actual results to differ materially from those projected, anticipated or implied in the
forward-looking statements. The most significant of these risks, uncertainties and other factors
are described in this Form 10-K (including in the section titled “Risk Factors That May Affect
Future Results” within “Item 1: Business”) and in Exhibit 99.01 to this Form 10-K. Except to the

PART I

Item 1: Business

General

Cardinal Health, Inc., an Ohio corporation formed in 1979, is a holding company that owns
operating subsidiaries conducting business as Cardinal Health. The Company is a leading provider
of products and services supporting the health care industry, and helping health care providers and
manufacturers improve the efficiency and quality of health care. As used in this report, the terms
the “Registrant” and the “Company” refer to Cardinal Health, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the
context requires otherwise. Except as otherwise specified, information in this report is provided
as of June 30, 2005 (the end of the Company’s fiscal year).

The description of the Company’s business should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and supplementary data included in this Form 10-K.

Accounting Investigations Update

The
following is a summary of the previously reported governmental and internal
investigations regarding the Company and related matters. This summary updates the information
provided in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 (the
“2004 Form 10-K”) and in its Quarterly Reports for fiscal 2005. The 2004 Form 10-K reflected
certain conclusions reached by the Company’s Audit Committee and
restated and reclassified the Company’s
consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 and the first three quarters
of fiscal 2004. As discussed more fully below and as previously reported, settlement discussions
have recently commenced with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) regarding
resolution of its investigation with respect to the Company, and the Company has recorded a reserve
of $25 million for fiscal 2005 in respect of the SEC investigation.

As previously reported, in October 2003, the SEC initiated an informal inquiry regarding the
Company. The SEC’s initial request sought historical financial and related information including
but not limited to the accounting treatment of certain recoveries from vitamin manufacturers. In
connection with the SEC’s informal inquiry, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company commenced its own internal review in April 2004, assisted by independent counsel. On May
6, 2004, the Company was notified that the SEC had converted the informal inquiry into a formal
investigation. On June 21, 2004, as part of the SEC’s formal investigation, the Company received
an additional SEC subpoena that included a request for the production of documents relating to
revenue classification, and the methods used for such classification, in the Company’s
Pharmaceutical Distribution business as either “Operating Revenue” or “Bulk Deliveries to Customer
Warehouses and Other.” In addition, the Company learned that the U.S. Attorney for the Southern
District of New York had also commenced an inquiry with respect to the Company that the Company
understands relates to the revenue classification issue. On October 12, 2004, in connection with
the SEC’s formal investigation, the Company received a subpoena from the SEC requesting the
production of documents relating to compensation information for specific current and former
employees and officers. The Company was notified in April 2005 that certain current and former
employees and directors received subpoenas from the SEC requesting the production of documents.
The subject matter of these requests is consistent with the subject matter of the subpoenas the
Company had previously received from the SEC. The Company continues to respond to the SEC’s
investigation and the Audit Committee’s internal review and provide all information required.



During September and October 2004, the Audit Committee reached certain conclusions with
respect to findings from its internal review. These conclusions regarding certain items that
impact revenue and earnings related to four primary areas of focus: (1) classification of sales to
customer warehouses between “Operating Revenue” and “Bulk Deliveries to Customer Warehouses and
Other” within the Company’s Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services segment; (2)
disclosure of the Company’s practice, in certain reporting periods, of accelerating its receipt and
recognition of cash discounts earned from suppliers for prompt payment; (3) timing of revenue
recognition within the Company’s former Automation and Information Services segment; and (4)
certain balance sheet reserve and accrual adjustments that had been identified in the internal
review. These conclusions were detailed in Notes 1 and 2 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements” included in the 2004 Form 10-K.

In connection with the Audit Committee’s conclusions with respect to findings from its
internal review, the Company made certain reclassification and restatement adjustments to its
fiscal 2004 and prior historical consolidated financial statements, which were reflected in the
2004 Form 10-K. Revenue previously disclosed separately as “Bulk Deliveries to Customer Warehouses
and Others” was aggregated with “Operating Revenue” resulting in combined “Revenue” being reported
in the financial statements. In addition, the Company changed its accounting method for
recognizing income from cash discounts. The Company also reduced its fourth quarter fiscal 2004
results of operations for premature revenue recognition within its former Automation and
Information Services segment after assessing the impact this segment’s sales practice had on the
Company’s results of operations for the three year period ended June 30, 2004. Lastly, the Company
restated its consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 and the first
three quarters of fiscal 2004 as a result of various misapplications of generally accepted
accounting principles (“GAAP”) and errors relating primarily to balance sheet reserve and accrual
adjustments recorded in prior periods. As a result, the Company supplemented its historical
disclosures within “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” in the 2004 Form 10-K to reflect these reclassification and restatement adjustments on
previously reported Company and business segment operating earnings performance. All prior period
disclosures presented in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations” in the 2004 Form 10-K were adjusted to reflect these changes.
 More information with respect to the prior conclusions of the Audit
Committee’s internal review and the impact of the reclassification
and restatement adjustments on the reporting periods discussed in
this Form 10-K is set forth in Notes 1 and 2 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”

Following the conclusions reached by the Audit Committee in September and October 2004, the
Audit Committee began the task of assigning responsibility for the financial statement matters
described above which were reflected in the 2004 Form 10-K and in January 2005 took disciplinary
actions with respect to the Company’s employees who it determined bore responsibility for these
matters, other than with respect to the accounting treatment of certain recoveries from vitamin
manufacturers for which there is a separate Board committee internal review (discussed below). The
disciplinary actions ranged from terminations or resignations of employment to required repayments
of some or all of fiscal 2003 bonuses from certain employees to letters of reprimand. These
disciplinary actions affected senior financial and managerial personnel, as well as other
personnel, at the corporate level and in the four business segments. None of the Company’s current
corporate executive officers (who are identified under the heading “Executive Officers of the
Company” following Item 4 of this Form 10-K) were the subject of disciplinary action by the Audit
Committee. In connection with the determinations made by the Audit Committee, the Company’s
 former controller resigned effective February 15, 2005. The Audit Committee has completed its
determinations of responsibility for the financial statement matters described above which were
reflected in the 2004 Form 10-K, although responsibility for matters relating to the Company’s
accounting treatment of certain recoveries from vitamin manufacturers has been addressed by a
separate committee of the Board. The Audit Committee internal review is substantially complete.

In connection with the SEC’s formal investigation, a committee of the Board of Directors, with
the assistance of independent counsel, separately initiated an internal review to assign
responsibility for matters relating to the Company’s accounting treatment of certain recoveries
from vitamin manufacturers. In the 2004 Form 10-K, as part
of the Audit Committee’s internal review, the Company reversed its previous recognition of
estimated recoveries from vitamin manufacturers for amounts overcharged in prior years and
recognized the income from such recoveries as a special item in the period in which cash was
received from the manufacturers. The SEC staff had previously advised the Company that, in its
view, the Company did not have an appropriate basis for recognizing the income in advance of
receiving the cash. In August 2005, the separate Board committee reached certain conclusions with
respect to findings from its internal review and determined that no
additional disciplinary actions were required beyond the disciplinary
actions already taken by the Audit Committee, as described above. The separate Board committee internal review is substantially complete.

Settlement discussions have recently commenced with the SEC regarding resolution of
its investigation with respect to the Company. While these discussions are ongoing, there can be
no assurance that the Company’s efforts to resolve the investigation with respect to the Company
will be successful, and the Company cannot predict the timing or outcome of these matters or the
terms of any such resolution. As a result of the initiation of these discussions, the Company
recorded a reserve of $25 million for its fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 in respect of the SEC
investigation. Unless and until the SEC investigation is resolved, there can be no assurance that
the amount reserved by the Company for this investigation will be sufficient and that a



larger amount will not be required. Therefore, this reserve will be reviewed on a quarterly
basis and adjusted to the extent that the Company determines it is necessary.

The SEC investigation, the U.S. Attorney inquiry, the Audit Committee internal review and the
separate Board committee internal review remain ongoing, although the Audit Committee internal
review and the separate Board committee internal review are substantially complete. While the
Company is continuing in its efforts to respond to these inquiries and provide all information
required, the Company cannot predict the outcome of the SEC investigation, the U.S. Attorney
inquiry, the Audit Committee internal review or the separate Board committee internal review. The
outcome of the SEC investigation, the U.S. Attorney inquiry and any related legal and
administrative proceedings could include the institution of administrative, civil injunctive or
criminal proceedings involving the Company and/or current or former Company employees, officers
and/or directors, as well as the imposition of fines and other penalties, remedies and sanctions.

In addition, there can be no assurance that additional restatements will not be required, that
the historical consolidated financial statements included in the 2004 Form 10-K, the Forms 10-Q for
the quarterly periods during fiscal 2005, or this Form 10-K will not change or require amendment,
or that additional disciplinary actions will not be required in such circumstances. As the SEC’s
investigation, the U.S. Attorney’s inquiry and the Audit Committee’s internal review continue, the
Audit Committee may identify new issues, or make additional findings if it receives additional
information, that may have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and the
scope of the restatements described in the 2004 Form 10-K, the Forms 10-Q for the quarterly periods
during fiscal 2005, and this Form 10-K.

In connection with the Audit Committee’s internal review, since the end of fiscal 2004, the
Company has adopted and is in the process of implementing various measures in connection with the
Company’s ongoing efforts to improve its internal control processes and corporate governance.
These measures include the following:

The control enhancements discussed above are intended to improve the Company’s control
procedures and address the issues resulting in the material weaknesses identified by the Company’s
independent auditor in fiscal 2004. See Item 9a of this Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion
of the Company’s controls and procedures.



Business Segments

The Company’s operations are organized into four reporting segments. They are Pharmaceutical
Distribution and Provider Services, Medical Products and Services, Pharmaceutical Technologies and
Services and Clinical Technologies and Services.

Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services

Through its Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services segment, the Company distributes
a broad line of pharmaceutical and other health care products. The Company’s Pharmaceutical
Distribution business is one of the country’s leading wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical and
related health care products to independent and chain drug stores, hospitals, alternate care
centers and the pharmacy departments of supermarkets and mass merchandisers located throughout the
United States. Through the acquisition of The Intercare Group, plc (which has been given the legal
designation of Cardinal Health U.K. 432 Limited and is referred to in this Form 10-K as
“Intercare”) in fiscal 2004, this segment also operates a distribution network within the United
Kingdom offering a specialized range of branded and generic pharmaceutical products. As a
full-service wholesale distributor, the Pharmaceutical Distribution business complements its
distribution activities by offering a broad range of support services to assist its customers and
suppliers in maintaining and improving the efficiency and quality of their services. These support
services include: online procurement, fulfillment and information provided through
cardinalhealth.com; computerized order entry and order confirmation systems; generic sourcing
programs; product movement and management reports; consultation on store operations and
merchandising; and customer training. The Company’s proprietary software systems feature
customized databases specially designed to help its distribution customers order more efficiently,
contain costs and monitor their purchases.

Through this segment, the Company also provides certain services to pharmaceutical
manufacturers in connection with new distribution service agreements entered into during fiscal
2005. In addition to the base distribution services, these services generally include inventory
management services, data/reporting services, new product launch support and deduction management
services.

Through this segment, the Company also operates a pharmaceutical repackaging and distribution
program for independent and chain drug store customers as well as mail order customers. In
addition, through this segment the Company also is a franchisor of apothecary-style retail
pharmacies through its Medicine Shoppe International, Inc. (“Medicine Shoppe”) and Medicap
Pharmacies Incorporated (“Medicap”) franchise systems.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company made a business decision to exit its
branded pharmaceutical trading operations within this segment. These operations
represented less than 1% of the Company’s fiscal 2005 Pharmaceutical Distribution revenue.

Medical Products and Services

Through its Medical Products and Services segment, the Company provides medical products and
cost-saving services to hospitals and other health care providers. The Company offers a broad
range of medical and laboratory products, representing approximately 2,000 suppliers in addition to
its own line of surgical and respiratory therapy products to hospitals and other health care
providers. The Company also manufactures sterile and non-sterile procedure kits, single-use
surgical drapes, gowns and apparel, exam and surgical gloves, fluid suction and collection systems,
respiratory therapy products, surgical instruments, special procedure products and other products.
This segment also assists its customers in reducing costs while helping to improve the quality of
patient care in a variety of ways, including online procurement, fulfillment and information
provided through cardinalhealth.com, supply-chain management and instrument repair. Through this
segment, the Company also distributes oncology, therapeutic plasma and other specialty
pharmaceutical and biotechnology products to hospitals, clinics and other managed-care facilities.

Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services

Through its Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment, the Company provides a broad
range of technologies and services through facilities located in North America, Latin America,
Europe and Asia Pacific to the pharmaceutical, life sciences and consumer health industries. This
segment’s Oral Technologies business provides proprietary drug delivery technologies, including
softgel capsules, controlled release forms and Zydis

®

fast dissolving wafers, and
manufacturing for nearly all traditional oral dosage forms. The Biotechnology and Sterile Life
Sciences business provides advanced aseptic blow/fill/seal technology, drug lyophilization and
manufacturing for nearly all sterile dose forms, such as vials and prefilled syringes, as well as
biologic



development and regulatory consulting services. The Packaging Services business provides
pharmaceutical packaging services, folding cartons, inserts and labels, with proprietary expertise
in child-resistant and unit dose/compliance package design. The Pharmaceutical Development
business provides drug discovery, development and analytical science services. The Healthcare
Marketing Services business provides medical education, marketing and contract sales services,
along with product logistics management. The Nuclear Pharmacy Services business operates
centralized nuclear pharmacies that prepare and deliver radiopharmaceuticals for use in nuclear
imaging and other procedures in hospitals and clinics. Through this segment, the Company also
manufactures and markets generic injectible pharmaceutical products for sale to hospitals, clinics
and pharmacies in the United Kingdom.

Clinical Technologies and Services

Through its Clinical Technologies and Services segment, the Company provides products and
services to hospitals and other health care providers that focus on patient safety. Through the
acquisition of ALARIS Medical Systems, Inc. (which has been given the legal designation of Cardinal
Health 303, Inc. and is referred to in this Form 10-K as “Alaris”) in fiscal 2004, this segment
designs, develops and markets intravenous medication safety and infusion therapy delivery systems,
software applications, needle-free disposables and related patient monitoring equipment. Through
its Pyxis products business, this segment develops, manufactures, leases, sells and services
point-of-use systems that automate the distribution and management of medications and supplies in
hospitals and other health care facilities. In addition, through its Clinical Services and
Consulting business, this segment provides services to the health care industry through integrated
pharmacy management, temporary pharmacy staffing and the gathering and recording of clinical
information for review, analysis and interpretation.

The Company evaluates possible candidates for merger or acquisition and intends to take
advantage of opportunities to expand its operations and services across all reporting segments from
time to time as appropriate. These acquisitions may involve the use of cash, stock or other
securities as well as the assumption of indebtedness and liabilities. In addition, the Company
evaluates from time to time as appropriate its portfolio of businesses to identify any non-core
businesses for possible divestiture. For additional information concerning certain of the
transactions described above, see Notes 4, 17 and 22 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.”



Customers and Suppliers

The Company’s largest customers, CVS Corporation (“CVS”) and Walgreen Co. (“Walgreens”),
accounted for approximately 21% and 10%, respectively, of the Company’s revenue (by dollar volume)
for fiscal 2005. All of the Company’s business with CVS and Walgreens is included in its
Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services segment. The aggregate of the Company’s five
largest customers, including CVS and Walgreens, accounted for approximately 37% of the Company’s
revenue (by dollar volume) for fiscal 2005. The Company could be adversely affected if the
business of these customers was lost.

In addition, certain of the Company’s businesses have entered into agreements with group
purchasing organizations (“GPOs”) that act as purchasing agents that negotiate vendor contracts on
behalf of their members. Approximately 15% of the Company’s revenue for fiscal 2005 was derived
from GPO members through the contractual arrangements established with Novation, LLC (“Novation”)
and Premier Purchasing Partners, L.P. (“Premier”), the Company’s two largest GPO relationships in
terms of member revenue. Generally, compliance by GPO members with GPO vendor selections is
voluntary. As such, the Company believes the loss of any of the Company’s agreements with a GPO
would not mean the loss of sales to all members of the GPO, although the loss of such an agreement
could adversely affect the Company’s operating results. See Note 13 in “Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements” for further information regarding the Company’s concentrations of credit risk
and major customers.

The Company obtains its products from many different suppliers, the largest of which, Pfizer
Inc., accounted for approximately 13% (by dollar volume) of the Company’s revenue in fiscal 2005.
The Company’s five largest suppliers combined accounted for approximately 42% (by dollar volume) of
the Company’s revenue during fiscal 2005. Overall, the Company believes that its relationships
with its suppliers are good. New distribution service agreements recently entered into between the
Company and certain branded pharmaceutical manufacturers generally range from a one-year term with
an automatic renewal feature to a five-year term. Such agreements generally cannot be terminated
unless mutually agreed to by the parties, a breach of the agreement occurs that is not cured, or in
the event of an involuntary bankruptcy filing. The loss of certain suppliers could adversely
affect the Company’s business if alternative sources of supply were unavailable at reasonable
rates.

The Company’s Pharmaceutical Distribution business is in a business model transition with
respect to how it is compensated for the logistical, capital and administrative services that it
provides to branded pharmaceutical manufacturers. Historically, the compensation received by the
Pharmaceutical Distribution business from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers was based on each
manufacturer’s unique sales practices (e.g., volume of product available for sale, eligibility to
purchase product, cash discounts for prompt payment, rebates, etc.) and pharmaceutical pricing
practices (e.g., the timing, frequency and magnitude of product price increases). Specifically, a
significant portion of the compensation the Pharmaceutical Distribution business received from
manufacturers was derived from the Company’s ability to purchase pharmaceutical inventory in
advance of pharmaceutical price increases, hold that inventory as manufacturers increased
pharmaceutical prices, and generate a higher operating margin on the subsequent sale of that
inventory. This compensation system was dependent to a large degree upon the sales practices of
each branded pharmaceutical manufacturer, including established policies concerning the volume of
product available for purchase in advance of a price increase, and on predictable pharmaceutical
pricing practices.

Beginning in fiscal 2003, branded pharmaceutical manufacturers began to seek greater control
over the amount of pharmaceutical product available in the supply chain, and, as a result, began to
change their sales practices by restricting the volume of product available for purchase by
pharmaceutical wholesalers. In addition, manufacturers have increasingly sought more services from
the Company, including providing data concerning product sales and distribution patterns. The
Company believes that the manufacturers sought these changes to provide them with greater
visibility over product demand and movement in the market and to increase product safety and
integrity by reducing the risks associated with product being available to, and distributed in, the
secondary market. These changes have significantly reduced the compensation received by the
Company from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers. As a result of these actions by branded
pharmaceutical manufacturers, the Company concluded it was no longer being adequately and
consistently compensated for the reliable and consistent logistical, capital and administrative
services being provided by the Company to these manufacturers.

In response to the developments discussed above, the Company has established a compensation
system that is significantly less dependent on manufacturers’ sales or pricing practices, and is
based on the services provided by the Company to meet the unique distribution requirements of each
manufacturer’s products. During fiscal 2005, the Company worked with individual branded
pharmaceutical manufacturers to define fee-for-service terms that adequately compensate the Company
based on the services being provided to such manufacturers. The initial fee-for-service transition
is essentially complete, which should help reduce earnings volatility in the segment.

As part of the transition to fee-for-service terms, certain of the new distribution service
agreements entered into with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers continue to have an
inflation-based compensation component to them. Arrangements with certain
other branded manufacturers still continue to be solely inflation-based. If branded
pharmaceutical price inflation is lower than the



Company has anticipated, its operating results
could be adversely affected with respect to its current exposure to contingent fee-based
compensation in its Pharmaceutical Distribution business.
 In addition, certain key distribution service agreements will be re-negotiated in the latter
half of fiscal 2006 and into fiscal 2007 when their initial terms expire. If the terms of the
re-negotiated agreements are unfavorable to the Company, it could adversely affect the Company’s
operating results.

The Company’s manufacturing businesses within the Medical Products and Services and
Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segments use a broad range of raw materials in the
products that they produce. These raw materials include for Medical Products and Services, latex,
resin and fuel oil and, for Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services, resin, gelatin and active
pharmaceutical ingredients, among others. In certain circumstances, the Company’s operating
results may be adversely affected by increases in raw materials costs because the Company may not
be able to fully recover the increased costs from the customer or offset the increased cost through
productivity improvements. In addition, although most of these raw materials are generally
available, certain raw materials used by the Company’s manufacturing businesses may be available
only from a limited number of suppliers. There also may be cases where a particular raw material
may be available from another supplier or several other suppliers, but the Company is constrained
to use a particular supplier due to customer requirements, regulatory filings or product approvals.
In either case, where there are a limited number of suppliers, the Company may experience
shortages in supply, and as a result, the Company’s operating results could be adversely affected.

The Company’s Pharmaceutical Distribution business utilizes contract carriers to distribute
its products. Contracts with these carriers generally contain a fuel surcharge capped at a certain
percentage. If fuel costs rise significantly, the Pharmaceutical Distribution business may need to
increase the specified fuel surcharge, which is limited to specified
annual percentage increases, with certain contract carriers. In the event that the
Pharmaceutical Distribution business cannot reach agreement on these changes, it may need to replace
the contract carriers at prevailing market rates. The Company’s Medical Products and Services
Distribution and Nuclear Pharmacy Services businesses own their distribution fleets, which
distribute a majority of their products to customers. These businesses are directly impacted by
market changes in the price of fuel. As a result of the Company’s exposure to fuel costs, the
Company’s operating results may be adversely affected by
increased fuel costs, as the Company
may not be able to fully recover the increased costs from its customers.

The Company’s Medical Products and Services Distribution business purchases medical/surgical
products from vendors other than the original manufacturer of such products. Certain manufacturers
have adopted policies limiting the ability of such business to purchase products from anyone other
than the manufacturer. If this practice becomes more widespread, the ability of the Medical
Products and Services Distribution business to purchase products from other distributors, as well
as its ability to sell excess inventories to other distributors, may be impaired. This could
adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

While certain of the Company’s operations may show quarterly fluctuations, the Company does
not consider its business to be seasonal in nature on a consolidated basis.

Competition

The markets in which the Company operates generally are highly competitive.

In the Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services segment, the Company’s pharmaceutical
wholesale distribution business competes directly with two other national wholesale distributors
(McKesson Corporation and AmerisourceBergen Corporation) and a number of smaller regional wholesale
distributors, direct selling manufacturers, self-warehousing chains, specialty distributors and
third-party logistics companies on the basis of a value proposition that includes breadth of
product lines, service offerings, support services and pricing. The Company’s pharmaceutical
wholesale distribution operations have narrow profit margins and, accordingly, the Company’s
earnings depend significantly on its ability to distribute a large volume and variety of products
efficiently, to provide quality support services, to compete effectively on the pricing of
pharmaceutical products, and to maintain satisfactory arrangements with pharmaceutical
manufacturers whereby the Company is compensated for its logistical, capital and administrative
services. With respect to pharmacy franchising operations, a few smaller franchisors compete with
Medicine Shoppe and Medicap in the franchising of pharmacies, with competition being based
primarily upon benefits offered to both the pharmacist and the customer, access to third-party
programs, the reputation of the franchise and pricing. Medicine Shoppe and Medicap also need to be
competitive with a pharmacist’s ongoing options to operate or work for an independent or chain
pharmacy.

The Company’s Medical Products and Services segment competes both domestically and
internationally. Competitive factors within medical-surgical supply distribution include price,
breadth of product offerings, product availability, order-filling accuracy (both invoicing and
product selection) and service offerings. Within its distribution services, this segment competes
across several
customer classes with many different distributors, including Owens & Minor, Inc., Fisher
Scientific International, Inc., and Henry



Schein, Inc., among others. Competitive factors within
medical-surgical product manufacturing include brand recognition and product innovation,
performance, quality and price. This segment competes against many product manufacturers, some of
which are larger and more diversified than Medical Products and Services. The Company believes
that its key competitive strengths within this segment include its ability to work with customers
to help them provide quality care while enhancing their competitiveness through cost-savings
initiatives. This competitive strength is enhanced through the integration of products and
services within both the Medical Products and Services segment and across other Company segments.

In the Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment, the Company competes on several
fronts both domestically and internationally, including competing with other companies that provide
outsourcing services to pharmaceutical manufacturers based in North America, Latin America, Europe
and Asia Pacific and competing with those pharmaceutical manufacturers that choose to perform these
services themselves. Specifically, in this segment, the Company competes with providers of both
new drug delivery technologies and existing delivery technologies as well as oral solid dose
manufacturing; with other providers of sterile fill/finish manufacturing and lyophilization
services; with providers of contract discovery, development, analytical laboratory and regulatory
consulting services and manufacturing and packaging of clinical supplies; with companies that
provide packaging components and packaging services; with other providers of medical education,
marketing/product launch services, contract sales and product logistics services; and with other
nuclear pharmacy companies and distributors engaged in the preparation and delivery of
radiopharmaceuticals for use in nuclear imaging procedures in hospitals and clinics, which include
numerous operators of radiopharmacies, numerous independent radiopharmacies and manufacturers and
universities that have established their own radiopharmacies. The Company competes in this segment
based upon a variety of factors, principally including quality, responsiveness, proprietary
technologies or capabilities, customer service and price.

In the Clinical Technologies and Services segment, the Alaris products business competes based
upon quality, technological innovation, the value proposition of helping improve patient outcomes
while reducing overall costs associated with medication safety, and price. Alaris’ competitors
include both domestic and foreign companies, including Baxter International, Inc., Hospira, Inc.
and B. Braun Medical, Inc. The Pyxis products business competes based upon quality, relationships
with customers, customer service and support capabilities, patents and other intellectual property,
its ability to interface with customer information systems, and price. Actual and potential
competitors for Pyxis include both existing domestic and foreign companies, as well as emerging
companies that supply products for specialized markets and other outside service providers. Such
competitors include McKesson Corporation and Omnicell, Inc. With respect to services that enhance
performance in hospital pharmacies, the Company competes with both national and regional hospital
pharmacy management firms, and self-managed hospitals and hospital systems on the basis of services
offered, its established base of existing operations, the effective use of information systems, the
development of clinical programs, the quality of the services it provides to its customers and
price.

Employees

As
of September 9, 2005, the Company had more than 55,000 employees in the U.S. and abroad,
of which 910 are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Overall, the Company considers its
employee relations to be good.

Intellectual Property

The Company relies on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws,
nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect its products,
services and intangible assets. These proprietary rights are important to the Company’s ongoing
operations.

The Company has applied in the United States and certain foreign countries for registration of
a number of trademarks and service marks, some of which have been registered, and also holds common
law rights in various trademarks and service marks. It is possible that in some cases the Company
may be unable to obtain the registrations for trademarks and service marks for which it has
applied.

The Company holds patents relating to certain aspects of its automated pharmaceutical
dispensing systems, automated medication management systems, medication packaging, medical devices,
processes, products, formulations, infusion therapy systems, infusion administration sets, drug
delivery systems and sterile manufacturing. The Company has a number of pending patent
applications in the United States and certain foreign countries, and intends to pursue additional
patents as appropriate. The Company has enforced and will continue to enforce its intellectual
property rights in the United States and worldwide.

The Company does not consider any particular patent, trademark, license, franchise or
concession to be material to its overall business.



Regulatory Matters

Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries may be required to register for permits and/or licenses
with, and comply with operating and security standards of, the United States Drug Enforcement
Administration (the “DEA”), the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), the United States Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (the “NRC”), the Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”), and
various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well
as foreign agencies, and certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and
location of product distribution, manufacturing and sale. These subsidiaries include those that:

In addition, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries are subject to requirements of the
Controlled Substances Act and the Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 and similar state laws,
which regulate the marketing, purchase, storage and distribution of prescription drugs and
prescription drug samples under prescribed minimum standards. Certain of the Company’s
subsidiaries that manufacture medical devices are subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic
Act, as amended by the Medical Device Amendments of 1976, the Safe Medical Device Act of
1990, as amended in 1992, the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002, and comparable
foreign regulations. In addition, certain of the Clinical Technologies and Services segment’s
Alaris products are indirectly subject to the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act.

Laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of products also exist in most other
countries where certain of the Company’s subsidiaries conduct business. In addition, the Medical
Products and Services segment’s international manufacturing operations, the Pharmaceutical
Technologies and Services segment’s international operations (including Intercare) and the Clinical
Technologies and Services segment’s Alaris international operations are subject to local
certification requirements, including compliance with domestic and/or foreign good manufacturing
practices and quality system regulations established by the FDA and/or those applicable foreign
jurisdictions. Intercare self-manufactures and markets sterile injectible products in the United
Kingdom in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations of the United Kingdom and the
European Union. Intercare also manufactures methadone syrup in the United Kingdom pursuant to the
United Kingdom’s regulations covering the manufacture of controlled opioid substances.

The Company’s franchising operations, through Medicine Shoppe and Medicap, are subject to
Federal Trade Commission regulations, and rules and regulations adopted by certain states, which
require franchisors to make certain disclosures to prospective franchisees prior to the sale of
franchises. In addition, certain states have adopted laws which regulate the franchisor-franchisee
relationship. The most common provisions of such laws establish restrictions on the ability of
franchisors to terminate or to refuse to renew franchise agreements. From time to time, similar
legislation has been proposed or is pending in additional states.

The Company’s Nuclear Pharmacy Services business operates nuclear pharmacies, imaging centers
and related businesses such as cyclotron facilities used to produce positron emission tomography
(“PET”) products used in medical imaging. This group operates in a regulated industry which
requires licenses or permits from the NRC, the radiologic health agency and/or department of health
of each state in which it operates and the applicable state board of pharmacy. In addition, the
FDA is also involved in the regulation of cyclotron facilities where PET products are produced.

Certain of the Company’s businesses are subject to federal and state health care fraud and
abuse, referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations. Certain
of the Company’s subsidiaries also maintain contracts with the federal government and are subject
to certain regulatory requirements relating to government contractors.



Services and products provided by certain of the Company’s businesses include access to health
care information gathered and assessed for the benefit of health care clients. Greater scrutiny on
a federal and state level is being placed on how patient identifiable health care information
should be handled and in identifying the appropriate parties and means to do so. Future changes in
regulations and/or legislation such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
1996 (“HIPAA”) and its accompanying federal regulations, such as those pertaining to privacy and
security, may affect how some of these information services or products are provided. In addition,
certain of the Company’s operations, depending upon their location, may be subject to additional
state or foreign regulations affecting personal data protection and how information services or
products are provided. Failure to comply with HIPAA and other such laws may subject the Company
and/or its subsidiaries to civil and/or criminal penalties, which could be significant.

The Company is also subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and
recommendations, both in the United States and abroad, relating to safe working conditions,
laboratory and manufacturing practices and the use, transportation and disposal of hazardous or
potentially hazardous substances. The Company’s environmental policies mandate compliance with all
applicable regulatory requirements concerning environmental quality and contemplate, among other
things, appropriate capital expenditures for environmental protection for each of its subsidiaries.
In addition, U.S. and international import and export laws and regulations require that the
Company abide by certain standards relating to the importation and exportation of finished goods,
raw materials and supplies and the handling of information. The Company is also subject to certain
laws and regulations concerning the conduct of its foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act and anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of the Company’s
internal books and records.

There have been increasing efforts by various levels of government including state pharmacy
boards and comparable agencies to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to
prevent the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated or mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical
distribution system. Certain states, such as Florida and California, have already adopted laws and
regulations that are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system
while other government agencies are currently evaluating their recommendations. These laws and
regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with the Company’s
Pharmaceutical Distribution business, and may adversely affect the Company’s operating results.
The Company continues to work with its suppliers to help minimize the risks associated with
counterfeit products in the supply chain.

The costs associated with complying with the various applicable federal regulations, as well
as state and foreign regulations, could be significant and the failure to comply with all such
legal requirements could have an adverse affect on the Company’s results of operations and
financial condition.

Inventories

The Company has historically maintained higher levels of inventory in its Pharmaceutical
Distribution business in order to satisfy daily delivery requirements and take advantage of
price changes as partial compensation for its services, but is not generally required by its
customers to maintain particular inventory levels other than as may be required to meet service
level requirements. In connection with the business model transition discussed under
“Customers and Suppliers” above, the Pharmaceutical Distribution business’ inventory levels are
significantly lower than historical levels. This trend, primarily attributable to reduced
pharmaceutical investment buying opportunities and lower inventory levels negotiated with
pharmaceutical manufacturers, is expected to continue. Certain supply contracts with U.S.
Government entities require the Company’s Pharmaceutical Distribution and Medical Products
Distribution businesses to maintain sufficient inventory to meet emergency demands. The
Company does not believe that the requirements contained in these U.S. Government supply
contracts materially impact inventory levels. The Company’s customer return policy requires
that the product be physically returned, subject to restocking fees, and only allows customers
to return products which can be added back to inventory and resold at full value, or which can
be returned to vendors for credit. The Company’s practice is to offer market payment terms to
its customers. The Company is not aware of any material differences between its practices and
those of other industry participants.

Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results

Although it is not possible to predict all risks that may affect future results, these risks
may include, but are not limited to, the following:

Intense competition may erode the Company’s profit margins.

The markets in which the
Company operates generally are
highly competitive. For example, in its Pharmaceutical Distribution business, the Company competes
with national wholesale distributors McKesson Corporation and AmerisourceBergen Corporation, and a
number of smaller regional wholesale distributors, direct selling manufacturers, self-warehousing
chains, specialty distributors and third-party logistics companies. Competitive pressures across
business segments have contributed to a decline in the Company’s gross profit margins on revenue
from approximately 4% in fiscal 2002 to 3% in fiscal 2005. This trend may continue and the
Company’s business could be adversely affected as a result.

The Company’s Pharmaceutical Distribution business is transitioning its business model, which
subjects the Company to risks and uncertainties.

As discussed more fully under “Customers and
Suppliers” within “Item 1: Business,” the Company’s Pharmaceutical Distribution business, which is
the Company’s largest business, is in a business model transition with respect to how it is
compensated for the logistical, capital and administrative services it provides to branded
pharmaceutical manufacturers. During fiscal 2005, the Company worked with individual branded
pharmaceutical manufacturers to define fee-for-service terms that adequately compensate the Company
based on the services being provided to such manufacturers.

As part of the transition to fee-for-service terms, certain of the new distribution service
agreements entered into with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers continue to have an
inflation-based compensation component to them. Arrangements with certain other branded
manufacturers still continue to be solely inflation-based. If branded pharmaceutical price
inflation is lower than the Company has anticipated, its operating results could be adversely
affected with respect to its current exposure to contingent fee-based compensation in its
Pharmaceutical Distribution business.
 In addition, certain key distribution service agreements will be re-negotiated in the latter
half of fiscal 2006 and into fiscal 2007 when their initial terms expire. If the terms of the
re-negotiated agreements are unfavorable to the Company, it could adversely affect the Company’s
operating results.

The ongoing SEC investigation and U.S. Attorney inquiry could adversely affect the Company’s
business, financial condition or operating results.

As discussed below under “Item 3: Legal
Proceedings” and Note 1 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” the Company is the subject
of a formal SEC investigation and had learned that the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of
New York had also commenced an inquiry with respect to the Company. In April 2004, the Company’s
Audit Committee commenced its own internal review, assisted by independent counsel. While the
Company is continuing in its efforts to respond to these inquiries
 and provide all information required, the Company cannot predict the outcome of the
SEC investigation or the U.S. Attorney inquiry. There can be no assurance that the scope of the
SEC investigation or the U.S. Attorney inquiry will not expand or that other regulatory agencies
will not become involved. The outcome of, and costs associated with, the SEC investigation and the
U.S. Attorney inquiry could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or
operating results, and the investigations could divert the efforts and attention of its management
team from the Company’s ordinary business operations. The outcome of the SEC investigation, the
U.S. Attorney inquiry and any related legal and administrative proceedings could include the
institution of administrative, civil injunctive or criminal proceedings involving the Company
and/or current or former Company employees, officers and/or directors, as well as the imposition of
fines and other penalties, remedies and sanctions.

Additional restatements may be required, the historical consolidated financial statements may
change or require amendment or additional disciplinary actions may be required; the Audit Committee
may identify new issues, or make additional findings if it receives additional information, that
may have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and the scope of the restatements
described in Forms 10-K and 10-Q.

During September and October 2004, the Audit Committee reached
certain conclusions with respect to findings to date from its internal review, which were discussed
in Notes 1 and 2 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in the 2004 Form 10-K.
In connection with these conclusions, the Audit Committee previously determined that the
consolidated financial statements of the Company with respect to fiscal 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003,
as well as the first three quarters of fiscal 2004, should be restated to reflect the conclusions
from its internal review to date. In January 2005, the Audit Committee took disciplinary actions
with respect to the Company’s employees who it determined bore responsibility for these matters,
other than with respect to the accounting treatment of certain recoveries from vitamin
manufacturers for which there is a separate Board committee internal review.
There can be no assurance that additional restatements will not be required, that
the historical consolidated financial statements included in the 2004 Form 10-K, the Forms 10-Q for
the quarterly periods during fiscal 2005, or this Form 10-K will not change or require amendment,
or that additional disciplinary actions will not be required in such circumstances. In addition, as the SEC
investigation, the U.S. Attorney inquiry and



the Audit Committee internal review continue, the
Audit Committee may identify new issues, or make additional findings if it receives additional
information, that may have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and the
scope of the restatements described in the 2004 Form 10-K, the Forms 10-Q for the quarterly
periods, and this Form 10-K.

The Company’s internal controls may not be sufficient to ensure timely and reliable financial
information.

As reported under Item 9a of this Form 10-K, the Company’s management completed
its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as
of June 30, 2005 and based on that assessment, concluded that
the Company maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of June 30, 2005. The Company’s auditor, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on
management’s assessment that expresses unqualified opinions on management’s assessment and on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Still, however, the
Company’s growth continues to place stress on its internal controls, and there can be no assurance
that the Company’s control procedures will continue to be adequate. The effectiveness of the
Company’s controls and procedures may be limited by a variety of
risks, including, among other things, faulty human
judgment, simple errors, omissions and mistakes, collusion of two or more people or inappropriate
management override of procedures. If the Company fails to have effective internal controls and
procedures for financial reporting in place, it could be unable to provide timely and reliable
financial information.

Changes in the United States health care environment may adversely affect the Company’s business,
financial condition or operating results.

In recent years, the health care industry has undergone
significant changes driven by various efforts to reduce costs. These efforts include, but are not
limited to, potential national health care reform, trends toward managed care, cuts in Medicare,
consolidation of competitors, suppliers and customers and the development of large, sophisticated
purchasing groups, including the efforts in several states to establish pharmaceutical purchasing
programs on behalf of their residents. This industry is expected to continue to undergo
significant changes for the foreseeable future, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s
business, financial condition or operating results. Other factors related to the health care
industry that could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or operating
results include, but are not limited to:

The Company’s Medical Products and Services Distribution business purchases medical/surgical
products from vendors other than the original manufacturer of such products. Certain manufacturers
have adopted policies limiting the ability of such business to purchase products from anyone other
than the manufacturer. If this practice becomes more widespread, the ability of the Medical
Products and Services Distribution business to purchase products from other distributors, as well
as its ability to sell excess inventories to other distributors, may be impaired. This could
adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

Healthcare and public policy trends indicate that the number of generic drugs will increase
over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug
patents. To the extent that market conditions significantly alter the
level of availability or pricing of generic drugs different from what
the Company was anticipating, this could adversely affect the
Company’s net earnings.

There have been increasing efforts by various levels of government including state pharmacy
boards and comparable agencies to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to
prevent the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated or mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical
distribution system. Certain states, such as Florida and California, have already adopted laws and
regulations that are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system
while other government agencies are currently evaluating their recommendations. These laws and
regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with the Company’s
Pharmaceutical Distribution business, and may adversely affect the Company’s business, financial
condition or operating results.

There have been increasing efforts by various parties to introduce and pass legislation that
would directly permit the importation of pharmaceutical products into the United States. If such
efforts are successful, the price the Company receives for pharmaceutical products and related
services could be adversely affected, thereby negatively impacting the Company’s operating results.

The Company is subject to extensive and frequently changing local, state and federal laws and
regulations relating to healthcare fraud. The federal government continues to increase its
scrutiny over practices involving healthcare fraud affecting
Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs. Furthermore, the Company’s
relationships with pharmaceutical



manufacturers and healthcare providers subject its business to
laws and regulations on fraud and abuse. Many of the regulations applicable to the Company,
including those relating to marketing incentives offered by pharmaceutical or medical-surgical
suppliers, are vague and could be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial
authority in a manner that could require the Company to make changes in its operations. If the
Company fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations, it could suffer civil and criminal
penalties, including the loss of licenses or its ability to participate in Medicare, Medicaid and
other federal and state healthcare programs.

Under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Act”),
the U.S. government recently proposed changes in certain pharmaceutical reimbursement rates. The
Company may be adversely affected by changes or changes that may be proposed in the future under
the Act. The Company is in the process of developing plans to mitigate any exposures from these
changes in reimbursement rates and the way its customers conduct their business under the Act.
However, if the Company fails to successfully implement such plans, its business and the results of
operations may be adversely affected.

The outcomes of lawsuits brought against the Company may adversely affect the Company’s business,
financial condition or operating results.

As discussed below under “Item 3: Legal
Proceedings,” the Company is subject to numerous lawsuits, including several class action lawsuits
against the Company and certain of its former and present officers and directors. Any settlement
of or judgment in one or more of these matters could adversely affect the Company’s business,
financial condition or operating results. There can be no assurance that all or any portion of the
liability arising from these pending lawsuits will be covered by insurance policies that the
Company currently maintains.

The Company could be adversely affected by the loss of one or more significant customers or group
of customers, or by a change in customer mix.

The Company’s largest customers, CVS and
Walgreens, accounted for approximately 21% and 10%, respectively, of the Company’s revenue (by
dollar volume) for fiscal 2005. The aggregate of the Company’s five largest customers, including
CVS and Walgreens, accounted for approximately 37% of the Company’s revenue (by dollar volume) for
fiscal 2005. The Company’s business and operating results could be adversely affected if the
business of these customers was lost.

In addition, certain of the Company’s businesses have entered into agreements with GPOs.
Approximately 15% of the Company’s revenue for fiscal 2005 was derived from GPO members through the
contractual arrangements established with Novation and Premier. Generally, compliance by GPO
members with GPO vendor selections is voluntary. Notwithstanding this fact, the loss of such an
agreement could adversely affect the Company’s operating results. See the “Customers and
Suppliers” discussion within “Item 1: Business” and Note 13 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements” for further information regarding the Company’s significant customers.

Changes in the Company’s customer mix could also significantly impact its business, financial
condition or operating results. Due to the diverse range of health care supply management and
health care information technology products and services that the Company offers, such changes may
adversely affect certain of the Company’s businesses, while not affecting some of its competitors
who offer a narrower range of products and services.

Difficulties, delays or increased costs in implementing the global restructuring program
associated with the Company’s One Cardinal Health initiative may adversely affect the anticipated
benefit of the restructuring on the Company’s business, financial condition and operating results.

As discussed more fully in the “Overview” section within
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations,” in fiscal 2005, the Company launched a global restructuring program
in connection with its One Cardinal Health initiative. The Company expects the program to be
substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2008 and expects it to improve operating earnings and
position the Company for future growth. If the restructuring program suffers unforeseen
difficulties, is delayed in its completion or results in unforeseen additional costs, the Company
may not achieve the operational and financial objectives it has set for the program, and the
Company’s business, financial condition or operating results may not fully benefit from the
restructuring to the extent that the Company had initially anticipated.

In addition, certain projects under the One Cardinal Health restructuring involve replacement
of legacy systems, consolidation and rationalization of employees and, in some cases, outsourcing.
During such transitions, it is possible the Company may suffer, at least on a temporary basis,
problems associated with internal control over financial reporting or business interruptions which
could arise as a result of such restructuring.

Failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements may adversely affect the
Company’s business, financial condition or operating results.

The health care industry is highly
regulated. The Company is subject to various local, state, federal, foreign and transnational laws
and regulations, which include the operating and security standards of the DEA, the FDA, various
state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, the NRC, DHHS, the European Union member states
and other comparable agencies. Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries may be required to register
for permits and/or licenses with, and
comply with operating and security standards of, the DEA, the FDA, the NRC, DHHS and various state
boards of pharmacy, state



health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as foreign
agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of
product distribution, manufacturing and sale. Although the Company believes that it is in
compliance, in all material respects, with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no
assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion concerning
the compliance of the Company’s operations with applicable laws and regulations. In addition,
there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain or renew existing permits and
licenses or obtain without significant delay future permits and licenses needed for the operation
of the Company’s businesses. The Clinical Technologies and Services segment’s automated
pharmaceutical dispensing systems are not currently required to be registered or submitted for
pre-market notifications to the FDA. There can be no assurance, however, that FDA policy in this
regard will not change.

Any noncompliance by the Company with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to
maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could have an adverse effect on the
Company’s results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if changes were to occur to
the laws and regulations applicable to the Company’s businesses, such changes could adversely
affect many of the Company’s regulated operations, which include:

Also, the health care regulatory environment may change in a manner that could restrict the
Company’s existing operations, limit the expansion of the Company’s businesses, apply regulations
to previously unregulated businesses or otherwise affect the Company adversely.

The Company’s operating results could be adversely affected by a delay in, or failure to receive,
regulatory approval.

The Company’s pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturing businesses are
heavily regulated and strict compliance with federal and foreign laws, rules, regulations and
practices must be followed. By nature, the manufacturing of such products is a highly controlled
process in which great strides are taken to avoid contamination in the products. Due to the
regulatory issues and challenges, there is a risk of delay in approval of these products, which
could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

Circumstances associated with the Company’s acquisition strategy and internal growth may adversely
affect the Company’s operating results

. An important element of the Company’s growth strategy has
been the pursuit of acquisitions of other businesses which expand or complement the Company’s
existing businesses. Over the past decade, the Company has expanded beyond its core pharmaceutical
distribution business into areas such as medical-surgical product manufacturing and distribution,
development and manufacturing of drug delivery systems, development and manufacturing of automation
and information products, compounding and distribution of nuclear pharmaceutical products, and
developing, manufacturing and distributing intravenous pumps and administration sets. Integrating
businesses, however, involves a number of special risks, including the following:

In addition, the Company may incur debt to finance future acquisitions and/or may issue
securities in connection with future acquisitions which may dilute the holdings of its current and
future shareholders. To the extent the Company continues to pursue acquisitions, its ability to
complete such transactions may be adversely affected by the government investigations described
above under the risk factor entitled “The ongoing SEC investigation and U.S. Attorney inquiry could
adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or operating results.”

In addition to the risks associated with acquisition-related growth, the Company’s business
has grown in size and complexity



over the past few years as a result of internal growth. This
growth and increase in complexity have placed significant demands on management, systems, internal
controls and financial and physical resources. To meet such demands, the Company intends to
continue to invest in new technology, make other capital expenditures and, where appropriate, hire
and/or train employees with expertise to handle these particular demands. If the Company is unable
to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner or if the Company
fails to efficiently manage operations in a way that accommodates continued internal growth, its
business, financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected.

Downgrades of the Company’s credit ratings could adversely affect the Company.

The Company’s
senior debt credit ratings from S&P, Moody’s and Fitch are BBB, Baa3 and BBB+, respectively, the
commercial paper ratings are A-3, P-3 and F-2, respectively, and the ratings outlooks are
“negative,” “stable” and “negative,” respectively. Although a ratings downgrade by any of the
rating agencies will not trigger an acceleration of any of the Company’s indebtedness, these events
may adversely affect its ability to access capital and would result in an increase in the interest
rates payable under the Company’s credit facilities and future indebtedness. See also “Liquidity
and Capital Resources” within “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations.”

The Company could be adversely affected if transitions in senior management are not successful

.
The Company’s operations depend in a large extent on the efforts of its senior management. Several
new members of senior management, including the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer –
Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Ethics and Compliance
Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller and Treasurer have recently joined the Company.
The Company seeks to develop and retain an effective management team through the proper positioning
of existing key employees and the addition of new management personnel where necessary. The
Company’s operations could be adversely affected if transitions in senior management are not
successful or if the Company is unable to sustain an effective management team.

Increased costs for raw materials or raw material shortages may adversely affect the Company’s
operating results.

As discussed more fully under “Customers and Suppliers” within “Item 1:
Business,” the Company’s manufacturing businesses within the Medical Products and Services and
Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segments use a broad range of raw materials in the
products that they produce. In certain circumstances, the Company’s operating results may be
adversely affected by increases in raw materials costs because the Company may not be able to fully
recover the increased costs from the customer or offset the increased cost through productivity
improvements. In addition, in the case where there are a limited number of suppliers for a
particular raw material or where the Company is constrained to use a particular supplier due to
customer requirements, regulatory filings or product approvals, the Company may experience
shortages in supply. This, in turn, could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

Increased fuel costs may adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

As discussed under
“Customers and Suppliers” within “Item 1: Business,” the Company’s Pharmaceutical Distribution
business utilizes contract carriers to distribute its products. Contracts with these carriers
generally contain a fuel surcharge capped at a certain percentage. If fuel costs rise
significantly, the Pharmaceutical Distribution business may need to
increase the specified fuel surcharge, which is limited to specified
annual percentage increases,
with certain contract carriers. In the event that the Pharmaceutical Distribution business cannot
reach agreement on these changes, it may need to replace the contract carriers at prevailing market
rates. The Company’s Medical Products and Services Distribution and Nuclear Pharmacy Services
businesses own their distribution fleets, which distribute a majority of their products to
customers. These businesses are directly impacted by market changes in the price of fuel. As a
result of the Company’s exposure to fuel costs, the Company’s operating results may be adversely
affected by increased fuel costs, as the Company may not be able to fully recover the increased costs
from its customers.

Proprietary technology protections may not be adequate and Company products may infringe on the
rights of third parties.

The Company relies on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright
and trademark laws, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to
protect a number of its products, services and intangible assets. There can be no assurance that
these protections will provide meaningful protection against competitive products or services or
otherwise be commercially valuable or that the Company will be successful in obtaining additional
intellectual property or enforcing its intellectual property rights against unauthorized users.
There can be no assurance that the Company’s competitors will not independently develop
technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the Company’s technology.

From time to time, third parties have asserted infringement claims against the Company and
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the
Company in the future. (See the discussion of the ICU Medical, Inc. litigation against Alaris in
the “Overview” section within “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations.”) While the Company believes that the products it currently manufactures
using its proprietary technology do not infringe upon proprietary rights of other parties or that
meritorious defenses would exist with respect to any assertions to the contrary, there can be no
assurance that the Company would not be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others.



Additionally, the Company may be subject to litigation or find it necessary to initiate
litigation to protect its trade secrets, to enforce its patent, copyright and trademark rights and
to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. This type of litigation
can be costly and time consuming and could generate significant expenses, damage payments or
restrictions or prohibitions on the Company’s use of its technology, which could adversely affect
the Company’s results of operations. In addition, if the Company is found to be infringing on
proprietary rights of others, the Company may be required to develop non-infringing technology,
obtain a license or cease making, using and/or selling the infringing products.

Risks generally associated with the Company’s sophisticated information systems may adversely
affect the Company’s operating results.

The Company relies on sophisticated information systems in
its business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data to:

•

facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers;

•

receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis;

•

manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers; and

•

process payments to suppliers.

The Company’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected if these systems
are interrupted, damaged by unforeseen events or fail for any extended period of time, including
due to the actions of third parties.

The Company could become subject to liability claims that are not adequately covered by insurance,
and may have to pay damages and other expenses which may have an adverse affect on the Company’s
operating results.

The Company’s businesses expose it to risks that are inherent in:

Insurance policies covering pharmaceutical product liability generally being offered by
insurance carriers are becoming more restrictive in terms of self-insured retentions, available
policy limits, coverage exclusions and other terms. There can be no assurance that a successful
product or professional liability claim would be adequately covered by the Company’s applicable
insurance policies or by any applicable contractual indemnity and, as such, this could adversely effect the Company’s operating results.

The loss of third-party licenses used by businesses within the Company’s Clinical Technologies and
Services segment may adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

The Company licenses the
rights to use certain technologies from third-party vendors to incorporate in or complement
products and services offered through its Clinical Technologies and Services segment. These
licenses are generally nonexclusive, must be renewed periodically by mutual consent and may be
terminated if the Company breaches the terms of the license. As a result, the Company may have to
discontinue, delay or reduce product shipments until it obtains equivalent technology, which could
adversely affect the Company’s business. The Company’s competitors may obtain the right to use any
of the technology covered by these licenses and use the technology to compete directly with the
Company. In addition, if the Company’s vendors choose to discontinue support of the licensed
technology in the future, the Company may not be able to modify or adapt certain of its own
products.

Tax legislation initiatives could adversely affect the Company’s net earnings.

The Company is a
large multinational corporation with operations in the United States and international
jurisdictions. As such, the Company is subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United
States federal, state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions. From time to
time, various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect the Company’s tax
positions. There can be no assurance that the Company’s effective tax rate will not be adversely
affected by these initiatives. In addition, United States federal, state and local, as well as
international, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying
interpretations. Although the Company believes that its historical tax positions are sound and
consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that
the Company’s tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that the Company
would be successful in any such challenge.



Item 2: Properties

Domestically, the Company has 24 principal pharmaceutical distribution facilities and two
specialty distribution facilities utilized by its Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services
segment. In its Medical Products and Services segment, the Company has 52 medical-surgical
distribution facilities, 16 medical-surgical manufacturing facilities and one specialty
distribution facility. In its Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment, the Company has
198 domestic sites, 171 of which are Nuclear Pharmacy Services laboratory, manufacturing and
distribution facilities, and the remainder of which are Packaging Services, Oral Technologies,
Pharmaceutical Development and Biotechnology and Sterile Life Sciences facilities and a single
Specialty Pharmaceutical Services facility. In its Clinical Technologies and Services segment, the
Company has four domestic assembly operation facilities. The Company’s domestic facilities are
located in 45 states and Puerto Rico.

Internationally, the Company owns or leases 11 facilities through its Pharmaceutical
Distribution and Provider Services segment, all located in the United Kingdom. The Company owns or
leases 13 facilities through its Medical Products and Services segment, located in Australia,
Dominican Republic, France, Germany, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico and Thailand. The Company owns or
leases 19 operating facilities through its Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment,
located in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan and the
United Kingdom. The Company owns or leases four manufacturing and distribution facilities through
its Clinical Technologies and Services segment in Australia, Italy, Mexico and the United Kingdom.
The Company’s international facilities are located in a total of 29 countries.

The Company owns 90 of its domestic and international operating facilities, and the remaining
254 facilities are leased. The Company’s principal executive offices are headquartered in a leased
four-story building located at 7000 Cardinal Place in Dublin, Ohio.

The Company considers its operating properties to be in satisfactory condition and adequate to
meet its present needs. However, the Company regularly evaluates its operating properties and may
make further additions, improvements and consolidations as it continues to seek opportunities to
expand its role as a provider of products and services to the health care industry.

For certain financial information regarding the Company’s facilities, see Notes 10 and 11 of
“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”

Item 3: Legal Proceedings

Latex Litigation

On September 30, 1996, Baxter International Inc. (“Baxter”) and its subsidiaries transferred
to Allegiance Corporation and its subsidiaries (“Allegiance”), Baxter’s U.S. health care
distribution business, surgical and respiratory therapy business and health care cost-management
business, as well as certain foreign operations (the “Allegiance Business”) in connection with a
spin-off of the Allegiance Business by Baxter. In connection with this spin-off, Allegiance
Corporation, which later merged with a subsidiary of the Company on February 3, 1999, agreed to indemnify
Baxter, and to defend and indemnify Baxter Healthcare Corporation, as contemplated by the
agreements between Baxter and Allegiance Corporation, for all expenses and potential liabilities
associated with claims arising from the Allegiance Business, including certain claims of alleged
personal injuries as a result of exposure to natural rubber latex
gloves. Such claims, which name multiple defendants in addition to
Baxter/Allegiance, involved allegations of sensitization to natural
rubber latex products. The Company is not a
party to any of the lawsuits and has not agreed to pay any settlements to the plaintiffs.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company reassessed its ability to estimate the
potential remaining costs of these lawsuits. Following this reassessment, during the first quarter
of fiscal 2005, the Company recognized a charge of $16.4 million as its reasonable estimate of net
future costs to be incurred in defending or settling outstanding claims as well as pursuing
insurance recoveries. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company resolved claims
relating to substantially all of its remaining insurance coverage for this litigation. Following
resolution of these claims, the Company concluded that it was in a position to reasonably estimate
the total remaining uninsured costs for this litigation. As such, during the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2005, the Company recognized an additional charge of $11.8 million as its reasonable
estimate of uninsured costs already incurred in defending or settling outstanding claims. While
the Company does not anticipate significant charges in future periods, additional charges may be
required if there is a significant increase in the number of new lawsuits filed. Currently, the
Company considers this potential event to be remote.



Antitrust Litigation against Pharmaceutical Manufacturers

During the past six years, numerous class action lawsuits have been filed against certain
prescription drug manufacturers alleging that the prescription drug manufacturer, by itself or in
concert with others, took improper actions to delay or prevent generic drug competition against the
manufacturer’s brand name drug. The Company has not been a named plaintiff in any of these class
actions, but has been a member of the direct purchasers’ class (i.e., those purchasers who purchase
directly from these drug manufacturers). None of the class actions have gone to trial, but some
have settled in the past with the Company receiving proceeds from the settlement fund. Currently,
there are several such class actions pending in which the Company is a class member. Total
recoveries from these actions through June 30, 2005 were $97.7 million, including a $21.2 recovery
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. The Company is unable at this time to estimate
definitively future recoveries, if any, it will receive as a result of these class actions.

Environmental Claims

Pennsauken Environmental Claim

In 1985, PCI Services, Inc. (“PCI”) purchased Burgess & Why Folding Carton Company
(“Burgess”), located in Pennsauken, New Jersey. The Company acquired PCI in 1996. In 1991, the
Pennsauken Solid Waste Management Authority sued various waste transporters and other parties in
New Jersey State court alleging contamination of the Pennsauken landfill. One of the waste haulers
sued by the Pennsauken Solid Waste Management Authority was Quick Way, Inc. (“Quick Way”), a waste
hauling company used by Burgess from 1970 to 1982. Quick Way, in turn, joined several companies
that it serviced, including Burgess. There are approximately 600 parties in the litigation. The
Company reasonably believes that PCI’s liability, if any, will be less than $100,000, and the
impact of this claim upon PCI, if any, will be immaterial to the Company’s financial position,
liquidity and results of operations.

Environmental Claims Relating to Allegiance

On September 30, 1996, Baxter and its subsidiaries transferred to Allegiance the Allegiance
Business in connection with the Baxter-Allegiance Spin-Off. As a result of the Baxter-Allegiance
Spin-Off, Allegiance agreed to defend and indemnify Baxter from the following environmental claims.

San Gabriel Environmental Claim

Allegiance, through Baxter and its predecessors-in-interest, owned a facility located in
Irwindale, California (the “Irwindale Property”) from approximately 1961 to approximately 1999
where, among other things, plastics were manufactured, a chemical laboratory was operated, and
certain research and development activity was carried out. San Gabriel is a Superfund site in the
Los Angeles area that concerns ground water contamination of a local drinking water aquifer. The
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “U.S. EPA”) is the lead government agency in charge of
the San Gabriel Valley Groundwater Basin Superfund Sites, Areas 1-4, Baldwin Park Operable Unit
(the “BPOU”). According to the U.S. EPA, the groundwater within the BPOU is contaminated. The
Irwindale Property is located approximately one mile away from the BPOU plume. The U.S. EPA named
Allegiance as a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) for the groundwater contamination in the
BPOU, along with a number of other PRPs. In June 2000, the U.S. EPA issued a unilateral
administrative order (“UAO”) against a number of companies, including Allegiance. The UAO
requires, among other things, the design and implementation of the Interim Groundwater Remedy
selected by the U.S. EPA. This Interim Groundwater Remedy generally requires pumping contaminated
groundwater from the aquifer and treating it in accordance with federal and state government
standards in order to remove or reduce contaminants of concern and to stop the further migration of
contaminants. Allegiance has maintained that the Irwindale Property did not contribute to the
alleged ground water contamination. The levels of contaminants detected on the Irwindale Property
are below any state or federal standard requiring remediation or monitoring. The U.S. EPA has been
engaged in settlement discussions with Allegiance, and has not sued Allegiance in connection with
the UAO or the BPOU. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, Allegiance accepted the U.S. EPA’s
cash buy-out demand of $550,000 in satisfaction of Allegiance’s share of costs for the Interim
Groundwater Remedy. Allegiance also agreed to pay the California Department of Toxic
Substances (“DTSC”) $16,050 in settlement of DTSC’s claims related to the Interim Groundwater
Remedy. Allegiance has recorded environmental accruals, based upon information available, that it
reasonably believes are adequate to satisfy known costs. The Company reasonably believes that the
impact of this claim upon Allegiance will be immaterial to the Company’s financial position,
liquidity and results of operations.



A-1 Plainwell and A-1 Sunrise Environmental Claims

The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality brought suit against Baxter as a PRP along
with a number of other PRPs in 1994 in the Circuit Court of the State of Michigan for Ingham
County alleging contamination of the A-1 disposal site in Plainwell, Michigan (“A-1 Plainwell”).
Among the contaminants at the site were solvent wastes generated by Burdick & Jackson (“Burdick”)
of Muskegon, Michigan. Baxter became a PRP through its acquisition of Burdick in 1986. Allegiance
agreed to defend and indemnify Baxter in this claim as part of the Baxter-Allegiance Spin-Off. The
principal relief sought was for the PRPs to clean up the site to applicable standards and to
reimburse the government for its oversight and other costs at the site. In a related action,
Allegiance, through its association with Baxter and Burdick, was named a PRP to reimburse the State
of Michigan for reimbursement costs associated with the construction of a landfill cap and
continued operation, maintenance and monitoring of the A-1 Sunrise site in Michigan (“A-1
Sunrise”). Allegiance has paid approximately $95,000 for past remediation costs at the A-1
Plainwell site and approximately $230,000 at the A-1 Sunrise site. Remediation of the A-1
Plainwell site is substantially complete, subject to minimal operation, maintenance and monitoring
of the site. Allegiance’s share of future remediation at the A-1 Sunrise site is approximately
1.8%. Allegiance has recorded environmental accruals based upon the information available that it
reasonably believes are adequate to satisfy known costs. The Company reasonably believes that the
impact of these claims upon Allegiance will be immaterial to the Company’s financial position,
liquidity and results of operations.

Thermochem Environmental Claim

As a result of the Burdick acquisition, Baxter was identified by the U.S. EPA as a PRP for
clean-up costs related to the Thermochem waste processing site in Muskegon, Michigan. Allegiance
agreed to defend and indemnify Baxter in this claim as part of the Baxter-Allegiance Spin-Off.
Based upon the information available, Allegiance reasonably believes the total clean-up cost of
this site to be between approximately $17 million and $23 million. A well-funded PRP group, of
which Allegiance is a member, has spent approximately $10 million in clean-up costs. Allegiance
reasonably believes that current available funding of the PRP group, along with Allegiance’s
additional recorded environmental accruals, are adequate to satisfy known costs. The Company
reasonably believes that the impact of this claim upon Allegiance will be immaterial to the
Company’s financial position, liquidity and results of operations.

Derivative Actions

On November 8, 2002, a complaint was filed by a purported shareholder against the Company and
its directors in the Court of Common Pleas, Delaware County, Ohio, as a purported derivative
action.

Doris Staehr v. Robert D. Walter, et al., No. 02-CVG-11-639

. On or about March 21, 2003,
after the Company filed a Motion to Dismiss the complaint, an amended complaint was filed alleging
breach of fiduciary duties and corporate waste in connection with the alleged failure by the Board
of Directors of the Company to renegotiate or terminate the Company’s proposed acquisition of
Syncor, and to determine the propriety of indemnifying Monty Fu, the former Chairman of Syncor.
The Company filed a Motion to Dismiss the amended complaint, and the plaintiffs subsequently filed
a second amended complaint that added three new individual defendants and included new allegations
that, among other things, the Company improperly recognized revenue in December 2000 and September
2001 related to settlements with certain vitamin manufacturers. The Company filed a Motion to
Dismiss the second amended complaint, and on November 20, 2003, the Court denied the motion. On
April 14, 2005, the Court stayed the action for a period of six months. The defendants intend to
vigorously defend this action. The Company currently does not believe that the impact of this
lawsuit will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, liquidity or
results of operations.

Since July 1, 2004, three complaints have been filed by purported shareholders against the
members of the Company’s Board of Directors, certain of its officers and employees and the Company
as a nominal defendant in the Court of Common Pleas, Franklin County, Ohio, as purported derivative
actions (collectively referred to as the “Cardinal Health Franklin County derivative actions”).
These cases include:

Donald Bosley, Derivatively on behalf of Cardinal Health, Inc. v. David Bing,
et al., Sam Wietschner v. Robert D. Walter, et al.

and

Green Meadow Partners, LLP, Derivatively on
behalf of Cardinal Health, Inc. v. David Bing, et al

. The Cardinal Health Franklin County
derivative actions allege that the individual defendants failed to implement adequate internal
controls for the Company and thereby violated their fiduciary duty of good faith, GAAP and the
Company’s Audit Committee charter. The complaints in the Cardinal Health Franklin County
derivative actions seek money damages and equitable relief against the defendant directors and an
award of attorney’s fees. On November 22, 2004, the Cardinal Health Franklin County derivative
actions were consolidated. Furthermore, by agreement of the parties, the Cardinal Health Franklin
County derivative actions have been stayed. None of the defendants has responded to the complaints
yet, nor has the Company.



Shareholder/ERISA Litigation against Cardinal Health

Since July 2, 2004, ten purported class action complaints have been filed by purported
purchasers of the Company’s securities against the Company and certain of its officers and
directors, asserting claims under the federal securities laws (collectively referred to as the
“Cardinal Health federal securities actions”). To date, all of these actions have been filed in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. These cases include:

Gerald
Burger v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 575), Todd Fener v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al.
(04 CV 579), E. Miles Senn v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 597), David Kim v. Cardinal
Health, Inc. (04 CV 598), Arace Brothers v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 604), John Hessian
v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 635), Constance Matthews Living Trust v. Cardinal Health,
Inc., et al. (04 CV 636), Mariss Partners, LLP v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 849), The
State of New Jersey v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 831)

and

First New York Securities, LLC
v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 911).

The Cardinal Health federal securities actions
purport to be brought on behalf of all purchasers of the Company’s securities during various
periods beginning as early as October 24, 2000 and ending as late as July 26, 2004 and allege,
among other things, that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5
promulgated thereunder and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act by issuing a series of false and/or
misleading statements concerning the Company’s financial results, prospects and condition. Certain
of the complaints also allege violations of Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
claiming material misstatements or omissions in prospectuses issued by the Company in connection
with its acquisition of Bindley Western Industries, Inc. (which has been given the legal
designation of Cardinal Health 100, Inc. and is referred to in this Form 10-K as “Bindley”) in 2001
and Syncor in 2003. The alleged misstatements relate to the Company’s accounting for recoveries
relating to antitrust litigation against vitamin manufacturers, and to classification of revenue in
the Company’s Pharmaceutical Distribution business as either operating revenue or revenue from bulk
deliveries to customer warehouses, among other matters. The alleged misstatements are claimed to
have caused an artificial inflation in the Company’s stock price during the proposed class period.
The complaints seek unspecified money damages and equitable relief against the defendants and an
award of attorney’s fees. On December 15, 2004, the Cardinal Health federal securities actions
were consolidated into one action captioned

In re Cardinal Health, Inc. Federal Securities
Litigation

, and on January 26, 2005, the Court appointed the Pension Fund Group as lead plaintiff
in this consolidated action. On April 22, 2005, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended
complaint naming the Company, certain current and former officers and employees and the Company’s
external auditors as defendants. The complaint seeks unspecified money damages and other
unspecified relief against the defendants. On August 22, 2005, the Company and certain defendants
filed a Motion to Dismiss the consolidated amended complaint.

Since July 2, 2004, 15 purported class action complaints (collectively referred to as the
“Cardinal Health ERISA actions”) have been filed against the Company and certain officers,
directors and employees of the Company by purported participants in the Cardinal Health Profit
Sharing, Retirement and Savings Plan (now known as the Cardinal Health 401(k) Savings Plan, or the
“401(k) Plan”). To date, all of these actions have been filed in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of Ohio. These cases include:

David McKeehan and James Syracuse v.
Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 643), Timothy Ferguson v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV
668), James DeCarlo v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 684), Margaret Johnson v. Cardinal
Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 722), Harry Anderson v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 725),
Charles Heitholt v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 736), Dan Salinas and Andrew Jones v.
Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 745), Daniel Kelley v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV
746), Vincent Palyan v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 778), Saul Cohen v. Cardinal Health,
Inc., et al. (04 CV 789), Travis Black v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 790), Wendy Erwin v.
Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 803), Susan Alston v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV
815), Jennifer Brister v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 828)

and

Gint Baukus v. Cardinal
Health, Inc., et al. (05 C2 101).

The Cardinal Health ERISA actions purport to be brought on
behalf of participants in the 401(k) Plan and the Syncor Employees’ Savings and Stock Ownership
Plan (the “Syncor ESSOP,” and together with the 401(k) Plan, the “Plans”), and also on behalf of
the Plans themselves. The complaints allege that the defendants breached certain fiduciary duties
owed under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”), generally asserting that the
defendants failed to make full disclosure of the risks to the Plans’ participants of investing in
the Company’s stock, to the detriment of the Plans’ participants and beneficiaries, and that
Company stock should not have been made available as an investment alternative for the Plans’
participants. The misstatements alleged in the Cardinal Health ERISA actions significantly overlap
with the misstatements alleged in the Cardinal Health federal securities actions. The complaints
seek unspecified money damages and equitable relief against the defendants and an award of
attorney’s fees. On December 15, 2004, the Cardinal Health ERISA actions were consolidated into
one action captioned

In re Cardinal Health, Inc. ERISA Litigation

. On January 14, 2005, the court
appointed lead counsel and liaison counsel for the consolidated Cardinal Health ERISA action. On
April 29, 2005, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended ERISA complaint naming the Company,
certain current and former directors, officers and employees, the Company’s Employee Benefits
Policy Committee and Putnam Fiduciary Trust Company as defendants. The complaint seeks unspecified
money damages and other unspecified relief against the defendants. On August 22, 2005, the Company
and certain defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss the consolidated amended ERISA complaint.



With respect to the proceedings described under the headings “Derivative Actions” and
“Shareholder/ERISA Litigation against Cardinal Health,” the Company currently believes that there
will be some insurance coverage available under the Company’s insurance policies in effect at the
time the actions were filed. Such policies are with financially viable insurance companies, and
are subject to self-insurance retentions, exclusions, conditions, coverage gaps, policy limits and
insurer solvency.

Shareholder/ERISA Litigation against Syncor

Eleven purported class action lawsuits have been filed against Syncor and certain of its
officers and directors, asserting claims under the federal securities laws (collectively referred
to as the “Syncor federal securities actions”). All of these actions were filed in the United
States District Court for the Central District of California. These cases include

Richard Bowe v.
Syncor Int’l Corp., et al., No. CV 02-8560 LGB (RCx) (C.D. Cal.), Alan Kaplan v. Syncor Int’l
Corp., et al., No. CV 02-8575 CBM (MANx) (C.D. Cal), Franklin Embon, Jr. v. Syncor Int’l Corp., et
al., No. CV 02-8687 DDP (AJWx) (C.D. Cal), Jonathan Alk v. Syncor Int’l Corp., et al., No. CV
02-8841 GHK (RZx) (C.D. Cal), Joyce Oldham v. Syncor Int’l Corp., et al., CV 02-8972 FMC (RCx)
(C.D. Cal), West Virginia Laborers Pension Trust Fund v. Syncor Int’l Corp., et al., No. CV 02-9076
NM (RNBx) (C.D. Cal), Brad Lookingbill v. Syncor Int’l Corp., et al., CV 02-9248 RSWL (Ex) (C.D.
Cal), Them Luu v. Syncor Int’l Corp., et al., CV 02-9583 RGK (JwJx) (C.D. Cal), David Hall v.
Syncor Int’l Corp., et al., CV 02-9621 CAS (CWx) (C.D. Cal), Phyllis Walzer v. Syncor Int’l Corp.,
et al., CV 02-9640 RMT (AJWx) (C.D. Cal),

and

Larry Hahn v. Syncor Int’l Corp., et al., CV 03-52
LGB (RCx) (C.D. Cal.)

. The Syncor federal securities actions purport to be brought on behalf of
all purchasers of Syncor shares during various periods, beginning as early as March 30, 2000 and
ending as late as November 5, 2002. The actions allege, among other things, that the defendants
violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder and Section 20(a)
of the Exchange Act by issuing a series of press releases and public filings disclosing significant
sales growth in Syncor’s international business, but omitting mention of certain allegedly improper
payments to Syncor’s foreign customers, thereby artificially inflating the price of Syncor shares.
A lead plaintiff has been appointed by the Court in the Syncor federal securities actions, and a
consolidated amended complaint was filed May 19, 2003, naming Syncor and 12 individuals, all former
Syncor officers, directors and/or employees, as defendants. The consolidated complaint seeks
unspecified money damages and other unspecified relief against the defendants. Syncor filed a
Motion to Dismiss the consolidated amended complaint on August 1, 2003, and on December 12, 2003,
the Court granted the Motion to Dismiss without prejudice. A second amended consolidated class
action complaint was filed on January 28, 2004, naming Syncor and 14 individuals, all former Syncor
officers, directors and/or employees, as defendants. Syncor filed a Motion to Dismiss the second
amended consolidated class action complaint on March 4, 2004. On July 6, 2004, the Court granted
Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss without prejudice as to defendants Syncor, Monty Fu, Robert Funari
and Haig Bagerdjian. As to the other individual defendants, the Motion to Dismiss was granted with
prejudice. On September 14, 2004, the lead plaintiff filed a Motion for Clarification of the
Court’s July 6, 2004 dismissal order. The court clarified its July 6, 2004 dismissal order on
November 29, 2004 and the lead plaintiff filed a third amended consolidated complaint on December
29, 2004. Syncor filed a Motion to Dismiss the third amended consolidated complaint on January 31,
2005. On April 15, 2005, the Court granted the Motion to Dismiss with prejudice. The lead
plaintiff has appealed this decision.

On November 14, 2002, two additional actions were filed by individual stockholders of Syncor
in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the “Delaware actions”) against seven of
Syncor’s nine directors (the “director defendants”). The complaints in each of the Delaware
actions were identical and alleged that the director defendants breached certain fiduciary duties
to Syncor by failing to maintain adequate controls, practices and procedures to ensure that
Syncor’s employees and representatives did not engage in improper and unlawful conduct. Both
complaints asserted a single derivative claim, for and on behalf of Syncor, seeking to recover all
of the costs and expenses that Syncor incurred as a result of the allegedly improper payments
(including the costs of the Syncor federal securities actions described above), and a single
purported class action claim seeking to recover damages on behalf of all holders of Syncor shares
in the amount of any losses sustained if consideration received by Syncor stockholders in the
Company’s merger with Syncor was reduced. On November 22, 2002, the plaintiff in one of the two
Delaware actions filed an amended complaint adding as defendants the Company, its subsidiary Mudhen
Merger Corporation and the remaining two Syncor directors, who are hereafter included in the term
“director defendants.” These cases have been consolidated under the caption

In re Syncor
International Corp. Shareholders Litigation

(the “consolidated Delaware action”). On August 14,
2003, the Company filed a Motion to Dismiss the operative complaint in the consolidated Delaware
action. At the end of September 2003, plaintiffs in the consolidated Delaware action moved the
Court to file a second amended complaint. Plaintiffs’ request was granted in February 2004. Monty
Fu was the only named defendant in the second amended complaint. On September 15, 2004, the Court
granted Monty Fu’s Motion to Dismiss the second amended complaint. The Court dismissed the second
amended complaint with prejudice.

On November 18, 2002, two additional actions were filed by individual stockholders of Syncor
in the Superior Court of California for the County of Los Angeles (the “California actions”)
against the director defendants. The complaints in the California actions allege that the director
defendants breached certain fiduciary duties to Syncor by failing to maintain adequate controls,
practices and procedures to ensure that Syncor’s employees and representatives did not engage in
improper and unlawful conduct. Both complaints asserted a single derivative claim, for and on
behalf of Syncor, seeking to recover costs and expenses



that Syncor incurred as a result of the allegedly improper payments. These cases include

Joseph
Famularo v. Monty Fu, et al., Case No. BC285478 (Cal. Sup. Ct., Los Angeles Cty.)

, and

Mark Stroup
v. Robert G. Funari, et al., Case No. BC285480 (Cal. Sup. Ct., Los Angeles Cty.)

. An amended
complaint was filed on December 6, 2002 in one of the cases, purporting to allege direct claims on
behalf of a class of shareholders. The defendants’ motion for a stay of the California actions
pending the resolution of the Delaware actions (discussed above) was granted on April 30, 2003. On
November 29, 2004, the court dismissed the California actions with prejudice.

A purported class action complaint, captioned

Pilkington v. Cardinal Health, et al.,

was filed
on April 8, 2003 against the Company, Syncor and certain officers and employees of the Company by a
purported participant in the Syncor ESSOP. A related purported class action complaint, captioned

Donna Brown, et al. v. Syncor International Corp, et al.,

was filed on September 11, 2003 against
the Company, Syncor and certain individual defendants. Another related purported class action
complaint, captioned

Thompson v. Syncor International Corp., et al.

, was filed on January 14, 2004
against the Company, Syncor and certain individual defendants. Each of these actions was brought
in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. A consolidated
complaint was filed on February 24, 2004 against Syncor and certain former Syncor officers,
directors and/or employees alleging that the defendants breached certain fiduciary duties owed
under ERISA based on the same underlying allegations of improper and unlawful conduct alleged in
the federal securities litigation. The consolidated complaint seeks unspecified money damages and
other unspecified relief against the defendants. On April 26, 2004, the defendants filed Motions
to Dismiss the consolidated complaint. On August 24, 2004, the Court granted in part and denied in
part Defendants’ Motions to Dismiss. The Court dismissed, without prejudice, all claims against
defendants Ed Burgos and Sheila Coop, all claims alleging co-fiduciary liability against all
defendants, and all claims alleging that the individual defendants had conflicts of interest
precluding them from properly exercising their fiduciary duties under ERISA. A claim for breach of
the duty to prudently manage plan assets was upheld against Syncor, and a claim for breach of the
alleged duty to “monitor” the performance of Syncor’s Plan Administrative Committee was upheld
against defendants Monty Fu and Robert Funari. In addition, the United States Department of Labor
is conducting an investigation of the Syncor ESSOP with respect to its compliance with ERISA
requirements. The Company has responded to a subpoena received from the Department of Labor and
continues to cooperate in the investigation.

It is impossible to predict the outcome of the proceedings described under the heading
“Shareholder/ERISA Litigation against Syncor” or their impact on the Company. However, the Company
currently does not believe that the impact of these actions will have a material adverse effect on
the Company’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations. The Company believes the
allegations made in the complaints described above are without merit and it intends to vigorously
defend such actions. The Company has been informed that the individual director and officer
defendants deny liability for the claims asserted in these actions, believe they have meritorious
defenses and intend to vigorously defend such actions. The Company currently believes that a
portion of any liability will be covered by insurance policies that the Company and Syncor have
with financially viable insurance companies, subject to self-insurance retentions, exclusions,
conditions, coverage gaps, policy limits and insurer solvency.

DuPont Litigation

On September 11, 2003, E.I. Du Pont De Nemours and Company (“DuPont”) filed a lawsuit against
the Company and others in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee.

E.I. Du Pont De Nemours and Company v. Cardinal Health, Inc., BBA Materials Technology and BBA
Nonwovens Simpsonville, Inc., No. 3-03-0848

. The complaint alleges various causes of action
against the Company relating to the production and sale of surgical drapes and gowns by the
Company’s Medical Products and Services segment. DuPont’s claims generally fall into the
categories of breach of contract, false advertising and patent infringement. The complaint does
not request a specific amount of damages. The Company believes that the claims made in the
complaint are without merit, and it intends to vigorously defend this action. The Company is owed
a defense and indemnity from its co-defendants with respect to DuPont’s claim for patent
infringement. The Company currently does not believe that the impact of this lawsuit, if any, will
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, liquidity or results of
operations. This matter is currently scheduled for trial during the second quarter of fiscal 2006.

SEC Investigation and U.S. Attorney Inquiry

On October 7, 2003, the Company received a request from the SEC, in connection with an
informal inquiry, for historical financial and related information. The SEC’s initial request
sought a variety of documentation, including the Company’s accounting records for fiscal 2001
through fiscal 2003, as well as notes, memoranda, presentations, e-mail and other correspondence,
budgets, forecasts and estimates.

On May 6, 2004, the Company was notified that the pending SEC informal inquiry had been
converted into a formal investigation. On June 21, 2004, as part of the SEC’s formal
investigation, the Company received an SEC subpoena that included a request for the production of
documents relating to revenue classification, and the methods used for such classification, in the
Company’s Pharmaceutical Distribution business as either “Operating Revenue” or “Bulk Deliveries to
Customer Warehouses and



Other.” The Company learned that the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New
York had also commenced an inquiry that the Company understands relates to this same subject. On
October 12, 2004, in connection with the SEC’s formal investigation, the Company received a
subpoena from the SEC requesting the production of documents relating to compensation information
for specific current and former employees and officers. The Company was notified in April 2005
that certain current and former employees and directors received subpoenas from the SEC requesting
the production of documents. The subject matter of these requests is consistent with the subject
matter of the subpoenas the Company had previously received from the SEC.

In connection with the SEC’s inquiry, the Company’s Audit Committee commenced its own internal
review in April 2004, assisted by independent counsel. This internal review was prompted by
documents contained in the production to the SEC that raised issues as to certain accounting
matters, including but not limited to the establishment and adjustment of certain reserves and
their impact on quarterly earnings. The Audit Committee and its independent counsel also have
reviewed the revenue classification issue that is the subject of the SEC’s June 21, 2004 subpoena
and are reviewing other matters identified in the course of the Audit Committee’s internal review.
During September and October 2004, the Audit Committee reached certain conclusions with respect to
findings from its internal review. In connection with the Audit Committee’s conclusions, the
Company made certain reclassification and restatement adjustments to its fiscal 2004 and prior
historical consolidated financial statements. The Audit Committee’s conclusions were discussed,
and the reclassification and restatement adjustments were reflected, in the 2004 Form 10-K.
More information with respect to the prior conclusions of the Audit
Committee’s internal review and the impact of the
reclassification and restatement adjustments on the reporting periods
discussed in this Form 10-K is set forth in Notes 1 and 2 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”

Following the conclusions reached by the Audit Committee in September and October 2004, the
Audit Committee began the task of assigning responsibility for the financial statement matters
described above which were reflected in the 2004 Form 10-K and in January 2005 took disciplinary
actions with respect to the Company’s employees who it determined bore responsibility for these
matters, other than with respect to the accounting treatment of certain recoveries from vitamin
manufacturers for which there is a separate Board committee internal review (discussed below). The
disciplinary actions ranged from terminations or resignations of employment to required repayments
of some or all of fiscal 2003 bonuses from certain employees to letters of reprimand. These
disciplinary actions affected senior financial and managerial personnel, as well as other
personnel, at the corporate level and in the four business segments. None of the Company’s current
corporate executive officers (who are identified under the heading “Executive Officers of the
Company” following Item 4 of this Form 10-K) were the subject of disciplinary action by the Audit
Committee. In connection with the determinations made by the Audit Committee, the Company’s
former controller resigned effective February 15, 2005. The Audit Committee has completed its
determinations of responsibility for the financial statement matters described above which were
reflected in the 2004 Form 10-K, although responsibility for matters relating to the Company’s
accounting treatment of certain recoveries from vitamin manufacturers has been addressed by a
separate committee of the Board. The Audit Committee internal review is substantially complete.

In connection with the SEC’s formal investigation, a committee of the Board of Directors, with
the assistance of independent counsel, separately initiated an internal review to assign
responsibility for matters relating to the Company’s accounting treatment of certain recoveries
from vitamin manufacturers. In the 2004 Form 10-K, as part of the Audit Committee’s internal
review, the Company reversed its previous recognition of estimated recoveries from vitamin
manufacturers for amounts overcharged in prior years and recognized the income from such recoveries
as a special item in the period in which cash was received from the manufacturers. The SEC staff
had previously advised the Company that, in its view, the Company did not have an appropriate basis
for recognizing the income in advance of receiving the cash. In August 2005, the separate Board
committee reached certain conclusions with respect to findings from its internal review and
determined that no additional disciplinary actions were required
beyond the disciplinary actions already taken by the Audit Committee,
as described above. The separate Board committee
internal review is substantially complete.

Settlement discussions have recently commenced with the SEC regarding resolution of
its investigation with respect to the Company. While these discussions are ongoing, there can be
no assurance that the Company’s efforts to resolve the investigation with respect to the Company
will be successful, and the Company cannot predict the timing or outcome of these matters or the
terms of any such resolution. As a result of the initiation of these discussions, the Company
recorded a reserve of $25 million for its fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 in respect of the SEC
investigation. Unless and until the SEC investigation is resolved, there can be no assurance that
the amount reserved by the Company for this investigation will be sufficient and that a larger
amount will not be required. Therefore, this reserve will be reviewed on a quarterly basis and
adjusted to the extent that the Company determines it is necessary.

The SEC investigation, the U.S. Attorney inquiry, the Audit Committee internal review and the
separate Board committee internal review remain ongoing, although the Audit Committee internal
review and the separate Board committee internal review are substantially complete. While the
Company is continuing in its efforts to respond to these inquiries and provide all information
required, the Company cannot predict the outcome of the SEC investigation, the U.S. Attorney
inquiry, the Audit Committee internal review or the separate Board committee internal review. The
outcome of the SEC investigation, the U.S. Attorney inquiry



and any related legal and administrative proceedings could include the institution of
administrative, civil injunctive or criminal proceedings involving the Company and/or current or
former Company employees, officers and/or directors, as well as the imposition of fines and other
penalties, remedies and sanctions.

In addition, there can be no assurance that additional restatements will not be required, that
the historical consolidated financial statements included in the 2004 Form 10-K, the Forms 10-Q for
the quarterly periods during fiscal 2005, or this Form 10-K will not change or require amendment,
or that additional disciplinary actions will not be required in such circumstances. As the SEC’s
investigation, the U.S. Attorney’s inquiry and the Audit Committee’s internal review continue, the
Audit Committee may identify new issues, or make additional findings if it receives additional
information, that may have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and the
scope of the restatements described in the 2004 Form 10-K, the Forms 10-Q for the quarterly periods
during fiscal 2005, and this Form 10-K.

FTC Investigation

In December 2004, the Company received a request for documents from the Federal Trade
Commission (“FTC”) that asks the Company to voluntarily produce certain documents to the FTC. The
document request, which does not allege any wrongdoing, is part of an FTC non-public investigation
to determine whether the Company may be engaging in anticompetitive practices with other wholesale
drug distributors in order to limit competition for provider customers seeking distribution
services. The Company is in the process of responding to the FTC request. Because the
investigation is at an early stage, the Company cannot predict its outcome or its effect, if any,
on the Company’s business.

New York Attorney General Investigation

In April 2005, one of the Company’s subsidiaries received a subpoena from the Attorney
General’s Office of the State of New York. The Company believes that the New York Attorney General
is conducting a broad industry inquiry that appears to focus on, among other things, the secondary
market within the wholesale pharmaceutical industry. The Company is one of multiple parties that
have received such a subpoena. The Company has been producing documents and providing information
to the New York Attorney General’s office in response to the April 2005 subpoena as well as
subsequent informal requests. Because the investigation is at an early stage, the Company cannot
predict its outcome or its effect on the Company’s business.

Other Matters

In addition to the legal proceedings disclosed above, the Company also becomes involved from
time-to-time in other litigation incidental to its business, including, without limitation,
inclusion of certain of its subsidiaries as a potentially responsible party for environmental
clean-up costs as well as litigation in connection with future and prior acquisitions. The Company
intends to vigorously defend itself against such other litigation and does not currently believe
that the outcome of any such other litigation will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

The health care industry is highly regulated and government agencies continue to increase
their scrutiny over certain practices affecting government programs and otherwise. From time to
time

,

the Company receives subpoenas or requests for information from various government agencies.
The Company generally responds to such subpoenas and requests in a timely and thorough manner,
which responses sometimes require considerable time and effort, and can result in considerable
costs being incurred, by the Company. The Company expects to incur additional costs in the future
in connection with existing and future requests.

Item 6: Selected Financial Data

In connection with certain conclusions made by the Audit Committee during September and
October 2004 as part of its internal review and prior to filing the 2004 Form 10-K, the Company
made certain reclassification and restatement adjustments to its fiscal 2004 and prior historical
consolidated financial statements, which were reflected in the 2004 Form 10-K. The following
selected consolidated financial data reflects the impact of these adjustments.

The selected consolidated financial data of the Company were prepared giving retroactive
effect to the business combination with Bindley on February 14, 2001, which was accounted for as
a pooling-of-interests transaction. The consolidated financial data include all purchase
transactions as of the date of acquisition that occurred during these periods.

Amounts reflect business combinations and the impact of special items in all periods
presented. See Note 4 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a further
discussion of special items affecting fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003. Fiscal 2002 amounts reflect
the impact of special items of $116.6 million ($73.7 million, net of tax). Fiscal 2001
amounts reflect the impact of special items of $124.9 million
($85.3 million, net of tax).

Subsequent to the filing of the 2004 Form 10-K, certain
errors were indentified related to the restatement adjustments
previously recorded in the 2004 Form 10-K within fiscal years 2003
through 2000. The impact of these errors was immaterial for all
periods presented. See Note 1 of “Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements” for additional information.

(3)

During fiscal 2002, the Company recognized a benefit of approximately $23 million as a result
of changes in the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) calculation with respect to generic
products in order to more accurately reflect inflationary indices. The Company determined
that the cumulative effect of the change in LIFO methods was non-determinable due to the
unavailability of historical information needed to calculate the effect. Therefore, in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, the Company did not record the
adjustment as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle.

(4)

On January 1, 2003, the Company acquired Syncor. Prior to the acquisition, Syncor had
announced the discontinuation of certain operations including the medical imaging business and
certain overseas operations. The Company proceeded with the discontinuation of these
operations and included additional international and non-core domestic businesses to the
discontinued operations. The Company sold substantially all of the remaining discontinued
operations prior to the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2005. For additional
information regarding discontinued operations, see Note 22 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.”

(5)

Effective at the beginning of fiscal 2004, the Company changed its method of recognizing cash
discounts from recognizing cash discounts as a reduction of costs of products sold primarily
upon payment of vendor invoices to recording cash discounts as a component of inventory cost
and recognizing such discounts as a reduction of cost of products sold upon sale of inventory.
For more information regarding the change in accounting, see Note 16 of “Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.”

(6)

In the first quarter of fiscal 2002, the method of recognizing revenue for pharmacy
automation equipment was changed from recognizing revenue when the units are delivered to the
customer to recognizing revenue when the units are installed at the customer site.

(7)

Basic earnings, diluted earnings and cash dividends per Common Share have been adjusted to
retroactively reflect all stock dividends and stock splits through June 30, 2005.

(8)

Cash dividends per Common Share exclude dividends paid by all entities with which
subsidiaries of the Company have merged.

Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The discussion and analysis presented below refers to and should be read in conjunction with
the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

In connection with certain conclusions made by the Audit Committee during September and
October 2004 as part of its ongoing internal review and prior to filing the 2004 Form 10-K, the
Company made certain reclassification and restatement adjustments to its fiscal 2004 and prior
historical consolidated financial statements, which were reflected in the 2004 Form 10-K. As a
result, the Company supplemented its historical disclosures within “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” to reflect these reclassification and
restatement adjustments on previously reported Company and business segment operating earnings
performance. All prior period disclosures presented in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations” have been adjusted to reflect these changes.

Growth is calculated as change (increase or decrease) for a given year as compared to
immediately preceding year.

The results of operations during the fiscal years noted in the table above reflect the breadth
of products and services the Company offers and the increasing demand for the Company’s diverse
portfolio of products and services, which led to revenue growth in every segment of the Company.
The Company continues to experience strong demand from health care providers for the Company to
provide integrated solutions. Integrated solutions include products and services from multiple
lines of businesses within the Company, and currently represent approximately $7 billion of annual
sales.

The
Company’s operations are organized into four reportable segments, Pharmaceutical
Distribution and Provider Services, Medical Products and Services, Pharmaceutical Technologies and
Services and Clinical Technologies and Services. See Note 18 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements” for discussion of changes to business segments during fiscal 2005.

The Company’s Pharmaceutical Distribution business is in a business model transition with
respect to how it is compensated for the logistical, capital and administrative services that it
provides to branded pharmaceutical manufacturers. Historically, the compensation received by the
Pharmaceutical Distribution business from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers was based on each
manufacturer’s unique sales practices (e.g., volume of product available for sale, eligibility to
purchase product, cash discounts for prompt payment, rebates, etc.) and pharmaceutical pricing
practices (e.g., the timing, frequency and magnitude of product price increases). Specifically, a
significant portion of the compensation the Pharmaceutical Distribution business received from
manufacturers was derived from the Company’s ability to purchase pharmaceutical inventory in
advance of pharmaceutical price increases, hold that inventory as manufacturers increased
pharmaceutical prices, and generate a higher operating margin on the subsequent sale of that
inventory. This compensation system was dependent to a large degree upon the sales practices of
each branded pharmaceutical manufacturer, including established policies concerning the volume of
product available for purchase in advance of a price increase, and on predictable pharmaceutical
pricing practices.

Beginning in fiscal 2003, branded pharmaceutical manufacturers began to seek greater control
over the amount of pharmaceutical product available in the supply chain, and, as a result, began to
change their sales practices by restricting the volume of product available for purchase by
pharmaceutical wholesalers. In addition, manufacturers have increasingly sought more services from
the Company, including providing data concerning product sales and distribution patterns. The
Company believes that the manufacturers have sought these changes to provide them with greater
visibility over product demand and movement in the market and to increase product safety and
integrity by reducing the risks associated with product being available to, and distributed in, the
secondary market. These changes have significantly reduced the compensation received by the
Company from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers. As a result of these actions by branded
pharmaceutical manufacturers, the Company concluded it was no longer being adequately and
consistently compensated for the reliable and consistent logistical, capital and administrative
services being provided by the Company to these manufacturers.

In response to the developments discussed above, the Company has established a compensation
system that is significantly less dependent on manufacturers’ sales or pricing practices, and is
based on the services provided by the Company to meet the unique distribution requirements of each
manufacturer’s products. During fiscal 2005, the Company worked with individual branded
pharmaceutical manufacturers to define fee-for-service terms that adequately compensate the Company
based on the services being provided to such manufacturers. The initial fee-for-service transition
is essentially complete, which should help reduce earnings volatility in the segment.

As part of the transition to fee-for-service terms, certain of the new distribution service
agreements entered into with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers continue to have an
inflation-based compensation component to them. Arrangements with certain other branded
manufacturers still continue to be solely inflation-based. If branded pharmaceutical price
inflation is lower than the



Company has anticipated, its operating results could be adversely affected with respect to its
current exposure to contingent fee-based compensation in its
Pharmaceutical Distribution business. In addition, certain key distribution service agreements will be re-negotiated in the latter
half of fiscal 2006 and into fiscal 2007 when their initial terms expire. If the terms of the
re-negotiated agreements are unfavorable to the Company, it could adversely affect the Company’s
operating results.

Revenue and operating earnings within the Pyxis products business of the Clinical Technologies
and Services segment declined significantly during fiscal 2005. The decline was a result of the
following:

•

a lengthened sales and installation cycle;

•

the delayed introduction of Pyxis MedStation® 3000, the next generation of Pyxis’ medication management system;

•

increased competition within the industry; and

•

the impact from the Audit Committee’s internal review, as more fully described in Note 1
of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” which created execution issues as the
efforts and attention of certain sales and installation teams were diverted from ordinary
business operations.

The Company believes that these adverse conditions impacted the Pyxis products business in the
short-term, and it remains confident in the long-term prospects for this business due
to the expected efficiencies from the formation of the Clinical Technologies and Services segment,
the greater efficiency to be realized from new installation processes and continuing customer
demand for products and services focusing on patient safety. During the fourth quarter of fiscal
2005, the Pyxis products business established momentum for fiscal 2006 as evidenced by its
increased committed contracts primarily for its new product, Pyxis MedStation 3000.

Operating earnings within the Company’s Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment
declined during fiscal 2005. The decline was due in part to the continued delays in opening new
facilities and existing facilities operating below planned capacity within the Biotechnology and
Sterile Life Sciences business, including the Humacao, Puerto Rico facility. The Company decided to
close the sterile manufacturing facility in Humacao, Puerto Rico as part of the global
restructuring program associated with its One Cardinal Health initiative. These operations had
underperformed relative to Company expectations, due in part to continued regulatory issues at the
facility. The decision does not affect the Company’s other operations in Puerto Rico or at other
locations worldwide. In addition, the operating earnings decline within this segment was also the
result of lower demand for medical communication services within the Healthcare Marketing Services
business. The adverse conditions experienced by the segment were partially offset by the strength
of certain softgel and controlled release products, as well as the year-over-year impact of
acquisitions.

Global Restructuring Program

As
previously reported, during fiscal 2005, the Company launched a global restructuring
program in connection with its One Cardinal Health initiative with the goal of increasing the value
the Company provides its customers through better integration of existing businesses and improved
efficiency from a more disciplined approach to procurement and resource allocation. The Company
expects the program to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2008 and to improve operating
earnings and position the Company for future growth. The actual operating earnings improvements
for fiscal 2005 were estimated by the Company to have been in excess of the expected improvement of $125 million. The program is
expected to improve operating earnings by approximately $190 million for fiscal 2006.

The Company expects the program to be implemented in two phases. The first phase of the
program focuses on business consolidations and process improvements, including rationalizing
facilities worldwide, reducing the Company’s global workforce, and rationalizing and discontinuing
overlapping and under-performing product lines. See the Form 8-K filed by the Company on December
14, 2004 for a description of the costs the Company expects to incur in connection with the first
phase of the program.

The second phase of the program will focus on longer term integration activities that will
enhance service to customers through improved integration across the Company’s segments, and
continue to streamline internal operations. See the Form 8-K filed by the Company on August 5,
2005 for a description of the costs the Company expects to incur in connection with the second
phase of the program. See Notes 4 and 21 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for
discussion of the restructuring costs incurred by the Company during fiscal 2005 related to both
phases of the global restructuring program.



Government Investigations and Board Committee Internal Reviews

The Company is currently the subject of a formal investigation by the SEC relating to certain
accounting matters and the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York is
conducting an inquiry with respect to the Company. The Company’s Audit Committee also is
conducting its own internal review, assisted by independent counsel, which internal review is
ongoing. In addition, a Board committee, with the assistance of independent counsel, is separately
conducting an internal review to assign responsibility for the matters relating to the Company’s
accounting treatment of certain recoveries from vitamin manufacturers, which internal review is
also ongoing. Settlement discussions have recently commenced with the
SEC regarding
resolution of its investigation with respect to the Company, and the
Company has recorded a reserve of $25 million for fiscal 2005 in
respect of the SEC investigation.
 For further information regarding these matters, see “Part I, Item 3: Legal
Proceedings” and Note 1 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in this Form 10-K.

Product Safety

As a leading provider of products and services supporting the health care industry, including
the distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products, the Company is monitoring
issues regarding the safety of the supply chain for pharmaceuticals and other health care products.
The Company will continue to work proactively with all participants and regulators in the
pharmaceutical supply chain to help ensure it is safe and efficient. The Company continues to work
with its suppliers to help minimize the risks associated with counterfeit products in the supply
chain.

Acquisitions

On June 28, 2004, the Company acquired approximately 98.7% of the outstanding common stock of
Alaris, a provider of intravenous medication safety products and services. On July 7, 2004, Alaris
merged with a subsidiary of the Company to complete the transaction. The value of the transaction,
including the assumption of Alaris’ debt, totaled approximately $2.1 billion. For further
information regarding the Alaris acquisition, the valuation of the acquisition’s intangibles, and
the impact on segment reporting, see Notes 4, 17 and 18 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.”
 Prior to the completion of the ALARIS acquisition, on June 16, 2004,
ICU Medical, Inc. filed a patent infringement lawsuit against ALARIS
in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
California. In the lawsuit, ICU claims that the ALARIS SmartSite®
family of needle-free values and systems infringes upon ICU patents.
ICU seeks monetary damages plus permanent injunctive relief
preventing ALARIS from selling SmartSite® products. On July 30,
2004, the Court denied ICU’s application for a preliminary injunction
finding, among other things, that ICU had failed to show a
substantial likelihood of success on the merits. The Company intends
to vigorously defend this action.

During December 2003, the Company completed its acquisition of Intercare, an European
pharmaceutical products and services company. The cash transaction was valued at approximately
$570 million, including the assumption of approximately $150 million in Intercare debt. See Note
18 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for further information regarding the impact
that this acquisition had on the Company’s segment reporting.

During fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company completed numerous acquisitions, including,
Alaris, Intercare and Syncor. The Company’s trend with regard to acquisitions has been to expand
its role as a provider of services to the health care industry. This trend has resulted in
expansion into areas that complement the Company’s existing operations and provide opportunities
for the Company to develop synergies with, and strengthen, the acquired business. As the health
care industry continues to change, the Company evaluates possible candidates for merger or
acquisition and intends to take advantage of opportunities to expand its role as a provider of
services to the health care industry through all its reporting segments. There can be no assurance
that the Company will be able to successfully take advantage of any such opportunity or consummate
any such transaction, if pursued. To the extent that the Company continues to pursue acquisitions,
its ability to complete such transactions may be adversely affected by the government
investigations described under “Part I, Item 3: Legal Proceedings” and Note 1 of “Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements” in this Form 10-K. If additional transactions are pursued or
consummated, the Company would incur additional merger- and acquisition-related costs, and may need
to enter into funding arrangements for such mergers or acquisitions. There can be no assurance
that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful.

Growth is calculated as change (increase or decrease) for a given year as compared to
immediately preceding year.

Total Company.

Total Company revenue increased 15% during each of fiscal 2005 and
2004. The revenue growth in these fiscal years resulted from the following:



These increases during fiscal 2005 were partially offset by slower revenue growth within the
Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment and a decline in revenue from Pyxis products
within the Clinical Technologies and Services segment.

Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services.

The Pharmaceutical Distribution
and Provider Services revenue growth of 16% in fiscal 2005 resulted from strong sales to customers
within this segment’s core Pharmaceutical Distribution business. The most significant growth was
in “Bulk Revenue” (defined below), which increased approximately 34%. See the Bulk Revenue
discussion below for further details. In addition, annualized pharmaceutical price increases of
approximately 4.9% contributed to the growth in this segment. However, the rate of price increases
was lower than the rate experienced over the prior fiscal year.

As discussed in Note 2 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in this Form 10-K,
during fiscal 2004, the Company decided to aggregate revenue classes. “Operating Revenue” and
“Bulk Deliveries to Customer Warehouses and Other” were combined for all periods presented so that
total revenue and total cost of products sold are presented as single amounts in the consolidated
statements of earnings. Beginning with the 2004 Form 10-K, information concerning the portion of
the Company’s revenue that arises from Bulk Revenue is discussed in the Company’s “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” For more information
regarding this reclassification, see Note 2 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”

The Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services segment reports transactions with the
following characteristics as “Bulk Revenue”:

•

deliveries to customer warehouses whereby the Company acts as an intermediary in the
ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products;

•

delivery of products to the customer in the same bulk form as the products are received from the manufacturer;

•

warehouse to customer warehouse or process center deliveries; or

•

deliveries to customers in large or high volume full case quantities.

Bulk Revenue for fiscal 2005 was $24.1 billion compared to $18.0 billion in fiscal 2004. The
increase in Bulk Revenue primarily relates to additional volume from existing and new customers as
well as market growth within the mail order business. The increase from existing customers is
primarily due to certain customers purchasing from the Company rather than directly from the
manufacturer.

The Company continues to provide disclosure concerning its bulk sales due to the differences
in the nature and character of the business activities associated with bulk and non-bulk revenues.
Non-bulk activities tend to be more complex as the Company receives inventory in large or full case
sizes from the manufacturer, breaks it down into smaller sizes, warehouses the product, picks
products specific to a customer’s order and delivers that order to customer locations (such as
retail pharmacies or individual hospitals) generally on a just-in-time basis and in small sizes.
While certain of the above activities occur with some bulk transactions, bulk typically involves
much larger sizes, generally in unopened cases or full pallets, which are shipped either directly
from the manufacturer or from the Company to customers’ own warehousing facilities.

The Company’s classification of sales as bulk or non-bulk also corresponds to its four
business operations within Pharmaceutical Distribution. Applying the definition set forth above,
all revenue in the brokerage and trading operations is classified as bulk. All revenue in the
repackaging operation is classified as non-bulk. Within the core facilities operation, revenue is
classified as bulk or non-bulk on a customer-by-customer basis, based solely upon the type of
customer involved. Shipments to warehouses and processing centers (primarily retail chain and mail
order customers) are classified as bulk revenue. All other core facilities revenue is classified
as non-bulk revenue.

This segment’s revenue growth of 14% in fiscal 2004 resulted primarily from strong sales to
existing customers, sales to new customers and pharmaceutical price increases. Sales growth to
existing customers within the retail chain and alternate site categories in this segment’s
Pharmaceutical Distribution business showed particular strength. This segment also benefited from
contract wins during fiscal 2004, pharmaceutical price increases averaging approximately 6.2%
during fiscal 2004 and an extra business day. These revenue gains were partially dampened by
continued reduction in business with Kmart Holding Corp. (“Kmart”) due to Kmart’s closure of
various stores and certain contract losses during fiscal 2004 in this segment’s Pharmaceutical
Distribution business.

Medical Products and Services.

The Medical Products and Services revenue growth of 7%
in fiscal 2005 resulted primarily from increased volume from existing customers, new contracts
signed during fiscal 2004 within the medical-surgical distribution business, strong international
growth, especially in Canada and Europe, favorable foreign exchange translation and increased
revenue from the Specialty Distribution business. The 6% growth in the medical-surgical
distribution business was primarily from increased sales to hospital supply and ambulatory care customers and
the 11% growth within the Specialty Distribution business resulted from increased revenue from the
business’ largest customer and growth of the existing customer base. This segment’s revenue growth
was adversely affected by slower growth in the sale of self-manufactured products, and the loss of
certain business from customers within a GPO.

The Specialty Distribution business’ largest customer has notified the Company that they will
begin self distribution on January 1, 2006 which will significantly impact revenue and operating
earnings for this business during the second half of fiscal 2006. This customer represented
approximately $1.5 billion or 16% of this segment’s fiscal 2005 revenue. The Company plans to
partially mitigate this loss through the addition of a large, new customer agreement signed in April
2005 and cost cutting measures.

This segment’s revenue growth of 14% in fiscal 2004 resulted primarily from increased sales
momentum from new and existing contracts within the distribution business as well as from increased
sales volume from the segment’s international businesses. New contracts drove increased sales of
both distributed and self-manufactured products, with sales from the distribution business
particularly strong during fiscal 2004. The international businesses also generated strong revenue
growth,
increasing nearly 19% from the prior fiscal year. Approximately 14% of the international
business revenue growth related to



changes in foreign currency rates. Sales of new
self-manufactured products, particularly enhancements within surgeon glove products, also
contributed to the overall revenue growth. This segment’s revenue growth was above industry
averages during fiscal 2004.

Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services.

The Pharmaceutical Technologies and
Services segment’s revenue growth of 6% in fiscal 2005 resulted primarily from strong demand for
certain softgel products, the impact of acquisitions, primarily Intercare and the acquisition of
Geodax within the Nuclear Pharmacy Services business, and the impact of foreign exchange rates.
Revenue growth was offset by certain regulatory issues as noted below. The net impact of
acquisitions and divestitures within this segment accounted for approximately 5% of the revenue
growth in fiscal 2005. Revenue in fiscal 2005 increased by approximately 2% as a result of the
impact of foreign exchange rates. This impact takes into consideration the fiscal 2005 rate
fluctuations due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar and the fiscal 2004 constant rate adjustment
(see footnote 6 to the table in Note 18 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for
additional discussion as it relates to fiscal 2004 constant rate adjustment). The segment’s growth
was adversely affected by the continued delays in opening new facilities and existing facilities
operating below planned capacity within the Company’s Biotechnology and Sterile Life Sciences
business, including underperformance at the Humacao, Puerto Rico facility. The segment’s growth
was also adversely affected by lower demand for medical communication services within the
Healthcare Marketing Services business.

This segment’s revenue growth of 25% in fiscal 2004 resulted from acquisitions and sales
momentum within the Pharmaceutical Development, Nuclear Pharmacy Services and Packaging Services
businesses. Approximately 5% of this segment’s revenue growth was due to the inclusion of
Intercare, an acquisition completed during December 2003. Intercare’s results of operations are
not included in the prior period amounts. Intercare’s operations had considerable sales momentum
after the acquisition was completed, particularly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Also, this
segment’s revenue growth benefited from the inclusion of Syncor, an acquisition that was completed
on January 1, 2003. Syncor’s results of operations are not included in the amounts for the first
half fiscal 2003. Acquisitions within this segment accounted for approximately 23% of the revenue
growth during fiscal 2004.

This segment’s fiscal 2004 revenue growth was partially dampened by a delay in startup of
commercial manufacturing of key sterile products from signed contracts as certain regulatory
inspections and product approvals were delayed in the Biotechnology and Sterile Life Sciences
business. Revenue growth was not impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations as the Company applied
constant exchange rates to translate its foreign operations’ revenue into U.S. dollars. The impact
of actual foreign exchange rate changes for translation purposes is retained within the Corporate
segment (see footnote 6 of the table in Note 18 in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”).

Clinical Technologies and Services.

The Clinical Technologies and Services revenue
growth of 41% in fiscal 2005 resulted primarily from the impact of the acquisition of Alaris and
strong revenue growth within the Clinical Services and Consulting business offset by significant
revenue declines within the Pyxis products business. The Alaris acquisition accounted for
approximately 41% of this segment’s total revenue growth for fiscal 2005. Alaris’ results of operations are not
included in the prior period amounts. The Pyxis products business experienced a revenue decline of
approximately 17% in fiscal 2005 due to the following:

•

a lengthened sales and installation cycle;

•

the delayed introduction of Pyxis MedStation® 3000, the next generation of Pyxis’ medication management system;

•

increased competition within the industry; and

•

the impact from the Audit Committee’s internal review, as more fully described in Note 1
of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” which created execution issues as the
efforts and attention of certain sales and installation teams were diverted from ordinary
business operations.

The Company believes that these adverse conditions impacted the Pyxis products business’ in
the short-term, and it remains confident in the long-term prospects for this business
due to the expected efficiencies from the formation of the Clinical Technologies and Services
segment, the greater efficiency to be realized from new installation processes and continuing
customer demand for products and services focusing on patient safety. During the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2005, the Pyxis products business established momentum for fiscal 2006 as evidenced by its
increased committed contracts primarily for its new product, Pyxis MedStation 3000.

In fiscal 2004, the Pyxis products business sold portions of its leased asset portfolio at the
direction of Corporate. The proceeds were transferred to Corporate, and the Pyxis products
business subsequently received a $21.0 million allocation from Corporate related to the estimated
interest income that would have been earned had the associated lease portfolios not been sold.
This allocation was recorded within revenue, consistent with the recording of interest income
received from sales-type leases. Effective the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Pyxis products
business did not receive this Corporate allocation. See footnote 6 to
the table in Note 18 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for further details.



The Clinical Technologies and Services segment’s revenue growth of 10% in fiscal 2004 is
reflective of the premature revenue recognition adjustment resulting from the Audit Committee’s
internal review as more fully described in Note 1 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”
Operationally, this segment’s revenue growth in fiscal 2004 included sales growth within the
medication product lines (such as the Pyxis
MedStation

®

system), the addition of new
products and 12% growth within the Clinical Services and Consulting business. This
segment was adversely affected by a softening of demand at the hospital level for Pyxis products.
As discussed above, in order to aid in the comparability of this segment’s operating results,
during fiscal 2004, the Company recorded a Corporate allocation adjustment to this segment’s
revenue of $21.0 million representing an estimate of interest income this segment would have earned
had the Company not completed sales of its lease receivables.

The Company’s overall operating earnings growth of (25)% and 7%, respectively, in

items and impairment charges are not allocated to the segments.



See Notes 4 and 21 in
“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for further information regarding the
Company’s special items and impairment charges.

Total Company operating earnings decreased 25% and increased 7% during fiscal 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The following paragraphs provide a description of the varying dynamics affecting the
total Company’s operating earnings for fiscal 2005 and 2004.

Total Company.

Total Company operating earnings decreased 25% during fiscal 2005 as a
result of declining operating earnings in each of the Company’s reportable segments. The Company’s
gross margins were dampened primarily by the following:

•

reduced vendor margins within the Pharmaceutical Distribution business driven primarily
by changes in branded pharmaceutical manufacturers’ sales and pricing practices (see the
“Overview” section for further discussion) and competitive pricing;

•

increased mix of lower-margin distribution business, competitive pricing and increased
raw material and fuel costs within the Medical Products and Services segment;

•

continued regulatory issues adversely affecting manufacturing efficiencies within the
Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment; and

•

a lengthened sales and installation cycle, new product launch delays and increased
competition within the Pyxis products business in the Clinical Technologies and Services
segment.

Total Company operating earnings were also adversely affected by the unfavorable impact
related to special items of $264.2 million in fiscal 2005. These increased costs related to the
Company’s global restructuring program associated with its One Cardinal Health initiative, the SEC
investigation and Audit Committee internal review and related matters and the integration of certain acquisitions,
which were partially offset by settlements received in antitrust and vitamin litigation (see Note 4
of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information).

In addition, the Company recorded $118.0 million for asset impairments during fiscal 2005
compared to gains of $11.5 million in fiscal 2004 (see Note 21 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements” for additional information). Total Company operating earnings for fiscal 2005 were
also impacted by the following:

Total Company operating earnings increased 7% during fiscal 2004 primarily as a result of the
Company’s revenue growth of 15% during the same time period, which yielded a gross margin increase
of 6%. Gross margins grew at a slower rate than revenue primarily as a result of the following:

•

the continued dampening effect of reduced vendor margins and competitive pricing within
the Pharmaceutical Distribution business driven by changes to its business model (see the
“Overview” section for further discussion);

•

an increased mix of lower-margin distribution business within the Medical Products and
Services segment;

•

an increased mix of lower margin business, primarily Nuclear Pharmacy Services business,
within the Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment; and

•

competitive product and pricing actions within the Clinical Technologies and Services
segment.



The overall increase in gross margin in fiscal 2004 reflects the increased contributions from
the Company’s operating segments outside of the Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services
segment, which generate higher gross margins and operating earnings (as a percentage of revenue).
These segments accounted for more than one-half of the Company’s operating earnings. Acquisitions
completed by the Company accounted for approximately 3% of the operating earnings growth.

The increases in revenue and gross margin were partially offset by a 4% increase in selling,
general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2004 as well as an increase of $17.5 million in
the Company’s special items. The overall increase in operating expenses was primarily a result of
the additional expenses resulting from acquisitions, higher personnel costs associated with overall
business growth and an increase in depreciation and amortization costs. Additionally, the Company
continued to invest in research and development and strategic initiatives that will benefit future
periods. Investments of approximately $115 million in fiscal 2004 were charged against current
operating earnings as incurred. These increases in selling, general and administrative expenses
were offset partially by a reduction versus the prior fiscal year in incentive compensation
expenses of approximately $64 million due to the performance of the Company’s consolidated
operations relative to management’s expectations and established financial performance metrics.
Such reduction affected all of the Company’s business segments. The expense increases were also
offset by adjustments of certain trade receivable reserves and lower bad debt expenses, with a
combined impact of approximately $10 million, due to changes in customer-specific credit exposures
and improvements in customer credit, billing and collection processes yielding significant
reductions in past due and uncollectible accounts. In addition, operating earnings included $11.5
million of net gains on the sale of certain businesses and assets which were recorded in
“impairment charges and other.”

Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services.

The Pharmaceutical Distribution
and Provider Services operating earnings decreased 2% during fiscal 2005 primarily as a result of
reduced vendor margins resulting from changes in branded pharmaceutical manufacturers’ sales and
pricing practices, as discussed above in the “Overview” section, and competitive pricing pressures.
As discussed above, branded pharmaceutical manufacturers have changed their sales practices by
restricting product available for purchase by pharmaceutical wholesalers. In addition, branded
pharmaceutical manufacturers’ product pricing practices have become less predictable, as the
frequency of price increases has slowed and the amounts have decreased versus historical levels.
For fiscal 2005, annualized pharmaceutical price increases were approximately 4.9% compared to 6.2%
in fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2005, the Company worked with individual branded pharmaceutical
manufacturers to define fee-for-service terms that adequately compensate the Company based on the
services being provided to such manufacturers. The initial fee-for-service transition is
essentially complete, which should help reduce earnings volatility in the segment.

This
segment’s operating earnings were also favorably impacted by $31.7 million
from changes in the LIFO reserve primarily due to price deflation within generic pharmaceutical
inventories, lower inventory levels and lower price increases related to branded pharmaceutical
inventories. Operating earnings were also impacted by improved margins from generic products and
expense control within the Pharmaceutical Distribution business which resulted in lowering selling,
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales. In addition, operating earnings
during fiscal 2005 were adversely impacted by approximately $14.7 million for inventory reserves
related to a generic manufacturer’s bankruptcy, approximately $10.0 million related to slow moving
inventory reserves and approximately $7.8 million as a result of inventory rationalization of
certain health and beauty care products.

This segment’s operating earnings decreased 2% during fiscal 2004 primarily due to reduced
vendor margins caused by the changing business model within the Pharmaceutical Distribution
business (as further described in the “Overview” section) and the impact of competitive pricing.
Other adjustments within the Pharmaceutical Distribution business that negatively impacted this
segment in fiscal 2004 included an increase in inventory valuation and vendor dispute reserves in
the fourth quarter of approximately $11.7 million and an adverse adjustment in the third quarter of
approximately $9.2 million for vendor margins. In addition, one of several aspects of the business
model transition adversely impacting Pharmaceutical Distribution’s year-over-year operating
earnings was the change in estimation of vendor margin with generic, health and beauty products and
pharmaceutical manufacturers with an impact of approximately $15.3 million. These declines were
partially offset by the following:



Medical Products and Services.

The Medical Products and Services segment’s operating
earnings decreased 3% during fiscal 2005 primarily as a result of pricing pressures related to
self-manufactured products, increased raw material and fuel costs, an increased mix of lower margin
distributed products, and competitive pricing on a large GPO contract. Operating earnings were
also adversely impacted by a $28.2 million charge for latex litigation as more fully described
within Note 11 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.” Selling, general and
administrative expenses grew 10% during fiscal 2005 primarily due to the charge for latex
litigation described above and higher personnel costs associated with the overall business growth.
These items were partially offset by revenue growth of 7%, manufacturing efficiencies, expense
control related to the Company’s global restructuring program and incremental operating earnings
from new customers.

This segment’s operating earnings growth of 11% during fiscal 2004 resulted primarily from
revenue growth of 14% during the same time period, led by sales momentum from distribution
contracts and gains within international markets. This segment also realized manufacturing
productivity improvements resulting in gross margin gains. In addition, operating earnings
benefited from lower incentive compensation expense versus prior year. This segment’s operating
earnings growth was partially dampened by the increased mix of lower margin distributed products,
competitive pricing within the industry and an increase of approximately $9 million in raw material
prices.

Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services.

The Pharmaceutical Technologies and
Services segment’s operating earnings decreased 28% during fiscal 2005 primarily due to the
continued delays in opening new facilities and existing facilities operating below planned capacity
within the Company’s Biotechnology and Sterile Life Sciences business, including underperformance
at the Humacao, Puerto Rico facility. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company
decided to close the sterile manufacturing facility in Humacao, Puerto Rico as part of its global
restructuring program. These operations had underperformed relative to Company expectations, due
in part to continued regulatory issues at the facility. The decision does not affect the Company’s
other operations in Puerto Rico or at other locations worldwide.

In addition, the operating earnings in this segment’s Healthcare Marketing Services business
were adversely affected by lower demand for medical communication services. Operating earnings
were also adversely impacted by approximately $8.0 million related to the write down of inventory
within the Biotechnology and Sterile Life Sciences business. The operating earnings declines were
partially offset by the strength of certain softgel and controlled release products, and the
year-over-year impact of acquisitions of approximately 6%. The impact of foreign exchange rates on
operating earnings did not significantly affect the fiscal 2005 growth rates above. This takes
into consideration the fiscal 2005 rate fluctuations due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar and
the fiscal 2004 constant rate adjustment. See footnote 6 to the table in Note 18 of “Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional discussion as it relates to the fiscal 2004
constant rate adjustment and the change made in fiscal 2005.

This segment’s operating earnings growth of 26% during fiscal 2004 resulted primarily from
revenue growth of 25% during the same time period, with sales momentum in the
Pharmaceutical Development, Nuclear Pharmacy Services and Packaging Services businesses showing
particular strength. This segment also benefited from acquisitions completed by the Company,
specifically Intercare and Syncor. The acquisition of Intercare was completed during the second
quarter fiscal 2004 and, therefore, its results of operations are not included in the prior period.
Also, Syncor’s results of operations are not included in the first half of fiscal 2003 because the
acquisition was completed on January 1, 2003. Acquisitions within this segment accounted for approximately 18% of the operating earnings growth during fiscal 2004.

This segment’s gross margin as a percentage of revenue was negatively impacted by the increase
in services provided by the Nuclear Pharmacy Services business, which has a lower gross margin
ratio as compared to the other businesses within this segment. The segment’s operating earnings
also benefited year-over-year by reduced incentive compensation expenses. Operating earnings
growth was dampened by the delay in startup of commercial manufacturing of certain sterile products
as discussed in this segment’s Revenue discussion. In addition, this segment’s fiscal 2004
operating earnings growth was not impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations as the Company applied
constant exchange rates to translate its foreign operations’ operating earnings into U.S. dollars.
The impact of actual foreign exchange rate changes for translation purposes was retained within the
Corporate segment in fiscal 2004. See footnote 6 to the table in Note 18 in “Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements” for additional discussion as it relates to the fiscal 2004 constant rate
adjustment and the change made in fiscal 2005.



Clinical Technologies and Services.

The Clinical Technologies and Services segment’s
operating earnings decreased 19% during fiscal 2005 primarily from decreased operating earnings
within the Pyxis products business that were not completely offset by the acquisition benefit from
the Alaris transaction. The Pyxis products business performance was impacted by:

The Alaris acquisition improved operating earnings by approximately 26% for fiscal 2005. The
results of operations from this acquisition are not included in the prior period amounts.
Operating results from Alaris, while incremental to the segment’s results year-over-year, were
adversely impacted by the effect of purchase accounting adjustments recorded during the first two
quarters of fiscal 2005. These adjustments included an inventory valuation adjustment to “fair
value” and the adjusted, higher cost inventory being sold, which adversely affected gross margins
by approximately $23.6 million.

This segment’s operating earnings growth of 6% during fiscal 2004 was impacted by the
premature revenue recognition adjustment resulting from the Audit Committee’s internal review as
more fully described in Note 1 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.” This segment’s
operating earnings growth during fiscal 2004 resulted, in part, from this segment’s revenue growth
of 10% during the same time period in conjunction with operational improvements within the Pyxis
products business and expense control within the Clinical Services and Consulting business. In
addition, this segment benefited from a reduction in receivable reserves and lower bad debt
expenses, with a combined impact of approximately $8.2 million, due to improvements in
customer-specific credit matters and general improvements in customer credit, billing and
collection procedures, resulting in significant reductions in past due and uncollectible accounts.

The segment’s fiscal 2004 operating earnings also benefited year-over-year from reduced
incentive compensation expenses and a Corporate expense allocation of $1.5 million. As mentioned
in this segment’s revenue discussion, the Company recorded, for comparative purposes, a Corporate
allocation of $21.0 million to this segment representing estimated interest income this segment would
have earned had the Company not initiated the sale of its lease receivables. See this segment’s
discussion under “Revenue” for additional information regarding this allocation entry in fiscal
2004.

Interest Expense and Other

“Interest expense and other” increased $23.1 million during fiscal 2005 primarily from
increased interest expense of $54.8 million due to increased borrowing levels and rates. The
Company manages its exposure to interest rates using various hedging strategies (see Notes 3 and 7
in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”). The $54.8 million increase in interest expense
during fiscal 2005 was partially offset by the Company recording the minority interest impact of
approximately $19.4 million for certain impairment charges within the Pharmaceutical Technologies
and Services segment’s Oral Technologies business. These impairment charges were recorded within
“impairment charges and other” on the consolidated statements of earnings during fiscal 2005. See
Note 21 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information regarding
“impairment charges and other.”

The increase in “interest expense and other” of $4.1 million during fiscal 2004 resulted
primarily from the adverse year-over year impact of foreign exchange
rates and the impact of a gain
recognized in fiscal 2003 related to a speculative interest rate swap
transaction, which were
partially offset by decreased interest expense.

Provision for Income Taxes

The provisions for income taxes relative to earnings before income taxes, discontinued
operations and cumulative effect of changes in accounting were 35.8% of pretax earnings in fiscal
2005, 31.9% in fiscal 2004 and 33.6% in fiscal 2003. The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2005
includes tax expense related to a planned repatriation of foreign earnings as provided for in the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “AJCA”) (see the following paragraph). Generally,
fluctuations in the effective tax rate are due to changes within state and foreign
effective tax rates resulting from the Company’s business mix and changes in the tax impact of
special items, which may have unique tax implications depending on the nature of the item and the
taxing jurisdiction. The Company’s effective tax rate reflects tax benefits derived from
increasing operations outside the United States, which are generally taxed at rates lower than the
U.S. statutory rate of 35%. The Company has subsidiaries operating in Puerto Rico under a tax
incentive agreement expiring in 2019, as well as a tax agreement in place with Thailand that
expires in 2013.

On October 22, 2004, the AJCA was signed into law. A provision of the AJCA creates a temporary
incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate undistributed income earned abroad by providing an
85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company determined that it will repatriate $500
million of accumulated foreign earnings in fiscal 2006 pursuant to the repatriation provisions of
the AJCA, and accordingly has recorded a related tax liability of $26.3 million as of June 30,
2005. The $500 million is the maximum repatriation available to the Company under the repatriation
provisions of the AJCA. See Note 8 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional
information.

Earnings/(Loss) from Discontinued Operations

See Note 22 in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for information on the Company’s
discontinued operations.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SENSITIVE ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact
on the presentation of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, and require use
of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management’s judgment. Because
of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates.
Below are those policies applied in preparing the Company’s consolidated financial statements that
management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. For
additional accounting policies, see Note 3 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”

Allowance for doubtful accounts.

Trade receivables are amounts owed to the Company through its
operating activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company also
provides financing to various customers. Such financing arrangements range from one to ten years
at interest rates that generally are subject to fluctuation. These financings may be
collateralized, guaranteed by third parties or unsecured. Finance notes and accrued interest
receivables are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and are included in other
assets. Extending credit terms and calculating the required allowance for doubtful accounts
involve the use of judgment by the Company’s management.

In determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, which includes general and
specific reserves, the Company reviews accounts receivable agings, industry trends, customer
financial strength, credit standing, historical write-off trends and payment history to assess the
probability of collection. The Company continuously monitors the collectibility of its receivable
portfolio by analyzing the aging of its accounts receivable, assessing credit worthiness of its
customers and evaluating the impact of changes in economic conditions that may impact credit risks.
If the frequency or severity of customer defaults increases due to changes in customers’ financial
condition or general economic conditions, the Company’s allowance for uncollectible accounts may
require adjustment.



The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of customer receivables was 2.9% and 3.3%
at June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease was a result of adjustments to certain trade
receivable reserves due to changes in customer-specific credit exposures, historical write-off
trends, and improvements in customer credit, billing and collections processes. A hypothetical
0.1% increase or decrease in the reserve as a percentage of trade receivables to the fiscal 2005
reserve would result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense of approximately $4.4 million.
The Company believes the reserve maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal year 2005 are
appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed. The total reserve at June 30,
2005 and 2004 exceeds the total Company receivable balance greater than 60 days past due at those
same dates. See Schedule II included in this Form 10-K which includes a rollforward of activity
for these allowance reserves.

Inventories.

A substantial portion of inventories
(approximately 67% in 2005 and 66% in 2004)
are stated at the lower of cost, using the LIFO method, or market.
These inventories are included within the core distribution facilities
within the Company’s Pharmaceutical Distribution business and are
primarily merchandise inventories. The remaining inventory is primarily stated at the lower of
cost, using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method, or market. If the Company had used the FIFO
method of inventory valuation, which approximates current replacement cost, inventories would have
increased $26.0 million and $57.8 million in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Below is a reconciliation of FIFO inventory to LIFO inventory:

Total inventory

$

$

Inventories recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for
excess and obsolete inventory. The Company reserves for inventory obsolescence using estimates
based on historical experiences, sales trends, specific categories of inventory and age of on-hand
inventory. If actual conditions are less favorable than the Company’s assumptions, additional
inventory reserves may be required, however these would not be expected to have a material adverse
impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Goodwill.

The Company accounts for goodwill in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” Under SFAS No. 142, purchased
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for
impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist. Accordingly, the Company does not
amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Intangible assets with finite
lives, primarily customer relationships and patents and trademarks, continue to be amortized over
their useful lives.

In conducting the impairment test, the fair value of the Company’s reporting units is compared
to its carrying amount including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, then no
impairment exists. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, further analysis is performed to
assess impairment.

The Company’s impairment analysis is based on a review of the price/earnings ratio for
publicly traded companies similar in nature, scope and size or a discounted cash flow analysis.
The use of alternative estimates, peer groups or changes in the industry could affect the estimated
fair value of the assets and potentially result in impairment. Any identified impairment would
result in adjustment to the Company’s results of operations. The Company performed its annual
impairment tests in fiscal 2005 and 2004, neither of which resulted in the recognition of any
impairment charges. See Note 17 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional
information regarding goodwill.

Business Combinations.

Assumptions and estimates are used in determining the fair value of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. A significant portion of the purchase
price in many of the Company’s acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets which require
management to use significant judgment in determining fair value. The Company typically utilizes
third-party valuation experts (“Valuation Experts”) for this process. In addition, current and
future amortization expense for such intangibles is impacted by purchase price allocations as well
as the assessment of estimated useful lives of such intangibles, excluding goodwill. The Company
believes the assets recorded and the useful lives established are appropriate based upon current
facts and circumstances.

In conjunction with the review of a transaction, the Valuation Experts assess the status of
the acquired company’s research and development projects to determine the existence of in-process
research and development (“IPR&D”). The Company has not historically recorded significant costs
related to IPR&D. However, in conjunction with the acquisition of Alaris, the Company was



required to estimate the fair value of acquired IPR&D which required selecting an appropriate
discount rate and estimating future cash flows for each project. Management also assessed the
current status of development, nature and timing of efforts to complete such development,
uncertainties and other factors when estimating the fair value. Costs were not assigned to IPR&D
unless future development was probable. Once the fair value was determined, an asset was
established and, as required by GAAP immediately written-off as a special item in the Company’s consolidated statement
of earnings. The Company recorded $12.7 million as a special item in fiscal 2004 representing an
estimate of Alaris’ IPR&D (see Note 4 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”).

Special Items.

The Company’s special items consist primarily of costs that relate to
the integration of previously acquired companies or costs of restructuring operations to improve
productivity. Integration costs from acquisitions accounted for under the pooling of interests
method have been recorded in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 94-3,
“Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an
Activity (including Certain Costs incurred in a Restructuring),” and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin
No. 100, “Restructuring and Impairment Charges.” Certain costs related to these acquisitions, such
as employee and lease terminations and other facility exit costs, were recognized at the date the
integration plan was adopted by management. Certain other integration costs that did not meet the
criteria for accrual at the commitment date have been expensed as the integration plan has been
implemented.

The costs associated with integrating acquired companies under the purchase method are
recorded in accordance with EITF Issue No. 95-3, “Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a
Purchase Business Combination.” Certain costs to be incurred by the Company, as the acquirer, such
as employee and lease terminations and other facility exit costs, are recognized at the date the
integration plan is committed to and adopted by management. Certain other integration costs that
do not meet the criteria for accrual at the commitment date are expensed as the integration plan is
implemented.

At the beginning of the third quarter fiscal 2003, the Company implemented SFAS No. 146,
“Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities,” to account for costs incurred
in restructuring activities. Under this standard, a liability for most types of exit costs is
recognized as incurred. As discussed above, the Company previously accounted for costs associated
with restructuring activities under EITF Issue No. 94-3, which required the Company to recognize a
liability for restructuring costs on the date of the commitment to an exit plan.

The majority of the special items related to acquisitions and restructurings can be classified
in one of the following categories: employee-related costs, exit costs (including lease termination
costs), asset impairments and other integration costs. Employee costs include severance and
termination benefits. Lease termination costs include lease cancellation fees, forfeited deposits
and remaining payments due under existing lease agreements less estimated sublease income. Other
facility exit costs include costs to move equipment or inventory out of a facility as well as other
costs incurred to shut down a facility. Asset impairment costs include the reduction in value of
the Company’s assets as a result of the integration or restructuring activities. Other integration
costs primarily include charges directly related to the integration plan such as consulting costs
related to information systems and employee benefit plans as well as relocation and travel costs
directly associated with the integration plan.

The Company also records settlements of significant lawsuits that are infrequent,
non-recurring or unusual in nature as special items. In addition, costs related to legal fees and
document preservation and production costs incurred in connection with the SEC investigation and
the Audit Committee internal review and related matters are also classified as special items.
See Note 4 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information.

Vendor Reserves.

In determining an appropriate vendor reserve, the Company assesses historical
experience and current outstanding claims. The Company researches and resolves contested
transactions based on discussions with vendors, Company policy and findings of research performed.
At any given time, there are outstanding items in various stages of research and resolution. The
ultimate outcome of certain claims may be different than the Company’s original estimate and may
require adjustment. However, the Company believes reserves recorded for such disputes are adequate
based upon current facts and circumstances.

Income Tax Reserves.

The Company has established an estimated liability for federal, state
and foreign income tax exposures that arise and meet the criteria for accrual under SFAS No. 5,
“Accounting for Contingencies.” This liability addresses a number of issues for which the Company
may have to pay additional taxes (and interest) when all examinations by taxing authorities are
concluded.

The Company has developed a methodology for estimating its tax liability related to such
matters and has consistently followed such methodology from period to period. The liability
amounts for such matters are based on an evaluation of the underlying facts and circumstances, a
thorough research of the technical merits of the Company’s arguments, and an assessment of the
probability of the Company prevailing in its arguments. In all cases, the Company considers
previous findings of the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. The Company
generally consults with external tax advisers in reaching its



conclusions. Amounts accrued for a particular period are not adjusted upward or downward unless a
significant change in facts or circumstances has occurred and been formally documented.

Loss Contingencies.

The Company accrues for contingencies related to litigation in accordance with
SFAS No. 5, which requires the Company to assess contingencies to determine degree of probability
and range of possible settlement. An estimated loss contingency is accrued in the Company’s
consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
amount of the settlement can be reasonably estimated. Assessing contingencies is highly subjective
and requires judgments about future events. The Company regularly reviews contingencies to
determine the adequacy of the accruals and related disclosures. The amount of ultimate settlement
may differ from these estimates.

Self Insurance Accruals.

The Company is self-insured for employee medical and dental insurance
programs. The Company had recorded liabilities totaling $26.0 million and $23.0 million for
estimated costs related to outstanding claims at June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These costs
include an estimate for expected settlements on pending claims, administrative fees and an estimate
for claims incurred but not reported. These estimates are based on the Company’s assessment of
outstanding claims, historical analysis and current payment trends. The Company records an
estimate for the claims incurred but not reported using an estimated lag period. This lag period
assumption has been consistently applied for the periods presented. If the lag period was
hypothetically adjusted by a period equal to a half month, the impact on earnings would be $5.5
million. However, the Company believes the liabilities recorded are adequate based upon current
facts and circumstances.

The Company has certain deductibles or is self-insured for various claims including
general liability, product, pharmacist professional, auto and workers’ compensation. The Company
had recorded liabilities totaling $66.4 million and $48.0 million for anticipated costs related to
general liability and workers’ compensation at June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These costs
include an estimate for expected settlements on pending claims, defense costs and an estimate for
claims incurred but not reported. These estimates are based on the Company’s assessment of
outstanding claims, historical analysis, actuarial information and current payment trends. The
amount of ultimate liability in respect to these matters may differ from these estimates.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Sources and Uses of Cash

The following table summarizes the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for fiscal
2005, 2004 and 2003:

Operating activities.

Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2005
totaled approximately $2.9 billion, an increase of $225.5 million when compared to fiscal 2004.
The increase was primarily the result of net proceeds of $550 million during the year under the
Company’s committed receivables sales facility program. See Note 10 of “Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements” for information regarding this program. Overall, the operating cash flow
benefits were adversely affected by a $478.0 million decrease in earnings from continuing
operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting. A significant portion of the earnings
decrease was due to non-cash asset impairments of approximately $223.9 million. For further
discussion of changes in the Company’s earnings from continuing operations, see the “Results of
Operations” section above.

On June 27, 2005, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the purchase of
up to $1.0 billion of its Common Shares as management deems appropriate and a dividend increase to
$0.06 per share effective the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Based on this rate, the Company
expects fiscal 2006 dividends to total $0.24 per share, a doubling of the Company’s previous annual
dividend policy of $0.12 per share. However, all future dividends are subject to approval by the
Company’s Board of Directors.

Cash provided by operating activities nearly doubled during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal
2003 primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and increased earnings from continuing
operations. The primary driver of the increase in accounts payable was the timing of payments at
fiscal year-end, as well as inventory buys executed shortly before fiscal year-end within the
Company’s Pharmaceutical Distribution business. In addition, as a result of certain non-recurring
end of year arrangements, payments to vendors in fiscal 2004 were reduced by $258 million due to
the acceleration of payments at June 30, 2003 to selected pharmaceutical vendors. Such
arrangements resulted in changes to the original payment terms with the vendors for which an



economic consideration was exchanged between the parties. The Company’s overall investment in
inventories declined during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 due primarily to the changing
business model of the Pharmaceutical Distribution business (see the “Overview” section earlier
within “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”).
For further discussion of changes in the Company’s earnings from continuing operations, see the
“Results of Operations” section. Additionally, the Company’s operating cash flow benefited by
approximately $99.3 million during fiscal 2004 due to sales of lease receivables from the Company’s
Clinical Technologies and Services segment. See Note 10 in “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements” for information regarding sales of lease receivables.

Investing activities.

Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2005, 2004 and
2003 primarily represents the Company’s use of cash to complete acquisitions which expand its role
as a provider of services to the health care industry (see “Acquisitions and Divestitures” within
“Part I, Item 1: Business” for further information regarding the Company’s acquisitions) and
capital spending to develop and enhance the Company’s infrastructure, including facilities,
information systems and other machinery and equipment. During fiscal 2005, the majority of the
cash used in investing activities related to capital spending and costs associated with the
acquisition of Alaris and Geodax. The majority of the cash used in investing activities during
fiscal 2004 was related to costs associated with the acquisitions of Alaris, Intercare and Medicap.
During fiscal 2005, cash used in investing activities included approximately $99.8 million related
to the purchase of investment securities available for sale. See Note 23 of “Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements” for information on the Company’s
investments. Cash used in investing
activities during fiscal 2005 also includes cash proceeds of approximately $47.4 million which the Company received
related to the sale of discontinued operations. See Note 22 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements” for information on the Company’s discontinued operations.

Financing activities.

The Company’s financing activities utilized cash of $1,657.1
million, $815.7 million and $712.3 million during fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Cash
used in financing activities during fiscal 2005 primarily reflects the Company’s decisions to
retire its commercial paper and certain debt assumed in the Alaris acquisition and repurchase its
Common Shares as authorized by its Board of Directors (see “Share Repurchases” below for additional
information). During fiscal 2005, the Company utilized $500.3 million to repurchase its Common
Shares. Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2004 and 2003 primarily reflects the
Company’s decision to repurchase its shares as authorized by its Board of Directors. These cash
outflows for fiscal 2004 and 2003 were partially offset by net proceeds received from the Company’s
debt facilities and proceeds received from shares issued under various employee stock plans.

International Cash

The Company’s cash balance of approximately $1.4 billion as of June 30, 2005, includes $511.8
million of cash held by its subsidiaries outside of the United States. Although the vast majority
of cash held outside the United States is available for repatriation, doing so subjects it to
United States federal income tax.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company determined that it will repatriate $500
million of accumulated foreign earnings in fiscal 2006 pursuant to the repatriation provisions of
the AJCA, and accordingly has recorded a related tax liability of $26.3 million as of June 30,
2005. The $500 million is the maximum repatriation available to the Company under the repatriation
provisions of the AJCA. See Note 8 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional
information.

Share Repurchases

During fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company’s Board of Directors approved, and management
completed, several share repurchase programs. The Company repurchased approximately $3.2 billion
of the Company’s shares, in the aggregate, through these share repurchase programs. During fiscal
2005, the Company repurchased approximately 8.8 million shares having an average price paid per
share of $56.76. During fiscal 2004, the Company repurchased approximately 24.2 million shares
having an average price paid per share of $62.03. During fiscal 2003, the Company repurchased
approximately 19.6 million shares having an average price paid per share of $60.77. The
repurchased shares were placed into treasury to be used for general corporate purposes. See
“Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” within “Part I, Item 5: Market for the Registrant’s Common
Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” for further
information regarding the Company’s most recent share repurchase program.

Capital Resources

In addition to cash, the Company’s sources of liquidity include a $1.5 billion commercial
paper program backed by $1.5 billion of bank revolving credit facilities, a $150 million extendible
commercial note program and a committed receivables sales facility program with capacity to sell
$800 million in receivables. As of June 30, 2005, the Company did not have any outstanding
borrowings from the commercial paper program. The Company also has other short-term credit
facilities of approximately $322.7 million, of which $136.0 million was outstanding as of June 30,
2005. For more information regarding the committed receivables sales facility program, see Note 10
of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”

The Company maintains two $750 million bank revolving credit facilities. These facilities are
available for general corporate



purposes; however, they are primarily used as backstop liquidity for the Company’s commercial paper
program. During the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company borrowed $500 million on its
revolving credit facilities. The proceeds of this borrowing were utilized to repay a portion of
the Company’s commercial paper and for general corporate purposes, including the establishment of
pharmaceutical inventory at the Pharmaceutical Distribution business’ National Logistics Center in
Groveport, Ohio. During the second quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company borrowed an additional $750
million on the revolving credit facilities, with the proceeds utilized primarily for the
establishment of inventory at the National Logistics Center. The Company fully repaid the $1.25
billion in outstanding balances under its bank revolving credit facilities during the second
quarter of fiscal 2005 due to stabilization in its short-term liquidity requirements in light of,
among other things, the Company having substantially completed the initial establishment of
inventory at the National Logistics Center.

During fiscal 2005, the Company retired $300 million in 4.45% Notes which matured in 2005.
Also during fiscal 2005, the Company paid off $183.6 million of the $195.3 million Senior
subordinated notes due 2011 assumed as part of the Company’s acquisition of Alaris in fiscal 2004.
The Company also amended the bond indenture to remove the restrictive covenants. The remaining
balance at June 30, 2005 of $11.6 million is callable at any time on or after July 1, 2007. Also
related to the Alaris acquisition, the Company acquired a bank credit facility consisting of a
six-year $245 million term loan and a five-year $30 million revolving credit facility. At June 30,
2004, $162.6 million was outstanding under the term loan. During fiscal 2005, the Company paid off
the $162.6 million balance under the term loan and terminated the credit facility.

During fiscal 2004, the Company retired two series of $100 million Notes which matured in
2004.

During fiscal 2001, the Company entered into an agreement to periodically sell trade
receivables to a special purpose accounts receivable and financing entity (the “Accounts Receivable
and Financing Entity”), which is exclusively engaged in purchasing trade receivables from, and
making loans to, the Company. The Accounts Receivable and Financing Entity, which is consolidated
by the Company as it is the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity, issued $250
million and $400 million in preferred variable debt securities to parties not affiliated with the
Company during fiscal 2004 and 2001, respectively. These preferred debt securities are classified
as long-term debt in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. These preferred debt securities
must be retired or redeemed by the Accounts Receivable and Financing Entity before the Company, or
its creditors, can have access to the Accounts Receivable and Financing Entity’s receivables.

From time to time, the Company considers and engages in acquisition transactions in order to
expand its role as a leading provider of services to the health care industry. The Company
evaluates possible candidates for merger or acquisition and intends to take advantage of
opportunities to expand its role as a provider of services to the health care industry through all
its reporting segments. If additional transactions are entered into or consummated, the Company
may need to enter into funding arrangements for such mergers or acquisitions.

The Company currently believes that, based upon existing cash, operating cash flows, available
capital resources (as discussed above) and other available market transactions, it has adequate
capital resources at its disposal to fund currently anticipated capital expenditures, business
growth and expansion, contractual obligations and current and projected debt service requirements,
including those related to business combinations.

Debt Ratings/Covenants

The Company’s senior debt credit ratings from S&P, Moody’s and Fitch are BBB, Baa3 and BBB+,
respectively, the commercial paper ratings are A-3, P-3 and F2, respectively, and the ratings
outlooks are “negative,” “stable” and “negative,” respectively. Although a ratings downgrade by
any of the rating agencies will not trigger an acceleration of any of the Company’s indebtedness,
further reductions in the Company’s credit ratings could negatively impact its ability to access
capital as well as its ability to issue additional debt securities at currently available interest
rates.

The Company’s various borrowing facilities and long-term debt, except for the preferred debt
securities as discussed below, are free of any financial covenants other than minimum net worth
which cannot fall below $4.1 billion at any time. As of June 30, 2005, the Company was in
compliance with this covenant.

The Company’s preferred debt securities contain a minimum adjusted tangible net worth covenant
(adjusted tangible net worth cannot fall below $3.0 billion) and certain financial ratio covenants.
As of June 30, 2005, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. A breach of any of these
covenants would be followed by a grace period during which the Company may discuss remedies with
the security holders, or extinguish the securities, without causing an event of default.

Interest Rate and Currency Risk Management

The Company uses forward currency exchange contracts, currency options and interest rate swaps
to manage its exposure to cash flow variability. The Company also uses foreign currency forward
contracts and interest rate swaps to protect the value of its



existing foreign currency assets and liabilities and the value of its debt. See Notes 3 and 7 of
“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for information regarding the use of financial
instruments and derivatives, including foreign currency hedging instruments. As a matter of
policy, the Company rarely engages in “speculative” transactions involving derivative financial
instruments. During fiscal 2003, the Company entered into one speculative interest rate swap
transaction resulting in a gain of approximately $6.7 million. This gain was recorded in interest
expense and other in the consolidated statement of earnings.

Contractual Obligations

As of June 30, 2005, the Company’s contractual obligations, including estimated payments due
by period, are as follows:

Purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is
enforceable and legally binding and specifying all significant terms, including: fixed or
minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and
approximate timing of the transaction. The purchase obligation amounts disclosed above
represent estimates of the minimum for which the Company is obligated and the time period in
which cash outflows will occur. Purchase orders and authorizations to purchase that involve
no firm commitment from either party are excluded from the above table. In addition,
contracts that can be unilaterally cancelled with no termination fee or with proper notice are
excluded from the Company’s total purchase obligations except for the amount of the
termination fee or the minimum amount of goods that must be purchased during the requisite
notice period. The significant amount disclosed within fiscal 2006, as compared to other
periods, primarily represents obligations to purchase inventories within the Pharmaceutical
Distribution and Provider Services segment.

Recent
Developments.

In late August 2005, Hurricane Katrina devastated parts
of Louisiana, Mississippi and the Gulf Coast of the United States. The
Company sustained limited damage to its facilities in the region and
at the time of the filing of this Form 10-K, all major facilities in
the region were operational. The damage sustained to the
Company’s facilities will not materially impact its financial
condition or results of operations. The Company has made monetary and
product donations to the hurricane relief efforts which will not
have a material impact on its
financial condition or results of operations.

See Note 24 in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for discussion of
additional subsequent events after June 30, 2005.



Item 7a: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

The Company is exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations as a result of certain market
risks. These market risks primarily relate to foreign exchange, interest rate, and commodity
related changes. The Company maintains a comprehensive hedging program to manage volatility
related to these market exposures. It employs operational, economic, and derivative financial
instruments in order to mitigate risk. See Notes 3 and 7 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements” for further discussion regarding the Company’s use of derivative instruments.

Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitivity.

By nature of the Company’s global operations, it is exposed to
cash flow and earnings fluctuations resulting from foreign exchange rate variation. These
exposures are transactional and translational in nature. Since the Company manufactures and sells
its products throughout the world, its foreign currency risk is diversified. Principal drivers of
this diversified foreign exchange exposure include the European euro, Mexican peso, British pound,
Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and Thai bhat.

Transactional Exposure

The Company’s transactional exposure arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services
in currencies other than the functional currency of the parent or its subsidiaries. As part of its
risk management program, at the end of each fiscal year the Company performs a sensitivity analysis
on its forecasted transactional exposure for the upcoming fiscal year. This analysis assumes a
hypothetical 10% strengthening or weakening of the U.S dollar. Included in the analysis is the
estimated impact of its hedging program, which mitigates the Company’s transactional exposure. At
June 30, 2005 and 2004, the Company had hedged approximately 52% of its transactional exposures.
The following table summarizes the analysis as it relates to the Company’s transactional exposure:

Translational Exposure

The Company also has exposure related to the translation of financial statements of its
foreign divisions into U.S dollars, the functional currency of the parent. It performs a similar
analysis as described above related to this translational exposure. The Company does not typically
hedge any of its translational exposure and no hedging impact was included in the Company’s
analysis at June 30, 2005 and 2004. The following table summarizes the Company’s translational
exposure and the impact of a hypothetical 10% strengthening or weakening in the U.S dollar:

$

$

20.8

(1)

Impact of a hypothetical 10% strengthening or weakening of the U.S dollar.

Interest Rate Sensitivity.

The Company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a
result of its borrowing and investing activities to maintain liquidity and fund business
operations. The nature and amount of the Company’s long-term and short-term debt can be expected
to fluctuate as a result of business requirements, market conditions and other factors. The
Company’s policy is to manage exposures to interest rates using a mix of fixed and floating rate
debt as deemed appropriate by management. The Company utilizes interest rate swap instruments to
mitigate its exposure to interest rate movements.

As part of its risk management program, the Company annually performs a sensitivity analysis
on its forecasted exposure to interest rates for the following fiscal year. This analysis assumes
a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates. At June 30, 2005 and 2004, the potential increase or
decrease in interest expense under this analysis as a result of this hypothetical change was $4.6
million and $6.4 million, respectively.



Commodity Price Sensitivity.

The Company purchases certain commodities for use in its
manufacturing processes, which include rubber, heating oil, diesel fuel and polystyrene. The
Company typically purchases these commodities at market prices, and as a result, is affected by
price fluctuations. As part of its risk management program, the Company performs sensitivity
analysis on its forecasted commodity exposure for the following fiscal year. At June 30, 2005 and
2004, the Company had not hedged any of these exposures. The table below summarizes the Company’s
analysis of these forecasted commodity exposures and a hypothetical 10% fluctuation in commodity
prices as of June 30, 2005 and 2004:

Impact of a hypothetical 10% change in commodity market prices.

The Company also has exposure to certain energy related commodities, including natural gas and
electricity through its normal course of business. These exposures result primarily from operating
the Company’s distribution, manufacturing, and corporate facilities. In certain deregulated
markets, the Company from time to time enters into long-term purchase contracts to supply these
items at a specific price.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and the

Board of Directors of Cardinal Health, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cardinal Health, Inc. and
subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements
of earnings, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
June 30, 2005. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
Item 15(a)(2). These consolidated financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements and the schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2005 and 2004,
and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended June 30, 2005, in conformity with the U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all
material respects the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its
method of recognizing cash discounts effective at the beginning of fiscal year 2004.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of June 30, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated September 9, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

CARDINAL HEALTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. ACCOUNTING INVESTIGATIONS AND RESTATEMENT

The
following is a summary of the previously reported governmental and internal
investigations regarding Cardinal Health, Inc. (the “Company”) and related matters. This summary
updates the information provided in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2004 (the “2004 Form 10-K”) and in its Quarterly Reports for fiscal 2005. The 2004
Form 10-K reflected certain conclusions reached by the Company’s
Audit Committee and restated and reclassified the
Company’s consolidated  financial statements for fiscal 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 and the first three quarters of
fiscal 2004. As discussed more fully below and as previously reported, settlement discussions
have recently commenced with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) regarding
resolution of its investigation with respect to the Company, and the Company has recorded a reserve
of $25 million for fiscal 2005 in respect of the SEC investigation.

As
previously
reported, in October 2003, the SEC initiated an informal inquiry regarding the Company. The SEC’s
initial request sought historical financial and related information including but not limited to
the accounting treatment of certain recoveries from vitamin manufacturers. In connection with the
SEC’s informal inquiry, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company commenced its
own internal review in April 2004, assisted by independent counsel. On May 6, 2004, the Company
was notified that the SEC had converted the informal inquiry into a formal investigation. On June
21, 2004, as part of the SEC’s formal investigation, the Company received an additional SEC
subpoena that included a request for the production of documents relating to revenue
classification, and the methods used for such classification, in the Company’s Pharmaceutical
Distribution business as either “Operating Revenue” or “Bulk Deliveries to Customer Warehouses and
Other.” In addition, the Company learned that the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New
York had also commenced an inquiry with respect to the Company that the Company understands relates
to the revenue classification issue. On October 12, 2004, in connection with the SEC’s formal
investigation, the Company received a subpoena from the SEC requesting the production of documents
relating to compensation information for specific current and former employees and officers. The
Company was notified in April 2005 that certain current and former employees and directors received
subpoenas from the SEC requesting the production of documents. The subject matter of these
requests is consistent with the subject matter of the subpoenas the Company had previously received
from the SEC. The Company continues to respond to the SEC’s investigation and the Audit
Committee’s internal review and provide all information required.

During September and October 2004, the Audit Committee reached certain conclusions with
respect to findings from its internal review. These conclusions regarding certain items that
impact revenue and earnings related to four primary areas of focus: (1) classification of sales to
customer warehouses between “Operating Revenue” and “Bulk Deliveries to Customer Warehouses and
Other” within the Company’s Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services segment; (2)
disclosure of the Company’s practice, in certain reporting periods, of accelerating its receipt and
recognition of cash discounts earned from suppliers for prompt payment; (3) timing of revenue
recognition within the Company’s former Automation and Information Services segment; and (4)
certain balance sheet reserve and accrual adjustments that had been identified in the internal
review. In connection with these conclusions, the Audit Committee determined that the consolidated
financial statements of the Company with respect to fiscal 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003, as well as
the first three quarters of fiscal 2004, should be restated to reflect the conclusions from its
internal review to date. These restatements were reflected in the 2004 Form 10-K.

Following the conclusions reached by the Audit Committee in September and October 2004, the
Audit Committee began the task of assigning responsibility for the financial statement matters
described above which were reflected in the 2004 Form 10-K and in January 2005 took disciplinary
actions with respect to the Company’s employees who it determined bore responsibility for these
matters, other than with respect to the accounting treatment of certain recoveries from vitamin
manufacturers for which there is a separate Board committee internal review (discussed below). The
disciplinary actions ranged from terminations or resignations of employment to required repayments
of some or all of fiscal 2003 bonuses from certain employees to letters of reprimand. These
disciplinary actions affected senior financial and managerial personnel, as well as other
personnel, at the corporate level and in the four business segments. None of the Company’s current
corporate executive officers (who are identified under the heading “Executive Officers of the
Company” following Item 4 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2005) were the subject of disciplinary action by the Audit Committee. In connection with
the determinations made by the Audit Committee, the Company’s
former controller resigned effective
February 15, 2005. The Audit Committee has completed its determinations of responsibility for the
financial statement matters described above which were reflected in the 2004 Form 10-K, although
responsibility for matters relating to the Company’s accounting treatment of certain recoveries
from vitamin manufacturers has been addressed by a separate committee of the Board. The Audit
Committee internal review is substantially complete.

In connection with the SEC’s formal investigation, a committee of the Board of Directors, with
the assistance of independent



CARDINAL HEALTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

counsel,
separately initiated an internal review to assign responsibility for matters
relating to the Company’s accounting treatment of certain recoveries from vitamin manufacturers. In the 2004 Form 10-K, as part of the Audit Committee’s
internal review, the Company reversed its previous recognition of estimated recoveries from vitamin
manufacturers for amounts overcharged in prior years and recognized the income from such recoveries
as a special item in the period in which cash was received from the manufacturers. The SEC staff
had previously advised the Company that, in its view, the Company did not have an appropriate basis
for recognizing the income in advance of receiving the cash. In August 2005, the separate Board
committee reached certain conclusions with respect to findings from its internal review and
determined that no additional disciplinary actions were required
beyond the disciplinary actions already taken by the Audit Committee,
as described above. The separate Board committee
internal review is substantially complete.

Settlement discussions have recently commenced with the SEC regarding resolution of
its investigation with respect to the Company. While these discussions are ongoing, there can be
no assurance that the Company’s efforts to resolve the investigation with respect to the Company
will be successful, and the Company cannot predict the timing or outcome of these matters or the
terms of any such resolution. As a result of the initiation of these discussions, the Company
recorded a reserve of $25 million for its fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 in respect of the SEC
investigation. Unless and until the SEC investigation is resolved, there can be no assurance that
the amount reserved by the Company for this investigation will be sufficient and that a larger
amount will not be required. Therefore, this reserve will be reviewed on a quarterly basis and
adjusted to the extent that the Company determines it is necessary.

The conclusions of the Audit Committee’s internal review with respect to financial statement
matters were set forth in Notes 1 and 2 of “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements”
included in the 2004 Form 10-K. More information with respect to the
prior conclusions of the Audit Committee’s
internal review and the impact of the reclassification and
restatement adjustments on the reporting periods
discussed in this Form 10-K is set forth below.

Revenue Impact:

Classification of Sales To Customer Warehouses Between “Operating Revenue” and
“Bulk Deliveries to Customer Warehouses and Other” Within the Company’s Pharmaceutical Distribution
and Provider Services Segment

As presented historically since 1998, the Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services
segment’s revenue was classified into two categories (“Operating Revenue” and “Bulk Deliveries to
Customer Warehouses and Other”). The “Bulk Deliveries to Customer Warehouses and Other” category
had historically included revenue arising from sales where the Company ordered pharmaceutical
product in bulk on behalf of a specific warehousing customer and
either the manufacturer shipped the
product directly to the customer’s warehouse or the product was shipped to the customer’s warehouse
by the Company shortly after it was received by the Company and was not put into the Company’s
inventory (in either case, “Bulk Revenue”). For all Bulk Revenue, the product was shipped to the
customer in the same bulk form in which it was received by the Company from the manufacturers.
From November 2001 through March 2004, the Company followed an internal policy for distinguishing
between Operating Revenue and Bulk Revenue based on how long the product was in the Company’s
possession prior to being shipped to customers. If the product was in the possession of the
Company for more than 24 hours prior to being shipped to customers, then, regardless of other
characteristics of the transaction or the reason for the product being held more than 24 hours, the
sale of that product was deemed to be Operating Revenue. The Company’s internal policy also
provided that customer orders for bulk shipments filled from inventory within the Company’s
warehouse were deemed to be Operating Revenue. Based on results of the internal review conducted
by the Audit Committee, the Company concluded that certain bulk shipments ordered by customers were
intentionally held beyond 24 hours so that, pursuant to the internal policy, such shipments were
classified as Operating Revenue in four quarters within fiscal 2003 and 2002. The impact of this
practice was not previously quantified and disclosed as part of the Company’s reported Operating
Revenue. The improper classification between Bulk Revenue and Operating Revenue had no impact on
the Company’s previously reported total revenue or operating or net earnings for these periods.
See Note 2 for further discussion of these matters.

Undisclosed Earnings Impact:

Disclosure of the Company’s Practice, in Certain Reporting Periods,
of Accelerating Its Receipt and Recognition of Cash Discounts Earned From Suppliers for Prompt
Payment

Historically, the Company recognized cash discounts as a reduction of cost of products sold
primarily upon payment of vendor invoices. Cash discounts are discounts the Company receives from
some vendors for timely payment of invoices. The Company had a practice of accelerating payment of
vendor invoices at the end of certain reporting periods in order to accelerate the recognition of
cash discounts, which had the effect of improving operating results for those reporting periods.
Although the effect of these accelerated payments were properly included in the Company’s reported
earnings, the impact of this acceleration practice was not separately quantified and disclosed in
the periods in which the Company benefited from this practice. The net increase/(decrease) in net
earnings as a result of this practice for fiscal 2004 and 2003 is as follows:

these corrections resulted in an increase/(decrease) of $0.3 million,
$0.7 million and ($3.4) million for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002
respectively.

During the fourth quarter fiscal 2004, the Company changed its accounting method for
recognizing cash discounts from recognition primarily upon payment of vendor invoices to recording
cash discounts as a component of inventory cost and recognizing such discounts as a reduction to
cost of products sold upon sale by the Company of the purchased inventory. The Company believes
the change in accounting method provides a more objectively determinable method of recognizing cash
discounts and a better matching of inventory cost to revenue. This change was retroactively
effective to the beginning of fiscal 2004. As a result, the Company restated its previously
reported fiscal 2004 quarterly results to reflect this change. See Note 16 below for further
discussion of this change in accounting.

Revenue and Earnings Impact:

Timing of Revenue Recognition Within the Company’s Former Automation
and Information Services Segment

Within its former Automation and Information Services segment (which is now included in the
Clinical Technologies and Services segment; see Note 18 below), the Company’s revenue recognition
policy for equipment systems installed at a customer’s site is to recognize revenue once the
Company’s installation obligations are complete and the equipment is functioning according to the
material specifications of the user’s manual and the customer has accepted the equipment as
evidenced by signing an equipment confirmation document. As described in the 2004 Form 10-K, the
Company learned of concerns during the Audit Committee’s internal review that some equipment
confirmation documents were being executed prior to the time when installations were complete and
revenue could be recognized. In order to assess the implications of any premature execution of
equipment confirmations and corresponding revenue recognition, the Audit Committee review included
the following:

This inquiry indicated some equipment confirmations, particularly in some sales regions, had
been prematurely executed by customers at the request of certain Company employees, including
certain situations where inducements to the customer (such as deferral of payments) were offered to
obtain premature execution. As a result, it was determined that a material weakness in the
Company’s internal controls existed with respect to the timing of revenue recognition within this
segment. The Company concluded the following in connection with its review of premature revenue
recognition:

•

equipment confirmations in the last several weeks of a quarter were the most likely to
be executed early by the customer due to requests from certain Company employees;

•

no evidence was discovered of fictitious sales being recorded by the Company;

•

revenue was recognized early primarily by one quarter; in most cases, installations were
completed in the following quarter; and

•

the impact on the Company’s financial results was not deemed material for any individual
quarter or annually.

The net impact of this premature revenue recognition was assessed as of June 30, 2004 based
upon interviews of customers representing a substantial percentage of the segment’s end of quarter
reported revenue. As a result, it was determined that approximately 10.8% of revenue in the last
10 days of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 was being recognized prematurely (based upon an
extrapolation). The Company recorded an $8.3 million reduction of revenue and a $5.3 million
reduction of operating earnings during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 to adjust for premature
revenue recognition that was determined to have occurred within that
quarter. This revenue and
operating earnings were recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 upon completion of the
applicable installation process.



CARDINAL HEALTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company does not maintain accounting records that allow it to determine the precise impact
of this matter on prior quarters. However, during the investigation there was sufficient data
accumulated independent of the accounting systems to estimate the impact using a variety of
methods. These estimation methods were utilized solely to test the materiality of prior periods
and are not necessarily indicative of what the actual results would have been. If the results of
the June 30, 2004 interviews were applied (i.e., utilizing the 10.8% exception rate) the net
increase/(decrease) in revenue and operating earnings for the first three quarters of fiscal 2004
and fiscal 2003, and the related percentage of the former Automation and Information Services
segment’s reported amounts, would have been as follows:

Using different estimation methods than the methodology used to derive the table above, the
percentage change in operating earnings for the periods noted above would range from less than 1%
to a high of 6.6%. There were two quarters in which the estimated impact was over 5% (first
quarter of fiscal 2003 negative impact of 6.6% and third quarter of fiscal 2004 negative impact of
5.5%). The Company believes that the impact of the adjustments resulting from the estimation
methods are not material to previously reported results because such estimated adjustments do not
distort trends in revenue and operating earnings growth that were previously reported and would not
alter the Company’s previous disclosures related to the former Automation and Information Services
segment.

Given the premature revenue recognition practices identified at June 30, 2004, the Company
completed a similar review of the installation process during the first quarter of fiscal 2005,
including interviews with selected customers representing a substantial percentage of the former
Automation and Information Services segment’s end of quarter reported revenue. While the results
from the interviews performed in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 suggested a lower incidence of
premature revenue recognition than at June 30, 2004, the sample of customers interviewed was more
limited than was completed at June 30, 2004. In addition, the Company’s efforts to improve its
system of internal controls were in the early stages. As a result, the Company in conjunction with
the Audit Committee decided to adjust reported revenue utilizing the same error rate, 10.8%, as was
utilized at June 30, 2004. Utilizing the same 10.8% assumed error rate, the Company recorded a
$4.2 million reduction in revenue and a $2.5 million reduction in operating earnings during the
first quarter of fiscal 2005. This adjustment is exclusive of the recognition of the $8.3 million
in revenue and $5.3 million of operating earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 described
above.

Following the completion of the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company reiterated the
revenue recognition policy for equipment systems installed at a customer’s site for its former
Automation and Information Services segment, and instructed all employees to strictly adhere to
this policy. The Company continues to implement corrective actions in response to these findings
regarding its revenue recognition practices within its former Automation and Information Services
segment, as described in Note 1 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in the 2004 Form
10-K. During the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2005, the Company’s internal audit
function completed a review of revenue recognition practices associated with the equipment
installation process for its former Automation and Information Services segment, including
interviews with selected customers and site visits to related customer locations representing a
substantial percentage of the former Automation and Information Services segment’s end of quarter
reported revenue. The results of the interviews and site visits performed by the internal audit
function during the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2005 did not indicate any
additional occurrences of premature revenue recognition as described above.

Previously Restated Earnings:

Certain Balance Sheet Reserve and Accrual Adjustments

The Audit Committee’s internal review included a review to determine if period-end adjustments
to balance sheet reserve accounts and other accruals recorded in fiscal 2000 through fiscal 2004
were properly recorded in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Based
upon the Audit Committee’s internal review, the Company determined that there were various
situations where (a) the amount of reserve, (b) the timing of reserve recognition, or (c) the
timing of reserve adjustments could not be substantiated or was in error. As a result, as described in the 2004 Form 10-K, the consolidated financial
statements for certain prior fiscal quarters and years were restated by the Company.

The
types of balance sheet reserves and accrual adjustments that were
previously restated consist of the
following:

1. Errors arising from misapplication of GAAP. These errors primarily include (a) reductions in
reserve accounts made in periods subsequent to the period in which the excess had been
identified by the Company, (b) a last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) inventory adjustment, and (c) a
change in accounting policy for dividends to recognition when declared versus when paid. The
net impact of these errors on the first three quarters of fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 is
reflected in the table below.

2. Errors made in previous periods which were identified and appropriately corrected in a
subsequent period when discovered. These items were not reported as prior period corrections at
the time of their discovery because they were deemed immaterial. However, the
Company restated its prior consolidated financial statements to correct for such items
identified during the internal review. The net impact of these errors on the first three
quarters of fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 is reflected in the table below.

The following table summarizes the restatement impact on previously reported net earnings as
defined above for fiscal 2004 and 2003:

Period Errors

As the Company continued to respond to the SEC’s investigation and the Audit Committee’s internal
review, the Company identified errors in certain restatement adjustments reflected in the 2004 Form
10-K. The impact of the individual and consolidated adjustments on operating earnings, net
earnings and the related per share amounts was immaterial for all periods presented. The tables
above have not been adjusted to reflect the impact of these errors. Had the tables been adjusted,
the total restatements would have increased/(decreased) by $0.1 million, $(0.6) million, $0.8
million and $(0.5) million for the first, second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2003,
respectively. Net earnings would have increased/(decreased), as a result of these errors for
fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001 by $(0.2) million, $(0.5) million and $2.8 million, respectively.
There was no impact on the previously reported earnings per share for any of the periods effected.
In addition, the above errors would also decrease the Company’s June 30, 2000 retained earnings by
$1.1 million.



CARDINAL HEALTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The SEC investigation, the U.S. Attorney inquiry, the Audit Committee internal review and the
separate Board committee internal review remain ongoing, although the
Audit Committee internal review and the separate Board committee
internal review are substantially complete. While the Company is continuing in its efforts to respond to these inquiries and provide all information
required, the Company cannot predict the outcome of the SEC investigation, the U.S. Attorney
inquiry, the Audit Committee internal review or the separate Board committee internal review. The
outcome of the SEC investigation, the U.S. Attorney inquiry and any related legal and
administrative proceedings could include the institution of administrative, civil injunctive or
criminal proceedings involving the Company and/or current or former Company employees, officers
and/or directors, as well as the imposition of fines and other penalties, remedies and sanctions.

In addition, there can be no assurance
that additional restatements will not be required, that
the historical consolidated financial statements included in the 2004 Form 10-K, the Forms 10-Q for
the quarterly periods during fiscal 2005, or this Form 10-K will not change or require amendment,
or that additional disciplinary actions will not be required in such circumstances. As the SEC’s
investigation, the U.S. Attorney’s inquiry and the Audit Committee’s internal review continue, the
Audit Committee may identify new issues, or make additional findings if it receives additional
information, that may have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and the
scope of the restatements described in the 2004 Form 10-K, the Forms 10-Q for the quarterly periods
during fiscal 2005, and this Form 10-K.

2. RECLASSIFICATIONS

As presented historically since 1998, the Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services
segment’s revenue was classified into two categories (“Operating Revenue” and “Bulk Deliveries to
Customer Warehouses and Other”). The “Bulk Deliveries to Customer Warehouses and Other” category
had historically included revenue arising from sales where the Company ordered pharmaceutical
product in bulk on behalf of a specific warehousing customer and
either the manufacturer shipped the
product directly to the customer’s warehouse or the product was shipped to the customer’s warehouse
by the Company shortly after it was received by the Company and was not put into the Company’s
inventory (in either case, “Bulk Revenue”). For all Bulk Revenue, the product was shipped to the
customer in the same bulk form in which it was received by the Company from the manufacturers.
From November 2001 through March 2004, the Company followed an internal policy for distinguishing
between Operating Revenue and Bulk Revenue based on how long the product was in the Company’s
possession prior to being shipped to customers. If the product was in the possession of the
Company for more than 24 hours prior to being shipped to customers, then, regardless of other
characteristics of the transaction or the reason for the product being held more than 24 hours, the
sale of that product was deemed to be Operating Revenue. The Company’s internal policy also
provided that customer orders for bulk shipments filled from inventory within the Company’s
warehouse were deemed to be Operating Revenue. Based on results of the internal review conducted
by the Audit Committee, the Company concluded that certain bulk shipments ordered by customers were
intentionally held beyond 24 hours so that, pursuant to the internal policy, such shipments were
classified as Operating Revenue in two quarters within fiscal 2003. The impact of this practice
was not previously quantified and disclosed as part of the Company’s reported Operating Revenue.
The improper classification between Bulk Revenue and Operating Revenue had no impact on the
Company’s previously reported total revenue or operating or net earnings for these periods.

The following table shows the amount of Bulk Revenue that was estimated to be improperly
classified as Operating Revenue in the manner described above and the impact from adjusting each of
Bulk Revenue and Operating Revenue for the periods in which these improper classifications
occurred:

The Company decided to aggregate revenue classes within its 2004 Form 10-K. “Operating
Revenue” and “Bulk Deliveries to Customer Warehouses and Other” have been combined for all periods
presented so that total revenue and total cost of products sold are presented as single amounts in
the consolidated statements of earnings. These reclassifications have no effect on previously
reported total revenue, related cost of products sold, operating earnings, net earnings or earnings
per share. Beginning with the 2004 Form 10-K, information concerning the portion of the Company’s
revenue that arises from Bulk Revenue is discussed in the Company’s “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Certain other insignificant reclassifications were made to conform prior period amounts to the
current presentation.

3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Company is a leading provider of products and services supporting the health care industry
and helping health care providers and manufacturers improve the efficiency and quality of health
care. As of June 30, 2005, the Company conducted its business within the following four business
segments: Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services; Medical Products and Services;
Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services; and Clinical Technologies and Services. See Note 18 for
information related to the Company’s business segments.

Basis of Presentation.

The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts
of all majority-owned subsidiaries. In addition, all significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.

During fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company completed several acquisitions that were
accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The consolidated financial statements
include the results of operations from each of these business combinations as of the date of
acquisition. Additional disclosure related to the Company’s acquisitions is provided in Note 4.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes. Such estimates include, but are not limited to,
inventory valuation, allowance for doubtful accounts, goodwill and intangible asset impairment,
vendor reserves and restructuring charge reserves. Actual amounts may differ from these estimated
amounts.

Cash Equivalents.

The Company considers all liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three
months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying value of these cash equivalents approximates
fair value. Cash payments for interest were $127.4 million, $112.7 million and $115.3 million and
cash payments for income taxes were $535.8 million, $566.3 million and $256.8 million for fiscal
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. See Note 4 for additional information regarding non-cash
investing activities related to certain recent acquisitions.

Short-term Investments.

The Company’s short-term investments include approximately $79.8 million
in tax-exempt variable demand notes and approximately $20.0 million in tax-exempt auction rate
securities. These short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale on the Company’s
consolidated balance sheet. The Company’s investments in these securities are recorded at cost,
which approximates fair market value due to their variable interest rates. See Note 23 for
additional information regarding short-term investments.

Receivables.

Trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to the Company through its
pharmaceutical and other health care service activities and are presented net of an allowance for
doubtful accounts of $109.8 million and $119.1 million at June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. An
account is considered past due on the first day after its due date. In accordance with contract
terms, the Company generally has the ability to charge a customer service fees or higher prices if
an account is considered past due. The Company continuously monitors past due accounts and
establishes appropriate reserves to cover potential losses. The Company will write-off any amounts
deemed uncollectible against an established bad debt reserve.

The Company provides financing to various customers. Such financing arrangements range from
one year to ten years, at interest rates that generally are subject to fluctuation. Interest
income on these accounts is recognized by the Company as it is earned. The financings may be
collateralized, guaranteed by third parties or unsecured. Finance notes and accrued interest
receivables were $57.5 million and $35.4 million at June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively (current
portions were $40.5 million and $17.2 million, respectively), and are included in other assets.
These amounts are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $4.4 million and $4.1
million at June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The Company has formed special purpose entities with the sole purpose of buying receivables or
sales-type leases from various legal entities of the Company and selling those receivables or
sales-type leases to certain multi-seller conduits administered by banks or other third-party
investors. See Note 10 for additional disclosure regarding off-balance sheet financing.

During fiscal 2001, the Company entered into an agreement to periodically sell trade
receivables to a special purpose accounts receivable and financing entity (the “Accounts Receivable
and Financing Entity”) which is exclusively engaged in purchasing trade receivables from, and
making loans to, the Company. The Accounts Receivable and Financing Entity, which is consolidated
by the Company, issued $250 million and $400 million in preferred variable debt securities to
parties not affiliated with the Company



CARDINAL HEALTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

during fiscal 2004 and 2001, respectively.
These preferred debt securities must be retired or
redeemed by the Accounts Receivable and Financing Entity before the Company, or its creditors, can
have access to the Accounts Receivable and Financing Entity’s receivables. See Note 6 for
additional information.

Inventories.

A substantial portion of inventories (approximately 67% in 2005 and 66% in
2004) are stated at the lower of cost, using the LIFO method, or
market. These inventories are included within the Company’s
Pharmaceutical Distribution business and are
primarily merchandise inventories. The remaining inventory is primarily stated at the lower of
cost, using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method, or market. If the Company had used the FIFO
method of inventory valuation, which approximates current replacement cost, inventories would have
been higher than the LIFO method reported at June 30, 2005 and 2004 by $26.0 million and $57.8
million, respectively.

Goodwill and Other Intangibles.

The Company accounts for purchased goodwill and other intangible
assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” Under SFAS No. 142, purchased goodwill and intangible
assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized, but instead are tested for impairment at
least annually. Intangible assets with finite lives, primarily customer relationships and patents
and trademarks, continue to be amortized over their useful lives. The Company performed its annual
impairment test in fiscal 2005 and 2004, neither of which resulted in the recognition of any
impairment charges. See Note 17 for additional disclosure regarding goodwill and other intangible
assets.

Property and Equipment.

Property and equipment are primarily stated at cost. Depreciation expense
for financial reporting purposes is primarily computed using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, including capital lease assets which are depreciated over the
terms of their respective leases. The Company uses the following range of useful lives for its
property and equipment categories: buildings and improvements – 1 to 50 years; machinery and
equipment – 3 to 20 years; furniture and fixtures – 7 years. Depreciation expense was $337.8
million, $278.0 million and $249.0 million for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
Company expenses repairs and maintenance expenditures as incurred. The Company capitalizes
interest on long-term fixed asset projects using a rate of 5.0%, which approximates the Company’s
weighted average interest rate on long-term debt. The amount of capitalized interest within the
Corporate entity was immaterial for all fiscal years presented.

Other Accrued Liabilities.

Other accrued liabilities represent various obligations of the Company
including certain accrued operating expenses and taxes payable. For the fiscal years ended June
30, 2005 and 2004, the largest component of other accrued liabilities was deferred tax liabilities
of approximately $730.8 million and $530.2 million, respectively. Other significant components of
other accrued liabilities were current taxes payable and employee compensation and related benefit
accruals. For fiscal 2005 and 2004, current taxes payable were $209.8 million and $286.4 million,
respectively, while employee compensation and related benefit accruals were $381.3 million and
$310.8 million, respectively.

Revenue Recognition.

In accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 104, “Revenue
Recognition,” the Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
product delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered, the price is fixed or
determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Revenue is recognized net of sales returns
and allowances.

Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services

This segment records distribution revenue when title transfers to its customers and the
business has no further obligation to provide services related to such merchandise. This revenue
is recorded net of sales returns and allowances (see “Sales Returns and Allowances” below for
further information).

This segment defines Bulk Revenue as transactions with one or more of the following
characteristics:

•

deliveries to customer warehouses whereby the Company acts as an intermediary in the
ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products;

•

delivery of products to the customer in the same form as the products are received from the manufacturer;

•

warehouse to customer warehouse or process center deliveries; or

•

deliveries to customers in large or high volume full case quantities.

Bulk revenue is recorded when title transfers to its customers and the business has no further
obligation to provide services related to such merchandise. See Notes 1 and 2 for a further
discussion of Bulk Revenue.



CARDINAL HEALTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Revenue
for deliveries to customer warehouses whereby the Company acts as an
intermediary in the ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products is recorded gross in accordance with
Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) 99-19, “Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an
Agent.” This revenue is recorded on a gross basis since the Company incurs credit risk from the
customer, bears the risk of loss for incomplete shipments and does not receive a separate fee or
commission for the transaction.

This segment also owns certain consignment inventory and recognizes revenue when that
inventory is sold to a third party by the segment’s customer.

Through its Medicine Shoppe and Medicap franchise operations, the Company has apothecary-style
pharmacy franchisees in which it earns franchise and origination fees. Franchise fees represent
monthly fees based upon franchisees’ sales and are recognized as revenue when they are earned.
Origination fees from signing new franchise agreements are recognized as revenue when the new
franchise store is opened.

Medical Products and Services

This segment records distribution and self-manufactured medical product revenue when title
transfers to its customers and the business has no further obligation to provide services related
to such merchandise. This revenue is recorded net of sales returns and allowances (see “Sales
Returns and Allowances” below for further information).

Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services

Manufacturing and packaging revenue is recognized either upon shipment or delivery of the
product, in accordance with the terms of the contract which specify when transfer of title occurs.
Non-product revenue includes annual exclusivity fees, option fees to extend exclusivity agreements
and milestone payments for attaining certain regulatory approvals. Exclusivity payments are
received from certain manufacturers in return for the Company’s commitment not to enter into
agreements to manufacture competing products. The revenue related to these agreements is
recognized over the term of the exclusivity agreement or the term of the option agreement unless a
particular milestone is designated, in which case revenue is recognized when all obligations of
performance have been completed.

Radiopharmaceutical revenue is recognized upon delivery of the product to the customer.

Service-related revenue, including fees received for analytical services or sales and
marketing services, is recognized upon the completion of such services.

Clinical Technologies and Services

The Company’s Pyxis products business leases or sells point-of-use systems. Revenue is
recognized from these transactions as follows:

•

Revenue is recognized on sales-type leases when the lease becomes noncancellable. The
lease is determined to be noncancellable upon completion of the installation, when the
equipment is functioning according to material specifications of the user’s manual and the
customer has accepted the equipment, as evidenced by signing an equipment confirmation
document (see Note 16 for additional information). Interest income on sales-type leases is
recognized in revenue using the interest method.

•

Revenue is recognized on the sale of point-of-use systems upon completion of the
Company’s installation obligations and upon customer acceptance of the equipment, as
evidenced by signing the equipment confirmation document.

•

Consistent with sales-type leases, revenue is recognized on operating leases after
installation is complete and customer acceptance has occurred. Operating lease revenue is
recognized over the lease term as such amounts become receivable according to the
provisions of the lease.

ALARIS Medical Systems, Inc. (which has been given the legal designation of Cardinal Health
303, Inc. and is referred to in these “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” as “Alaris”)
recognizes revenue, net of an allowance for estimated returns and credits, upon delivery and/or
installation (depending on the product) and once transfer of title and risk of loss have occurred.
Alaris frequently enters into revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, which is recognized
upon completion of the installation process, and is allocated to each element using the relative
fair value or vendor-specific objective evidence, as appropriate.

Pharmacy management and other service revenue is recognized as the services are rendered
according to the contracts established. A fee is charged under such contracts through a capitated
fee, a dispensing fee, a monthly management fee or an actual costs-incurred arrangement. Under
certain contracts, fees for services are guaranteed by the Company not to exceed stipulated



CARDINAL HEALTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

amounts or have other risk-sharing provisions. Revenue is adjusted to reflect the estimated
effects of such contractual guarantees and risk-sharing provisions.

Multiple Segments or Business Units

Arrangements containing multiple revenue generating activities are accounted for in accordance
with EITF Issue No. 00-21, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.” If the deliverable
meets the criteria of a separate unit of accounting, the arrangement revenue is allocated to each
element based upon its relative fair value and recognized in accordance with the applicable revenue
recognition criteria for each element.

Savings Guarantees

Some of the Company’s customer contracts include a guarantee of a certain amount of savings
through utilization of the Company’s services. Revenue associated with a guarantee in which the
form of consideration is cash or credit memos is not recorded until the guaranteed savings is
fully recognized. For guarantees with consideration paid in the form of free products or services,
the cost of goods sold related to those sales is increased by the amount of the guarantee.

Sales Returns and Allowances.

Pharmaceutical distribution revenue is recorded net of sales returns
and allowances. The Pharmaceutical Distribution business recognizes sales returns as a reduction
of revenue and cost of sales for the sales price and cost, respectively, when products are
returned. The Pharmaceutical Distribution business’ customer return policy requires that the
product be physically returned, subject to restocking fees, and only allows customers to return
products which can be added back to inventory and resold at full value, or which can be returned to
vendors for credit. Product returns are generally consistent throughout the year, and typically
are not specific to any particular product or customer. Amounts recorded in revenue and cost of
sales under this accounting policy closely approximate what would have been recorded under SFAS No.
48, “Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists.” Applying the provisions of SFAS No. 48
would not materially change the Company’s financial position and results of operations. Sales
returns and allowances for the Pharmaceutical Distribution business were approximately $1.4
billion, $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Distributed and self-manufactured medical product revenue is recorded net of sales returns and
allowances. The Medical Products and Services segment has established a reserve against returned
goods in accordance with SFAS No. 48. This reserve amount was immaterial for all periods
presented. This segment’s customer return policy requires that the product be physically returned,
subject to restocking fees, and only allows customers to return products which can be added back to
inventory and resold at full value, or which can be returned to vendors for credit. Product
returns are generally consistent throughout the year, and typically are not specific to any
particular product or customer. Sales returns and allowances for the Medical Products and Services
segment were approximately $70.8 million, $56.9 million and $55.6 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively.

Cash Discounts.

Cash discounts are recorded as a component of inventory cost and recognized as a
reduction of cost of products sold when related inventory is sold. See Note 16 for further
information regarding cash discounts and the change in accounting method adopted in 2004.

Distribution
Service Agreement Fees.

The Company’s Pharmaceutical
Distribution business accounts for fees received from its
distribution service agreements and other fees received from vendors
related to the purchase or distribution of the vendor’s inventory
as a reduction in cost of sales, in accordance with EITF Issue No.
02-16, “Accounting by a Customer for Certain Consideration
Received from a Vendor.”

Accounting for Vendor Reserves.

In the ordinary course of business, vendors may challenge
deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due them from the Company. These contested
transactions are researched and resolved based upon Company policy and findings of the research
performed. At any given time, there are outstanding items in various stages of research and
resolution. In determining an appropriate vendor reserve, the Company assesses historical
information and current outstanding claims. The ultimate outcome of certain claims may be
different than the Company’s original estimate and may require adjustment.

Shipping and Handling.

Shipping and handling costs are included in selling, general and
administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings. Shipping and handling costs
include all delivery expenses as well as all costs to prepare the product for shipment to the end
customer. Shipping and handling costs totaled $275.7 million, $250.3 million and $213.8 million
for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Shipping and handling revenue received was
immaterial for all periods presented.

Translation of Foreign Currencies.

Financial statements of the Company’s subsidiaries outside the
U.S. generally are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Adjustments to

accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity utilizing period-end exchange rates.
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses calculated by utilizing weighted average exchange
rates for the period are included in the consolidated statements of earnings in “interest expense
and other” and were immaterial for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Interest Rate and Currency Risk Management.

The Company accounts for derivative instruments in
accordance with SFAS No. 133, as amended, “Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activity.” Under
this standard, all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and all
changes in fair value are recorded to net earnings or shareholders’ equity through other
comprehensive income.

The Company uses forward currency exchange contracts, currency options and interest rate swaps
to manage its exposures to the variability of cash flows primarily related to the foreign exchange
rate changes of future foreign currency transaction costs and to the interest rate changes on
borrowing costs. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges.

The Company also uses interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the value of fixed rate debt due
to variations in interest rates. Both the derivative instruments and underlying debt are adjusted
to market value through “interest expense and other” at the end of each period. The Company uses
foreign currency forward contracts to protect the value of existing foreign currency assets and
liabilities. The remeasurement adjustments for any foreign currency denominated assets or
liabilities are included in “interest expense and other.” The remeasurement adjustment is offset
by the foreign currency forward contract settlements which are also classified in “interest expense
and other

.

” Both interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts are
designated as fair value hedges.

The Company generally does not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
During fiscal 2003, the Company entered into one speculative interest rate swap transaction
resulting in a gain of approximately $6.7 million.

The Company’s derivative contracts are adjusted to current market values each period and
qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, as amended. Periodic gains and losses of
contracts designated as cash flow hedges are deferred in other comprehensive income until the
underlying transactions are recognized. Upon recognition, such gains and losses are recorded in
net earnings as an adjustment to the carrying amounts of underlying transactions in the period in
which these transactions are recognized. For those contracts designated as fair value hedges,
resulting gains or losses are recognized in net earnings offsetting the exposures of underlying
transactions. Carrying values of all contracts are included in other assets or liabilities.

The Company’s policy requires contracts used as hedges must be effective at reducing the risk
associated with the exposure being hedged and must be designated as a hedge at the inception of the
contract. Hedging effectiveness is assessed periodically. Any contract not designated as a hedge,
or so designated but ineffective, is adjusted to market value and recognized in net earnings
immediately. If a fair value or cash flow hedge ceases to qualify for hedge accounting or is
terminated, the contract would continue to be carried on the balance sheet at fair value until
settled and future adjustments to the contract’s fair value would be recognized in earnings
immediately. If a forecasted transaction were no longer probable to occur, amounts previously
deferred in other comprehensive income would be recognized immediately in earnings. Additional
disclosure related to the Company’s hedging contracts is provided in Note 7.

Research and Development Costs.

Costs incurred in connection with development of new products and
manufacturing methods are charged to expense as incurred. Research and development expenses were
$117.2 million, $56.5 million and $56.9 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
increase in fiscal 2005 primarily relates to incremental expenses
from the acquisition of Alaris. The Company received reimbursement
for certain research and development costs. The reimbursements were
immaterial for all periods presented.

Income Taxes.

In accordance with provisions of SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income
Taxes,” the Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. The asset and
liability method requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future
tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between tax bases and financial
reporting bases of the Company’s assets and liabilities. Historically, no provision was made for
U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because those earnings are
considered permanently reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. During the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company determined that it will repatriate $500 million of accumulated
foreign earnings in fiscal 2006 pursuant to the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004 (the “AJCA”). Accordingly, the Company has recorded a related tax liability
of $26.3 million as of June 30, 2005. The $500 million is the maximum repatriation available to
the Company under the repatriation provisions of the AJCA. See Note 8 of “Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements” for additional information.

Earnings per Common Share.

Basic earnings per Common Share (“Basic”) is computed by dividing net
earnings (the numerator) by the weighted average number of Common Shares outstanding during each
period (the denominator). Diluted earnings per Common Share is similar to the computation for
Basic, except that the denominator is increased by the dilutive effect of stock options, restricted
shares and restricted share units computed using the treasury stock method.

Dividends.

Excluding dividends paid by all entities with which the Company has merged, the Company
paid cash dividends per Common Share of $0.12, $0.12 and $0.10 for the fiscal years ended June 30,
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Recent Financial Accounting Standards.

In May 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued FASB Staff Position SFAS 106-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to
the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.” This FASB Staff
Position provides guidance on the accounting, disclosure, effective date and transition
requirements related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.
FASB Staff Position SFAS 106-2 is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after June 15,
2004. The adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial
position or results of operations.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs-an amendment of Accounting
Research Bulletin (“ARB”) No. 43, Chapter 4.” The Statement requires abnormal amounts of idle
capacity and spoilage costs be excluded from the cost of inventory and expensed when incurred.
SFAS No. 151 is applicable to inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15,
2005. The adoption of this Statement is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
financial position or results of operations.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, “Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets-an amendment
of Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 29.” This Statement requires exchanges of
productive assets to be accounted for at fair value, rather than at carryover basis, unless: (a)
neither the asset received nor the asset surrendered has a fair value that is determinable within
reasonable limits; or (b) the transactions lack commercial substance. SFAS No. 153 is effective
for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The
adoption of this Statement is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial
position or results of operations.

In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position SFAS 109-1, “Application of FASB
Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, for the Tax Deduction Provided to U.S.-Based
Manufacturers by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.” This FASB Staff Position clarifies that
the tax deduction for domestic manufacturers under the AJCA should be accounted for as a special
deduction in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” FASB Staff
Position SFAS 109-1 was effective upon issuance. The adoption of this pronouncement did not have a
material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position SFAS 109-2, “Accounting and Disclosure
Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004.” This pronouncement provides entities more time to evaluate the impact of the AJCA on the
entity’s plan for reinvestment or repatriation of certain foreign earnings for purposes of applying
SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” FASB Staff Position SFAS 109-2 was effective upon
issuance. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company determined that it will repatriate
$500 million of accumulated foreign earnings in fiscal 2006 pursuant to the repatriation provisions
of the AJCA, and accordingly has recorded a related tax liability of $26.3 million as of June 30,
2005. The $500 million is the maximum repatriation available to the Company under the repatriation
provisions of the AJCA. See Note 8 below for additional information regarding the AJCA.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” which revises SFAS
No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and amends SFAS No. 95, “Statement of Cash Flows.”
This Statement requires that a public entity measure the cost of equity-based service awards based
on the grant date fair value of the award. All share-based payments to employees, including grants
of employee stock options, are required to be recognized in the income statement based on their
fair value. SFAS No. 123(R) is effective for the Company as of the beginning of the first annual
reporting period after June 15, 2005. The Company will adopt this Statement on July 1, 2005.

SFAS No. 123(R) allows public companies to adopt its requirement using one of the following
transition methods: (a) a “modified prospective” method in which compensation cost for all
share-based payments granted after the effective date is recognized based on the requirements of
SFAS No. 123(R) and compensation cost for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective
date that are unvested as of the effective date of SFAS No. 123(R) is recognized based on SFAS No.
123; or (b) a “modified retrospective” method which includes the requirements of the modified
prospective method and also permits entities to restate prior periods presented or prior interim
periods of the year of adoption based on the amounts previously recognized in its SFAS No. 123 pro
forma disclosures. The Company will be adopting SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective
method.



CARDINAL
HEALTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company currently accounts for share-based payments to employees using the intrinsic
value method under APB Opinion No. 25. As such, the Company generally does not recognize
compensation cost for stock options granted to employees. The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) is
expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations; however, it is not
expected to have a material impact on the Company’s overall financial position. The Company cannot
determine the impact of SFAS No. 123(R) at this time as it will depend on share-based payments
granted in the future. However, if the Company had adopted SFAS No.123(R) in prior periods, the
impact would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described below in the “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation” disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share. SFAS
No.123(R) also requires the benefits of excess tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation
cost be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as operating cash flow as is currently
required. As such, in the periods after adoption, this requirement of SFAS No. 123(R) will reduce
net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flow. The Company cannot estimate what
the future tax benefits will be as the amounts depend on, among other items, future employee stock
option exercises. However, the amount of operating cash flows recognized in the year ended June
30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 for such excess tax deductions were $18.8 million, $66.4 million and $65.5
million, respectively.

In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset
Retirement Obligations.” This Interpretation clarifies the term of conditional asset retirement
obligations as used in SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.” This
Interpretation is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005.
The adoption of this Interpretation is not anticipated to have a material impact on the Company’s
financial position or results of operations.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.” SFAS
No. 154 is a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20, “Accounting Changes” and SFAS No. 3, “Reporting
Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements.” This Statement requires voluntary changes in
accounting to be accounted for retrospectively and all prior periods to be restated as if the newly
adopted policy had always been used, unless it is impracticable. APB Opinion No. 20 previously
required most voluntary changes in accounting to be recognized by including the cumulative effect
of the change in accounting in net income in the period of change. This Statement also requires a
change in method of depreciation, amortization or depletion for a long-lived asset be accounted for
as a change in estimate that is affected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Once adopted by the Company, this
Statement could have an impact on prior year consolidated financial statements if the Company has a
change in accounting.

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.

At June 30, 2005, the Company maintained several stock
incentive plans for the benefit of certain employees. The Company accounts for these plans in
accordance with APB No. 25, and related interpretations. Except for costs related to restricted
shares, restricted share units, stock appreciation rights and an insignificant number of amended options requiring a new
measurement date, no compensation expense has been recognized in net earnings, as all options
granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying stock on the date of
grant. The following tables illustrate the effect on net earnings and earnings per share if the
Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation”:

4. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND SPECIAL ITEMS

Business Combinations

Fiscal 2005.

During fiscal 2005, the Company completed acquisitions that individually were
not material and were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The aggregate
purchase price of these individually immaterial acquisitions, which was paid in cash, was
approximately $107 million. Assumed liabilities of acquired businesses were approximately $27
million. The consolidated financial statements include the results of operations from each of
these business combinations as of the date of acquisition. Had the transactions occurred on July
1, 2002, results of operations would not have differed materially from reported results.

Fiscal 2004.

On June 28, 2004, the Company acquired approximately 98.7% of the outstanding
common stock of Alaris, a San Diego, California-based provider of intravenous medication safety
products and services. On July 7, 2004, Alaris merged with a subsidiary of the Company to complete
the transaction. This acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The
cash transaction was valued at approximately $2.1 billion, including the assumption of
approximately $358 million of debt. Under the agreement, the Company agreed to make a cash tender
offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Alaris common stock at a price of $22.35 per
share. Alaris employees with outstanding stock options either elected to receive a cash payment or
convert their options into an option to purchase the Company’s Common Shares. In July 2004,
certain Alaris employees elected to convert their options for the right to purchase a total of
approximately 0.6 million Common Shares of the Company.

The allocation of the Alaris purchase price resulted in an allocation to goodwill of
approximately $1.6 billion and an allocation to identifiable intangible assets of $413.2 million.
The Company valued intangible assets related to trademarks, trade names, patents and customer
relationships. The detail by category is as follows:

The Company worked with a third-party valuation expert to determine the fair value of
in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) and the fair value of identifiable intangible assets.
As required by SFAS 141 “Business Combinations,” amounts assigned to tangible and
intangible assets to be used in research and development projects that have no alternate future use
were charged to expense at the acquisition date. The Company recorded a charge in fiscal 2004 of
$12.7 million within special items in



CARDINAL HEALTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

the Company’s consolidated statement of earnings for an estimate of acquired IPR&D.

Supplemental pro forma results of operations are not disclosed as the impact to the Company
from the Alaris acquisition was not material. The fiscal 2004 consolidated financial statements
include the results of operations from June 28, 2004.

Prior to the completion of the Alaris acquisition, on June 16, 2004, ICU Medical, Inc. filed a
patent infringement lawsuit against Alaris in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of California. In the lawsuit, ICU claims that the Alaris SmartSite

®

family of
needle-free valves and systems infringes upon ICU patents. ICU seeks monetary damages plus
permanent injunctive relief preventing Alaris from selling SmartSite

®

products. On July
30, 2004, the Court denied ICU’s application for a preliminary injunction finding, among other
things, that ICU had failed to show a substantial likelihood of success on the merits. The Company
intends to vigorously defend this action.

During December 2003, the Company completed its acquisition of The Intercare Group, plc (which
has been given the legal designation of Cardinal Health U.K. 432 Limited and is referred to in
these “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” as “Intercare”), an European pharmaceutical
products and services company. The cash transaction was valued at approximately $570 million,
including the assumption of approximately $150 million in Intercare debt.

In addition, during fiscal 2004,
 the Company completed other acquisitions that
individually were not material and were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The
aggregate purchase price of these individually immaterial acquisitions, which was paid in cash, was
approximately $168 million. Assumed liabilities of acquired businesses, including those of Alaris
and Intercare, were approximately $1.1 billion. The consolidated financial statements include the
results of operations from each of these business combinations as of the date of acquisition. Had
the transactions, including Alaris and Intercare, occurred on July 1, 2002, results of operations
would not have differed materially from reported results.

Fiscal 2003.

On
January 1, 2003, the Company completed the acquisition of Syncor
International Corporation, a Woodland Hills, California-based company (which has been given the
legal designation of Cardinal Health 414, Inc. and is referred to in these “Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements” as “Syncor”), which is a provider of nuclear pharmacy services. This
acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The Company issued
approximately 12.5 million Common Shares, valued at approximately $780 million, to Syncor
stockholders and Syncor’s outstanding stock options were converted into options to purchase
approximately 3.0 million Common Shares. The Company also assumed approximately $120 million in
debt. In connection with this acquisition, certain operations of Syncor have been sold (see Note
22 below) and other operations have been integrated with the Company’s existing Nuclear Pharmacy
Services business, a component of the Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment.

In addition, during fiscal 2003,
the Company completed other acquisitions that
individually were not material and were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The
aggregate purchase price of these individually immaterial acquisitions, which was paid in cash, was
approximately $14.4 million. Assumed liabilities of the acquired businesses, including those of
Syncor, were approximately $340.1 million. The consolidated financial statements include the
results of operations from each of these business combinations as of the date of acquisition. Had
the transactions, including Syncor, occurred on July 1, 2002, results of operations would not have
differed materially from reported results.

Special Items Policy

The Company’s special items primarily consist of costs relating to the integration of
previously acquired companies or costs of restructuring operations to improve productivity.
Integration costs from acquisitions accounted for under the pooling of interests method have been
recorded in accordance with EITF Issue No. 94-3, “Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs incurred in a
Restructuring),” and SAB No. 100, “Restructuring and Impairment Charges.” Certain costs related to
these acquisitions, such as employee and lease terminations and other facility exit costs, were
recognized at the date the integration plan was adopted by management. Certain other integration
costs not meeting the criteria for accrual at the commitment date have been expensed as the
integration plan has been implemented.

Costs associated with integrating acquired companies under the purchase method are recorded in
accordance with EITF Issue No. 95-3, “Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase
Business Combination.” Certain costs to be incurred by the Company, as the acquirer, such as
employee and lease terminations and other facility exit costs, are recognized at the date the
integration plan is committed to and adopted by management. Certain other integration costs not
meeting the criteria for accrual at the commitment date are expensed as the integration plan is
implemented.



CARDINAL HEALTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

At the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company implemented SFAS No. 146,
“Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities,” to account for costs incurred
in restructuring activities. Under this standard, a liability for an exit cost is recognized as
incurred. As discussed above, the Company previously accounted for costs associated with
restructuring activities under EITF Issue No. 94-3, which required the Company to recognize a
liability for restructuring costs on the date of the commitment to an exit plan.

The Company records settlements of significant lawsuits that are infrequent, non-recurring or
unusual in nature as special items. Also, the Company records, from time to time, material charges
that are one-time, unusual or infrequent in nature as special items.

Phase I initiated within the Medical Products and Services segment during fiscal 2005. The
projects within this segment include centralizing of management functions within the distribution
business, transitioning to a customer needs-based sales representative model in the ambulatory care
business and improvements within the manufacturing business through consolidation or outsourcing of
production from higher cost facilities to lower cost facilities.

The Company incurred costs of $118.9 million related to restructuring projects associated with
Phase I initiated within the Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment during fiscal 2005.
The projects within this segment include planned reductions of headcount within existing operations
and consolidation of overlapping operations. The total costs for fiscal 2005 include $102.7
million of asset impairment charges of which approximately $102.4 million related to its plan to
sell three facilities and transfer business from a fourth facility. The Company plans to sell a
portion of the businesses housed in each of the three facilities available for sale and transfer
the remaining portion of the businesses to other existing Company facilities. One facility was
sold in fiscal 2005 and the Company expects to complete the sale of the remaining two facilities no
later than the end of fiscal 2006. The carrying amount of the three facilities to be sold was
$106.3 million, which included $18.7 million of goodwill allocated in accordance with SFAS No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” As the Company determined that the plan of sale criteria
in SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” had been met
during fiscal 2005, the carrying value of the asset groups being sold was adjusted to $28.5
million, the estimated fair market values less costs to sell. As a result, the Company recognized
asset impairment charges of $77.8 million associated with the three businesses during fiscal 2005.
As stated above, the Company also committed to a plan to transfer production from a fourth facility
within its Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services facilities to another existing Company facility
in fiscal 2005. Production is expected to continue at the facility through fiscal 2007. The
Company recorded an asset impairment of $24.6 million in fiscal 2005 based on an analysis of
discounted cash flows in accordance with SFAS No. 144.

The Company incurred costs of $0.7 million related to a restructuring project associated with
Phase I initiated within the Clinical Technologies and Services segment during fiscal 2005. The
costs were incurred in connection with a planned headcount reduction.

During fiscal 2005, the Company incurred costs of $30.0 million related to restructuring
projects associated with Phase I and Phase II that impacted multiple segments. These costs related
primarily to project consulting fees incurred as a result of design and implementation of the
Company’s overall restructuring plan, restructuring the Company’s delivery of information
technology infrastructure services, and severance accrued upon management’s commitment to the
restructuring plan when a defined severance plan exists.

Other Restructuring Programs.

Separate from the global restructuring program
discussed above, the Company incurred costs of $16.9 million in fiscal 2005 to restructure
operations (both domestically and internationally) throughout the Company as compared to $37.1
million in fiscal 2004 and $67.0 million in fiscal 2003. See costs by segment in the table above.
The restructuring plans across all segments focused on various aspects of operations, including
closing and consolidating certain manufacturing operations, rationalizing headcount both
domestically and internationally, and aligning operations in the most strategic and cost-efficient
structure. Included in these costs for fiscal 2004 were $13.7 million in asset impairments related
to the Company’s decision to exit certain North American commodity operations within the
Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment.

In connection with implementing these restructuring plans, the Company incurred costs that
included, but were not limited to, the following: (a) employee-related costs, the majority of which
represents severance accrued upon either communication of terms to employees or management’s
commitment to the restructuring plan when a defined severance plan exists; and (b) exit costs,
including asset impairment charges, costs incurred to relocate physical assets and project
management costs. The earliest of these restructuring plans was initiated during fiscal 2001, with
others being implemented throughout fiscal 2002, 2003 and 2004. Some of these restructuring plans
were completed during fiscal 2003, 2004 and 2005 while other plans will be completed throughout
fiscal 2006. Overall, the restructuring plans within the Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider
Services segment resulted in the termination of approximately 43 employees, 41 of whom were
terminated as of June 30, 2005. The restructuring plans within the Medical Products and Services
segment will result in the termination of approximately 2,200 employees, of whom approximately
2,185 had been terminated as of June 30, 2005. The restructuring plans within the Pharmaceutical
Technologies and Services segment overall will result in the termination of approximately 1,100
employees, 1,050 of whom were terminated as of June 30, 2005. The restructuring plans within the
Clinical Technologies and Services segment resulted in the termination of 35 employees, all of whom
had been terminated as of June 30, 2005. The restructuring plans that impacted multiple segments
resulted in the termination of 20 employees, all of whom had been terminated as of June 30, 2005.

Merger-Related Costs

Costs of integrating operations of various merged companies are recorded as merger-related
costs when incurred. The merger-related costs incurred during fiscal 2005 were primarily a result
of the Alaris and Syncor acquisitions. The merger-related costs incurred during fiscal 2004 were
primarily a result of the Syncor acquisition. Merger-related costs incurred during fiscal 2003
were primarily a result of the Bindley Western Industries, Inc. (which has been given the legal
designation of Cardinal Health 100, Inc. and is referred to in these “Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements” as “Bindley”) acquisition. During the fiscal years noted above, the Company
also incurred merger-related costs for numerous smaller acquisitions. The following table and
paragraphs provide additional detail regarding the types of merger-related costs incurred by the
Company.

Employee-Related Costs.

During fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company incurred
employee-related costs associated with certain merger and acquisition transactions of $16.3
million, $11.9 million and $18.7 million, respectively. These costs primarily consist of
severance, stay bonuses, non-compete agreements and other forms of compensatory payouts made to
employees as a direct result of the mergers or acquisitions. The fiscal 2005 charges related
primarily to the Alaris and Syncor acquisitions. The fiscal 2004 charges were primarily a result
of the Syncor acquisition. In addition to these types of costs, during fiscal 2003, the Company
incurred a charge of $8.8 million related to an approved plan to curtail defined benefit pension
plans within the Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment. This curtailment resulted from
the plan to conform the employee benefit plans of R.P. Scherer Corporation (which has been given
the legal designation of Cardinal Health 409, Inc. and is referred to in these “Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements” as “Scherer”) to the Company’s benefit plan structure at the
time of the Scherer merger. In fiscal 2005, $2.9 million of the remaining accrual balance was
reversed as a result of lowered estimates for future payouts due to reduced headcount.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Pharmaceutical Distribution Center Consolidation.

During fiscal 2004 and 2003, the
Company incurred charges of $0.1 million and $22.7 million, respectively, primarily associated
with the Company’s plans to close and consolidate a total of 16 Bindley distribution centers,
Bindley’s corporate office and one of the Company’s data centers as a result of the Bindley
acquisition. These charges include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) employee-related
costs, primarily from the termination of approximately 1,250 employees due to the closures and
consolidations noted above; (b) exit costs to consolidate and close the various facilities
mentioned above, including asset impairment charges, inventory move costs and contract/lease
termination costs; and (c) duplicate salary costs incurred during the shutdown periods.

Asset Impairments and Other Exit Costs.

During fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, the
Company incurred asset impairment and other exit costs of $1.6 million, $0.9 million and $5.4
million, respectively. The asset impairment and other exit costs incurred during fiscal 2005 were
primarily a result of fixed asset disposals due to the Alaris acquisition and facility closures
associated with the Syncor acquisition. The asset impairment and other exit costs incurred during
fiscal 2004 related primarily to plans to consolidate operations as a result of the Syncor
acquisition. The asset impairment and other exit costs incurred during fiscal 2003 related
primarily to plans to close and consolidate facilities as a result of the Bergen Brunswig Medical
Corporation acquisition as well as asset impairments, lease terminations and other exit costs
incurred internationally as a result of the Scherer acquisition.

Debt Issuance Cost Write-Off.

During the first two quarters of fiscal 2005, the
Company incurred charges of $8.8 million related to the write-off of debt issuance costs and other
debt tender offer costs related to the Company’s decision to retire certain Alaris debt instruments
that carried higher interest rates than the Company’s cost of debt. As a result, the Company
retired such debt instruments in advance of their original maturity dates.

In-Process Research and Development.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the
Company recorded a charge of $12.7 million related to the write-off of in-process research and
development costs associated with the Alaris acquisition.

Other Integration Costs.

During fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company incurred
integration costs and other of $22.2 million, $19.1 million and $27.6 million, respectively. The
costs included in this category generally relate to expenses incurred to integrate merged or
acquired companies’ operations and systems into the Company’s pre-existing operations and systems.
These costs include, but are not limited to, the integration of information systems, employee
benefits and compensation, accounting/finance, tax, treasury, internal audit, risk management,
compliance, administrative services, sales and marketing and others.

Other

Fiscal 2005

.

During fiscal 2005, the Company incurred costs recorded within other
special items totaling $54.6 million. These costs primarily relate to legal fees and document
preservation and production costs incurred in connection with the SEC investigation and the Audit
Committee internal review and related matters. In addition, these costs include a $25.0 million
reserve for the potential settlement with the SEC regarding  resolution of its
investigation with respect to the Company. Unless and until the SEC investigation is resolved,
there can be no assurance that the amount reserved by the Company for this investigation will be
sufficient and that a larger amount will not be required. Therefore, this reserve will be reviewed
on a quarterly basis and adjusted to the extent that the Company determines it is necessary. For
further information regarding these matters, see Note 1.

Fiscal 2004.

During fiscal 2004, the Company incurred other special items totaling
$37.9 million. This total comprises two items. First, the
Company made a special contribution
to The Cardinal Health Foundation during the fourth quarter which totaled approximately $31.7
million. The special contribution was made as a direct result of a large pharmaceutical
manufacturer antitrust litigation settlement received during the fourth quarter. The Cardinal
Health Foundation is the primary vehicle used by the Company to provide charitable support to the
community and various organizations. Prior contributions to the Cardinal Health Foundation were
immaterial. Second, the Company incurred costs of $6.2 million during the fourth quarter related
to the SEC investigation and the Audit Committee’s internal review. These costs primarily
represent legal fees and document preservation and production costs incurred in responding to
requests related to the SEC’s investigation and the Audit Committee’s internal review. Prior costs
incurred related to these matters were immaterial. For further information regarding these
matters, see Note 1.

In connection with restructuring and integration plans related to Syncor, the Company accrued,
as part of its acquisition adjustments, a liability of $15.1 million related to employee
termination and relocation costs and $10.4 million related to closing of duplicate facilities. As
of June 30, 2005, the Company had paid $13.8 million of employee related costs, $5.1 million
associated with the facility closures and $1.1 million of other restructuring costs.

Other

Certain merger, acquisition and restructuring costs are based upon estimates. Actual amounts
paid may ultimately differ from these estimates. If additional costs are incurred or recorded
amounts exceed costs, such changes in estimates will be recorded in special items when incurred.



CARDINAL HEALTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company estimates it will incur additional costs in future periods associated with various
mergers, acquisitions and restructuring activities totaling approximately $268 million
(approximately $175 million net of tax). These estimated costs are primarily associated with the
first and second phases of the Company’s previously-announced global restructuring program and the
Alaris acquisition. The Company believes it will incur these costs to properly restructure,
integrate and rationalize operations, a portion of which represents facility rationalizations and
implementing efficiencies regarding information systems, customer systems, marketing programs and
administrative functions, among other things. Such amounts will be expensed as special items when
incurred.

The 4.00%, 4.45%, 6.00%, 6.25% and 6.75% Notes represent unsecured obligations of the Company.
The 7.30% Notes and the 7.80% and 7.00% Debentures represent unsecured obligations of Allegiance
Corporation, which are guaranteed by the Company. These obligations are not subject to a sinking
fund and are not redeemable prior to maturity, except for the 7.00% Debentures which included put
options that expired on September 15, 2003, without any put options being exercised. Interest is
paid pursuant to the terms of the notes. These notes are structurally subordinated to the
liabilities of the Company’s subsidiaries, including trade payables of $7.6 billion and $650.0
million of preferred debt securities.

As part of the Company’s acquisition of Alaris in fiscal 2004, the Company assumed $195.3
million of Senior subordinated notes due 2011, which includes a premium of $20.3 million based on
the fair value of the debt. The Senior subordinated notes bear interest at an annual rate of
7.25%, which is payable semi-annually in arrears on July 1 and January 1 of each year, commencing
January 1, 2004, and mature on July 1, 2011. The Senior subordinated notes are redeemable at the
option of the Company, in whole or in part, at any time on or after July 1, 2007 at an initial
redemption price of 103.625%, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption,
with the redemption price declining annually thereafter. In addition, subject to certain
limitations, the Company may redeem up to 35% of the Senior subordinated notes on or before July 1,
2006 with the net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings, at a price of 107.25%, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. In the event of a change of
control, as defined in the indenture governing the Senior subordinated notes, holders may require
the Company to purchase their Senior subordinated notes at 101% of the principal amount thereof,
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. The Senior subordinated notes
are subject to certain restrictive and reporting covenants. As of June 30, 2004, the Company was in
compliance with all such covenants. During fiscal 2005, the Company paid off $183.6 million of the
Senior subordinated notes and amended the bond indenture to remove the restrictive covenants. The
remaining balance at June 30, 2005 of $11.6 million is callable at any time on or after July 1,
2007.

Also related to the Alaris acquisition, the Company assumed a bank credit facility consisting
of a six-year $245 million term loan and a five-year $30 million revolving credit facility. During
fiscal 2005, the Company paid off the term loan and terminated the credit facility. At June 30,
2004, $162.6 million was outstanding under the term loan. The term loan bore interest at an annual
rate equal to current LIBOR or a fluctuating base rate, plus a margin of 2.25% as of June 30, 2004.
The Company could elect to use either a one-, two-, three-, or six-month LIBOR rate. Alaris made
elections resulting in a weighted average interest rate at June



CARDINAL HEALTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

30, 2004 of 3.36% per annum (1.11% plus the margin of 2.25%).

The Company has a commercial paper program, providing for the issuance of up to $1.5 billion
in aggregate maturity value of commercial paper. The Company did not have any borrowings
outstanding under this program at June 30, 2005, but had $634.2 million outstanding under this
program at June 30, 2004 with a market interest rate based upon LIBOR. The Company also had an
extendible commercial notes program providing for the issuance of up to $150.0 million of
extendible commercial notes. The Company did not have any borrowings outstanding under this
extendible commercial notes program at June 30, 2005 or June 30, 2004. The Company also maintains
other short-term credit facilities and an unsecured line of credit that allow for borrowings up to
$322.7 million. At June 30, 2005 and 2004, $136.0 million and $68.4 million, respectively, were
outstanding under these uncommitted facilities. The June 30, 2005 and 2004 balances include $5.6
million and $15.0 million, respectively, in short-term borrowings reclassified. The effective
interest rate as of June 30, 2005 and 2004 was 0.72% and 1.68%, respectively. The June 30, 2005
balance also includes $130.4 million which is classified in other obligations. The remaining
$153.9 million balance of other obligations at June 30, 2005 consisted primarily of additional
notes, loans and capital leases. The June 30, 2004 balance also includes $53.4 million which is
classified in other obligations. The remaining $49.8 million balance of other obligations at June
30, 2004 consists primarily of additional notes, loans and capital leases.

The Company also has two unsecured $750 million bank revolving credit facilities, which provide for
up to an aggregate of $1.5 billion in borrowings. One of these facilities expires on March 24,
2008 and the other expires on March 23, 2009. At expiration, these revolving credit facilities can
be extended upon mutual consent of the Company and the lending institutions. During the first
quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company borrowed $500 million on its revolving credit facilities. The
proceeds of this borrowing were utilized to repay a portion of the Company’s commercial paper and
for general corporate purposes, including the establishment of pharmaceutical inventory at the
Pharmaceutical Distribution business’ National Logistics Center in Groveport, Ohio. During the
second quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company borrowed an additional $750 million on the revolving
credit facilities, with the proceeds utilized primarily for the establishment of inventory at the
National Logistics Center. The Company fully repaid the $1.25 billion in outstanding balances
under its bank revolving credit facilities during the second quarter of fiscal 2005 due to
stabilization in its short-term liquidity requirements in light of, among other things, the Company
having substantially completed the initial establishment of inventory at the National Logistics
Center . These revolving credit facilities exist largely to support issuances of
commercial paper as well as other short-term borrowings and remained unused at June 30, 2005 and
2004, except for $46.2 million and $37.3 million, respectively, of standby letters of credit issued
on behalf of the Company. At June 30, 2005, $5.6 million of other short-term borrowings were
reclassified as long-term. At June 30, 2004, $500.0 million of commercial paper and $15.0 million
of other short-term borrowings were reclassified as long-term. These reclassifications reflect the
Company’s intent and ability, through the existence of the unused revolving credit facilities, to
refinance these borrowings. The remaining $134.2 million of commercial paper outstanding at June
30, 2004 was classified as short-term.

During fiscal 2001, the Company entered into an agreement to periodically sell trade
receivables to a special purpose accounts receivable and financing entity (the “Accounts Receivable
and Financing Entity”), which is exclusively engaged in purchasing trade receivables from, and
making loans to, the Company. The Accounts Receivable and Financing Entity, which is consolidated
by the Company as it is the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity, issued $250
million and $400 million in preferred variable debt securities to parties not affiliated with the
Company during fiscal 2004 and 2001, respectively. These preferred debt securities are classified
as long-term debt in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. These preferred debt securities must
be retired or redeemed by the Accounts Receivable and Financing Entity before the Company, or its
creditors, can have access to the Accounts Receivable and Financing Entity’s receivables. At June
30, 2005 and 2004, the Accounts Receivable and Financing Entity owned approximately $534.0 million
and $506.9 million, respectively, of receivables that are included in the Company’s consolidated
balance sheet. The effective interest rate as of June 30, 2005 and 2004 was 3.96% and 2.36%,
respectively. Other than for loans made to the Company or for breaches of certain representations,
warranties or covenants, the Accounts Receivable and Financing Entity does not have any recourse
against the general credit of the Company.

The Company had a long-term obligation that was collateralized with property and equipment of
the Company with an aggregate book value of approximately $70 million at June 30, 2004. The
collateralized obligation was paid off during fiscal 2005. Any future obligation under the
borrowing facility would be subject to the same collateralization provisions.

Company’s objective is to manage the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and
on the market value of its borrowings. The Company maintains fixed rate debt as a percentage of
its net debt within a certain range.

The Company utilizes a mix of debt maturities along with both fixed-rate and variable-rate
debt to manage changes in interest rates. In addition, the Company enters into interest rate swaps
to further manage its exposure to interest rate variations related to its borrowings and to lower
its overall borrowing costs.

At June 30, 2005, the Company held two pay-fixed interest rate swaps to hedge the variability
of cash flows relating to forecasted transactions. These contracts were classified as cash flow
hedges and mature through 2010 and 2017, respectively. The Company adjusted these pay-fixed
interest rate swaps to current market values through other comprehensive income, as the contracts
were effective in offsetting the interest rate exposure of the forecasted transactions. During
fiscal 2005, the Company held two additional pay-fixed interest rate swaps to hedge the variability
of cash flows related to forecasted transactions. These contracts were classified as cash flow
hedges and matured through 2010 and 2017, respectively. The forecasted transactions related to the
two additional pay-fixed interest rate swaps did not occur during fiscal 2005, and thus, a portion
of each of the contracts became ineffective. Payments totaling $11.6 million were made to
terminate the contracts in fiscal 2005 and the ineffective portion of each of the contracts,
totaling $1.3 million, was recorded in interest expense and other during fiscal 2005. The
remaining $10.3 million of the payments that relates to the portion of the contracts that was
effective prior to the termination date was adjusted to current market value through other
comprehensive income during fiscal 2005, and an adjustment will be recognized in interest expense
and other in future periods in conjunction with the occurrence of the originally forecasted
transactions. At June 30, 2004, the Company held two pay-fixed interest rate swaps acquired
through the Alaris acquisition. These pay-fixed interest rate swaps were utilized by Alaris to
hedge a bank term loan. These swaps were unwound in fiscal 2005 upon the Company’s election to pay
down the bank term loan (see Note 6). The impact in the Company’s consolidated financial
statements was not material.

The Company also held pay-floating interest rate swaps to hedge the change in fair value of
the fixed-rate debt related to fluctuations in interest rates. These contracts are classified as
fair value hedges and mature through June 2015. The gain/(loss) recorded on the pay-floating
interest rate swaps is directly offset by the change in fair value of the underlying debt. Both
the derivative instrument and the underlying debt are adjusted to market value at the end of each
period with any resulting gain/(loss) recorded in interest expense and other.

The following table represents the notional amount hedged, fair value of the interest rate
swaps outstanding at June 30, 2005 and 2004 included in other assets/liabilities. The net gains
for pay-floating interest rate swaps recognized through interest expense and other during fiscal
2005, 2004 and 2003 were approximately $22.7 million, $34.8 million and $27.1 million,
respectively.

In addition to the $10.3 million described above, the Company had net deferred losses on
pay-fixed interest rate swaps of $7.3 million recorded in other comprehensive income at June 30,
2005. The Company had net deferred gains on pay-fixed interest rate swaps of $0.8 million recorded
in other comprehensive income at June 30, 2004. During fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 the Company
recognized losses of approximately $0.7 million, $4.5 million and $11.9 million, respectively,
within interest expense and other related to these interest rate swaps.



CARDINAL HEALTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions and the Company does
not have significant exposure to any one counterparty. Management believes the risk of loss is
remote and in any event would not be material.

Currency Risk Management.

The Company conducts business in several major international
currencies and is subject to risks associated with changing foreign exchange rates. The Company’s
objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate
changes to allow management to focus its attention on its business operations. Accordingly, the
Company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to
protect the value of existing foreign currency assets and liabilities, commitments and anticipated
foreign currency revenue and expenses. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in
the value of the underlying transactions as they occur.

At June 30, 2005 and 2004, the Company held forward contracts expiring through June 2006 and
June 2005, respectively, to hedge probable, but not firmly committed, revenue and expenses. These
hedging contracts are classified as cash flow hedges and, accordingly, are adjusted to current
market values through other comprehensive income until the underlying transactions are recognized.
Upon recognition, such gains and losses are recorded in operations as an adjustment to the recorded
amounts of the underlying transactions in the period in which these transactions are recognized.
The principal currencies hedged are the European euro, British pound, Mexican peso, Canadian
dollar, Australian dollar and Thai bhat.

The Company also held forward contracts expiring in December 2013 at June 30, 2005 and 2004,
respectively, to hedge the value of foreign currency assets and liabilities. These forward
contracts are classified as fair value hedges and are adjusted to current market values through
interest expense and other, directly offsetting the adjustment of the foreign currency asset or
liability.

The following table represents the notional amount hedged, the value of the forward contracts
outstanding at June 30, 2005 and 2004 included in other assets or liabilities. The amount of net
losses related to fair value forward contracts recognized through interest expense and other during
fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 were approximately $18.5 million, $12.7 million and $8.1 million,
respectively.

At June 30, 2005, the Company had net deferred gains related to forward contract cash flow
hedges of $5.4 million as compared to net deferred losses of $3.5 million at June 30, 2004. These
gains and losses were recorded in other comprehensive income. During fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003
the Company recognized losses of approximately $8.0 million, $14.9 million and $12.2 million,
respectively, within net earnings related to these forward contracts.

The income/loss recorded on the forward contract fair value hedge is offset by the
remeasurement adjustment on the foreign currency denominated asset or liability. The settlement of
the derivative instrument and the remeasurement adjustment on the foreign currency denominated
asset or liability are both recorded in interest expense and other at the end of each period. The
Company did not recognize any material gains/(losses) related to contracts that were not effective
or forecasted transactions that did not occur during fiscal 2005 and 2004.

In connection with the Company’s acquisition of Alaris, the Company acquired certain options
hedging European euro, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and British pound. These options were
entered into by Alaris to reduce the risk of earnings and cash flow volatility related to certain
forecasted transactions. The options expired in fiscal 2005 and the Company did not recognize any
material gains/(losses) related to these options.

The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions and the Company does
not have significant exposure to any one counterparty. Management believes the risk of loss is
remote and in any event would not be material.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

The carrying amounts of cash and equivalents, trade
receivables, accounts payable, notes payable-banks, other short-term borrowings and other accrued
liabilities at June 30, 2005 and 2004, approximate their fair value because of the short-term
maturities of these items.

Cash balances are invested in accordance with the Company’s investment policy. These
investments are exposed to market risk from interest rate fluctuations and credit risk from the
underlying issuers, although this is mitigated through diversification.

The estimated fair value of the Company’s long-term obligations was $2,720.2 million and
$3,787.1 million as compared to the carrying amounts of $2,627.8 million and $3,689.7 million at
June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The fair value of the Company’s long-term obligations is
estimated based on either the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues and the current
interest rates offered for debt of the same remaining maturities or estimated discounted cash
flows.

The following is a summary of the fair value gain/(loss) of the Company’s derivative
instruments, based upon the estimated amount that the Company would receive (or pay) to terminate
the contracts as of June 30. The fair values are based on quoted market prices for the same or
similar instruments.

On October 22, 2004, the AJCA was signed into law. A provision of the AJCA creates a
temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate undistributed income earned abroad by
providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign
corporations. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company determined that it will
repatriate $500 million of accumulated foreign earnings in fiscal 2006 pursuant to the repatriation
provisions of the AJCA, and accordingly has recorded a related tax liability of $26.3 million as of
June 30, 2005. The $500 million is the maximum repatriation available to the Company under the
repatriation provisions of the AJCA.

As of June 30, 2005 the Company
had $905 million (net of the $500 million to be repatriated in
fiscal 2006) of undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be
permanently reinvested in foreign operations. These earnings are considered permanently
reinvested, thus no U.S. tax provision has been accrued related to the repatriation of these
earnings. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of U.S tax that might be payable on the
eventual remittance of such earnings.

Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax
reporting bases of assets and liabilities, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax
purposes. The components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

At June 30, 2005, the Company had gross federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of
$127.1 million and $708.3 million, respectively. A gross valuation allowance of $397.8 million at
June 30, 2005 has been provided for the state net operating loss, as utilization of such
carryforwards within the applicable statutory periods is uncertain. The state net operating loss
carryforwards expire through 2025. Expiring state net operating loss carryforwards and the
required valuation allowances have been adjusted annually. The Company also has gross federal
capital loss carryovers of $14.7 million at June 30, 2005 for which no valuation allowance has been
established. After application of the valuation allowances described above, the Company
anticipates no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other net deferred
income tax assets described above.

Under a tax-sharing agreement with Baxter International Inc., Allegiance Corporation will pay
for increases and be reimbursed for decreases to the net deferred tax assets transferred on the
date of the Baxter-Allegiance Spin-Off (as hereinafter defined in Note 11). Such increases or
decreases may result from audit adjustments to Baxter’s prior period tax returns.

9. EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, other
postretirement benefit and defined contribution plans. Substantially all of the Company’s domestic
non-union employees are eligible to be enrolled in Company-sponsored contributory profit sharing
and retirement savings plans, which include features under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and provide for Company matching and profit sharing
contributions. The Company’s contributions to the plans are determined by the Board of Directors
subject to certain minimum requirements as specified in the plans.

The total expense for employee retirement benefit plans (excluding defined benefit and other
postretirement benefit plans, see below) was $86.1 million, $54.5 million and $64.2 million for the
fiscal years ended June 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Defined Benefit and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans.

The Company has several defined benefit
plans covering substantially all Scherer salaried and hourly employees. The Company also assumed
defined benefit plans through certain acquisitions including Intercare and Alaris. The Company’s domestic
defined benefit plans provide defined benefits based on years of service and level of compensation.
Foreign subsidiaries provide for pension benefits in accordance with local customs or law. The
Company funds its pension plans at amounts required by applicable regulations.

The Company also has a postretirement medical plan and a postretirement life insurance plan
that covers all eligible Scherer participants.

The Company uses a measurement date of March 31 for substantially all its pension and
postretirement benefit plans.

The investment policy reflects the long-term nature of the plans’ funding obligations. The
assets are invested to provide the opportunity for both income and growth of principal. This
objective is pursued as a long-term goal designed to provide required benefits for participants
without undue risk. It is expected that this objective can be achieved through a well-diversified
asset portfolio. All equity investments are made within the guidelines of quality, marketability
and diversification mandated by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) and other
relevant statutes. Investment managers are directed to maintain equity portfolios at a risk level
approximately equivalent to that of the specific benchmark established for that portfolio. Assets
invested in fixed income securities and pooled fixed income portfolios are managed actively to
pursue opportunities presented by changes in interest rates, credit ratings or maturity premiums.

Contributions

The
total estimated contributions for the 2006 measurement year are $3.4 million.

The Company periodically enters into certain off-balance sheet arrangements, primarily
receivable sales and operating leases, in order to maximize diversification of funding and return
on assets. The receivable sales, as described below, also provide for the transfer of credit risk
to third parties.

Lease Receivable-Related Arrangements

During fiscal 2004, the Company entered into two separate agreements to transfer ownership of
certain equipment lease receivables, plus security interests in the related equipment, to the
leasing subsidiary of a bank in the amounts of $164.2 million and $150.0 million. These
transactions resulted in immaterial gains or losses classified by the Company as revenue within its
results of operations. In order to qualify for sale treatment under SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities,” the Company formed
wholly-owned, special purpose, bankruptcy-remote subsidiaries (the “Pyxis SPEs”) of Pyxis
Corporation (which has been given the legal designation of Cardinal Health 301, Inc. and is
referred to in this Form 10-K as “Pyxis”), and each of the Pyxis SPEs formed wholly-owned,
qualified special purpose subsidiaries (the “QSPEs”) to effectuate the removal of the lease
receivables from the Company’s consolidated financial



CARDINAL HEALTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

statements. In accordance with SFAS No. 140, the Company consolidates the Pyxis SPEs and does
not consolidate the QSPEs. Both the Pyxis SPEs and QSPEs are separate legal entities that maintain
separate financial statements from the Company and Pyxis. The assets of the Pyxis SPEs and QSPEs
are available first and foremost to satisfy the claims of their respective creditors.

The Company formed Pyxis Funding LLC (“Pyxis Funding”) for the sole purpose of acquiring a
pool of leases and the related leased equipment from Pyxis and ultimately selling the lease
receivables to a multi-seller conduit administered by a third-party bank. Pyxis Funding is a
wholly-owned, special purpose, bankruptcy-remote subsidiary of Pyxis. Pyxis Funding II LLC (“Pyxis
Funding II”) was formed for the sole purpose of acquiring lease receivables from Pyxis Funding and
issuing notes secured by its assets to a multi-seller conduit administered by a third-party bank.
Pyxis Funding II is a wholly-owned, qualified special purpose subsidiary of Pyxis Funding. The
transaction qualifies for sale treatment under SFAS No. 140. Accordingly, the related receivables
are not included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. As required by U.S. GAAP, the
Company consolidates Pyxis Funding and does not consolidate Pyxis Funding II. Both Pyxis Funding
and Pyxis Funding II are separate legal entities that maintain separate financial statements from
the Company and Pyxis. The assets of Pyxis Funding and Pyxis Funding II are available first and
foremost to satisfy the claims of their respective creditors. During fiscal 2005, Pyxis exercised its option
to recall the agreement that issued the aforementioned notes. As a result the Company recorded an
immaterial loss. Therefore, at June 30, 2005 the notes did not have a balance or the related
credit protection. The notes held by investors had a principal balance of $16.0 million at June
30, 2004, and the investors were provided with credit protection in the form of 20% ($4.0 million)
over-collateralization.

Other Receivable-Related Arrangements

Cardinal Health Funding (“CHF”) and Medicine Shoppe Capital Corporation (“MSCC”) were
organized for the sole purpose of buying receivables and selling those receivables to multi-seller
conduits administered by third party banks or other third party investors. MSCC and CHF were
designed to be special purpose, bankruptcy-remote entities. Although consolidated in accordance
with GAAP, MSCC and CHF are separate legal entities from the Company, Medicine Shoppe
International, Inc. and the Company’s Financial Shared Services business. The sale of receivables
by MSCC and CHF qualify for sales treatment under SFAS No. 140 and accordingly are not included in
the Company’s consolidated financial statements. During fiscal 2004, the Company terminated and
liquidated MSCC resulting in an immaterial loss.

At June 30, 2005, the Company had a committed receivables sales facility program available
through CHF with capacity to sell $800 million in receivables. During the first quarter of fiscal
2005, the capacity under the committed receivables sales facility program was increased from $500
million to $800 million. Recourse is provided under the program by the requirement that CHF retain
a percentage subordinated interest in the sold receivables. The Company sold $500 million of
receivables under this committed receivables sales facility program during the first quarter of
fiscal 2005. The Company sold an additional $300 million under this program during the second
quarter of fiscal 2005. In the third quarter of fiscal 2005 the Company repurchased and
subsequently sold $133.8 million of receivables under this
program. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the
Company repurchased $250 million of receivables under this program. After these transactions, the
Company had $550 million of receivable sales outstanding at June 30, 2005. The Company also
provided a secured interest in the existing receivables of $274.2 million at June 30, 2005, as
required under this program. At June 30, 2004, the Company had no outstanding receivables or
subordinated interests related to this facility.

Cash Flows from all Receivable-Related Arrangements

Pyxis, MSCC and CHF were required to repurchase any receivables sold only if it is determined
that the representations and warranties with regard to the related receivables were not accurate on
the date sold.

Operating Leases

The Company has entered into operating lease agreements with several third party banks for the
construction of various facilities and equipment. The initial terms of the lease agreements have
varied maturity dates ranging from June 2006 through June 2013, with optional renewal periods,
generally five years. In the event of termination, the Company is required (at its election) to
either purchase the facility or vacate the property and make reimbursement for a portion of any
unrecovered property cost. The maximum portion of unrecovered property costs that the Company
could be required to reimburse does not exceed the amount expended to acquire and/or construct the
facilities. As of June 30, 2005, the amount expended to acquire and/or construct the facilities
was $256.4 million. The agreements provide for maximum funding of $301.6 million, which is
currently greater than the estimated cost to complete the construction projects. The required
lease payments equal the interest expense for the period on the amounts drawn. During fiscal 2005,
the Company decided to purchase certain buildings and equipment of approximately $132.3 million
which were previously under operating lease agreements. In addition, certain of these leases
qualified as capital lease obligations, and accordingly, the Company had approximately $81.1
million of property and equipment offset by long-term liabilities on its balance sheet at June 30,
2005. Based upon current market information obtained from a third party valuation expert, the
Company believes that the payment obligation under certain leases would exceed the proceeds from
the sale of related properties and equipment. Therefore, the Company recorded impairment charges
during fiscal 2005. See Note 21 below for additional information regarding these impairment
charges. Lease payments under the agreements are based primarily upon LIBOR and are subject to
interest rate fluctuations. As of June 30, 2005, the weighted average interest rate on the
agreements approximated 4.01%. The Company’s estimated minimum annual lease payments under the
agreements at June 30, 2005 were approximately $10.3 million.

11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

The future minimum rental payments for operating leases (including those referenced in Note
10) having initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year at June 30, 2005

Rental expense relating to operating leases (including those referenced in Note 10) was
approximately $125.2 million, $120.6 million and $102.8 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Sublease rental income was not material for any period presented herein.

Latex Litigation

On September 30, 1996, Baxter International Inc. (“Baxter”) and its subsidiaries transferred
to Allegiance Corporation and its subsidiaries (“Allegiance”), Baxter’s U.S. health care
distribution business, surgical and respiratory therapy business and health care cost-management
business, as well as certain foreign operations (the “Allegiance Business”) in connection with a
spin-off of the Allegiance Business by Baxter. In connection with this spin-off, Allegiance
Corporation, which later merged with a subsidiary of the Company on February 3, 1999, agreed to
indemnify Baxter, and to defend and indemnify Baxter Healthcare Corporation, as contemplated by the
agreements between Baxter and Allegiance Corporation, for all expenses and potential liabilities
associated with claims arising from the Allegiance Business, including certain claims of alleged
personal injuries as a result of exposure to natural rubber latex
gloves. Such claims, which name multiple defendants in addition to
Baxter/Allegiance, involved allegations of sensitization to natural
rubber latex products. The Company is not a
party to any of the lawsuits and has not agreed to pay any settlements to the plaintiffs.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company reassessed its ability to estimate the
potential remaining costs of these lawsuits. Following this reassessment, during the first quarter
of fiscal 2005, the Company recognized a charge of $16.4 million as its reasonable estimate of net
future costs to be incurred in defending or settling outstanding claims as well as pursuing
insurance recoveries. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company resolved claims
relating to substantially all of its remaining insurance coverage for this litigation. Following
resolution of these claims, the Company concluded that it was in a position to reasonably estimate
the total remaining uninsured costs for this litigation. As such, during the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2005, the Company recognized an additional charge of $11.8 million as its reasonable estimate of
uninsured costs already incurred in
defending or settling outstanding claims. While the Company does not anticipate significant
charges in future periods, additional charges may be required if there is a significant increase in
the number of new lawsuits filed. Currently, the Company considers this potential

event to be remote.

Derivative Actions

On November 8, 2002, a complaint was filed by a purported shareholder against the Company and
its directors in the Court of Common Pleas, Delaware County, Ohio, as a purported derivative
action.

Doris Staehr v. Robert D. Walter, et al., No. 02-CVG-11-639

. On or about March 21, 2003,
after the Company filed a Motion to Dismiss the complaint, an amended complaint was filed alleging
breach of fiduciary duties and corporate waste in connection with the alleged failure by the Board
of Directors of the Company to renegotiate or terminate the Company’s proposed acquisition of
Syncor, and to determine the propriety of indemnifying Monty Fu, the former Chairman of Syncor.
The Company filed a Motion to Dismiss the amended complaint, and the plaintiffs subsequently filed
a second amended complaint that added three new individual defendants and included new allegations
that, among other things, the Company improperly recognized revenue in December 2000 and September
2001 related to settlements with certain vitamin manufacturers. The Company filed a Motion to
Dismiss the second amended complaint, and on November 20, 2003, the Court denied the motion. On
April 14, 2005, the Court stayed the action for a period of six months. The defendants intend to
vigorously defend this action. The Company currently does not believe that the impact of this
lawsuit will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, liquidity or
results of operations.

Since July 1, 2004, three complaints have been filed by purported shareholders against the
members of the Company’s Board of Directors, certain of its officers and employees and the Company
as a nominal defendant in the Court of Common Pleas, Franklin County, Ohio, as purported derivative
actions (collectively referred to as the “Cardinal Health Franklin County derivative actions”).
These cases include:

Donald Bosley, Derivatively on behalf of Cardinal Health, Inc. v. David Bing,
et al., Sam Wietschner v. Robert D. Walter, et al.

and

Green Meadow Partners, LLP, Derivatively on
behalf of Cardinal Health, Inc. v. David Bing, et al

. The Cardinal Health Franklin County
derivative actions allege that the individual defendants failed to implement adequate internal
controls for the Company and thereby violated their fiduciary duty of good faith, GAAP and the
Company’s Audit Committee charter. The complaints in the Cardinal Health Franklin County
derivative actions seek money damages and equitable relief against the defendant directors and an
award of attorney’s fees. On November 22, 2004, the Cardinal Health Franklin County derivative
actions were consolidated. Furthermore, by agreement of the parties, the Cardinal Health Franklin
County derivative actions have been stayed. None of the defendants has responded to the complaints
yet, nor has the Company.

Shareholder/ERISA Litigation against Cardinal Health

Since July 2, 2004, ten purported class action complaints have been filed by purported
purchasers of the Company’s securities against the Company and certain of its officers and
directors, asserting claims under the federal securities laws (collectively referred to as the
“Cardinal Health federal securities actions”). To date, all of these actions have been filed in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. These cases include:

Gerald
Burger v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 575), Todd Fener v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al.
(04 CV 579), E. Miles Senn v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 597), David Kim v. Cardinal
Health, Inc. (04 CV 598), Arace Brothers v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 604), John Hessian
v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 635), Constance Matthews Living Trust v. Cardinal Health,
Inc., et al. (04 CV 636), Mariss Partners, LLP v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 849), The
State of New Jersey v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 831)

and

First New York Securities, LLC
v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 911).

The Cardinal Health federal securities actions
purport to be brought on behalf of all purchasers of the Company’s securities during various
periods beginning as early as October 24, 2000 and ending as late as July 26, 2004 and allege,
among other things, that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder and Section 20(a) of
the Exchange Act by issuing a series of false and/or misleading statements concerning the Company’s
financial results, prospects and condition. Certain of the complaints also allege violations of
Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, claiming material misstatements or omissions
in prospectuses issued by the Company in connection with its
acquisition of Bindley in 2001 and Syncor in 2003. The alleged misstatements relate to the Company’s
accounting for recoveries relating to antitrust litigation against vitamin manufacturers, and to
classification of revenue in the Company’s Pharmaceutical Distribution business as either operating
revenue or revenue from bulk deliveries to customer warehouses, among other matters. The alleged
misstatements are claimed to have caused an artificial inflation in the Company’s stock price
during the proposed class period. The complaints seek unspecified money damages and equitable
relief against the defendants and an award of attorney’s fees. On December 15, 2004, the Cardinal
Health federal securities actions were consolidated into one action
captioned

In re Cardinal Health, Inc. Federal Securities Litigation

, and on January 26, 2005,
the Court appointed the Pension Fund Group as lead plaintiff in this consolidated action. On April
22, 2005, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended complaint naming the Company, certain
current and former officers and employees and the Company’s external auditors as defendants. The
complaint seeks unspecified money damages and other unspecified relief against the defendants. On
August 22, 2005, the Company and certain defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss the



CARDINAL HEALTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

consolidated amended complaint.

Since July 2, 2004, 15 purported class action complaints (collectively referred to as the
“Cardinal Health ERISA actions”) have been filed against the Company and certain officers,
directors and employees of the Company by purported participants in the Cardinal Health Profit
Sharing, Retirement and Savings Plan (now known as the Cardinal Health 401(k) Savings Plan, or the
“401(k) Plan”). To date, all of these actions have been filed in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of Ohio. These cases include:

David McKeehan and James Syracuse v.
Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 643), Timothy Ferguson v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV
668), James DeCarlo v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 684), Margaret Johnson v. Cardinal
Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 722), Harry Anderson v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 725),
Charles Heitholt v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 736), Dan Salinas and Andrew Jones v.
Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 745), Daniel Kelley v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV
746), Vincent Palyan v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 778), Saul Cohen v. Cardinal Health,
Inc., et al. (04 CV 789), Travis Black v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 790), Wendy Erwin v.
Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 803), Susan Alston v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV
815), Jennifer Brister v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 828

and

Gint Baukus v. Cardinal
Health, Inc., et al. (05 C2 101 ).

The Cardinal Health ERISA actions purport to be brought on
behalf of participants in the 401(k) Plan and the Syncor Employees’ Savings and Stock Ownership
Plan (the “Syncor ESSOP,” and together with the 401(k) Plan, the “Plans”), and also on behalf of
the Plans themselves. The complaints allege that the defendants breached certain fiduciary duties
owed under ERISA, generally asserting that the defendants failed to make full disclosure of the
risks to the Plans’ participants of investing in the Company’s stock, to the detriment of the
Plans’ participants and beneficiaries, and that Company stock should not have been made available
as an investment alternative for the Plans’ participants. The misstatements alleged in the
Cardinal Health ERISA actions significantly overlap with the misstatements alleged in the Cardinal
Health federal securities actions. The complaints seek unspecified money damages and equitable
relief against the defendants and an award of attorney’s fees. On December 15, 2004, the Cardinal
Health ERISA actions were consolidated into one action captioned

In re Cardinal Health, Inc. ERISA
Litigation

. On January 14, 2005, the court appointed lead counsel and liaison counsel for the
consolidated Cardinal Health ERISA action. On April 29, 2005, the lead plaintiff filed a
consolidated amended ERISA complaint naming the Company, certain current and former directors,
officers and employees, the Company’s Employee Benefits Policy Committee and Putnam Fiduciary Trust
Company as defendants. The complaint seeks unspecified money damages and other unspecified relief
against the defendants. On August 22, 2005, the Company and certain defendants filed a Motion to
Dismiss the consolidated amended ERISA complaint.

With respect to the proceedings described under the headings “Derivative Actions” and
“Shareholder/ERISA Litigation against Cardinal Health,” the Company currently believes that there
will be some insurance coverage available under the Company’s insurance policies in effect at the
time the actions were filed. Such policies are with financially viable insurance companies, and
are subject to self-insurance retentions, exclusions, conditions, coverage gaps, policy limits and
insurer solvency.

Shareholder/ERISA Litigation against Syncor

Eleven purported class action lawsuits have been filed against Syncor and certain of its
officers and directors, asserting claims under the federal securities laws (collectively referred
to as the “Syncor federal securities actions”). All of these actions were filed in the United
States District Court for the Central District of California. These cases include

Richard Bowe v.
Syncor Int’l Corp., et al., No. CV 02-8560 LGB (RCx) (C.D. Cal.), Alan Kaplan v. Syncor Int’l
Corp., et al., No. CV 02-8575 CBM (MANx) (C.D. Cal), Franklin Embon, Jr. v. Syncor Int’l Corp., et

and

Larry Hahn v. Syncor Int’l Corp., et al., CV 03-52
LGB (RCx) (C.D. Cal.)

. The Syncor federal securities actions purport to be brought on behalf of
all purchasers of Syncor shares during various periods, beginning as early as March 30, 2000 and
ending as late as November 5, 2002. The actions allege, among other things, that the defendants
violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder and Section 20(a)
of the Exchange Act by issuing a series of press releases and public filings disclosing significant
sales growth in Syncor’s international business, but omitting mention of certain allegedly improper
payments to Syncor’s foreign customers,
thereby artificially inflating the price of Syncor shares. A lead plaintiff has been appointed by
the Court in the Syncor federal securities actions, and a consolidated amended complaint was filed
May 19, 2003, naming Syncor and 12 individuals, all former Syncor officers, directors and/or
employees, as defendants. The consolidated complaint seeks unspecified money damages and other
unspecified relief against the defendants. Syncor filed a Motion to Dismiss the consolidated
amended complaint on August 1, 2003, and on December 12, 2003, the Court granted the Motion to
Dismiss without prejudice. A second amended consolidated class action complaint was filed on



CARDINAL HEALTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

January 28, 2004, naming Syncor and 14 individuals, all former Syncor officers, directors and/or
employees, as defendants. Syncor filed a Motion to Dismiss the second amended consolidated class
action complaint on March 4, 2004. On July 6, 2004, the Court granted Defendants’ Motion to
Dismiss without prejudice as to defendants Syncor, Monty Fu, Robert Funari and Haig Bagerdjian. As
to the other individual defendants, the Motion to Dismiss was granted with prejudice. On September
14, 2004, the lead plaintiff filed a Motion for Clarification of the Court’s July 6, 2004 dismissal
order. The court clarified its July 6, 2004 dismissal order on November 29, 2004 and the lead
plaintiff filed a third amended consolidated complaint on December 29, 2004. Syncor filed a Motion
to Dismiss the third amended consolidated complaint on January 31, 2005. On April 15, 2005, the
Court granted the Motion to Dismiss with prejudice. The lead plaintiff has appealed this decision.

On November 14, 2002, two additional actions were filed by individual stockholders of Syncor
in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the “Delaware actions”) against seven of
Syncor’s nine directors (the “director defendants”). The complaints in each of the Delaware
actions were identical and alleged that the director defendants breached certain fiduciary duties
to Syncor by failing to maintain adequate controls, practices and procedures to ensure that
Syncor’s employees and representatives did not engage in improper and unlawful conduct. Both
complaints asserted a single derivative claim, for and on behalf of Syncor, seeking to recover all
of the costs and expenses that Syncor incurred as a result of the allegedly improper payments
(including the costs of the Syncor federal securities actions described above), and a single
purported class action claim seeking to recover damages on behalf of all holders of Syncor shares
in the amount of any losses sustained if consideration received by Syncor stockholders in the
Company’s merger with Syncor was reduced. On November 22, 2002, the plaintiff in one of the two
Delaware actions filed an amended complaint adding as defendants the Company, its subsidiary Mudhen
Merger Corporation and the remaining two Syncor directors, who are hereafter included in the term
“director defendants.” These cases have been consolidated under the caption

In re Syncor
International Corp. Shareholders Litigation

(the “consolidated Delaware action”). On August 14,
2003, the Company filed a Motion to Dismiss the operative complaint in the consolidated Delaware
action. At the end of September 2003, plaintiffs in the consolidated Delaware action moved the
Court to file a second amended complaint. Plaintiffs’ request was granted in February 2004. Monty
Fu was the only named defendant in the second amended complaint. On September 15, 2004, the Court
granted Monty Fu’s Motion to Dismiss the second amended complaint. The Court dismissed the second
amended complaint with prejudice.

On November 18, 2002, two additional actions were filed by individual stockholders of Syncor
in the Superior Court of California for the County of Los Angeles (the “California actions”)
against the director defendants. The complaints in the California actions allege that the director
defendants breached certain fiduciary duties to Syncor by failing to maintain adequate controls,
practices and procedures to ensure that Syncor’s employees and representatives did not engage in
improper and unlawful conduct. Both complaints asserted a single derivative claim, for and on
behalf of Syncor, seeking to recover costs and expenses that Syncor incurred as a result of the
allegedly improper payments. These cases include

Joseph Famularo v. Monty Fu, et al., Case No.
BC285478 (Cal. Sup. Ct., Los Angeles Cty.)

, and

Mark Stroup v. Robert G. Funari, et al., Case No.
BC285480 (Cal. Sup. Ct., Los Angeles Cty.)

. An amended complaint was filed on December 6, 2002 in
one of the cases, purporting to allege direct claims on behalf of a class of shareholders. The
defendants’ motion for a stay of the California actions pending the resolution of the Delaware
actions (discussed above) was granted on April 30, 2003. On November 29, 2004, the court dismissed
the California actions with prejudice.

A purported class action complaint, captioned

Pilkington v. Cardinal Health, et al.,

was filed
on April 8, 2003 against the Company, Syncor and certain officers and employees of the Company by a
purported participant in the Syncor ESSOP. A related purported class action complaint, captioned

Donna Brown, et al. v. Syncor International Corp, et al.,

was filed on September 11, 2003 against
the Company, Syncor and certain individual defendants. Another related purported class action
complaint, captioned

Thompson v. Syncor International Corp., et al.

, was filed on January 14, 2004
against the Company, Syncor and certain individual defendants. Each of these actions was brought
in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. A consolidated
complaint was filed on February 24, 2004 against Syncor and certain former Syncor officers,
directors and/or employees alleging that the defendants breached certain fiduciary duties owed
under ERISA based on the same underlying allegations of improper and unlawful conduct alleged in
the federal securities litigation. The consolidated complaint seeks unspecified money damages and
other unspecified relief against the defendants. On April 26, 2004, the defendants filed Motions
to Dismiss the consolidated complaint. On August 24, 2004, the Court granted in part and denied in
part Defendants’ Motions to Dismiss. The Court dismissed, without prejudice, all claims against
defendants Ed Burgos and Sheila Coop, all claims alleging co-fiduciary liability against all
defendants, and all claims alleging that the individual defendants had conflicts of interest
precluding them from properly exercising their fiduciary duties under ERISA. A claim for breach of
the duty to prudently manage plan assets was upheld against Syncor, and a claim for breach of the
alleged duty to “monitor” the performance of Syncor’s Plan Administrative Committee was upheld
against defendants Monty Fu and Robert Funari. In addition, the United States Department of Labor
is conducting an investigation of the Syncor ESSOP with respect to its compliance with ERISA
requirements. The

Company has responded to a subpoena received from the Department of Labor and
continues to cooperate in the investigation.

It is impossible to predict the outcome of the proceedings described under the heading
“Shareholder/ERISA Litigation against Syncor” or their impact on the Company. However, the Company
currently does not believe that the impact of these actions will have a material adverse effect on
the Company’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations. The Company believes the
allegations made in the complaints described above are without merit and it intends to vigorously
defend such actions. The Company has been informed that the individual director and officer
defendants deny liability for the claims asserted in these actions, believe they have meritorious
defenses and intend to vigorously defend such actions. The Company currently believes that a
portion of any liability will be covered by insurance policies that the Company and Syncor have
with financially viable insurance companies, subject to self-insurance retentions, exclusions,
conditions, coverage gaps, policy limits and insurer solvency.

DuPont Litigation

On September 11, 2003, E.I. Du Pont De Nemours and Company (“DuPont”) filed a lawsuit against
the Company and others in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee.

. The complaint alleges various causes of action
against the Company relating to the production and sale of surgical drapes and gowns by the
Company’s Medical Products and Services segment. DuPont’s claims generally fall into the
categories of breach of contract, false advertising and patent infringement. The complaint does
not request a specific amount of damages. The Company believes that the claims made in the
complaint are without merit, and it intends to vigorously defend this action. The Company is owed
a defense and indemnity from its co-defendants with respect to DuPont’s claim for patent
infringement. The Company currently does not believe that the impact of this lawsuit, if any, will
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, liquidity or results of
operations. This matter is currently scheduled for trial during the second quarter of fiscal 2006.

Other Matters

The Company also becomes involved from time-to-time in other litigation incidental to its
business, including, without limitation, inclusion of certain of its subsidiaries as a potentially
responsible party for environmental clean-up costs as well as litigation in connection with future
and prior acquisitions. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against such other
litigation and does not currently believe that the outcome of any such other litigation will have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

12. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY

At June 30, 2005 and 2004, the Company’s authorized capital shares consisted of the following:
750 million common shares, without par value (“Class A common shares”); 5 million Class B common
shares, without par value; and 0.5 million non-voting preferred shares, without par value. The
Class A common shares and Class B common shares are collectively referred to as “Common Shares.”
Holders of Common Shares are entitled to share equally in any dividends declared by the Company’s
Board of Directors and to participate equally in all distributions of assets upon liquidation.
Generally, the holders of Class A common shares are entitled to one vote per share and the holders
of Class B common shares are entitled to one-fifth of one vote per share on proposals presented to
shareholders for vote. Under certain circumstances, the holders of Class B common shares are
entitled to vote as a separate class. Only Class A common shares were outstanding as of June 30,
2005 and 2004.

On June 27, 2005, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the purchase of
up to $1.0 billion of its
Common Shares as management deems appropriate. The Company expects to begin repurchasing shares in
the first half of fiscal 2006.

In December 2004, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of Common Shares
up to an aggregate amount of $500.0 million. Pursuant to this authorization, the Company
repurchased approximately 8.8 million Common Shares having an aggregate cost of approximately
$500.0 million during the six months ended June 30, 2005. The average price paid per Common Share
was $56.76. The repurchased shares are held in treasury to be used for general corporate purposes.

On February 27, 2004, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of Common
Shares up to an aggregate amount of $500 million. Pursuant to this authorization, the Company
repurchased approximately 6.9 million Common Shares



CARDINAL HEALTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

under an accelerated share repurchase program
having an aggregate cost of approximately $460.3 million. The initial price paid per share was
$66.80. The approximately 6.9 million shares repurchased under the program were subject to a
future contingent purchase price adjustment which was settled during the fourth quarter of fiscal
2004. The purchase price adjustment was based upon the volume weighted average price during the
actual repurchase period and was subject to certain provisions which establish a cap and a floor
for the average share price in the Company’s agreement with its broker-dealer who executed the
repurchase transactions.

The accelerated share repurchase program was completed on May 11, 2004. The final volume
weighted average price was $70.07. As a result, the Company settled the forward contract for $22.5
million in cash, which cost was included in the amount associated with Common Shares in treasury.
The Company used the remaining $17.2 million of the initial authorization to repurchase additional
shares of approximately 0.2 million having an average price paid per share of $70.73. The
repurchased shares were placed into treasury to be used for general corporate purposes.

On August 1, 2003, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of Common Shares
up to an aggregate amount of $1.0 billion. Pursuant to this authorization, the Company repurchased
approximately 17.0 million Common Shares having an aggregate cost of approximately $1.0 billion.
The average price paid per share was $58.65. This repurchase was completed during the first
quarter of fiscal 2004, and the repurchased shares were placed into treasury to be used for general
corporate purposes.

In January 2003, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of Common Shares
up to an aggregate amount of $500 million. Pursuant to this authorization, the Company repurchased
approximately 8.6 million Common Shares having an aggregate cost of approximately $500 million.
This repurchase was completed in February 2003, and the repurchased shares were placed into
treasury shares to be used for general corporate purposes.

In August 2002, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of Common Shares up
to an aggregate amount of $500 million. Pursuant to this authorization, the Company repurchased
approximately 7.8 million Common Shares having an aggregate cost of approximately $500 million.
This repurchase was completed in January 2003, and the repurchased shares were placed into treasury
shares to be used for general corporate purposes.

13. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK AND MAJOR CUSTOMERS

The Company invests cash in deposits with major banks throughout the world and in high quality
short-term liquid instruments. Such investments are made only in instruments issued or enhanced by
high quality institutions. These investments mature within three months and the Company has not
incurred any related losses.

The Company’s trade receivables, finance notes and accrued interest receivables, and lease
receivables are exposed to a concentration of credit risk with customers in the retail and health
care sectors. Credit risk can be affected by changes in reimbursement and other economic pressures
impacting the hospital and acute care sectors of the health care industry. However, such credit
risk is limited due to supporting collateral and the diversity of the customer base, including its
wide geographic dispersion. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’
financial conditions and maintains reserves for credit losses. Such losses historically have been
within the Company’s expectations.

The following table summarizes all of the Company’s customers which individually account for
at least 10% of the Company’s revenue. The customers in the table below are serviced
through the Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services segment.

Percent of Revenue




CVS Corporation (“CVS”)


%


%

Walgreen Co. (“Walgreens”)

%

At June 30, 2005 and 2004, CVS accounted for 25% and 18%, respectively, and
Walgreens accounted for 19% and 9%, respectively, of the Company’s gross trade receivable balance.

Certain of the Company’s businesses have entered into agreements with group purchasing
organizations (“GPOs”) that act as purchasing agents that negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of
their members. In fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, approximately 15%, 17% and 17%, respectively, of
revenue was derived from GPO members through the contractual arrangements established with
Novation, LLC and Premier Purchasing Partners, L.P., the Company’s two largest GPO relationships in
terms of revenue.



CARDINAL HEALTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

However, the Company’s trade receivable balances are with individual members of
the GPO and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists with these types of
arrangements.

14. STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED SHARES

The Company maintains several stock
incentive plans (the “Plans”) for the benefit of certain
officers, directors and employees. Historically, employee options granted under the Plans
generally vested in full on the third anniversary of the grant date and were exercisable for
periods up to ten years from the date of grant at a price which equals fair market value at the
date of grant. Beginning in fiscal 2006, employee options granted under the Plans generally vest
in equal annual installments over four years and are exercisable for periods up to seven years from
the date of grant at a price which equals the fair market value at the date of grant. Under the
Plans the Company currently utilizes for equity award grants, the
Company was authorized to grant
up to 76.8 million shares as of June 30, 2005, of which 53.7 million shares have been granted.

The following summarizes all stock option transactions for the Company under the Plans from
July 1, 2002 through June 30, 2005, giving retroactive effect to conversions of options in
connection with merger transactions and stock splits:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company accounts for the Plans in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25. Except for costs
related to restricted shares, restricted share units and an insignificant number of amended options
requiring a new measurement date, no compensation cost has been recognized. See Note 3 for table
illustrating the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company adopted the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock Based Compensation.”

The weighted average fair value of options granted during fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 are
$17.99, $22.78 and $21.96, respectively.

The fair values of the options granted to Company employees and directors were estimated on
the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions for
grants in the respective periods:

The market values of restricted shares and restricted share units awarded by the Company are
recorded in the “Other” component of shareholders’ equity in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets. The restricted shares are amortized to expense over the period in which participants
perform services, generally one to seven years. The restricted share units are generally amortized
over a five-year vesting period. As of June 30, 2005, approximately 0.9 million shares and share
units remained restricted and subject to forfeiture.

The Company has employee stock purchase plans under which the sale of 12.0 million of the
Company’s Common Shares has been authorized. Employees who have been employed by the Company for
at least 30 days may be eligible to contribute from 1% to 15% of eligible compensation. The
purchase price is determined by the lower of 85% of the closing market price on the first day of
the offering period or 85% of the closing market price on the last day of the offering period.
During any given calendar year, there are two offering periods: January 1–June 30; and July
1–December 31. At June 30, 2005, subscriptions of 0.4 million shares were outstanding. Through
June 30, 2005, 3.9 million shares had been issued to employees under the plans.

15. EARNINGS PER SHARE

16. CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING

Effective fiscal 2004, the Company changed its method of recognizing cash discounts from
recognizing cash discounts as a reduction of cost of products sold primarily upon payment of vendor
invoices to recording cash discounts as a component of inventory cost and recognizing such
discounts as a reduction to cost of products sold upon the sale of inventory. The Company believes
the change in accounting method provides a more objectively determinable method of recognizing cash
discounts and a better matching of inventory cost to revenue.

The Company recorded a $38.5 million (net of tax of $22.5 million) cumulative effect of change
in accounting in the consolidated statements of earnings. The cumulative effect reduced net
diluted earnings per Common Share by $0.09. The impact of this change for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2004 was an increase in earnings from continuing operations before cumulative effect of
change in accounting by approximately $13.2 million. This resulted in an increase in diluted
earnings per Common Share from continuing operations of $0.03 for fiscal 2004. The pro forma effect
of this accounting change on prior periods is as follows:

Subsequent to the filing of the 2004 Form 10-K, certain errors were
identified related to the Company’s fiscal 2002 pro forma
disclosures related to cash discounts. The errors were a result of
incomplete information used in the corresponding calculations. The
corrected fiscal 2002 pro forma disclosures are reflected in the
table above. The
impact of the correction of the errors on the previously reported pro forma fiscal 2002 amounts was as
follows: decreased pro forma earnings from continuing operations
before cumulative effect of change in accounting and pro forma net
earnings by $11.1 million, decreased pro forma basic and diluted
earnings per Common Share from continuing operations by $0.03, and
decreased pro forma net basic and diluted earnings per Common Share
from continuing operations by $0.02.

The increase within the Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services segment
primarily relates to Medicap Pharmacies Incorporated purchase price tax adjustments of
approximately $25.2 million.

(3)

The increase within the Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services
segment primarily relates to the acquisition of Geodax Technology,
Inc. and an
acquisition within the Intercare business, which resulted in
goodwill allocations of approximately $63.8 and $26.6 million
respectively. The affect of these acquisitions was partially offset by
purchase price adjustments of approximately $18.6 million. The
remaining amounts represent goodwill acquired from an other
immaterial acquisition, other purchase price adjustments and foreign
currency translation adjustments.

(4)

The increase within the Clinical Technologies and Services segment primarily relates to
Alaris purchase price tax adjustments of approximately $117.9 million which were offset by
approximately $19.3 million for the reclassification of goodwill to intangibles within the
Alaris business.

(5)

These impairment charges relate to the Pharmaceutical Development, Oral Technologies
and Biotechnology and Sterile Life Science businesses within the Pharmaceutical
Technologies and Services segment. See Note 4 above for additional information regarding
these impairment charges.

This goodwill decrease relates to the sale of the Radiation Management Services
business within the Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment during the second

(7)

During the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company transferred its Clinical Services
and Consulting business, previously reported within the Pharmaceutical Distribution and
Provider Services segment, to its Clinical Technologies and Services segment to better
align business operations. This transfer resulted in approximately $60.1 million of
goodwill being reclassed between the segments.

The allocation of the purchase price related to certain immaterial acquisitions are not yet
finalized and are subject to adjustment as the Company assesses the value of the pre-acquisition
contingencies and certain other matters. The Company expects any future adjustments to the
allocation of the purchase price to be recorded to goodwill.

18. SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company’s operations are principally managed on a products and services basis and are
comprised of four reportable business segments: Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services,
Medical Products and Services, Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services and Clinical Technologies
and Services (formed during the first quarter of fiscal 2005). Clinical Technologies and Services
includes Alaris, the Company’s businesses formerly within the Automation and Information Services
segment and the Company’s Clinical Services and Consulting business, which was formerly reported
under the Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services segment. In June 2004, the Company
acquired approximately 98.7% of Alaris’ outstanding common stock, and in July 2004, Alaris merged
with a subsidiary of the Company to complete the transaction.

Also during the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company transferred its Specialty
Pharmaceutical Distribution business, previously included within the Pharmaceutical Distribution
and Provider Services segment, to the Medical Products and Services segment. These transfers were
effected to better align business operations with the current management and reporting structure.
Prior period financial results were adjusted to reflect these changes.

During fiscal 2003, the Company reclassified Central Pharmacy Services, Inc. and Cord
Logistics, Inc. from the Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services segment to the
Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment and therefore restated these segments’ financial
results. All prior period financial results presented were adjusted to reflect these changes. In
addition, with the completion of the Syncor acquisition on January 1, 2003, Syncor was included
within the Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment.

In December 2003, the Company acquired Intercare, which operates specialty pharmaceutical
distribution and pharmaceutical manufacturing operations in Europe. For the fiscal year ended June
30, 2004, the results of operations of Intercare’s Specialty Pharmaceutical Distribution business,
which is similar to the Company’s Pharmaceutical Distribution business, were included within the
Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services segment (see footnote 1 in the table below for
further information). All other results of operations for Intercare were included within the
Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment. This classification was not reported during the
second quarter fiscal 2004 immediately following the acquisition as the Company was still assessing
the appropriate segment reporting treatment. Intercare’s results of operations for the second
quarter of fiscal 2004 were not material to the Company or the Company’s individual segments.

The Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services segment distributes a broad line of
pharmaceuticals, health care products and other items typically sold by hospitals, retail drug
stores and other health care providers. Through the acquisition of Intercare, this segment also
operates a distribution network within the United Kingdom offering a specialized range of branded
and generic pharmaceutical products. This segment also provides distribution and other services to
pharmaceutical manufacturers through new distribution service agreements. The segment also
provides support services complementing its distribution activities. In addition, this segment
operates and franchises apothecary-style retail pharmacies.

The Medical Products and Services segment manufactures medical, surgical and laboratory
products and distributes these self-manufactured products as well as products manufactured by other
suppliers to hospitals, physician offices, surgery centers and other health care providers. In
addition, the segment distributes oncology, therapeutic plasma and other specialty pharmaceutical
and biotechnology products to hospitals, clinics and other managed-care facilities.

The Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment provides products and services to the
health care industry through pharmaceutical development and manufacturing services in nearly all
oral and sterile dose forms, including those incorporating the Company’s proprietary drug delivery
systems, such as softgel capsules, controlled release forms, Zydis® fast dissolving wafers and
advanced sterile delivery technologies. This segment also provides comprehensive packaging,
radiopharmaceutical manufacturing and distribution, pharmaceutical development and analytical

Distribution business. For segment reporting purposes, this specialty pharmaceutical
distribution business is included in the Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services
segment. This classification was not reported during the second quarter of fiscal 2004

Corporate operating earnings include special items of $264.2 million, $57.4 million and
$39.9 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively (see Note
4 for discussion of special items). The Company allocated a portion of its corporate costs
to the business segments to estimate the costs the segments would have incurred for certain
services provided by the corporate entity. In addition, the Company attempts to maintain a
relatively consistent year-over-year rate of Corporate allocated costs. During the first
quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company will modify the way in which corporate costs are allocated
to the business segments, to better align corporate spending with the business segments based
on the benefits received. The presentation of the first quarter of fiscal 2006 results will
include a re-allocation of the historical segment amounts for comparative purposes.

During fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, corporate operating earnings include unallocated
Corporate administrative expenses, costs not attributable to the operations of the segments and
certain other Corporate directed costs described below:

•

Investment spending – The Company has encouraged its business units to identify
investment projects which will provide future returns. These projects typically require
incremental strategic investments in the form of additional capital or operating expenses.
As approval decisions for such projects are dependent upon Corporate management, the
expenses for such projects are retained at the Corporate segment. Investment spending for
fiscal years, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $18.0 million, $48.3 million and $58.0 million,
respectively.

•

Interest income adjustment – At the direction of Corporate management, the former
Automation and Information Services segment sold portions of its leased asset portfolio and
transferred the proceeds to Corporate. As the capital proceeds associated with these sales
have not been redeployed within the business segment, but utilized for other general
corporate purposes, the segment was allocated a benefit by Corporate for the interest
income that would have been earned associated with these sold leases. In fiscal 2004, the
segment received a $21 million allocation from Corporate. Effective the first quarter of
fiscal 2005, the Pyxis products business did not receive an allocation adjustment from
Corporate for the estimated interest income related to the sale of certain lease
portfolios.

•

Foreign exchange adjustments – Effective the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the
Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment changed its basis for measuring the impact
of translating foreign subsidiaries’ operating results into U.S. dollars. Historically
since 2000, this segment’s revenue and operating earnings were not impacted by foreign
exchange fluctuations as the Company applied constant exchange rates to translate its
foreign operating results into U.S. dollars and recorded the actual impact of foreign
exchange rate changes within the Corporate segment. For fiscal 2004 and 2003, $11.2
million and $17.5 million of expenses were allocated to Corporate representing the
difference between “constant rates” and “actual” exchange rates. Effective the first
quarter of fiscal 2005, the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations were included in the
Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment.

(7)

The cost of the Company’s shared service center in Albuquerque New Mexico, which was
previously reported within the Corporate segment, has been reclassified within the Medical
Products and Services operating earnings for fiscal 2004 and 2003 to more accurately reflect
the costs within the segment that received the benefits from the shared service center. The
cost of these services was approximately $18.2 million, $18.4 million and $19.0 million,
respectively, for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003.

The Corporate assets primarily include cash and cash equivalents, net property and equipment

20. GUARANTEES

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.”
This interpretation enhances a guarantor’s disclosure requirements in its interim and annual
financial statements regarding obligations under certain guarantees. The Company adopted the
enhanced disclosure requirements in the second quarter of fiscal 2003. The initial recognition and
measurement provisions of the interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees
issued or modified after December 31, 2002.

The Company has contingent commitments related to certain operating lease agreements (see Note
10). These operating leases consist of certain real estate and equipment used in the operations of
the Company. In the event of termination of these operating leases, which range in length from one
to ten years, the Company guarantees reimbursement for a portion of any unrecovered property cost.
At June 30, 2005, the maximum amount the Company could be required to reimburse was $278.5 million.
During fiscal 2005, the Company decided to repurchase certain buildings and equipment of
approximately $132.3 million which were previously under operating lease agreements. In addition,
certain of these leases qualified as capital lease obligations, and accordingly, the Company
recorded approximately $81.1 million of property and equipment offset by long-term liabilities on
its balance sheet at June 30, 2005. Based upon current market information obtained from a third
party valuation expert, the Company believed that the payment obligation under certain leases would
exceed the proceeds from the sale of related properties and equipment. Therefore, the Company
recorded impairment charges during fiscal 2005. See Note 21 below for additional information
regarding these impairment charges. In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 45, the Company
recorded a liability of $3.8 million as of June 30, 2005 related to these agreements.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company, from time to time, agrees to indemnify
certain other parties under agreements with the Company, including under acquisition and
disposition agreements, customer agreements and intellectual property licensing agreements. Such
indemnification obligations vary in scope and, when defined, in duration. In many cases, a maximum
obligation is not explicitly stated and, therefore, the overall maximum amount of the liability
under such indemnification obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Where appropriate, such
indemnification obligations are recorded as a liability. Historically, the Company has not,
individually or in the aggregate, made payments under these indemnification obligations in any
material amounts. In certain circumstances, the Company believes that its existing insurance
arrangements, subject to the general deduction and exclusion provisions, would cover portions of
the liability that may arise from these indemnification obligations. In addition, the Company
believes that the likelihood of material liability being triggered under these indemnification
obligations is not significant.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company, from time to time, enters into agreements
that obligate the Company to make fixed payments upon the occurrence of certain events. Such
obligations primarily relate to obligations arising under acquisition transactions, where the
Company has agreed to make payments based upon the achievement of certain financial performance
measures by the acquired business. Generally, the obligation is capped at an explicit amount. The
Company’s aggregate exposure for these obligations, assuming the achievement of all financial
performance measures, is not material. Any potential payment for these obligations would be
treated as an adjustment to the purchase price of the related entity and would
have no impact on the Company’s results of operations.

21. IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AND OTHER

The Company classifies certain asset impairments related to restructurings in special items,
which are included in operating earnings within the consolidated statements of earnings. Asset
impairments not eligible to be classified as special items and gains and losses from the sale of
assets were historically classified in “interest expense and other” within the consolidated
statements of earnings. Significant asset impairments were incurred during fiscal 2005 and are
expected to be incurred in the future due to the Company’s global restructuring program and ongoing
strategic planning efforts. Effective the second quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company presented
asset impairments and gains and losses not eligible to be classified as special items within
“impairment charges and other” within the consolidated statements of earnings. These asset
impairment charges were included within the Corporate segment’s results. Prior period financial
results were reclassified to conform to this change in presentation.

During fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded charges/(gains) of $118.0 million,
$(11.5) million and $9.0 million, respectively. With respect to the significant asset impairments
recorded during fiscal 2005, the Company incurred the following impairments:

With respect to the significant items recorded during fiscal 2004, the Company incurred the
following:

•

A net gain of approximately $8.7 million related to the sale of a non-strategic business
within its Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment.

•

A net gain of approximately $6.8 million related to the sale of land within its Medical
Products and Services segment.

•

A net gain of approximately $6.3 million related to the sale of a non-strategic business
within its Medical Products and Services segment.

•

The Company recorded a $4.2 million asset impairment charge relating to domestic
intellectual property rights within its former Automation and Information Services segment.

With respect to the significant items recorded during fiscal 2003, the Company incurred the
following:

•

A net gain of approximately $17.6 million related to the sale of a non-strategic
business within the Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services segment.

•

Impairment of $7.9 million related to certain obsolete assets as a result of a system
implementation within the Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment.

•

Impairment of $6.0 million related to two investments within the Company’s former
Automation and Information Services segment.

•

Impairment of $5.5 million related to an aircraft within the Corporate entity which met
all criteria to be classified as held for sale during the second quarter of fiscal 2003.

22. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In connection with the acquisition of Syncor, the Company acquired certain operations of
Syncor that were discontinued. Prior to the acquisition, Syncor announced the discontinuation of
certain operations including the medical imaging business and certain overseas operations. The
Company continued with these plans and added additional international and non-core domestic
businesses to the discontinued operations. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” the net assets and results of operations of these
businesses were presented as discontinued operations. The Company sold substantially all of the
remaining discontinued operations prior to the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2005. The net
assets at June 30, 2004 for the discontinued operations are included within the Pharmaceutical
Technologies and Services segment.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company recorded a gain of approximately $18.7
million related to the sale of the Radiation Management Services business within the Company’s
Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment. This business unit was not previously classified
as discontinued operations as it did not qualify in accordance with SFAS No. 144 until the second
quarter of fiscal 2005. The assets, liabilities and results of operations related to this business
were not included in the tables below as the amounts were not significant.

The
results of discontinued operations for the fiscal years ended
June 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 are
summarized as follows:

There was no interest expense allocated to discontinued operations for fiscal 2005, as a note
assumed in connection with the Syncor acquisition was paid off in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2004. Interest expense allocated to discontinued operations was $0.2 million and $0.5 million for
fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. Interest expense was allocated to the discontinued operations
based upon a ratio of the net assets of discontinued operations versus the overall net assets of
Syncor.

At June 30, 2005 and 2004 the major components of assets and liabilities of the discontinued
operations were as follows:

consolidated statements of cash flows.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

23. INVESTMENTS

At June 30, 2005 the Company invested approximately $79.8 million in tax exempt variable
demand notes and approximately $20.0 million in tax exempt auction rate securities. These
short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale on the Company’s consolidated balance
sheet. The interest rate payable on these investments resets every seven days, and the investments
are automatically reinvested unless the Company provides notice of intent to liquidate to the
broker. The Company’s investments in these securities are recorded at cost, which approximates
fair market value due to their variable interest rates. The underlying maturities of these
investments range from eight to thirty-five years. The bonds are issued by municipalities and
other tax exempt entities, but are backed by letters of credit from the banking institutions that
broker the debt placements. All of the investments are held in the custody of major financial
institutions.

At June 30, 2005, the Company also held a $16.7 million cost investment. The entity invested
in is continuously incurring losses. The Company believes this investment is impaired; however, it
believes the impairment to be temporary. Therefore, no impairment has been recorded at June 30,
2005. The entity is a start up organization and it was expected to incur losses through its fiscal
year 2005. The entity has strong cash flow and believes that it will be profitable in its fiscal
year 2006. The Company will continue to evaluate this investment for impairment and will recognize
a loss if the investment is deemed other-than-temporarily impaired.

24. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

In the proxy statement for its 2004 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the Company
disclosed that it had discovered in 2004 that a portion of an option to purchase 1,425,000 of the
Company’s Common Shares (giving effect to stock splits occurring after the date of grant) that had
been granted in November 1999 to Robert D. Walter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the
Company, was in excess of that permitted to be granted to a single individual during any fiscal
year under the Company’s Amended and Restated Equity Incentive Plan (the “Equity Incentive Plan”).
The maximum number of Common Shares as to which option awards could be granted pursuant to the
terms of the Equity Incentive Plan was 562,500 Common Shares (although the Company would have been
permitted at the time to make a larger grant outside of such Equity Incentive Plan).

In order to satisfy the original intent and understanding of the Company with respect to the
1999 option award, and after consulting with its outside compensation consultant, on August 2,
2005, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors approved a
grant to Mr. Walter, in lieu of the portion of the 1999 option award in excess of the share
limitation and in full satisfaction of any claims with respect to such portion, of a deferred
payment stock appreciation right (the “SAR”) with respect to 862,500 Common Shares. Following
ratification by the Board of Directors, the agreement between Mr. Walter and the Company setting
forth the terms of the SAR grant (the “SAR Agreement”) was executed on August 3, 2005. Under the
terms of the SAR Agreement, upon exercise of the SAR, Mr. Walter will become entitled to receive
cash in an amount equal to the fair market value per underlying Common Share on the date of
exercise minus $31.167, the original exercise price of the 1999 option award, multiplied by the
number of Common Shares as to which the SAR is being exercised. Consistent with the fact that the
1999 option award is fully vested, the SAR is fully vested and has a term expiring on November 15,
2009, the expiration date of the 1999 option award (or, if earlier, on the six-month anniversary of
Mr. Walter’s termination of employment). In order to comply with Section 409A of the Code, and to
avoid potential loss to the Company of a tax deduction under Section 162(m) of the Code, any
payment due to Mr. Walter will be deferred until six months following his termination of
employment, and will be credited with interest at the Prime Rate from the date of exercise until
the payment date. Any such payment will be subject to applicable tax withholding. The SAR
Agreement contains a confirmation and agreement by Mr. Walter and the Company that the portion of
the 1999 option award in excess of the share limitation is null and void. The 1999 option to
purchase 562,500 Common Shares which was not in excess of the maximum number permitted under the
Equity Incentive Plan remains outstanding and continues to be governed by the terms of the original
option agreement. The SAR Agreement also provides for reimbursement of certain legal fees incurred
by Mr. Walter in connection with the SAR and a March 2005 deferred payment stock appreciation right
grant.

Also subsequent to June 30, 2005, the Company decided to repurchase certain buildings and
equipment of approximately $133.6 million that were under both operating and capital lease
agreements at June 30, 2005. The amounts under capital lease agreements were recorded in
“long-term obligations, less current portion” within the Company’s consolidated balance sheets
at June 30, 2005, due to the original maturity date of February 2009. See Notes 6, 10 and 20
above for additional information regarding these lease agreements.



Item 9: Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9a: Controls and Procedures

The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance
that information required to be disclosed in its reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this
Form 10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC rules and forms. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure
that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. The Company’s internal controls are designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of its consolidated
financial statements in conformity with GAAP.

As disclosed in Notes 1 and 2 in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” and described in
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” prior to
filing the 2004 Form 10-K, the Company made certain reclassification and restatement adjustments to
its fiscal 2004 and prior historical consolidated financial statements as a result of the internal
review undertaken by the Audit Committee with respect to certain accounting matters. Specifically,
the Company restated its consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 and
the first three quarters of fiscal 2004, reclassified certain categories of revenue, reduced its
fourth quarter fiscal 2004 results for premature revenue recognition in its former Automation and
Information Services segment, and expanded disclosure. The reclassification and restatement
adjustments were reflected in the 2004 Form 10-K.

In connection with the Audit Committee’s internal review, since the end of fiscal 2004, the
Company has adopted and is in the process of implementing various measures in connection with the
Company’s ongoing efforts to improve its internal control processes and corporate governance.
These measures include the following:



The
Company believes that the implementation of the enhancements
identified above, as well as other control and governance
enhancements, have
remediated the “material weaknesses” (as defined under
standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board) in the Company’s entity level controls relating to the Company’s
control environment through June 30, 2004 and with respect
to the timing of revenue recognition within the Company’s former
Automation and Information
Services segment, which material weaknesses were identified and communicated to the Company by its independent auditors prior to the filing of the 2004
Form 10-K.

In addition, the Company and the Audit Committee will continue to implement enhancements in
the Company’s control processes as necessary in response to specific accounting and reporting
issues arising out of the Audit Committee’s internal review. The Company will continue to develop
policies and procedures and reinforce compliance with existing policies and procedures in the
Company’s effort to constantly improve its internal control environment.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

.

The Company carried out an
evaluation, as required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, with the participation of the
Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2005. Based on this evaluation, the
Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2005.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

. Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company’s internal control system is
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of
published financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems
determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of June 30, 2005. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established
in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (the “COSO criteria”).

Based on management’s assessment and the COSO criteria, management believes that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2005.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an
attestation report on management’s assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting. Ernst & Young LLP’s report appears below under this Item 9a and expresses unqualified
opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting.

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

.

With the
exception of certain of the measures detailed above, including the
Company appointing a new Chief Financial Officer, a new Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer and a
new Chief Accounting Officer and Controller during the quarter ended June 30, 2005, there were no
changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June
30, 2005 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal
control over financial reporting.



Significant Deficiencies

.

As noted above, management’s assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2005 did not result in
the identification of any material weaknesses. However, the Company has identified a limited number of
“significant deficiencies” (as defined under standards by
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) that do not, in the
aggregate, rise to the level of a material weakness. The Company has
developed specific action plans to address each of these significant
deficiencies.

The Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and the principal
financial officer, does not expect that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures and its
internal control processes will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how
well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the
fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative
to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any,
within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that
judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error
or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by
collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any
system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals
under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error
or fraud may occur and may not be detected. The Company monitors its disclosure controls and
procedures and internal controls and makes modifications as necessary; the Company’s intent in this
regard is that the disclosure controls and procedures and the internal controls will be maintained
as dynamic systems that change (including with improvements and
corrections) as conditions warrant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and
as discussed above under this Item 9a, the Company’s principal executive officer and
principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2005. In addition, also as discussed above, the
Company’s management believes that the Company maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2005.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM OF MANAGEMENT’S

ASSESSMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Shareholders and the

Board of Directors of Cardinal Health, Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying “Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,” that Cardinal Health, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
“Company”) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2005,
based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). The Company’s management
is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of June 30, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on
the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2005, based on the COSO
criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Cardinal Health, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of June 30, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of earnings,
shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2005
and our report dated September 9, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Equity Compensation Plan Information

Certain
of the Company’s equity compensation plans are subject to
shareholder approval and other plans have been authorized
solely by the Board of Directors. The following is a description of the Company’s plans that have
not been approved by shareholders.

Broadly-based Equity Incentive Plan, as amended

The Company’s Broadly-based Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the “Broadly-based Equity
Incentive Plan”), was adopted by the Board of Directors effective November 15, 1999 and amended
pursuant to resolutions of the Board of Directors adopted on August 8, 2001. The plan provides for
grants in the form of nonqualified stock options, restricted shares and restricted share units to
employees of the Company. The aggregate number of Common Shares authorized for issuance pursuant
to the plan is 36 million with no more than 10% of the authorized amount issuable in the
form of restricted shares and restricted share units having a restriction period of less than three
years. The plan is not intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code and is not subject to
any of the provisions of ERISA.

Amended and Restated Outside Directors Equity Incentive Plan

The Company’s Amended and Restated Outside Directors Equity Incentive Plan (the “Outside
Directors Equity Incentive Plan”) was adopted by the Board of Directors effective May 10, 2000 and
amended and restated pursuant to resolutions of the Board of Directors adopted on August 3, 2005.
The plan provides for grants in the form of nonqualified stock options, restricted shares and
restricted share units to members of the Board of Directors who are not employees of the Company. The aggregate
number of Common Shares authorized for issuance pursuant to the plan is 1.5 million. The plan is
not intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code and is not subject to any of the
provisions of ERISA.



Deferred Compensation Plan, as amended and restated

The Company’s Deferred Compensation Plan, as amended and restated effective January 1, 2005
(the “Deferred Compensation Plan”), was adopted by the Board of Directors effective April 7, 1994.
On December 8, 2004, the Deferred Compensation Plan was amended and restated effective January 1,
2005 to reflect the consolidation of the Company’s Directors Deferred Compensation Plan, as amended
and restated, with and into the Deferred Compensation Plan for Company executives and to address
changes required of nonqualified deferred compensation plans by new Section 409A of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, enacted as part of the AJCA. The plan permits certain management
employees of the Company to defer salary and bonus into any of several investment alternatives,
including a stock equivalent account. In addition, the Company may, in its discretion, make
additional matching or fixed contributions to the deferred balances of participating management
employees. The plan also permits directors of the Company to defer board fees into any of several
investment alternatives, including a stock equivalent account. Deferrals into the stock equivalent
account are valued as if each deferral were invested in the Company’s Common Shares as of the
deferral date.

For management employees, deferred balances are paid upon retirement, termination from
employment, death or disability. For directors, deferred balances are paid upon retirement or
other termination from board service, death or disability. The maximum aggregate number of Common
Shares that can be credited to stock equivalent accounts pursuant to the plan is 2.34 million.
Deferred balances are paid in cash, or in Common Shares in kind, with any fractional shares paid in
cash. The plan contains a dividend reinvestment feature for the stock equivalent account with
dividends generally being reinvested in investment options other than the stock equivalent account
for reporting persons under Section 16 of the Exchange Act. The plan is not intended to qualify
under Section 401(a) of the Code and is exempt from many of the provisions of ERISA as a “top hat”
plan for a select group of management or highly compensated employees.

Global Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended

The Company’s Global Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended (the “Global Employee Stock
Purchase Plan”), was adopted by the Board of Directors effective August 11, 1999 and amended by
action of the Plan Administrator on April 7, 2005. The plan permits certain international
employees to purchase Common Shares through payroll deductions. The total number of Common Shares
made available for purchase under the plan is 4.5 million. International employees who have been
employed by the Company for at least 30 days may be eligible to contribute from 1% to 15% of
eligible compensation. The purchase price is determined by the lower of 85% of the closing market
price on the first day of the offering period or 85% of the closing market price on the last day of
the offering period. During any given calendar year, there are two offering periods: January
1–June 30; and July 1–December 31. The plan is not intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the
Code and is not subject to any of the provisions of ERISA.

Under the Company’s Amended and Restated Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the “Equity
Incentive Plan”),which was approved by the Company’s shareholders in November 1995, the total
number of Common Shares available for grant of awards under the plan is an amount equal to the sum
of (a) 1.5% of the total outstanding Common Shares as of the last day of



the Company’s immediately
preceding fiscal year, plus (b) the number of Common Shares available for grant under the plan as
of November 23, 1998, plus (c) any Common Shares related to awards that expire or are unexercised,
forfeited, terminated, cancelled, settled in such a manner that all or some of the Common Shares
covered by an award are not issued to a participant, or returned to the Company in payment of the
exercise price or tax withholding obligations in connection with outstanding awards, plus (d) any
unused portion of the Common Shares available under clause (a) above for the previous two fiscal
years as a result of not being used in such previous two fiscal years.

(2)

In addition to stock options outstanding under the Equity Incentive Plan, also includes 468,963
restricted share units outstanding under the Equity Incentive Plan that are payable solely in
Common Shares. Restricted share units do not have an exercise price, and therefore were not
included for purposes of computing the weighted-average exercise price.

(3)

Includes approximately 18.5 million Common Shares remaining available for future issuance under
the Equity Incentive Plan in the form of option, restricted share, restricted share unit,
performance share, performance share unit and incentive compensation restricted share awards. Also

under the Broadly-based Equity Incentive Plan that are payable solely in Common Shares. Also
includes 43,740 Common Share units outstanding under the Deferred Compensation Plan that are
payable solely in Common Shares. These awards do not have an exercise price, and therefore were
not included for purposes of computing the weighted-average exercise price.

(5)

Includes: approximately 3.2 million Common Shares remaining available for future issuance under
the Broadly-based Equity Incentive Plan in the form of option, restricted share or restricted share
unit awards; approximately 1.4 million Common Shares remaining available for future
issuance under the Outside Director Equity Incentive Plan in the form of option or restricted share
awards; approximately 2.3 million Common Shares remaining available for future
issuance under the Deferred Compensation Plan; and approximately 4.3 million Common
Shares remaining available for future issuance under the Global Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

(6)

Includes options to purchase approximately 1.4 million Common Shares in the aggregate that
were assumed by the Company in connection with acquisitions that were approved by the Company’s
shareholders. The remaining options to purchase approximately
2.7 million Common Shares in the
aggregate were assumed by the Company in connection with acquisitions that were not approved by the
Company’s shareholders
