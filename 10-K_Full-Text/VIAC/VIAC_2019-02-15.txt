The Company’s principal strategy is to create and acquire premium content that is widely accepted by audiences and generate affiliate and subscription fee, licensing and advertising revenues from the distribution of this content on multiple media platforms and to various geographic locations. The Company plans to increase its investment in premium content to enhance its opportunities for revenue growth, which include exhibiting the Company’s content on its direct-to-consumer digital streaming services; expanding the distribution of its content internationally; and securing compensation from multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), including cable, direct broadcast satellite (“DBS”), telephone company, and other distributors, as well as third-party live television digital streaming offerings (“virtual MVPDs”), for authorizing the MVPDs’ and virtual MVPDs’ carriage of the Company’s owned television stations (also known as “retransmission fees”) and cable networks, and securing compensation from television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network (“station affiliation fees,” also known as “reverse compensation”). The Company also seeks to grow its advertising revenues by monetizing all content viewership as industry measurements evolve to reflect viewers’ changing habits.

I-


The Company competes with many different entities and media in various markets worldwide. In addition to competition in each of its businesses, the Company competes for opportunities in the entertainment business with other diversified entertainment companies such as The Walt Disney Company, NBCUniversal Media, LLC, Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. and the WarnerMedia segment of AT&T Inc., formerly Time Warner Inc.

During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company began presenting CBS Sports Network in the Entertainment segment to reflect changes in management structure and the integration of CBS Sports Network programming with the CBS Television Network.  CBS Sports Network was previously included in the Cable Networks segment. Results for all periods presented have been reclassified to conform to this presentation. Also during the fourth quarter of 2018, in connection with recent management changes, the Company implemented changes to its programming strategy, primarily at CBS Films, which will shift its focus from theatrical films to developing content for the Company’s direct-to-consumer digital streaming services.

As of February 13, 2019, National Amusements, Inc. (“NAI”), a closely held corporation that owns and operates approximately 950 movie screens in the U.S., the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and South America and manages 4 movie screens in South America, directly or indirectly owned approximately 79.8% of the Company’s voting Class A Common Stock, and approximately 10.5% of the Company’s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock on a combined basis.

Television Network.

The CBS Television Network through CBS Entertainment™, CBS News

®

and CBS Sports

®

distributes a comprehensive schedule of news and public affairs broadcasts, sports and entertainment programming to more than 200 domestic affiliates reaching throughout the U.S., including 15 of the Company’s owned and operated television stations, and to affiliated stations in certain U.S. territories.

The CBS Television Network primarily derives revenues from the sale of advertising time for its network broadcasts. A significant portion of the sale of advertising spots for the network’s non-sports programming occurs annually generally during May through July in the industry’s upfront advertising market for the upcoming television broadcast season, which runs for one year generally commencing in mid-September. Overall advertising revenue for the network is also impacted by audience ratings for its programming and market conditions, including demand in the scatter advertising market, in which advertisers purchase the remaining advertising spots closer to the broadcast of the related programming. The Company offers dynamic advertising insertions for the CBS Television Network’s on-demand programming, which allows the Company to change advertisements at any time within such programming and offer advertisers greater audience reach.  The Company is focused on developing advanced advertising products

I-


that enable advertisers to target specific audience segments. In addition, the CBS Television Network’s revenues include station affiliation fees.

CBS Entertainment is responsible for acquiring or developing and scheduling the entertainment programming presented on the CBS Television Network, which includes primetime comedy and drama series, reality‑based programming, specials, children’s programs, daytime dramas, game shows and late-night programs such as

The Late Show with Stephen Colbert

. During 2018, the CBS Television Network broadcast the Tony Awards

®

, the Kennedy Center Honors and the Grammy

Awards

®

.  The Company won 20 awards at the 45

th

Annual Daytime Emmy

®

Awards in April 2018. CBS News operates a worldwide news organization, providing the CBS Television Network and CBS News Radio™ with regularly scheduled news and public affairs broadcasts, including

60 Minutes

,

,

as well as special reports. CBS News also provides CBS Newspath

®

, a television news syndication service that offers daily news coverage, sports highlights and news features to the CBS Television Network affiliates and other subscribers worldwide. CBS Sports broadcasts on the television network include

The Company’s most recent Super Bowl broadcast was in February 2019.

platforms under the Company’s multi-year deal with the NFL.  Digital streaming services that provide video content, including from broadcast and/or cable channels, streamed via the internet to users who are not required to have a subscription to an MVPD (such as virtual MVPDs and direct-to-consumer services) are known as over-the-top or “OTT” services. Digital streaming services that do not require payment to a third party are known as “direct-to-consumer” services, such as

CBS All Access

.

CBS All Access

and

CBSN

are available at

CBS.com

and

CBSNews.com

™, respectively, and/or through CBS apps on multiple digital platforms, including Android, iOS, Amazon Fire and Windows 10 mobile platforms, and Amazon Fire TV, Android TV, Apple TV, Amazon Channels, Chromecast, PlayStation, Roku, Samsung Smart TVs and Xbox connected device platforms, among others.

The CW, a broadcast network and the Company’s 50/50 joint venture with Warner Bros. Entertainment, airs programming, including

Charmed

,

Dynasty

,

Supergirl

and

The Flash

. Eight of the Company’s owned television stations are affiliates of The CW. Certain of The CW’s series are streamed on Netflix, a subscription video-on-demand service.  The CW programming is also available via The CW app on multiple digital platforms, including Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Chromecast, Roku, Xbox and mobile devices.

Television Production and Syndication.

CBS Television Studios and CBS Global Distribution Group produce, acquire and/or distribute programming worldwide, including series, specials, news and public affairs, and generate revenue principally from the licensing and distribution of such programming. The programming is produced primarily for broadcast on network television, exhibition on basic cable and premium subscription services, streaming services or distribution via first-run syndication. First-run syndication is programming exhibited on television stations without prior exhibition on a network or cable service. The Company subsequently distributes programming after its initial exhibition on a network, basic cable network or premium subscription service for domestic exhibition on television

I-


stations, cable networks or streaming services (known as “off-network syndicated programming”). Off-network syndicated programming and first‑run syndicated programming distributed domestically, as well as programming distributed internationally, can sometimes be sold in successive cycles of sales known as “first cycle” sales, “second cycle” sales, and so on, which may occur on exclusive or non-exclusive bases. Generally, license fees may decrease with successive sales cycles due to increased program exhibitions.

Programming that was produced or co-produced by the Company’s production group and is broadcast on network television includes, among others,

FBI

(CBS),

Seal Team

(CBS),

NCIS

(CBS),

Bull

(CBS),

Magnum P.I.

(CBS),

Madam Secretary

(CBS),

Criminal Minds

(CBS),

Charmed

(The CW) and

Jane the Virgin

(The CW). Generally, a network will license a specified number of episodes for broadcast on the network in the U.S. during a license period. Remaining distribution rights, including international and/or off‑network syndication rights, are typically retained by the Company or, in the case of co-productions, distribution rights are shared with the co-producer for U.S. or international markets. The network license fee for a series episode is normally lower than the costs of producing the episode; however, the Company’s objective is to recoup its costs and earn a profit through various forms of distribution, including international licensing, domestic syndication and digital streaming of episodes. Generally, international sales of network series are made within one year of the U.S. network run and series must have a network run of at least three or four years to be successfully sold in domestic off-network syndication; however, increasingly, these time frames are being shortened, particularly for sales to digital streaming services. In off-network syndication, the Company distributes series, such as

Hawaii Five-O

,

Criminal Minds

,

Blue Bloods

,

Elementary

,

NCIS

,

NCIS: Los Angeles

and

NCIS: New Orleans

as well as a library of older television programs. The Company also produces and/or distributes first-run syndicated series such as

Wheel of Fortune

,

Jeopardy!

,

Entertainment Tonight

,

Inside Edition

,

Dr. Phil

,

The Doctors

,

Rachael Ray

,

Hot Bench

and

Judge Judy

and produces

The Good Fight

,

Star Trek: Discovery

,

No Activity

,

Strange Angel

and

Tell Me a Story

for streaming on

CBS All Access

. The Company also distributes syndicated and other programming internationally.

The Company continues to monetize its content through digital media.  It enters into and renews numerous multi-year licensing agreements for distribution of certain of its programming to various services reaching countries throughout the world, particularly the U.S., Canada and in Europe.  These services include digital streaming on subscription or advertiser-supported video-on-demand services, including services by Amazon, Bell Media, Hotstar, Netflix, Stan Entertainment and Telefonica; virtual MVPDs, including DIRECTV NOW, Hulu with Live TV and YouTube TV; and digital downloading on various electronic sell-through services owned by Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft, among others.

Fees for television programming licensed for syndication and digital streaming are recorded as revenues at the beginning of the license period in which the programs are made available for exhibition, which, among other reasons, may cause substantial fluctuations in the Entertainment segment’s operating results. Unrecognized revenues attributable to such license agreements were

$1.08 billion

and

$670 million

at

December 31, 2018

and

December 31, 2017

, respectively.

In November 2017, the Company acquired Ten Network Holdings Limited, one of three major commercial broadcast networks in Australia. Network 10 includes the channels


™,

10 Bold

™

and

10 Peach

™

Entertainment Competition.

Television Network.

The broadcast television environment is highly competitive. The principal methods of competition in broadcast television are the development and acquisition of popular programming and the development of audience interest through programming and promotion, in order to sell advertising at profitable rates. Broadcast networks like CBS compete for audience, advertising revenues and programming with other broadcast networks, such as ABC, FOX, NBC, The CW and MyNetworkTV, independent television stations, cable program services, as well as other media, including OTT services, such as Netflix and Hulu, DVDs and Blu-ray Discs, print and the internet. In addition, the CBS Television Network competes with the other broadcast networks to secure affiliations with independently owned television stations in markets across the country which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of network programming to a nationwide audience.

Television Production and Syndication.

As a producer and distributor of programming, the Company competes with studios, television production groups, and independent producers and syndicators, such as Disney, Fox, NBCUniversal, Sony and Warner Bros., as well as additional entrants with substantial resources, such as Amazon, Apple and Netflix, to produce and sell programming both domestically and internationally. The Company also competes to obtain creative talent and story properties which are essential to the success of all of the Company’s entertainment businesses. In addition, the consumer has many options for entertainment other than television

I-


programming, including video games, sports, travel, outdoor recreation, the internet, and other cultural and computer-related activities.

CBS Interactive.

CBS Interactive competes with a variety of online properties for users, advertisers, and partners, including the following: general purpose portals, such as AOL, MSN and Yahoo!; search engines such as Google, Yahoo! and Bing; online comparison shopping and retail properties, including Amazon.com; vertical content sites in the categories that CBS Interactive’s brands serve, such as technology, gaming, music, news, business, food, entertainment and lifestyle-focused digital properties; other content sites and apps, such as ESPN.com, HBO GO, Hulu and Netflix, as well as major television broadcast company digital properties, including digital streaming services and apps; and platforms such as blogs, podcasts and video properties. CBS Interactive also competes for users and advertisers with diversified media companies that provide both online and offline content, including magazines, cable television, network television, radio and newspapers.

CBS Sports Network.

CBS Sports Network principally competes with cable programming services, including other sports-oriented cable programming services, for distribution and license fee revenue among MVPDs and virtual MVPDs, as well as for viewership and advertising revenue. The effects of consolidation among MVPDs and consumer pricing sensitivity have made it more difficult for niche channels to secure broad distribution in mainstream programming packages. In addition, the largest cable providers have created sports tiers for sports programming services which have not, in many cases, achieved significant subscriber penetration or acceptance. CBS Sports Network continues its repositioning to be included in programming packages with more subscribers. Re-alignment of college athletic conferences and their member institutions may adversely impact CBS Sports Network’s programming arrangements. CBS Sports Network also competes with cable programming services generally, including other sports programming services, such as ESPN, FOX Sports Networks and NBC Sports Network, in acquiring the television and multimedia rights to sporting events, resulting in increased rights fees and increased production expenses.

CBS Films.

CBS Films competes for audience acceptance with programming produced and/or distributed by digital program services, including Amazon, Apple and Netflix, and numerous films produced and/or distributed by various studios and independent producers, including Paramount Pictures Corporation, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc., Lions Gate Entertainment, STX Entertainment, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. and Lakeshore Entertainment Group.

programming, and provides information and entertainment and other services.

Showtime Networks derives revenue principally from the license of its program services to numerous MVPDs, with a substantial portion of such revenue coming from three of the largest such distributors. The costs of acquiring exhibition rights to programming and producing original series are the principal expenses of Showtime Networks. Showtime Networks enters into commitments to acquire rights, with an emphasis on acquiring exclusive rights for

Showtime

and

The Movie Channel

, from motion picture studios and other distributors typically covering the U.S. and Bermuda for varying durations. Showtime Networks’ original series telecast in 2018 included

Homeland

,

Ray Donovan

,

and

Shameless

, among others.  In 2018, Showtime Networks also telecast limited series

Escape at Dannemora

and

Patrick Melrose

, documentary series, including

The Circus: Inside the Wildest Political Show on Earth

,

The Fourth Estate

,

The Trade

and

Showtime

subscribers and non-subscribers through the

Showtime

app and third-party distributors.

Showtime Networks has entered into and may from time to time enter into co-financing, co-production and/or distribution arrangements with other parties to reduce the net cost to Showtime Networks for its original programming. In addition, Showtime Networks derives revenue by licensing rights it retains in certain of its original programming. The Company enters into licensing arrangements with television networks, digital platforms, including Amazon and Netflix, and/or other media companies for the exhibition of certain

Showtime

original programming domestically and in various international territories.  For example, the Company has output agreements, including with Bell Media Inc. for Canada, with Sky-affiliated entities for Austria, Germany, Ireland, Italy and the U.K., with Moviestar + for Spain, with Canal + Group for France, with Fox Networks Group Asia for Southeast Asia, and with Hotstar’s streaming service for India.

Showtime Networks also owns a majority of and manages Smithsonian Networks, a venture with Smithsonian Institution, which operates

Smithsonian Channel

, a basic cable service in the U.S., featuring programs of a cultural, historical, scientific and educational nature. Smithsonian Networks makes

Smithsonian Channel

content available via MVPDs and virtual MVPDs in the U.S. and licenses

Smithsonian Channel

content outside of the U.S., including in connection with

Smithsonian Channel

in Canada, in which Smithsonian Networks owns a minority interest.  Smithsonian Networks also operates the Website

SmithsonianChannel.com

™ and various apps, which promote

Smithsonian Channel

programming and provide information and entertainment services.  Smithsonian Networks also operates

Smithsonian Channel Plus

, a direct-to-consumer digital streaming subscription service, which launched in December 2018, that allows subscribers to view on-demand programming, including 4K Ultra HD series and documentaries.

Cable Networks Competition.

Showtime Networks.

Showtime Networks primarily competes with other providers of premium subscription program services in the U.S., including Home Box Office, Inc. and Starz, LLC. Competition among these premium subscription program services in the U.S. is dependent on: (i) the production, acquisition and packaging of original series and other original programming and the acquisition and packaging of an adequate number of recently released theatrical motion pictures; and (ii) the offering of prices, marketing and advertising support and other incentives to distributors for carriage so as to favorably position and package Showtime Networks’ premium subscription program services to subscribers. In addition, Showtime Networks competes with digital subscription programming services, such as Amazon, Hulu and Netflix, for original programming, theatrical motion pictures and viewership. Showtime

I-


Networks also competes for programming, distribution and/or audiences with basic cable program services, broadcast television and other media, including video games and other internet apps.

Smithsonian Networks competes for programming, distribution and/or audiences with non‑fiction and other basic cable program services, including Discovery Channel, National Geographic Channel and History, as well as with broadcast television and other media.

The terms and favorable renewal of agreements with distributors for the distribution of the Company’s subscription program services are important to the Company.  The effects of industry consolidation and other marketplace factors make it more difficult to reach and maintain favorable terms and positioning, which could increase costs and have an adverse effect on revenues.

To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before

by Jenny Han.

Simon & Schuster Digital

™, through

SimonandSchuster.com

, publishes original content, builds reader communities and promotes and sells Simon & Schuster’s books over the internet.

The consumer publishing marketplace is subject to increased periods of demand in the summer months and during the end-of-year holiday season. Major new title releases represent a significant portion of Simon & Schuster’s sales throughout the year.  Simon & Schuster’s top two accounts drive a significant portion of its annual revenue.  Consumer print books are generally sold on a fully returnable basis, resulting in the return of unsold books. In the domestic and international markets, the Company is subject to global trends and local economic conditions. In 2018, the sale of digital content represented approximately 23% of Simon & Schuster’s revenues. The Company expects that digital content will continue to represent a significant portion of Simon & Schuster revenues in the coming years.

Publishing Competition.

The consumer publishing business is highly competitive and has been affected over the years by consolidation trends and electronic distribution methods and models. Mass merchandisers and on‑line retailers are significant factors in the industry contributing to the general trend toward consolidation in the retail channel. The growth of the electronic book market has impacted print book retailers and wholesalers and could result

I-


in a reduction of these channels for the sales and marketing of the Company’s books. In addition, unfavorable economic conditions and competition may adversely affect book retailers’ operations, including distribution of the Company’s books. The Company must compete with other larger publishers, such as Penguin Random House, Hachette and HarperCollins, for the rights to works by authors and sales to retailers and customers. Competition is particularly strong for well‑known authors and public personalities. In addition, technological changes have made it increasingly possible for authors to self‑publish and have led to the development of new digital distribution models in which the Company’s books must compete with the availability of both a larger volume of books as well as non-book content.

The Local Media segment is composed of CBS Television Stations, the Company’s 29 owned broadcast television stations, all of which operate under licenses granted by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”). The licenses are renewable every eight years. The Company’s television stations are located in the 5 largest, and 15 of the top 20, television markets in the U.S. The Company owns multiple television stations within the same designated market area (“DMA”) in 10 major markets. These multiple station markets are: New York (market #1), Los Angeles (market #2), Philadelphia (market #4), Dallas-Fort Worth (market #5), San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose (market #8), Boston (market #9), Detroit (market #14), Miami-Ft. Lauderdale (market #16), Sacramento-Stockton-Modesto (market #20), and Pittsburgh (market #24). This group of television stations enables the Company to reach a wide audience within and across geographically diverse markets in the U.S. The stations produce news and broadcast public affairs, sports and other programming to serve their local markets and offer CBS, The CW or MyNetworkTV programming and syndicated programming.

The CBS Television Stations group principally derives its revenues from the sale of advertising time on its television stations. In addition, the CBS Television Stations group receives retransmission fees from MVPDs for authorizing the MVPDs’ carriage of the Company’s owned television stations.  The Company also has agreements for the digital streaming of the Company’s owned television stations on virtual MVPDs, including DIRECTV NOW, Hulu with Live TV and YouTube TV.  The Company’s direct-to-consumer digital streaming subscription service,

CBS All Access

, offers an extensive on-demand selection of both current programming and library, original series as well as the ability to stream linear programming from local CBS Television Stations and most CBS television station affiliates.

CBS All Access

is available at

CBS.com

and through the CBS app on multiple digital platforms. In December 2018, the Company launched

CBSN New York

, a direct-to-consumer digital streaming live, advertiser-supported local news network available 24 hours a day, seven days a week that complements

CBSN

and streams news events from the Company’s owned television stations in New York. The Company’s television stations also have a digital presence on CBS local Websites which are operated by CBS Local Digital Media.  The local Websites and related apps promote the Company’s stations’ programming as well as provide live and on-demand news, traffic, weather, entertainment and sports information, among other services for their local communities. The local Websites principally derive revenues from the sale of advertising.   The “Television  Stations and CBS Local Websites” table below includes information with respect to these properties within U.S. television markets. CBS Television Stations and Weigel Broadcasting own and operate through an approximately 50/50 joint venture

Start TV

™, a national entertainment program service featuring classic television content, movies and original programming focused on female audiences for local television stations’ digital sub-channels, which utilize a local television station's available broadcast spectrum to provide a companion to that station's primary channel.

Local Media Competition.

Television stations compete for programming, on‑air talent, audiences and advertising revenues with other stations and cable networks in their respective coverage areas and, in some cases, with respect to programming, with other station groups, and, in the case of advertising revenues, with other local and national media. The owned and operated television stations’ competitive position is largely influenced by the quality of the syndicated programs and local news programs in time periods not programmed by the network; the strength of the CBS Television Network programming and, in particular, the viewership of the CBS Television Network in the time period immediately prior to the late evening news; and in some cases, by the quality of the broadcast signal. The Company’s television stations face increasing competition from technologies such as digital audio and visual content, which create new ways for audiences to consume content of their choosing while avoiding traditional commercial

I-


advertising. The Company’s television stations’ Websites face competition for advertisers and visitors from other digital sources of local content.

Television Stations and CBS Local Websites

I-


REGULATION

The Company’s businesses are subject to and/or affected by regulations of federal, state and local governmental authorities in the U.S. and of national, regional and local authorities in foreign countries. The rules, regulations, policies and procedures affecting these businesses are subject to change. The summaries below should be read in conjunction with the texts of the statutes, rules and regulations described herein. The descriptions do not describe all present and proposed statutes, rules and regulations affecting the Company’s businesses.

Intellectual Property and Privacy

Laws affecting intellectual property are of significant importance to the Company. (See “Intellectual Property” on page I-15 for more information on the Company’s brands).

Unauthorized Distribution of Copyrighted Content and Piracy.

Unauthorized distribution, reproduction, exhibition or other exploitation of copyrighted material in television programming, motion pictures, video clips and books, such as through unauthorized stored copies and live

streaming, internet downloads, file “sharing” and peer-to-peer services, is a threat to copyright owners’ ability to protect and exploit their property. The Company’s digital delivery services and commercial arrangements with digital content providers help reduce the risks associated with unauthorized access to its content. The Company is also engaged in enforcement and other activities to protect its intellectual property and participates in various litigation, public relations programs and legislative activity. These business strategies and enforcement efforts are dependent upon laws and practices that protect the rights of creators and authorized distributors of content.

Laws and Content.

The Company derives revenues from the creation and exploitation of creative content, for which the copyright law, including in the U.S. and other laws in other jurisdictions, grants certain exclusive rights, including to reproduce, publicly perform and distribute such content. The scope and duration of the protection afforded to the Company’s intellectual property depends on the type of property and the laws and regulations of the relevant jurisdiction.

Any changes to copyright laws or related regulations that enable the Company to control the distribution of its content, including through court decisions, which diminish the scope of a copyright owner’s exclusive rights could impact the Company. Proposed legal amendments, such as to the law governing territorial exclusivity of the distribution of content in Europe, could adversely impact the Company’s ability to control and distribute its content.

Privacy.

The U.S. and international laws and regulations governing the collection, use and transfer of consumer information are complex and rapidly evolving, particularly as they relate to the Company’s interactive businesses. The Company monitors and considers these laws and regulations in the design and operation of its Websites, digital content services and legal and regulatory compliance programs. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and could result in claims, changes to business practices, financial penalties for noncompliance, or otherwise harm the Company's business.  For example, the European Union’s (“EU”) General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) went into effect in May 2018 and applies to activities conducted from the Company's establishments in the EU or related to products and services that the Company offers to EU users.  The GDPR creates new data protection compliance obligations and significantly increases financial penalties for noncompliance. Compliance with evolving U.S. and international consumer privacy and data protection laws requires additional resources and efforts by the Company.

Broadcasting

General.

Television broadcasting is subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act. The Communications Act empowers the FCC, among other actions, to issue, renew, revoke and modify broadcasting licenses; determine stations’ frequencies, locations and operating power; regulate some of the equipment used by stations; adopt other regulations to carry out the provisions of the Communications Act and other laws, including requirements affecting the content of broadcasts; and impose penalties for violation of its regulations, including monetary forfeitures, short-term renewal of licenses and, in egregious cases, license revocation or denial of license renewals.

I-


Under the Communications Act, the FCC also regulates certain aspects of the operation of MVPDs and certain other electronic media that compete with broadcast stations.

Indecency and Profanity Regulation.

The FCC’s rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent or profane material between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. Broadcasters risk violating the prohibition against broadcasting indecent or profane material because the vagueness of the FCC’s indecency/profanity definition makes it difficult to apply, particularly with respect to spontaneous, live programming. The FCC’s maximum forfeiture penalty per station for broadcasting indecent or profane programming is approximately $407,000 per indecent or profane utterance, with a maximum forfeiture exposure of approximately $3.76 million for any continuing violation arising from a single act or failure to act. The Company has been involved in litigation and, from time to time, has received and may receive in the future letters of inquiry from the FCC prompted by complaints alleging that certain programming on its broadcast stations included indecent or profane material.

License Renewals.

Television broadcast licenses are typically granted for standard terms of eight years. The Communications Act requires the FCC to renew a broadcast license if the FCC finds that the station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity and, with respect to the station, there have been no serious violations by the licensee of either the Communications Act or the FCC’s rules and regulations and there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or the FCC’s rules and regulations that, taken together, constitute a pattern of abuse.  The Company has no pending renewal applications.  A station remains authorized to operate while its license renewal application is pending.

License Assignments and Transfers of Licensee Control.

The Communications Act requires prior FCC approval for the assignment of a license or transfer of control of an FCC licensee. Third parties may oppose the Company’s applications to assign, acquire, or transfer control of broadcast licenses.

Ownership Regulation.

The Communications Act and FCC rules and regulations limit the ability of individuals and entities to have certain official positions or ownership interests, known as “attributable” interests, above specific levels in broadcast stations. In seeking FCC approval for the acquisition of a broadcast station license, the acquiring person or entity must demonstrate that the acquisition complies with the FCC’s ownership rules or that a waiver of the rules is in the public interest.

Below are descriptions of broadcast ownership rules that are subject to current FCC review. The FCC is reviewing its local television ownership and dual network rules through its most recent quadrennial review that commenced in November 2018 and is separately reviewing its television national audience reach rule.

Local Television Ownership.

Under the FCC’s local television ownership rule, one party may own up to two television stations in the same DMA, so long as at least one of the two stations is not among the top-four ranked stations in the market based on audience share as of the date an application for approval of an acquisition is filed with the FCC.  A party may also own two television stations in the same DMA if the broadcast service contours of the stations do not overlap. In addition, the FCC will consider whether to permit acquisitions of a second top-four ranked television station in the same market on a case-by-case basis if doing so would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity.  “Satellite” television stations that simply rebroadcast the programming of a “parent” television station are exempt from the local television ownership rule if located in the same DMA as the “parent” station.  Low power television stations, which are authorized by the FCC to operate at significantly lower power levels than full-service stations, are exempt from FCC ownership rules.

Dual Network Rule.

The dual network rule prohibits any of the four major networks, ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC, from combining.

Television National Audience Reach Limitation.

Under the national television ownership rule, one party may not own television stations that reach more than 39% of all U.S. television households.  In April 2017, the FCC reinstated the UHF discount, which was subsequently upheld by a federal court of appeals, pursuant to which a UHF television station is attributed with reaching only 50% of the television households in its

I-


market.  In December 2017, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking pursuant to which it will consider modifying, retaining or eliminating the 39% national television audience reach limitation and/or the UHF discount.  The Company currently owns and operates television stations that reach approximately 38% of all U.S. television households not taking into account the UHF discount.

Attribution of Ownership.

Under the FCC’s attribution rules, a direct or indirect purchaser of various types of securities of an entity which holds FCC licenses, such as the Company, could violate the foregoing FCC ownership regulations or policies if that purchaser owned or acquired an “attributable” interest in other media properties. Under the FCC’s rules, an “attributable” interest for purposes of the FCC’s broadcast ownership rules generally includes: equity and debt interests which combined exceed 33% of a licensee’s total assets, if the interest holder supplies more than 15% of the licensee’s total weekly programming, or has an attributable same-market media interest, whether television, radio, cable or newspaper; a 5% or greater direct or indirect voting stock interest, including certain interests held in trust, unless the holder is a qualified passive investor, in which case the threshold is a 20% or greater voting stock interest; any equity interest in a limited liability company or a partnership, including a limited partnership, unless the interest holder is properly “insulated” from management activities; and any position as an officer or director of a licensee or of its direct or indirect parent. The FCC is reviewing its single majority voting stockholder attribution exemption, which renders as non‑attributable voting interests up to 49% in a licensee controlled by a single majority voting stockholder.  Because NAI holds an attributable interest in both the Company and Viacom Inc., the business of each company is attributable to the other for certain FCC purposes, which may have the effect of limiting and affecting the activities, strategic business alternatives and business terms available to the Company. (See Item 1A. “Risk Factors-The businesses of the Company and Viacom Inc. will be attributable to the other company for certain regulatory purposes, which may limit business opportunities”).

Alien Ownership.

In general, the Communications Act prohibits foreign individuals or entities from owning more than 25% of the voting power or equity of the Company.  FCC approval is required to exceed the 25% threshold.  The FCC has recently approved foreign ownership levels of up to 100% in certain instances, subsequent to its review and approval of specific, named foreign individuals.

Cable and Satellite Carriage of Television Broadcast Stations.

The 1992 Cable Act and implementing FCC regulations govern the retransmission of commercial television stations by cable television operators. Every three years, a television station must elect, with respect to cable systems within its DMA, either “must carry” status, pursuant to which the cable system’s carriage of the station is mandatory, or “retransmission consent,” pursuant to which the station gives up its right to mandatory carriage and secures instead the right to negotiate consideration in return for consenting to carriage. Since 2006, the Company has implemented a systematic process of seeking monetary consideration for its retransmission consent.

Similarly, federal legislation and FCC rules govern the retransmission of broadcast television stations by DBS operators. DBS operators are required to carry the signals of all local television broadcast stations requesting carriage in local markets in which the DBS operator carries at least one signal pursuant to the statutory local-to-local compulsory copyright license. Every three years, each television station in such markets must elect “must carry” or “retransmission consent” status, in a manner similar to that described above with respect to cable systems.  The Company’s owned and operated television stations are being transmitted into their local markets by the two major DBS operators pursuant to retransmission consent agreements.

Children’s Television Programming.

FCC rules require television stations to broadcast on their main program stream three hours per week of educational and informational programming (“E/I programming”) designed for children 16 years of age and younger. FCC rules also impose E/I programming requirements on each additional digital multicast program stream transmitted by television stations, with the requirement increasing in proportion to the additional hours of free programming offered on multicast channels. These rules also limit the display during children’s programming of internet addresses of Websites that contain or link to commercial material or that use program characters to sell products. Regulations also limit the amount and content of commercial matter that may be shown on television stations during programming designed for children 12 years of age and younger. The FCC is considering relaxing certain of the E/I programming rules.

I-


Program Access.

Under the Communications Act, vertically integrated cable programmers (more fully described below) are generally prohibited from offering different prices, terms or conditions for programming to competing MVPDs unless the differential is justified by certain permissible factors set forth in the FCC’s regulations.   The FCC also assesses the competitive impact of exclusive distribution arrangements between vertically integrated cable programmers and cable operators on a complaint-based process, using a case-by-case review.  A cable programmer is considered to be vertically integrated under the FCC’s program access attribution rules if it owns or is owned in whole or in part by either a cable operator or a telephone company that provides video programming directly to subscribers.

The Company’s wholly owned program services are not currently subject to the program access rules. The Company’s flexibility to negotiate the most favorable terms available for carriage of these services and its ability to offer cable operators exclusive programming could be adversely affected if it were to become subject to the program access rules. Because the Company and Viacom Inc. are under common control by NAI, Viacom Inc.’s businesses could be attributable to the Company for purposes of the FCC’s program access rules. (See Item 1A. “Risk Factors-The businesses of the Company and Viacom Inc. will be attributable to the other company for certain regulatory purposes, which may limit business opportunities”).

National Broadband Plan/Post-Auction Repack

.  In 2017, the FCC concluded a series of voluntary auctions to repurpose certain spectrum then utilized by broadcast television stations for use by wireless broadband services. The FCC has mandated that certain television stations that are continuing to operate subsequent to these auctions must change their channels as the FCC “repacks” the remaining spectrum dedicated to broadcast television use.  Congress provided that the FCC will assist television stations in retaining their current coverage areas and established a fund to at least partially reimburse broadcasters for reasonable relocation expenses relating to the spectrum-repacking. Certain broadcast television stations, including some of those owned by the Company, are in the process of undertaking this repacking process and seeking reimbursement of associated costs.

Broadcast Transmission Standard

.  In November 2017, the FCC adopted rules to permit television broadcasters to voluntarily broadcast using the “Next Generation” broadcast television transmission standard developed by the Advanced Television Systems Committee, Inc., also called “ATSC 3.0.” Those full-service television stations using the new standard are subject to certain requirements, including the obligation to continue broadcasting a generally identical program stream in the current ATSC 1.0 broadcast standard.  The ATSC 3.0 standard can be used to offer better picture quality and improved mobile broadcast viewing.  A television station converting to ATSC 3.0 operation will incur significant costs in equipment purchases and upgrade. In addition, consumers may be required to obtain new television sets or other equipment that are capable of receiving ATSC 3.0 broadcasts.  The Company is participating in various ATSC 3.0 testing with other broadcasters, but it is too early to predict any impact of this technical standard on the Company’s operations.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD

‑

LOOKING STATEMENTS

This document, including “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition,” and the documents incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K, contain both historical and forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts, but rather reflect the Company’s current expectations concerning future results and events. These forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of statements that include phrases such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “foresee,” “likely,” “will,” “may,” “could,” “estimate” or other similar words or phrases. Similarly, statements that describe the Company’s objectives, plans or goals are or may be forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are difficult to predict and which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these statements. More information about these risks, uncertainties and other factors is set forth below. Additional risks, uncertainties and other factors may be described in the Company’s filings made under the securities laws. There may be additional risks, uncertainties and factors that the Company does not currently view as material or that are not necessarily known. The forward-looking statements included in this document are made only as of the date of this document and the Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.

RISK FACTORS

For an enterprise as large and complex as the Company, a wide range of factors could affect its business and financial results. The factors described below are considered to be the most significant. There may be other currently unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, technological, regulatory or other factors that could have material adverse effects on the Company’s future results. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. The following discussion of risk factors should be read in conjunction with “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

I-


The Company’s success and profitability are dependent upon audience acceptance of its content, which is difficult to predict.

Television and other content production and distribution are inherently risky businesses because the revenues derived from the production and distribution of such content, and the licensing of rights to the associated intellectual property, depend primarily upon their acceptance by the public, which is difficult to predict. The commercial success of a program also depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing programs released into the marketplace at or near the same time, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, general economic conditions and other tangible and intangible factors, all of which are difficult to predict. Rating points are also factors that are weighed when determining the advertising rates that the Company receives. The use of evolving ratings technologies and measurements, and viewership on platforms or devices, such as tablets, smart phones and other mobile devices, that is not being fully measured, could have an impact on the Company’s program ratings and advertising revenues. For example, while C-7, a current television industry sales metric, measures live, in-home, commercial viewing plus seven days of digital video recorder (“DVR”) and video-on-demand playback, the viewership occurring on subsequent days of DVR and video-on-demand playback, as well as out-of-home viewing and online and mobile viewership, are excluded from current audience viewership measures. Also, consumer viewership of OTT services continues to grow and is under measured. Low ratings can lead to lower pricing and advertising spending. For example, there can be no assurance that any replacement programming on the Company’s television stations will generate the same level of revenues or profitability as previous programming. In addition, the success of the Company’s cable networks and Simon & Schuster is similarly dependent on audience acceptance of its programming and publications, respectively. Low public acceptance of the Company’s content, including its programming and publications, will have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations. In addition, any decreased popularity of programming for which the Company has incurred significant commitments could have an adverse effect on its profitability. Programming and talent commitments of the Company, estimated to aggregate approximately

$8.98 billion

as of December 31, 2018, primarily included

$6.62 billion

for sports programming rights,

$1.71 billion

relating to the production and licensing of television and film programming, and

$660 million

for talent contracts, with

$889 million

of these amounts payable in and after


. A shortfall, now or in the future, in the expected popularity of the programming the Company expects to distribute or the sports events for which the Company has acquired rights, could lead to decreased profitability or losses for a significant period of time.

A decline in advertising expenditures could cause the Company’s revenues and operating results to decline significantly in any given period or in specific markets.

The Company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising on its broadcast and basic cable networks, television stations, syndicated programming, and digital properties. A decline in the economic prospects of advertisers, the economy in general or the economy of any individual geographic market, particularly a major market, such as Los Angeles, New York or Chicago, in which the Company owns and operates sizeable businesses, could alter current or prospective advertisers’ spending priorities. Natural and other disasters, acts of terrorism, political uncertainty or hostilities could lead to a reduction in advertising expenditures as a result of disrupted programming and services, uninterrupted news coverage and economic uncertainty. Advertising expenditures may also be affected by increasing competition for the leisure time of audiences. In addition, advertising expenditures by companies in certain sectors of the economy, including the automotive, financial and pharmaceutical segments, represent a significant portion of the Company’s advertising revenues. Any political, economic, social or technological change resulting in a reduction in these sectors’ advertising expenditures may adversely affect the Company’s revenue. Advertisers’ willingness to purchase advertising from the Company may also be affected by a decline in audience ratings for the Company’s programming, the inability of the Company to retain the rights to popular programming, increasing audience fragmentation caused by new program channels and the proliferation of media formats, including the internet and video-on-demand and the deployment of portable digital video devices and new technologies, which allow consumers to live stream and time shift programming, make and store digital copies and skip or fast-forward through advertisements.  In addition, the pricing and volume of advertising may be affected by shifts in spending toward digital and mobile offerings, which can deliver targeted advertising promptly, from more traditional media, or toward newer ways of purchasing advertising, such as through automated purchasing, dynamic advertising insertion, third parties selling local advertising spots and advertising exchanges, some or all of which may not be as beneficial to the Company

I-


as traditional advertising methods.  Any reduction in advertising expenditures could have an adverse effect on the Company’s revenues and results of operations.

The Company must respond to rapid changes in technology, content creation, services, standards and changes in consumer behavior in order to remain competitive.

Video, telecommunications and data services technologies used in the entertainment industry are changing rapidly as are the digital publishing and distribution models for books. Advances in technologies or alternative methods of product delivery or storage could reduce subscription or advertiser-supported viewership of the Company’s programming and have a negative effect on the Company’s revenues and profitability. Examples of the foregoing include the convergence of television telecasts and digital delivery of programming to televisions and other devices, video-on-demand platforms, tablets, new video and electronic book formats, user-generated content sites, unauthorized digital distribution of video content including via streaming and downloading, simultaneous live streaming of telecast content which allows users to consume content on demand and in remote locations while avoiding traditional commercial advertisements or subscription payments and “cloud-based” DVR storage. Further, these and other technologies drive changes in consumer behavior that could affect the attractiveness of the Company’s offerings to advertisers and adversely affect its revenues, including devices that allow users to view television programs on a time-delayed basis and technologies, such as DVRs, that enable users to fast-forward or skip advertisements or increase the sharing of subscription content and reduce the demand for electronic sell-through, DVD and Blu-ray Disc products. The Company’s business also may be adversely affected by the use of antennas (and their integration with set-top boxes or other consumer devices) to access broadcast signals to avoid subscriptions and live and stored video streaming boxes and services, which deliver unauthorized copies of copyrighted content, including those emanating from other countries in various languages.

More television and video programming options, including via digital streaming services and platforms, increase competition for viewers. In addition, competitors targeting programming to narrowly defined audiences may gain an advantage over the Company for advertising and subscription revenues. Television manufacturers, cable providers and others are developing and offering technology to enable viewers to locate digital copies of programming from the internet to view on television monitors or other devices, which could diminish viewership of the Company’s programming. Also, the impact of technological changes on MVPDs may adversely affect the Company’s cable networks’ ability to grow revenue. In order to respond to these developments, the Company implements changes to its business models and strategies from time to time. There can be no assurance that the Company’s direct-to-consumer digital streaming business models will continue to successfully respond to changes in technologies and consumer preferences. Anticipating and timely adapting to changes in technology and content consumption and exploiting new sources of revenue from these changes could affect the Company’s ability to continue to increase its revenues.

Increased programming and content costs may adversely affect the Company’s profits.

The Company produces and acquires programming and other content and incurs costs with respect to its content, including for all types of creative talent, such as actors, authors, writers and producers, composers and publishers of music, as well as for marketing and distribution. The Company plans to increase its investment in content and related marketing and distribution, including for its direct-to-consumer digital streaming services. An increase in any of these costs and increased competition from large entertainment companies and additional entrants with substantial resources for the production, acquisition and distribution of new content, including Amazon, Apple, Hulu and Netflix, may lead to decreased profitability. As competition for popular content is intense, the Company may have to increase expenditures for talent and intellectual property rights. In addition, changes in content consumption as well as the increasing number of available digital and other program, entertainment and news services increase the risks associated with the success of all types of content.  There can be no assurance that the Company will recoup its investments in programming and related costs. These factors could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.

I-


Piracy of the Company’s programming and other content, including digital piracy, may decrease revenue received from the exploitation of the Company’s programming and other content and adversely affect its businesses and profitability.

Piracy of programming, books and other copyrighted material is prevalent in many parts of the world and is made easier by the availability of digital copies of content, which facilitates the creation, transmission and sharing of high quality unauthorized copies of the Company’s content. Technological advances, which facilitate the streaming of programming via the internet to television screens and other devices, may increase piracy. The proliferation of unauthorized access to content, including through unauthorized live streaming, streaming boxes and apps programmed to seek pirated copies of content, the unauthorized premature release of content and unauthorized account sharing of subscription program services, has an adverse effect on the Company’s businesses and profitability because these unauthorized actions reduce the revenue that the Company potentially could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of its products and services. Increases in piracy would have an adverse effect on the Company’s businesses and profitability. Also, while legal protections exist, piracy and technological tools with which to carry it out continue to escalate, evolve and present challenges for enforcement.  The Company enforces its rights against entities that illegally secure and exhibit its content, including streaming the Company’s content without obtaining the consent of or paying compensation to the Company.  Failure of legal and technological protections to evolve and enable enhanced enforcement efforts to combat piracy could make it more difficult for the Company to adequately protect its intellectual property, which could negatively impact its value and further increase the Company’s enforcement costs.

Failure by the Company to obtain, create and retain the rights related to popular programming could adversely affect the Company’s revenues.

The Company’s revenues from its television, cable networks and digital services businesses are partially dependent on the Company’s continued ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer tastes and behavior on a timely basis. Moreover, the Company derives a portion of its revenues from the exploitation of its extensive library of television programming. Generally, a television series must have a network run of at least three or four years to be successfully sold in domestic syndication, however, increasingly, these time frames are being shortened. If the content of its television programming library ceases to be widely accepted by audiences or is not continuously replenished with popular content, the Company’s revenues could be adversely affected. The Company obtains a significant portion of its popular programming from third parties. For example, some of CBS Television Network’s most widely viewed broadcasts, including golf’s Masters Tournament, the PGA Championship, NFL games, NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Tournament games and series such as

Young Sheldon

, are made available based upon programming rights of varying duration that the Company has negotiated with third parties.  In addition, Showtime Networks enters into commitments and competes with other buyers to acquire rights to certain programming for

Showtime

,

The Movie Channel

and

Flix

from motion picture producers and other suppliers for varying durations. The Company competes for compelling source material for and the talent necessary to produce programming. In addition, competition for popular programming that is licensed from third parties is intense, and the Company may be outbid by its competitors for the rights to new, popular programming or in connection with the renewal of popular programming currently licensed by the Company. The Company’s failure to obtain or retain rights to popular content could adversely affect the Company’s revenues.

The Company’s businesses operate in highly competitive and consolidating industries.

The Company competes with other media companies for high quality content to achieve large audiences and to generate advertising and subscription revenue. The Company also competes for distribution on various MVPDs and third-party digital platforms. The Company’s ability to attract audiences and advertisers and obtain favorable distribution depends in part on its ability to provide popular programming and books and adapt to new technologies and distribution platforms. The consolidation of advertising agencies, distributors, content providers, printers and television service providers also has increased their negotiating leverage and intensified competition for audiences, advertising revenue, print production and distribution. In addition, consolidation among book retailers and the growth of online sales and electronic books sales have resulted in increased competition for limited physical shelf space for the Company’s publications and for the attention of consumers online. Competition for audiences and advertising

I-


comes from: broadcast television stations and networks; cable television systems and networks; motion picture studios; the internet; non-traditional programming services, including increases in the number of direct-to-consumer services; technological innovations in content distribution; terrestrial and satellite radio and portable devices; local, regional and national newspapers; direct mail; and other communications and advertising media that operate in these markets. Other television stations or cable networks may change their formats or programming, a new station or new network may adopt a format to compete directly with the Company’s stations or networks, or stations or networks might engage in aggressive promotional campaigns. In book publishing, competition among electronic and print book retailers could decrease the prices for new releases and the outlets available for book sales. Moreover, the growing use of self-publishing technologies by authors increases competition and could result in decreased use of traditional publishing services. This competition could result in lower ratings and advertising and subscription and other revenues or increased content costs and promotional and other expenses and, consequently, lower the Company’s earnings and cash flow. The Company cannot be assured that it will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing, new or potential competitors, or that competition and consolidation in the marketplace will not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations.

The loss of affiliation agreements or retransmission agreements or renewals on less favorable terms could materially adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.

The CBS Television Network provides its affiliates with up to approximately 98 hours of regularly scheduled programming per week. In return, the CBS Television Network’s affiliated stations broadcast network-inserted commercials during that programming and pay the Company station affiliation fees. Loss of station affiliation agreements of the CBS Television Network could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations by reducing the reach of the Company’s programming and therefore its attractiveness to advertisers, and renewal of these affiliation agreements on less favorable terms may also adversely affect the Company’s results of operations. Also, consolidation among television station group owners could increase their negotiating leverage. The non-renewal or termination of retransmission agreements with MVPDs and virtual MVPDs or continued distribution on less favorable terms could also adversely affect the Company’s revenues and its ability to distribute its network programming to a nationwide audience and affect the Company’s ability to sell advertising, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations. Showtime Networks, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian Networks are also dependent upon the maintenance of distribution agreements with MVPDs and third-party digital platforms and there can be no assurance that these agreements will be renewed in the future on terms acceptable to such programmers. The loss of one or more of these arrangements could reduce the distribution of Showtime Networks’, CBS Sports Network’s and Smithsonian Networks’ program services and reduce revenues from subscriber fees and advertising, as applicable. Further, the loss of favorable packaging, positioning, pricing or other marketing opportunities with any distributor could reduce revenues from subscriber fees. Also, consolidation among MVPDs and increased vertical integration of such distributors into the cable or broadcast network business have provided more leverage to these distributors and could adversely affect the Company’s ability to maintain or obtain distribution for its network programming or distribution and/or marketing of its subscription program services on favorable or commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Moreover, competitive pressures faced by MVPDs, particularly in light of the lower retail prices of digital streaming services, could adversely affect the terms of the Company’s renewals with MVPDs. In addition, MVPDs and digital streaming services continue to develop alternative offerings for consumers, including “skinny bundles,” which are generally smaller than the traditional program package or may allow the consumer to customize its package of program services.  To the extent these packages do not include the Company’s programming and become widely accepted in lieu of traditional program packages, the Company could experience a decline in affiliate and subscription revenues.

Cyber attacks or other events that adversely affect the Company’s information systems or result in the breach of proprietary or confidential information could disrupt the Company’s business, harm its reputation and expose the Company to regulatory enforcement and litigation.

Network and information systems and other technologies, including technology systems used in connection with the production and distribution of the Company’s content by the Company or third parties, are important to the Company’s business activities. Despite the Company’s security measures and disaster recovery planning, network

I-


and information systems-related events, such as process breakdowns, employee or partner error, cyber attacks or other activities, and power outages, terrorism, natural or other disasters, could result in a disruption or degradation of the Company’s services and operations, damage to equipment and data, and dissatisfaction or loss of viewers, customers or advertisers.  The Company manages, stores, and otherwise processes proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to its operations. The Company may experience breaches or other compromise of the information technology systems it uses for these purposes, as criminal or other actors may be able to penetrate the Company’s network security and misappropriate or compromise the Company’s business information, including intellectual property, financial, personal or other confidential information, or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Further, hardware and operating system software and applications that the Company produces or procures from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including “bugs” and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of such systems.  The costs to address the foregoing security problems and security vulnerabilities before or after a cyber incident could be significant. Remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede the Company’s operations. Breaches of the Company’s security measures and the unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about the Company or its customers or other third parties could expose such affected parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in regulatory enforcement, litigation and potential liability for the Company, damage the Company’s brands and reputation, or otherwise harm the Company’s business. Further, the Company relies in certain limited capacities on third-party data management providers and other vendors whose possible security problems and security vulnerabilities may have similar effects on the Company.

The Company is subject to laws, rules, and regulations in the U.S. and other countries relating to the collection, use, and security of user and other personal data. The Company’s ability to execute transactions and to possess and use personal information and data in conducting its business may require the Company to notify regulators and customers, employees, or other individuals of a data security breach, including in the EU under the GDPR, which took effect in May 2018. The Company will continue to incur expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations, but despite such efforts may face regulatory and other legal actions in the event of a data breach or perceived or actual non-compliance with such requirements.

The Company’s operating results are subject to seasonal variations and other factors.

The Company’s business has experienced and is expected to continue to experience seasonality due to, among other things, seasonal advertising patterns and seasonal influences, on people’s viewing, reading, attendance and listening habits. Typically, the Company’s revenue from advertising increases in the first and fourth quarters, Simon & Schuster generates an increased portion of its revenues in the second half of the year and license fees for television programming are dependent on the commencement of a license period, mix, number and availability of the Company’s television programming, which may cause operating results to increase or decrease during a period and create non-comparable results relative to the corresponding period in the prior year. In addition, the Company’s advertising revenues benefit when the Company broadcasts the Super Bowl and NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Tournament National Semifinals and Championship and, in even-numbered years, benefit from advertising placed by candidates for political offices. The effects of such seasonality make it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the previous results of any specific quarter and may adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

Economic conditions may adversely affect the Company’s businesses and customers.

The U.S. and other countries where the Company operates experience slowdowns and volatilities in their economies from time to time. A downturn could lead to lower consumer and business spending for the Company’s products and services, particularly if customers, including advertisers, subscribers, licensees, retailers and other consumers of the Company’s content offerings and services, reduce demands for the Company’s products and services. In addition, in unfavorable economic environments, the Company’s customers may have difficulties obtaining capital at adequate or historical levels to finance their ongoing business and operations and may face insolvency, all of which could impair their ability to make timely payments and continue operations, including distribution of the Company’s

I-


content. The Company is unable to predict the duration and severity of weakened economic conditions and such conditions and resultant effects could adversely impact the Company’s businesses, operating results, and financial condition.

Volatility and weakness in capital markets may adversely affect credit availability and related financing costs for the Company.

Bank and capital markets can experience periods of volatility and disruption. If the disruption in these markets is prolonged, the Company’s ability to refinance, and the related cost of refinancing, some or all of its debt could be adversely affected. Although the Company can currently access the bank and capital markets, there is no assurance that such markets will continue to be a reliable source of financing for the Company. In addition, the Company’s access to and cost of borrowing can be affected by the Company’s short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by credit ratings agencies. These factors, including the tightening of credit markets, or a decrease in the Company’s debt ratings, could adversely affect the Company’s ability to obtain cost-effective financing.

Changes in communications laws or other regulations may have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.

The television broadcasting and distribution industries in the U.S. are highly regulated by U.S. federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies, including the FCC. The television broadcasting industry is subject to extensive regulation by the FCC under the Communications Act. For example, the Company is required to obtain licenses from the FCC to operate its television stations. The Company cannot be assured that the FCC will approve its future renewal applications or that the renewals will be for full terms or will not include conditions or qualifications. The non-renewal, or renewal with substantial conditions or modifications, of one or more of the Company’s licenses could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s revenues. The Company must also comply with extensive FCC regulations and policies in the ownership and operation of its television stations and its television networks. FCC regulations prohibit the common ownership of more than one of the top four networks, ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC, and limit the number of television stations that a licensee can own in a market and the number of television stations that can be owned nationwide, which could restrict the Company’s ability to consummate future transactions and in certain circumstances could require it to divest some television stations. The U.S. Congress and the FCC currently have under consideration, and may in the future adopt, new laws, regulations, and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could, directly or indirectly, affect the operation and ownership of the Company’s television properties.  For example, from time to time, proposals have been advanced in the U.S. Congress and at the FCC to require television stations to provide advertising time to political candidates for free or at a reduced charge. Any restrictions on political or other advertising may adversely affect the Company’s advertising revenues.  Changes to the media ownership and other FCC rules may affect the competitive landscape in ways that could increase the competition faced by the Company. Proposals have also been advanced from time to time before the U.S. Congress and the FCC to extend the program access rules (currently applicable only to those cable program services which also own or are owned in whole or in part by cable distribution or telephone company systems) to all cable program services. The Company’s ability to obtain the most favorable terms available for its content could be adversely affected should such an extension be enacted into law.  It is difficult to predict the outcome of the FCC’s actions or their effect, if any, on the Company’s broadcasting properties.  In addition, changes in or new interpretations of international laws and regulations governing the broadcast and distribution of content, competition and the internet, including those affecting data privacy

,

as well as the new EU law requiring 30% local content on subscription video on demand services and proposed amendments to the law governing territorial exclusivity of the distribution of content in Europe, may have an adverse impact on the Company’s international businesses and internet properties. The Company is unable to predict the effect that any such laws, regulations or policies may have on its operations.

Vigorous enforcement or modification of FCC indecency and other program content rules against the broadcast and cable industries could have an adverse effect on the Company’s businesses and results of operations.

The FCC’s rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent or profane material on television stations between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. Broadcasters risk violating the prohibition against broadcasting indecent material because of the vagueness of the FCC’s indecency/profanity definition, coupled with

I-


the spontaneity of live programming. The FCC enforces its indecency rules against the broadcasting industry. The FCC has found on a number of occasions that the content of television broadcasts has contained indecent material. In such instances, the FCC issued fines or advisory warnings to the offending licensees. Moreover, the FCC has in some instances imposed separate fines for each allegedly indecent “utterance,” in contrast with its previous policy, which generally considered all indecent words or phrases within a given program as constituting a single violation. Broadcasting indecent material could result in fines per station of a maximum of approximately $407,000 per utterance and/or the loss of a station’s FCC license.  If the FCC denied a license renewal or revoked the license for one of the Company’s television stations, the Company would lose its authority to operate the station. The determination of whether content is indecent is inherently subjective and, as such, it can be difficult to predict whether particular content could violate indecency standards. The difficulty in predicting whether individual programs, words or phrases may violate the FCC’s indecency rules adds significant uncertainty to the Company’s ability to comply with the rules. Violation of indecency rules could lead to sanctions which may adversely affect the Company’s businesses and results of operations. Some policymakers support the extension of the indecency rules that are applicable to over-the-air broadcasters to cover cable and satellite programming and/or attempts to increase enforcement of or otherwise expand existing laws and rules. If such an extension, attempt to increase enforcement or other expansion took place and were found to be constitutional, some of the Company’s cable content could be subject to additional regulation and might not be able to attract the same subscription and viewership levels.

The failure or destruction of satellites and transmitter facilities on which the Company depends to distribute its programming could materially adversely affect the Company’s businesses and results of operations.

The Company uses satellite systems to transmit its broadcast and cable networks to affiliates. The distribution facilities include uplinks, communications satellites and downlinks. Transmissions may be disrupted as a result of local disasters including extreme weather that impair on-ground uplinks or downlinks, or as a result of an impairment of a satellite. Currently, there are a limited number of communications satellites available for the transmission of programming. If a disruption occurs, failure to secure alternate distribution facilities in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s businesses and results of operations. Each of the Company’s television stations and cable networks uses studio and transmitter facilities that are subject to damage or destruction. Failure to restore such facilities in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s businesses and results of operations.

The Company could suffer losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, FCC licenses and programming.

The Company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including FCC licenses, for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual tests if events or circumstances require an interim impairment assessment. A downward revision in the estimated fair value of a reporting unit or intangible assets, including FCC licenses, could result in a non-cash impairment charge. Also, any significant shortfall, now or in the future, in the expected popularity of the Company’s programming could lead to a downward revision in the fair value of such assets. Any such impairment charge for goodwill, intangible assets and/or programming could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s reported net earnings.

Dividends and dividend rates cannot be guaranteed.

The Company’s Board of Directors assesses relevant factors when considering the declaration of a dividend on the Company’s common stock. The Company cannot guarantee that it will continue to declare dividends, including at the same or similar rates.

The loss of key personnel, including talent, could adversely affect the Company’s business and revenues.

The Company’s business depends upon the continued efforts, abilities and expertise of the Company’s corporate and divisional executive officers and various creative talent and entertainment personalities. The Company believes that the loss of its executive officers could have a material adverse effect on the Company, including the impairment of the Company’s ability to execute its business strategy. The Company employs or contracts with highly regarded

I-


directors, actors, producers, authors and other talent who are important to attracting and retaining audiences and achieving the success of the Company’s programming, television stations, books and other content. There can be no assurance that these individuals will remain with or be drawn to the Company or will retain their current appeal. If the Company fails to retain or attract entertainment personalities, authors and talent or they lose their current appeal, the Company’s revenues could be adversely affected.

The Company’s liabilities related to discontinued operations and former businesses could adversely impact its financial condition.

The Company has both recognized and potential liabilities and costs related to discontinued operations and former businesses, certain of which are unrelated to the media business, including leases, guarantees, environmental liabilities, liabilities related to the pensions and medical expenses of retirees, asbestos liabilities, contractual disputes and other pending and threatened litigation. The Company cannot be assured that its reserves are sufficient to cover these liabilities in their entirety or any one of these liabilities when it becomes due or at what point any of these liabilities may come due. Therefore, there can be no assurances that these liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, operating performance or cash flow.

The Company could be adversely affected by strikes and other union activity.

The Company, its suppliers and business partners engage the services of writers, directors, actors and other talent, trade employees, players in sports leagues and others who are subject to collective bargaining agreements. If the Company, its suppliers or business partners are unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements, it is possible that the affected unions or others could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. Such actions, higher costs in connection with these agreements or a significant labor dispute could adversely affect the Company’s television, cable networks and interactive businesses by disrupting the Company’s ability to provide scheduled services and programming or by causing delays in the production of the Company’s programming. Depending on its duration, any lockout, strike or work stoppage could have an adverse effect on the Company’s revenues, cash flows and/or operating income and/or their timing.

Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and political and economic risks associated with the Company’s international businesses could harm the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

The Company’s businesses operate and have customers worldwide. Certain of the Company’s revenues are earned and expenses are incurred in foreign currencies.  The value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the U.S. dollar.  As a result, the Company is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations, which could have an adverse effect on its results of operations.  Other inherent risks of doing business in international markets include changes in the economic environment, potentially adverse tax developments, export restrictions, exchange controls, tariffs and other trade and sanctions barriers, longer payment cycles, and changes in privacy and data protection laws.  The Company may incur substantial expense as a result of the imposition of new restrictions or changes in the existing economic environment in the regions where it does business.  For example, the ongoing “Brexit” processes to withdraw the U.K. from the EU, which is expected to occur in 2019, may adversely affect economic and market conditions in the U.K. and other regions where the Company conducts business and could contribute to volatility in foreign exchange markets. In addition, acts of terrorism or other hostilities, or other future financial, political, economic or other uncertainties, could lead to a reduction in advertising expenditures, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.

Changes in tax laws, regulations and administrative practices, interpretations and policies may result in material tax liabilities.

The Company is subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.  Changes in tax laws, regulations and administrative practices, interpretations and policies in the territories where the Company’s businesses operate may result in material tax liabilities.  The Company’s tax returns are routinely audited by tax authorities and tax-related litigation or settlements may occur resulting in the assessment of additional taxes.  The enactment of the federal tax legislation in December 2017 (the “Tax Reform Act”) may expose the Company to tax

I-


risks as a result of the ongoing issuance of interpretive guidance by the U.S. government as to how provisions of the Tax Reform Act are to be applied, which may differ from the Company’s current interpretations.  The aforementioned risks may adversely affect the Company’s effective income tax rate or cash tax payments, which may adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.

NAI, through its voting control of the Company, is in a position to control actions that require stockholder approval.

NAI, through its direct and indirect ownership of the Company’s voting Class A Common Stock, has voting control of the Company.  At February 13, 2019, NAI directly or indirectly owned approximately 79.8% of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, and approximately 10.5% of the Company’s Class A Common Stock and non-voting Class B Common Stock on a combined basis.  Mr. Sumner M. Redstone is the beneficial owner of the controlling interest in NAI and, accordingly, beneficially owns all such shares.  Mr. Redstone, the controlling stockholder, chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer of NAI, serves as Chairman Emeritus of the Company's Board of Directors, and Ms. Shari Redstone, the president and a director of NAI, serves as Vice Chair of the Company’s Board of Directors. NAI is controlled by Mr. Redstone through the Sumner M. Redstone National Amusements Trust (the “SMR Trust”), which owns 80% of the voting interest of NAI, and such voting interest of NAI held by the SMR Trust is voted solely by Mr. Redstone until his incapacity or death. The SMR Trust provides that in the event of Mr. Redstone’s death or incapacity, voting control of the NAI voting interest held by the SMR Trust will pass to seven trustees, who will include CBS Corporation director Ms. Shari Redstone. No member of the Company’s management is a trustee of the SMR Trust.

Subject to the terms of the settlement and release agreement entered into by the Company and NAI, among others, on September 9, 2018, NAI is in a position to control the outcome of corporate actions that require, or may be accomplished by, stockholder approval, including amending the Company’s bylaws, the election or removal of directors and transactions involving a change of control. For example, the Company’s Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that:

•

the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the aggregate voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company then entitled to vote generally in an election of directors, voting together as a single class, is required for the stockholders of the Company to amend, alter, change, repeal or adopt any bylaws of the Company;

•

any or all of the directors of the Company may be removed from office at any time prior to the expiration of the director’s term of office, with or without cause, only by the affirmative vote of the holders of record of outstanding shares representing at least a majority of all the aggregate voting power of outstanding shares of stock of the Company then entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class at a special meeting of stockholders called expressly for that purpose; and

•

in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, stockholders of the Company may act by written consent without a meeting if such stockholders hold the number of shares representing not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such actions at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.

Accordingly, other stockholders who may have different interests are unable to affect the outcome of any such corporate actions for so long as NAI retains voting control.

Sales of NAI’s shares of the Company’s common stock could adversely affect the stock price.

At February 13, 2019, NAI directly or indirectly owned approximately 79.8% of the Company’s voting Class A Common Stock, and approximately 10.5% of the Company’s Class A Common Stock and non-voting Class B Common Stock on a combined basis.  Based on information received from NAI, NAI has pledged to its lenders shares of the Company’s non-voting Class B Common Stock owned directly or indirectly by NAI.  The aggregate number of shares

I-


of non-voting Class B Common Stock pledged by NAI to its lenders represents approximately 4.8% of the Company’s total Class B Common Stock outstanding. If there is a default on NAI’s debt obligations and the lenders foreclose on the collateral, such Class B Common Stock could be sold, which sale could adversely affect the Company’s share price.  There can be no assurance that NAI or its subsidiaries at some future time will not sell or pledge additional shares of the Company’s stock, which could adversely affect the Company’s share price.

Many factors may cause the stock price of the Company’s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock to fluctuate.

The stock price of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock may fluctuate significantly as a result of many factors. These factors, some or all of which are beyond the Company’s control, include: actual or anticipated fluctuations in the Company’s operating results; changes in expectations as to the Company’s future financial performance or changes in financial estimates of securities analysts; success of the Company’s operating and growth strategies; investor anticipation of strategic, technological or regulatory threats, whether or not warranted by actual events; operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies; and realization of any of the risks described in these risk factors.  In addition, the stock market has experienced volatility that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading prices of the Company’s common stock, regardless of the Company’s actual operating performance.

The businesses of the Company and Viacom Inc. will be attributable to the other company for certain regulatory purposes, which may limit business opportunities.

So long as the Company and Viacom Inc. are under common control, each company’s businesses, as well as the businesses of any other commonly controlled company, will be attributable to the other company for purposes of certain rules and regulations of the FCC, U.S. and non-U.S. antitrust rules and regulations and certain rules regarding political campaign contributions in the U.S., among others potentially. The businesses of one company will continue to be attributable to the other company for certain FCC and other purposes even after the two companies cease to be commonly controlled, if the two companies share common officers, directors, or attributable stockholders. As a result, the businesses and conduct of Viacom Inc. may have the effect of limiting and affecting the activities, strategic business alternatives and business terms available to the Company, including limitations to which the Company contractually agreed in connection with the Company’s separation of former Viacom Inc. (“Former Viacom”) into two publicly traded entities, CBS Corporation and new Viacom Inc., which was completed on December 31, 2005 (the “Separation”).

In connection with the Separation, each company will rely on the other company’s performance under various agreements between the companies.

In connection with the Separation, the Company and Viacom Inc. entered into various agreements, including a Separation Agreement dated December 19, 2005, a Tax Matters Agreement dated December 30, 2005, which are filed as exhibits to this report, and certain related party arrangements pursuant to which the Company and Viacom Inc. will provide services and products to each other from and after the Separation. The Separation Agreement sets forth the allocation of assets, liabilities, rights and obligations of the Company and Viacom Inc. following the Separation, and includes indemnification obligations for such liabilities and obligations. In addition, pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, certain income tax liabilities and related responsibilities are allocated between, and indemnification obligations are assumed by, each of the Company and Viacom Inc. Each company will rely on the other to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements. Certain of the liabilities to be assumed or indemnified by the Company or Viacom Inc. under these agreements are legal or contractual liabilities of the other company. If Viacom Inc. were to breach or be unable to satisfy its material obligations under these agreements, including a failure to satisfy its indemnification obligations, the Company could suffer operational difficulties or significant losses.

I-


NAI and any common director may face actual or potential conflicts of interest.

NAI has voting control of each of the Company and Viacom Inc. Mr. Sumner M. Redstone, the controlling stockholder through the SMR Trust, chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer of NAI, serves as Chairman Emeritus of the Company and Chairman Emeritus of Viacom Inc.  Ms. Shari Redstone, the president and a director of NAI, serves as Vice Chair of the Board of Directors of each of the Company and Viacom Inc. This ownership overlap and this common director could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when the Company’s and Viacom Inc.’s directors and controlling stockholder face decisions that could have different implications for the Company and Viacom Inc. For example, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute between the Company and Viacom Inc. regarding the terms of the agreements governing the Separation and the relationship between the Company and Viacom Inc. thereafter.  These agreements include the Separation Agreement, the Tax Matters Agreement

and any commercial agreements between the parties or their affiliates. On occasion, the Company and Viacom Inc. may compete with each other in various commercial enterprises. Potential conflicts of interest could also arise if the Company and Viacom Inc. enter into any commercial arrangements with each other in the future.  CBS Corp.’s certificate of incorporation contains provisions related to corporate opportunities that may be of interest to both the Company and Viacom Inc. CBS Corp.’s certificate of incorporation provides that in the event that a director, officer or controlling stockholder of the Company who is also a director, officer or controlling stockholder of Viacom Inc. acquires knowledge of a potential corporate opportunity for both the Company and Viacom Inc., such director, officer or controlling stockholder may present such opportunity to the Company or Viacom Inc. or both, as such director, officer or controlling stockholder deems appropriate in his or her sole discretion, and that by doing so such person will have satisfied his or her fiduciary duties to the Company and its stockholders. In addition, CBS Corp.’s certificate of incorporation provides that the Company renounces any interest in any such opportunity presented to Viacom Inc. Furthermore, CBS Corp.’s certificate of incorporation provides that neither the Company nor Viacom Inc. has any duty to refrain from engaging in the same or similar activities or lines of business as the other corporation, doing business with any potential or actual customer or supplier of the other corporation, or employing or soliciting for employment any officer or employee of the other corporation, and that no officer or director of either corporation shall be liable to the other corporation or the other corporation’s stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of any such activities of the Company or Viacom Inc., as the case may be. These provisions create the possibility that a corporate opportunity of one of such companies may be used for the benefit of the other company.  If any such opportunity is directed to Viacom Inc., rather than the Company, the Company may be materially adversely affected.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

General.

On an ongoing basis, the Company vigorously defends itself in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and responds to various investigations and inquiries from federal, state, local and international authorities (collectively, “litigation’’). Litigation may be brought against the Company without merit, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on its understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company believes that the below-described legal matters and other litigation to which it is a party are not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Under the separation agreement between the Company and Viacom Inc., the Company and Viacom Inc. have agreed to defend and indemnify the other in certain litigation in which the Company and/or Viacom Inc. is named.

Investigation-Related Matters

.    As announced on August 1, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors (“Board”) retained two law firms to conduct a full investigation of the allegations in recent press reports about the Company’s former Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Leslie Moonves, CBS News and cultural issues at all levels of the Company.  On December 17, 2018, the Board announced the completion of the investigation, certain findings of the investigation and the Board’s determination, discussed below, with respect to the termination of Mr. Moonves’s employment.  The Company has received subpoenas from the New York County District Attorney’s Office and the New York City Commission on Human Rights regarding the subject matter of this investigation and related matters. The New York State Attorney General’s Office has also requested information about these matters. The Company may receive additional related regulatory and investigative inquiries from these and other entities in the future. The Company is cooperating with these inquiries.

On August 27, 2018 and on October 1, 2018, each of Gene Samit and John Lantz, respectively, filed putative class action suits in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, individually and on behalf of others similarly situated, for claims that are similar to those alleged in the amended complaint described below.  On November 6, 2018, the Court entered an order consolidating the two actions.  On November 30, 2018, the Court appointed Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern California as the lead plaintiff of the consolidated action.  On February 11, 2019, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended putative class action complaint against the Company, certain current and former senior executives and members of the Board.  The consolidated action is stated to be on behalf of purchasers of the Company’s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock between September 26, 2016 and December 4, 2018.  This action seeks to recover damages arising during this time period allegedly caused by the defendants’ purported violations of the federal securities laws, including by allegedly making materially false and misleading statements or failing to disclose material information, and seeks costs and expenses as well as remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.

Separation Agreement

.    On September 9, 2018, the Company entered into a separation and settlement agreement and releases (the “Separation Agreement”) with Mr. Leslie Moonves, pursuant to which Mr. Moonves resigned as a director and as Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, the Company is contributing the aggregate amount of $20 million toward various charitable organizations that support the #MeToo movement and equality for women in the workplace, which organizations were mutually agreed by the Company and Mr. Moonves. The Company has recorded the contribution of $20 million in “Restructuring and other corporate matters” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2018. In October 2018, the Company contributed $120 million to a grantor trust. On December 17, 2018, the Board announced that, following its consideration of the findings of the investigation referred to above, it had determined that there were grounds to terminate Mr. Moonves’s employment for cause under his employment agreement with the Company. Any dispute related to the Board’s determination is subject to binding arbitration as set forth in the Separation Agreement. On January 16, 2019, Mr. Moonves notified the Company of his election to demand binding arbitration with respect to this matter and the related Board investigation. The assets of the grantor trust will remain in the trust until a final determination in the arbitration. The Company is currently unable to determine the

I-


outcome of the arbitration and the amount, if any, that may be awarded thereunder and, accordingly, no accrual for this matter has been made in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Claims Related to Former Businesses: Asbestos.

The Company is a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. The Company is typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of the Company’s products is the basis of a claim. Claims against the Company in which a product has been identified most commonly relate to allegations of exposure to asbestos-containing insulating material used in conjunction with turbines.

Claims are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. The Company does not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets that some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had pending approximately

31,570

asbestos claims, as compared with approximately

31,660

as of December 31, 2017 and

33,610

as of December 31, 2016. During 2018, the Company received approximately

3,290

new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately

3,380

claims. The Company reports claims as closed when it becomes aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when the Company has reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claims, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. The Company’s total costs for the years 2018 and 2017 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax were approximately $

45 million

and $

57 million

, respectively. The Company’s costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year and insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses.

Filings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure; other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos-related disease. The predominant number of pending claims against the Company are non-cancer claims. The Company believes that its reserves and insurance are adequate to cover its asbestos liabilities. This belief is based upon many factors and assumptions, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims. While the number of asbestos claims filed against the Company has remained generally flat in recent years, it is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may occur, including, among others, the number and types of claims and average cost to resolve such claims, which could affect the Company’s estimate of its asbestos liabilities.

Other.

The Company from time to time receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that it is or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to historical and predecessor operations of the Company. In addition, the Company from time to time receives personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from historical operations of the Company and its predecessors.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Management’s discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of CBS Corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires, the “Company” or “CBS Corp.”) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes.

Overview

Business Overview and Strategy

The Company operates businesses which span the media and entertainment industries, including the CBS Television Network, cable networks, content production and distribution, television stations, direct-to-consumer digital streaming services and other internet-based businesses, and consumer publishing. The Company’s principal strategy is to create and acquire premium content that is widely accepted by audiences and generate affiliate and subscription fee, licensing and advertising revenues from the distribution of this content on multiple media platforms and to various geographic locations. The Company plans to increase its investment in premium content to enhance its opportunities for revenue growth, which include exhibiting the Company’s content on its direct-to-consumer digital streaming services; expanding the distribution of its content internationally; and securing compensation from multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), third-party live television digital streaming offerings (“virtual MVPDs”), and television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network. The Company also seeks to grow its advertising revenues by monetizing all content viewership as industry measurements evolve to reflect viewers’ changing habits. The Company’s continued ability to capitalize on these and other emerging opportunities will provide incremental revenues across all of the Company’s main revenue streams.

Corporate Matters

In August 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) retained two law firms to conduct a full investigation of allegations in recent press reports about the Company’s former Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Leslie Moonves, CBS News and cultural issues at all levels of the Company. In September 2018, Mr. Moonves resigned as a director and as Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, pursuant to a separation and settlement agreement and releases, and the Company appointed its then Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Joseph R. Ianniello, as President and Acting Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The Board is conducting a search for a permanent Chief Executive Officer and Mr. Ianniello is a candidate in this search. On December 17, 2018, the Board announced the completion of the investigation and certain findings of the investigation. Also during 2018, the Company was involved in legal proceedings with its controlling shareholder, National Amusements, Inc., among others, which concluded with the dismissal of all claims pursuant to a settlement and release agreement. Pursuant to this agreement, on September 9, 2018, seven members of the Board resigned and the Board appointed six new members to the Board. On September 23, 2018, two directors who had served as members of the Board prior to September 9, 2018 resigned to pursue other interests, and, on October 21, 2018, another director resigned for health-related reasons. In addition, in early 2018, a potential combination with Viacom Inc. was evaluated by a special committee established by the Board. The uncertainties arising from leadership changes at the Company may have an adverse effect on the Company’s business. In connection with the aforementioned matters, the Company incurred expenses of

$128 million

in 2018. See “Legal Matters” for certain related information.

(a) See pages II-8, II-9, II-35 and II-36 for reconciliations of adjusted results to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).

For


, revenues reached an all-time high of

$14.51 billion

, an increase of

6%

from


, driven by growth across each of the Company’s main revenue streams. Advertising revenues grew

8%

, driven by record political advertising sales from the 2018 midterm elections and the Company’s acquisition of Network 10 in the fourth quarter of 2017. These increases were partially offset by the absence of the National Semifinals and National Championship games of the

NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Championship

(“NCAA Tournament”) and five

Thursday Night Football

games, which were broadcast by the CBS Television Network in 2017. During


, the Company experienced strong demand for CBS Television Network advertising. Underlying CBS Television Network advertising revenues in


were comparable with


, as higher pricing and higher ratings for Sunday National Football League (“NFL”) games were offset by lower ratings for the Company’s primetime programming. Affiliate and subscription fees increased

7%

, driven by

62%

growth from the Company’s direct-to-consumer digital streaming services,

CBS All Access

and

Showtime

, and higher station affiliation fees and retransmission revenues, including from virtual MVPDs. These increases were partially offset by Showtime Networks’ distribution of the Floyd Mayweather/Conor McGregor pay-per-view boxing event in


, which reduced the affiliate and subscription fee comparison by

eight

percentage points. Content licensing and distribution revenues were up

3%

, mainly from higher international licensing and the adoption of a new revenue recognition standard in


. This new standard resulted in revenues from the distribution of third-party content now being recognized based on the gross amount of consideration received from the customer, with an offsetting increase to participation expenses (see “Adoption of New Revenue Standard”). These increases were partially offset by lower domestic licensing compared with


.

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Operating income decreased

3%

from


. This comparison was impacted by several discrete items, including restructuring charges, costs relating to corporate matters and programming charges resulting from changes in the Company’s programming strategy, primarily at CBS Films. Adjusted operating income increased

5%

, primarily reflecting the revenue growth, which was partially offset by an increased investment in content, including a higher number of premium series produced for the Company’s direct-to-consumer digital streaming services, as well as for distribution on other platforms. Net earnings for


were

$1.96 billion

, or

$5.14

per diluted share, compared with

$357 million

, or

$.88

per diluted share, for


. The net earnings comparison was impacted by the following discrete items: the reversal of a valuation allowance in


, charges in


resulting from a pension settlement and the enactment of federal tax legislation in December


(the “Tax Reform Act”); and, in discontinued operations for


, a net loss from the split-off of CBS Radio Inc. (“CBS Radio”) and a noncash charge to adjust the carrying value of CBS Radio. (See Note


to the consolidated financial statements.) Adjusted diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) increased

18%

to

$5.19

for


, driven by the higher adjusted operating income and a lower effective income tax rate in 2018, which resulted from the Tax Reform Act, as well as lower weighted average shares outstanding. Adjusted operating income and adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. See pages II-8 and II-9 for details of the discrete items excluded from financial results, and reconciliations of adjusted results to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with GAAP.

The Company generated operating cash flow from continuing operations of

$1.43 billion

in


compared with

$793 million

in


, which included discretionary pension contributions of

$600 million

to prefund the Company’s qualified pension plans. Adjusted free cash flow was

$1.26 billion

for


compared with

$989 million

for


. These increases primarily reflected lower cash payments for income taxes and growth in affiliate and subscription fees, which were partially offset by the aforementioned increased investment in content. Adjusted free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow” on pages II-35 and II-36 for a reconciliation of net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure in accordance with GAAP, to adjusted free cash flow.

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Adoption of New Revenue Standard

During the first quarter of


, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification 606 (“ASC 606”) on the recognition of revenues which primarily resulted in two changes to the Company’s revenue recognition policies.

•

Revenues from Distribution Arrangements

Revenues from the Company’s distribution of third-party content are now recognized based on the gross amount of consideration received from the customer, with an offsetting participation expense recognized for the fees paid to the third party. Under previous accounting guidance, such revenues, which include content licensing and distribution revenues and advertising revenues, were recognized at the net amount retained by the Company after the payment of fees to the third party. For the year ended

December 31, 2018

, revenues and operating expenses relating to such distribution arrangements were each

$279 million

higher under ASC 606 than the amounts that would have been reported under previous accounting guidance, with no impact to operating income.

•

Revenues from the Renewal of Licensing Agreements

Revenues associated with the renewal of an existing license agreement are now recognized at the beginning of the renewal period. Under previous accounting guidance, these revenues were recognized upon the execution of such renewal. Content licensing and distribution revenue comparisons will continue to be impacted by fluctuations resulting from the timing of when Company-owned television series are made available for multiyear licensing agreements. Therefore, this change is not expected to have a material impact on the trend of the Company’s financial results. Additionally, historically, on an annual basis, revenues from renewals executed each year have approximated revenues associated with renewal periods that began in the same year.

The Company applied the modified retrospective method of adoption and therefore, prior periods continue to be presented under previous accounting guidance. The following table presents the Company’s revenues, operating income, net earnings from continuing operations, and diluted EPS from continuing operations, as well as the corresponding year-over-year comparisons, as if results for the year ended

December 31, 2017

were recognized under ASC 606. These amounts are non-GAAP financial measures and are reconciled below to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that presenting its financial results for 2017 under ASC 606 is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view results for 2017 on a basis consistent with the 2018 presentation, and makes it easier to compare the Company’s year-over-year results. If revenues were recognized under ASC 606 for 2017, the year-over-year comparisons to 2018 for operating income, net earnings from continuing operations and diluted EPS from continuing operations would have been similar to the comparisons on a reported basis.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures

Results for the years ended

December 31, 2018 and 2017

included discrete items that were not part of the normal course of operations. The following tables present non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of these discrete items, reconciled to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that presenting its financial results adjusted for the impact of discrete items is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the Company’s management and provides a clearer perspective on the underlying performance of the Company.

Consolidated Results of Operations—


vs.


Revenues

II-


Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Advertising

For


, the

8%

increase

in advertising revenues was driven by the Company’s acquisition of Network 10 in the fourth quarter of 2017 and record political advertising sales in


associated with the U.S. midterm elections. Underlying CBS Television Network advertising revenues for


were comparable with


, as higher pricing and higher ratings for Sunday NFL games were offset by lower ratings for the Company’s primetime programming.

Advertising revenues for


also benefited from higher revenues from the distribution of third-party content, resulting from such revenues now being recognized at the gross amount of consideration received from the customer, with an offsetting increase to operating expenses, as a result of the adoption of a new revenue recognition standard (see “Adoption of New Revenue Standard”). Under previous guidance such distribution revenues were recognized at the net amount retained by the Company after the payment of fees to the third party. These increases were partially offset by the absence of the broadcast of five

Thursday Night Football

games and the National Semifinals and National Championship games of the NCAA Tournament, which were broadcast on the CBS Television Network in 2017. The National Semifinals and National Championship games of the NCAA Tournament are broadcast by the CBS Television Network every other year through 2032 under the current agreements with the NCAA and Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. (“Turner”).

In


, advertising revenues will benefit from the CBS Television Network’s broadcast of the Super Bowl, which airs on the CBS Television Network on a rotating basis with other networks through 2022 under the current contract with the NFL, and the National Semifinals and National Championship games of the NCAA Tournament. However, the advertising revenue comparison in


will be negatively affected by the benefit in 2018 from record political advertising sales. The CBS Television Network’s upfront advertising sales (“Upfront”) for the 2018/2019 television broadcast season, which runs from the middle of September 2018 through the middle of September 2019, resulted in pricing and volume increases compared with the prior broadcast season, which are expected to benefit the Company’s advertising revenues during the 2018/2019 broadcast season. (See page I-2 for a description of the Upfront market.) However, overall advertising revenues for the Company will be dependent on ratings for its programming and market conditions, including demand in the scatter advertising market, in which advertisers purchase the remaining advertising spots closer to the broadcast of the related programming.

Content Licensing and Distribution

Content licensing and distribution revenues are principally comprised of fees from the licensing of internally-produced television programming; fees from the distribution of third-party programming; and revenues from the publishing and distribution of consumer books. For


, content licensing and distribution revenues increased

3%

, benefiting from higher revenues from the distribution of third-party content, resulting from such revenues now being recognized at the gross amount of consideration received from the customer, with an offsetting increase to participation expense, as a result of the adoption of a new revenue recognition standard (see “Adoption of New Revenue Standard”). Under previous guidance such distribution revenues were recognized at the net amount retained by the Company after the payment of fees to the third party. Content licensing and distribution revenues also reflected growth in international licensing, offset by lower domestic licensing, mainly resulting from several large sales in 2017, including

NCIS: New Orleans

,

Madam Secretary

and titles from the

CSI

franchise.

Content licensing and distribution revenue comparisons are impacted by fluctuations resulting from the timing of the availability of Company-owned television series for multiyear licensing agreements. Television license fee revenues are recognized at the beginning of the license period in which programs are made available to the licensee for exhibition. Unrecognized revenues attributable to signed license agreements for produced programming that is not yet available for exhibition were

$1.08 billion

at

December 31, 2018

and

$670 million

at

December 31, 2017

,

II-


Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

which increased to $1.33 billion on January 1, 2018 upon the adoption of ASC 606. At

December 31, 2018

, the Company had approximately


episodes of scripted original programming that had not yet been made available in the secondary domestic marketplace (See page II-59 for a description of the secondary marketplace).

Total outstanding receivables attributable to revenues recognized under licensing agreements were

$3.57 billion

at

December 31, 2018

,

$4.06 billion

at

December 31, 2017

and

$3.45 billion

at January 1, 2018. At

December 31, 2018

, the total amount due from these receivables was

$1.96 billion

in


,

$771 million

in


,

$430 million

in


,

$236 million

in


, and

$181 million

in


and thereafter.

Affiliate and Subscription Fees

Affiliate and subscription fees are principally comprised of revenues received from MVPDs and virtual MVPDs for carriage of the Company’s cable networks (“cable affiliate fees”), as well as fees received from television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network (“station affiliation fees”); fees for authorizing the MVPDs’ and virtual MVPDs’ carriage of the Company’s owned television stations (“retransmission fees”); subscription fees for the Company’s direct-to-consumer digital streaming services; and revenues received for the distribution of pay-per-view boxing events. For


, the

7%

increase

in affiliate and subscription fees reflects

22%

growth in station affiliation and retransmission fees and

62%

growth from the Company’s direct-to-consumer digital streaming services,

CBS All Access

and

Showtime

. These increases were partially offset by Showtime Networks’ distribution of the Floyd Mayweather/Conor McGregor pay-per-view boxing event in 2017, which reduced the comparison by

eight

percentage points.

Over the next two years, agreements with MVPDs and virtual MVPDs, representing approximately 85% of the Company’s total subscribers to these services, and agreements with station affiliates representing approximately 60% of the Company’s total subscribers under its station affiliation agreements, will come up for renewal. Historically, renewals of these agreements have resulted in increases in the rates received by the Company and therefore, the Company expects to benefit from these renewals over the next few years. In addition, the Company’s existing agreements with station affiliates, MVPDs and virtual MVPDs include annual contractual increases. Together, these factors are expected to result in continued growth in affiliate and subscription fees over the next several years.

Other

Other revenues are principally comprised of revenues from the rental of production facilities and ancillary digital revenues.

International Revenues

For


, international revenues increased

26%

primarily driven by the Company’s acquisition of Network 10 in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company generated approximately

17%

and

15%

of its total revenues from international regions in

2018 and 2017

, respectively.

II-


Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Operating Expenses

Programming

Programming expenses reflect the amortization of acquired programs exhibited on television broadcast and cable networks, and television stations. For


, the

9%

decrease

in programming expenses was primarily driven by lower sports programming costs, resulting from Showtime Networks’ distribution of the Floyd Mayweather/Conor McGregor pay-per-view boxing event in


and the absence of

Thursday Night Football

and the National Semifinals and National Championship games of the NCAA Tournament, which were broadcast on the CBS Television Network in 2017. These decreases were partially offset by costs for programming on Network 10, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of


.

Production

Production expenses reflect the amortization of direct costs of internally-developed television and theatrical film content as well as other television production costs, including on-air talent. For


, the

18%

increase

in production expenses reflected an increased investment in content, including a 17% increase in the number of series produced for distribution on multiple platforms, and the acquisition of Network 10 in the fourth quarter of


.

During the fourth quarter of


, in connection with recent management changes, the Company implemented changes to its programming strategy, primarily at CBS Films, which will shift its focus from theatrical films to developing content for the Company’s direct-to-consumer digital streaming services. As a result, the Company recorded programming charges of

$85 million

in


.

Participation, Distribution and Royalty

Participation, distribution and royalty costs primarily include participation and residual expenses for television programming, royalty costs for Publishing content and other distribution expenses incurred with respect to television content, such as print and advertising. For


, the

30%

increase

in participation, distribution and royalty costs was primarily driven by the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance, which resulted in revenues from the Company’s distribution of third-party content now being recognized based on the gross amount of consideration received from the customer, with an offsetting participation expense recognized for the fees paid to the third party. Under previous accounting guidance, such revenues were recognized at the net amount retained by the Company after the payment of fees to the third party. This change resulted in an increase to both revenues and participation expenses of

$279 million

for


, with no impact to the Company’s operating income.

Other

Other operating expenses primarily include compensation and costs associated with book sales, including printing and warehousing. For


, the

9%

increase

in other operating expenses mainly reflected higher costs associated with growth in the Company’s direct-to-consumer digital streaming services and expenses of Network 10, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of


.

II-

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses include expenses incurred for selling and marketing costs, occupancy and back office support. The

4%

increase

in SG&A expenses primarily reflected the Company’s acquisition of Network 10 in the fourth quarter of


and higher advertising and marketing costs associated with an increased number of original programs, including for the Company’s direct-to-consumer digital streaming services.

Depreciation and Amortization

Restructuring and Other Corporate Matters

During the year ended

December 31, 2018

, in a continued effort to reduce its cost structure, the Company initiated restructuring plans across several of its businesses, primarily for the reorganization and closure of certain business operations. As a result, the Company recorded restructuring charges of

$67 million

, reflecting

$57 million

of severance costs and

$10 million

of costs associated with exiting contractual obligations and other related costs. These restructuring activities are expected to reduce the Company’s annual cost structure by approximately

$70 million

.

During the year ended

December 31, 2017

, the Company recorded restructuring charges of

$63 million

, reflecting

$54 million

of severance costs and

$9 million

of costs associated with exiting contractual obligations and other related costs. During the year ended

December 31, 2016

, the Company recorded restructuring charges of

$30 million

, reflecting

$19 million

of severance costs and

$11 million

of costs associated with exiting contractual obligations and other related costs.

As of

December 31, 2018

, the cumulative settlements for the

2018, 2017, and 2016

restructuring charges were

$88 million

, of which

$74 million

was for severance costs and

$14 million

related to costs associated with exiting contractual obligations and other related costs.

II-


Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

In


, the Company recorded expenses of

$128 million

primarily for professional fees related to legal proceedings, recent investigations at the Company (see “Legal Matters”) and the evaluation of a potential combination with Viacom Inc.

In February 2019, the Company initiated a restructuring plan under which severance payments will be provided to certain eligible employees who voluntarily elect to participate. As a result, the Company expects to record a restructuring charge in the first quarter of 2019. The amount of this charge and the associated future savings will be based on the number of eligible employees who elect to participate in the restructuring plan and therefore cannot currently be determined.

Other Operating Items, Net

For


, other operating items, net reflected a net gain relating to the disposition of property and equipment.

Interest Expense and Interest Income

The following table presents the Company’s outstanding debt balances, excluding capital leases, and the weighted average interest rate as of

December 31, 2018 and 2017

:

Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt

For


, the loss on early extinguishment of debt of

$49 million

reflected a pretax loss associated with the Company’s redemption of

$800 million

of its long-term debt.

Pension Settlement Charges

During 2017, the Company purchased a group annuity contract under which an insurance company permanently assumed the Company’s obligation to pay and administer pension benefits to certain of the Company’s pension plan participants, or their designated beneficiaries, who had been receiving pension benefits. The purchase of this group annuity contract was funded with pension plan assets. As a result, the Company’s outstanding pension benefit obligation

II-


Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

was reduced by approximately

$800 million

, which represented approximately

20%

of the total obligations of the Company’s qualified pension plans. In connection with this transaction, the Company recorded a settlement charge of

$352 million

in 2017, reflecting the accelerated recognition of a portion of unamortized actuarial losses in the plan. Additionally, during 2017, the Company made discretionary contributions totaling

$600 million

to prefund its qualified pension plans.

Other Items, Net

The following table presents the components of Other items, net.

Provision for Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes represents federal, state and local, and foreign taxes on earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in loss of investee companies.

(a) The lower tax provision for the year ended

December 31, 2018

primarily reflects a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from

35%

to

21%

as a result of the Tax Reform Act.

(b) During the third quarter of


, in connection with the preparation of its 2017 federal tax return, the Company elected to utilize a federal tax law provision that was retroactively renewed in 2018. This tax law provision allowed the Company to immediately expense certain qualified production costs on its 2017 tax return. As a result, during the third quarter of


, the Company established a deferred tax liability associated with this deduction at the 2017 federal tax rate of 35%, and concurrently recorded a net tax benefit of

$69 million

, primarily reflecting the re-measurement of this deferred tax liability at the reduced federal corporate tax rate of 21% under the Tax Reform Act. This benefit was partially offset by a charge of

$15 million

to adjust the provisional amount of transition tax on cumulative foreign earnings and profits that resulted from the enactment of the Tax Reform Act. (See Note


to the consolidated financial statements.) 2017 reflects the impact of the enactment of the Tax Reform Act in December 2017. As a result of this tax law, the Company recorded a net provisional charge of

$129 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2017

, reflecting an estimated tax impact of

$407 million

on the Company’s historical accumulated foreign earnings and profits, partially offset by an estimated benefit of

$278 million

to adjust the Company’s deferred income tax balances as a result of the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from

35%

to

21%

.

(c) Reflects the reversal of a valuation allowance relating to capital loss carryforwards that will be utilized in connection with the sale of CBS Television City in the first quarter of 2019.

(d) Reflects the difference between the tax benefit from stock-based compensation expense and the deduction on the tax return associated with the exercise of stock options and vesting of RSUs. This difference occurs because stock-based compensation expense is recorded based on the grant-date fair value of the award, whereas the tax deduction is based on the fair value on the date the stock option is exercised or the RSU vests.

II-


Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

For


, the Company’s annual effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 21% before any potential discrete items, including the tax impacts from stock-based compensation.

Equity in Loss of Investee Companies, Net of Tax

The following table presents equity in earnings (loss) of investee companies for the Company’s domestic and international equity investments.

Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations

For


, the increase in net earnings from continuing operations of

50%

was primarily driven by the lower effective income tax rate in


and a pension settlement charge of

$352 million

(

$237 million

, net of tax) in 2017. Diluted EPS from continuing operations grew

60%

reflecting higher earnings and lower weighted average shares outstanding.

Net Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax

On November 16, 2017, the Company completed the split-off of CBS Radio through an exchange offer, in which the Company accepted

17.9 million

shares of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock from its stockholders in exchange for the

101.4 million

shares of CBS Radio common stock that it owned. Immediately following the exchange offer, each share of CBS Radio common stock was converted into one share of Entercom Class A common stock upon completion of the merger of CBS Radio and Entercom. CBS Radio has been presented as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.

II-


Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

The following table sets forth details of net earnings (loss) from discontinued operations for the year ended

December 31, 2017

.

(a) During 2017, prior to the split-off, CBS Radio was measured each reporting period at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. The value of the transaction with Entercom was determined based on Entercom’s stock price at the closing of the transaction and therefore, the Company recorded a market value adjustment of

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Advertising

For


, the

9%

decrease

in advertising revenues primarily reflects the benefit to 2016 from CBS’s broadcast of the Super Bowl, which is broadcast on the CBS Television Network on a rotating basis with other networks. The decline also reflects the benefit in 2016 from political advertising sales during the 2016 Presidential election cycle. Underlying CBS Television Network advertising revenues declined

2%

in


, mainly as a result of lower ratings for the Company’s programming, which was partially offset by higher pricing.

Content Licensing and Distribution

For


, the

8%

increase

in content licensing and distribution revenues reflected growth in both international and domestic licensing sales. The increase in domestic licensing sales was primarily driven by sales of

NCIS: New Orleans

,

Madam Secretary

and several titles from the

CSI

franchise. Internationally, the Company benefited from strong demand for its content during


, reflecting additional titles available for sale as a result of the Company’s increased investment in internally-produced series.

Affiliate and Subscription Fees

For


, the

26%

increase

in affiliate and subscription fees reflects revenues from Showtime Networks’ distribution of the Floyd Mayweather/Conor McGregor pay-per-view boxing event, which contributed

nine

points of the growth. Underlying affiliate and subscription fee revenues increased

17%

, led by

27%

growth in station affiliation fees and retransmission fees, and

98%

growth from digital initiatives, including the Company’s owned streaming subscription services,

CBS All Access

and the

Showtime

direct-to-consumer digital streaming subscription offering, and virtual MVPDs.

International Revenues

For


, international revenues increased 9% primarily as a result of higher television licensing sales. The Company generated approximately

15%

and

14%

of its total revenues from international regions in

2017 and 2016

, respectively.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Operating Expenses

Programming

For


, the

7%

increase

in programming expenses was driven by costs associated with Showtime Networks’ distribution of the Floyd Mayweather/Conor McGregor pay-per-view boxing event; CBS’s broadcast of the National Semifinals and National Championship games of the NCAA Tournament, and an increased investment in cable programming. Costs in 2016 associated with CBS’s broadcast of

Super Bowl 50

partially offset these increases.

Production

For


, the

8%

increase

in production expenses reflected an increased investment in internally-developed television series and higher costs associated with the increase in television licensing revenues.

Participation, Distribution and Royalty

For


, the

1%

decrease

in participation, distribution and royalty costs was primarily driven by the mix of titles sold under television licensing arrangements.

Other

For


, the

5%

increase

in other operating expenses mainly reflected higher compensation costs associated with the Company’s growth initiatives and increased costs resulting from a higher volume of book sales.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

For


, the

4%

increase in SG&A expenses primarily reflected higher advertising and marketing costs, mainly to support the Company’s growth initiatives.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Restructuring and Other Corporate Matters

During the year ended

December 31, 2017

, the Company recorded restructuring charges of

$63 million

, reflecting

$54 million

of severance costs and

$9 million

of costs associated with exiting contractual obligations and other related costs.

During the year ended

December 31, 2016

, the Company recorded restructuring charges of

$30 million

, reflecting

$19 million

of severance costs and

$11 million

of costs associated with exiting contractual obligations and other related costs.

In


, the Company incurred professional fees of

$8 million

associated with merger and acquisition-related activities.

Other Operating Items, Net

For


, other operating items, net reflected a net gain relating to the disposition of property and equipment. For


, other operating items, net included a gain from the disposition of an internet business in China and a multiyear, retroactive impact of a new operating tax.

Interest Expense and Interest Income

The following table presents the Company’s outstanding debt balances, excluding capital leases and discontinued operations debt, and the weighted average interest rate as of

December 31, 2017 and 2016

:

Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt

For


, the loss on early extinguishment of debt of

$49 million

reflected a pretax loss associated with the Company’s redemption of

$800 million

of its long-term debt.

Pension Settlement Charges

During 2017, the Company purchased a group annuity contract under which an insurance company permanently assumed the Company’s obligation to pay and administer pension benefits to certain of the Company’s pension plan participants, or their designated beneficiaries, who had been receiving pension benefits. The purchase of this group annuity contract was funded with pension plan assets. As a result, the Company’s outstanding pension benefit obligation was reduced by approximately

$800 million

, which represented approximately

20%

of the total obligations of the Company’s qualified pension plans. In connection with this transaction, the Company recorded a settlement charge of

$352 million

in 2017, reflecting the accelerated recognition of a portion of unamortized actuarial losses in the plan. Additionally, during 2017, the Company made discretionary contributions totaling

$600 million

to prefund its qualified pension plans.

II-


Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

During 2016, the Company offered eligible former employees who had not yet initiated pension benefit payments the option to make a one-time election to receive the present value of their pension benefits as a lump-sum distribution or to commence an immediate monthly annuity benefit. As a result, the Company paid a total of

$518 million

of lump-sum distributions in 2016 using its pension plan assets, which represented

12%

of the total obligations of its qualified pension plans. Accordingly, the Company recorded a settlement charge of

$211 million

reflecting the accelerated recognition of a portion of unamortized actuarial losses in the plan.

Other Items, Net

The following table presents the components of Other items, net.

Provision for Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes represents federal, state and local, and foreign taxes on earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in loss of investee companies.

(a)  Reflects the impact of the enactment of the Tax Reform Act in December 2017. As a result of this tax law, the Company recorded a net provisional charge of

$129 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2017

, reflecting an estimated tax impact of

$407 million

on the Company’s historical accumulated foreign earnings and profits, partially offset by an estimated benefit of

$278 million

to adjust the Company’s deferred income tax balances as a result of the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from

35%

to

21%

.

(b)  Reflects excess tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options and vesting of RSUs. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company adopted FASB guidance which requires that the difference between the tax benefit from stock-based compensation expense and the deduction on the tax return be recognized within the income tax provision on the statement of operations. Previously, such difference was recognized in stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. This difference occurs because stock-based compensation expense is determined based on the grant-date fair value of the award, whereas the tax deduction is based on the fair value on the date the stock option is exercised or the RSU vests. This guidance requires the income statement classification to be applied prospectively, and therefore, excess tax benefits for prior periods remain classified in stockholders’ equity.

(c)  For the year ended

December 31, 2017

, primarily reflects tax benefits from the resolution of certain state income tax matters. For the year ended

December 31, 2016

, primarily reflects a one-time tax benefit of $47 million associated with a multiyear adjustment to a tax deduction, which was approved by the IRS during the third quarter of 2016.

Equity in Loss of Investee Companies, Net of Tax

The following table presents equity in earnings (loss) of investee companies for the Company’s domestic and international equity investments.

For


, equity in loss of investee companies, net of tax included $10 million for the write-down of an international television joint venture to its fair value.

Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations

For


, the decreases in net earnings from continuing operations and diluted EPS from continuing operations of

16%

and

7%

, respectively, were driven by pension settlement charges of

$352 million

(

$237 million

, net of tax) in 2017 compared with $211 million ($130 million, net of tax) in 2016; a provisional charge of

$129 million

from the enactment of the Tax Reform Act in December 2017; and a charge of

$49 million

(

$31 million

, net of tax) from the early extinguishment of debt. Diluted EPS from continuing operations benefited from lower weighted average shares outstanding as a result of the Company’s share repurchases and the shares retired as a result of the split-off of CBS Radio during the fourth quarter of

Net Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax

The following tables set forth details of net earnings (loss) from discontinued operations for the years ended

December 31, 2017 and 2016

.

(a) During 2017, prior to the split-off, CBS Radio was measured each reporting period at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. The value of the transaction with Entercom was determined based on Entercom’s stock price at the closing of the transaction and therefore, the Company recorded a market value adjustment of

$980 million

in 2017 to adjust the carrying value of CBS Radio to the value indicated by the stock valuation of Entercom.

(b) Reflects a tax benefit from the resolution of a tax matter in a foreign jurisdiction relating to a previously disposed business that was accounted for as a discontinued operation.

(c) Reflects adjustments to the loss on disposal of the Company’s outdoor advertising businesses, primarily from a decrease to the guarantee liability associated with the 2013 disposal of the Company’s outdoor advertising business in Europe.

During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company began presenting CBS Sports Network in the Entertainment segment, to reflect changes in management structure and the integration of CBS Sports Network programming with the CBS Television Network. CBS Sports Network was previously included in the Cable Networks segment. Results for all periods presented have been reclassified to conform to this presentation.

The Company presents operating income (loss) excluding costs for restructuring and other corporate matters, programming charges and other operating items, net, each where applicable (“Segment Operating Income”), as the primary measure of profit and loss for its operating segments in accordance with FASB guidance for segment reporting. The Company believes the presentation of Segment Operating Income is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view segment performance in a manner similar to the primary method used by the Company’s management and enhances their ability to understand the Company’s operating performance. The reconciliation of Segment Operating Income to the Company’s consolidated net earnings is presented in Note

Results in


will benefit from the CBS Television Network’s broadcast of the Super Bowl, which airs on the CBS Television Network on a rotating basis with other networks through 2022 under the current contract, and the broadcast of the National Semifinals and National Championship games of the NCAA Tournament, which are broadcast on the CBS Television Network every other year through 2032 under the current agreement with the NCAA and Turner. Results are also expected to benefit from continued growth in affiliate and subscription fee revenues, driven by the renewal of several of the Company’s agreements with MVPDs and its television station affiliates, as well as annual contractual increases on multiyear agreements. Revenue comparisons will also be affected by fluctuations resulting from the timing of multiyear licensing agreements for television series. Television license fee revenues are recognized at the beginning of the license period in which programs are made available to the licensee for exhibition. In addition, the Company plans to increase its investment in content in 2019, including increasing the number of series on

is presented under previous accounting guidance. See Note


to the consolidated financial statements for the amount by which each balance sheet line item at

December 31, 2018

was impacted by the adoption of ASC 606.

(a) The increase primarily relates to the reclassification of the sales returns reserve to “Other current liabilities” as a result of the adoption of ASC 606 and higher receivables from television licensing arrangements.

(b) The increase primarily reflects the payment of sports program rights in advance of the broadcast of the related sporting events.

(a) The increase primarily reflects higher investment in programming.

(a) The decrease reflects lower noncurrent receivables from television licensing arrangements primarily as a result of the adoption of ASC 606 partially offset by restricted cash of

(a) The increase primarily reflects the recognition of interest and service cost, partially offset by contributions to the Company’s non-qualified pension and other postretirement benefits plans to satisfy benefit payments due under these plans.

(a) The decrease primarily relates to the reduction to a tax liability established during 2017 resulting from the enactment of the Tax Reform Act. This liability reflects the estimated tax on the Company’s historical accumulated foreign earnings and profits, which is payable to the IRS over eight years. The reduction relates to the application of a 2017 federal tax overpayment toward the liability.

Cash Flows

The changes in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were as follows:

Operating Activities.

The

increase

in cash

provided by

operating activities from continuing operations for

Free cash flow reflects the Company’s net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities before operating cash flow from discontinued operations, and less capital expenditures; and adjusted free cash flow reflects the Company’s net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities before operating cash flow from discontinued operations and discretionary contributions to prefund the Company’s pension plans, and less capital expenditures. The Company’s calculations of free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow include capital expenditures because investment in capital expenditures is a use of cash that is directly related to the Company’s operations. Adjusted free cash flow excludes discretionary contributions to prefund the Company’s pension plans because management assesses the Company’s ability to generate operating cash flows without considering the impact from discretionary pension contributions, and decisions regarding the timing of pension plan funding are not dependent on the level of operating cash flows generated during the period. The Company’s net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Management believes free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow provide investors with an important perspective on the cash available to the Company to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, maintain its capital assets, satisfy its tax obligations, and fund ongoing operations and working capital needs. As a result, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow are significant measures of the Company’s ability to generate long-term value. It is useful for investors to know whether this ability is being enhanced or degraded as a result of the Company’s operating performance. The Company believes the presentation of free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from the Company’s underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. Free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow are among several components of incentive compensation targets for certain management personnel. In addition, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow are primary measures used externally by the Company’s investors, analysts and industry peers for purposes of valuation and comparison of the Company’s operating performance to other companies in its industry.

As free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, either net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities as a measure of liquidity or net earnings (loss) as a measure of operating performance. Free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow, as the Company calculates them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow as measures of liquidity have certain limitations, do not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and are not necessarily measures of the Company’s ability to fund its cash needs. When comparing free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow to net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions that are not reflected in free cash flow or adjusted free cash flow.

The following table presents a reconciliation of the Company’s net cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow.

at

December 31, 2018

and

$10.28 billion

at

December 31, 2017

.

During the year ended

December 31, 2017

, the Company issued

$1.80 billion

of senior notes and used the net proceeds for the redemption and repayment of

$1.20 billion

of senior notes, of which

$800 million

was redeemed prior to maturity, resulting in a pre-tax loss on early extinguishment of debt of

$49 million

(

$31 million

, net of tax). The remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including discretionary contributions to the Company’s qualified pension plans and the repayment of short-term borrowings, including commercial paper.

At

December 31, 2018

, the Company classified

$600 million

of debt maturing in

August 2019

as long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, reflecting its intent and ability to refinance this debt on a long-term basis.

At

December 31, 2018

, the Company’s scheduled maturities of long-term debt at face value, excluding capital leases, were as follows:

Commercial Paper

The Company had outstanding commercial paper borrowings under its

Credit Facility

At

December 31, 2018

, the Company had a

$2.5 billion

revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) which expires in June 2021. The Company, at its option, may also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the Credit Facility. Borrowing rates under the Credit Facility are determined at the Company’s option at the time of each borrowing and are based generally on the prime rate in the U.S. or LIBOR plus a margin based on the Company’s senior unsecured debt rating. The Company pays a facility fee based on the total amount of the commitments.

The Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 4.5x at the end of each quarter as further described in the Credit Facility. At December 31,


, the Company’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio was approximately

3.1x

.

The Consolidated Leverage Ratio reflects the ratio of the Company’s indebtedness from continuing operations, adjusted to exclude certain capital lease obligations, at the end of a quarter, to the Company’s Consolidated EBITDA for the trailing four consecutive quarters.  Consolidated EBITDA is defined in the Credit Facility as operating income plus interest income and before depreciation, amortization and certain other noncash items.

The Credit Facility is used for general corporate purposes. At

December 31, 2018

, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and the remaining availability under the Credit Facility, net of outstanding letters of credit, was

$2.49 billion

.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company continually projects anticipated cash requirements for its operating, investing and financing needs as well as cash flows generated from operating activities available to meet these needs. The Company’s operating needs include, among other items, commitments for sports programming rights, television and film programming, talent contracts, operating leases, interest payments, and pension funding obligations. The Company’s investing and financing spending includes capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends and principal payments on its outstanding indebtedness. The Company believes that its operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, borrowing capacity under its Credit Facility, which had

$2.49 billion

of remaining availability at December 31,


, and access to capital markets are sufficient to fund its operating, investing and financing requirements for the next twelve months.

The Company’s funding for short-term and long-term obligations will come primarily from cash flows from operating activities. Any additional cash funding requirements are financed with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and long-term debt. To the extent that commercial paper is not available to the Company, the existing Credit Facility provides sufficient capacity to satisfy short-term borrowing needs. The Company routinely assesses its capital structure and opportunistically enters into transactions to lower its interest expense, which could result in a charge from the early extinguishment of debt.

Funding for the Company’s long-term debt obligations due over the next five years of

$2.63 billion

is expected to come from the Company’s ability to refinance its debt and cash generated from operating activities.

At December 31,


, the Company had

$2.46 billion

of remaining availability under its share repurchase program. Share repurchases under the program are expected to be funded by cash flows from operations and, as appropriate, with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and/or the issuance of long-term debt.

Contractual Obligations

As of

December 31, 2018

, payments due by period under the Company’s significant contractual obligations with remaining terms in excess of one year were as follows:

(a) Programming and talent commitments of the Company primarily include

$6.62 billion

for sports programming rights,

$1.71 billion

relating to the production and licensing of television and film programming, and

$660 million

for talent contracts.

(b) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders.

(c) Consists of long-term noncancellable operating lease commitments for office space, equipment, transponders and studio facilities.

(d) Long-term debt obligations are presented at face value, excluding capital leases.

(e) Future interest based on scheduled debt maturities, excluding capital leases.

(f) Includes capital leases for satellite transponders.

(g) Reflects long-term contractual obligations recorded on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet, including program liabilities; participations due to producers; residuals; and a tax liability resulting from the enactment of the Tax Reform Act in December 2017. This tax liability reflects the estimated tax on the Company’s historical accumulated foreign earnings and profits, which is payable to the IRS over eight years.

The table above excludes

$266 million

of reserves for uncertain tax positions and the related accrued interest and penalties, as the Company cannot reasonably predict the amount of and timing of cash payments relating to this obligation.

In


, the Company expects to make contributions of approximately

$60 million

to its non-qualified pension plans to satisfy the benefit payments due under these plans. Also in


, the Company expects to contribute approximately

$48 million

to its other postretirement benefit plans to satisfy the Company’s portion of benefit payments due under these plans.

Guarantees

The Company has indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business. At

December 31, 2018

, the outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds approximated

$100 million

and were not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

In the course of its business, the Company both provides and receives indemnities which are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, the Company may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification obligation. The Company records a liability for its indemnification obligations and other contingent liabilities when probable and reasonably estimable.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of the Company’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions.

The Company considers the following accounting policies to be the most critical as they are important to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. For a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Programming and Production Costs

Accounting for the Company’s television production costs requires management’s judgment as it relates to total estimated revenues to be earned (“Ultimate Revenues”) and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each television program. These estimates are used to determine the amortization of capitalized production costs, expensing of participation costs, and any necessary net realizable value adjustments to capitalized production costs. For each television program, management bases these estimates on the performance in the initial markets, the existence of future firm commitments to sell and the past performance of similar television programs.

The costs incurred in acquiring television series and feature film programming are capitalized when the program is accepted and available for airing and the costs of programming rights licensed under multi-year sports programming agreements are capitalized if the rights payments are made before the related economic benefit has been received. These costs are expensed over the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived. The economic benefit is determined based on management’s estimates of revenues to be derived from the programming. Management’s judgment is required in determining the value of the future economic benefit and timing of the expensing of these costs.

Ultimate revenue estimates for internally produced television programming, and the estimated economic benefit for acquired programming, which includes television series, feature films and sports, are updated regularly based on information available as the television program or film progresses through its life cycle or contractual term. Overestimating Ultimate Revenues for internally produced programming or a failure to adjust for a downward revision in the estimated economic benefit to be generated from acquired programming could result in the understatement of the amortization of capitalized production or programming costs, future net realizable value adjustments and/or estimated accruals for participation expense.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets Impairment Test

The Company performs a fair value-based impairment test of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, comprised of television FCC licenses and international broadcast licenses, annually during the fourth quarter and also between annual tests if an event occurs or if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value.

II-


Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

FCC licenses are tested for impairment at the geographic market level. The Company considers each geographic market, which is comprised of all of the Company’s television stations within that geographic market, to be a single unit of accounting because the FCC licenses at this level represent their highest and best use. At December 31,


the Company had


television markets with FCC license book values. For international broadcast licenses, the Company considers all of its broadcast licenses within a country to be a single unit of accounting because the international broadcast licenses at this level represent their highest and best use. At December 31,


, the Company had international broadcast licenses in Australia.

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company began including CBS Sports Network within the Television reporting unit, which is a component of the Entertainment operating segment, reflecting changes in management structure and the integration of CBS Sports Network programming with the CBS Television Network. Prior to this change, CBS Sports Network was a standalone reporting unit and a component of the Cable Networks operating segment. At December 31,


, the Company had

seven

reporting units with goodwill balances, each one level below their respective operating segments, except for the Cable Networks reporting unit and the Publishing reporting unit, which are each the same as their respective operating segments because these operating segments each have only one component.

Television FCC Licenses and International Broadcast Licenses-

For its annual impairment test, the Company performs qualitative assessments for each market or country that management estimates the FCC licenses or international broadcast licenses have an aggregate fair value that significantly exceed their respective carrying values. In selecting markets or international broadcast licenses for a qualitative assessment, the Company also considers the duration of time since a quantitative test was performed. For the


annual impairment test, the Company performed qualitative assessments for all


of its U.S. television markets. For each of these markets, the Company weighed the relative impact of market-specific and macroeconomic factors. The market-specific factors considered include recent projections by geographic market from both independent and internal sources for revenue and operating costs, as well as market share and capital expenditures. The Company also considered the macroeconomic impact on discount rates and growth rates, as well as the impact from recent tax law changes. Based on the qualitative assessments, considering the aggregation of the relevant factors, the Company concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of the FCC licenses in each of these television markets are less than their respective carrying values. Therefore, performing the quantitative impairment test was unnecessary.

For


, the Company performed a quantitative impairment test for international broadcast licenses. A quantitative impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the licenses with their carrying value. The estimated fair value is computed using the Greenfield Discounted Cash Flow Method (‘‘Greenfield Method’’), which attempts to isolate the income that is attributable to the license alone. The Greenfield Method is based upon modeling a hypothetical start-up station and building it up to a normalized operation that, by design, lacks inherent goodwill and whose other assets have essentially been added as part of the build-up process. The Greenfield Method adds the present value of the estimated annual cash flows of the start-up station over a projection period to the residual value at the end of the projection period. The annual cash flows over the projection period include assumptions for overall revenues in the relevant market, the start-up station’s operating costs and capital expenditures, and a five-year build-up period for the start-up station to reach a normalized state of operations, which reflects the point at which it achieves an average market share. The overall revenues in the subject market are estimated based on recent industry projections. Operating costs and capital expenditures are estimated based on both industry and internal data. The residual value is calculated using a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and long-term industry projections. The discount rate is determined based on the risk of achieving the projected cash flows, including the risk applicable to the industry and the market as a whole. The discount rate and perpetual nominal growth rate used for international broadcast licenses for 2018 were

11%

and

0.5%

, respectively. The Company concluded that the estimated fair value of international broadcast licenses, which were recorded at fair value in the fourth quarter of

II-

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

2017 when the Company acquired Network 10, continues to approximate the carrying value and therefore no impairment charge was required.

The estimated fair values of the FCC licenses and international broadcast licenses are highly dependent on the assumptions of future economic conditions in the individual geographic markets in which the Company owns and operates television stations. Certain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital, or a decline in the local television advertising marketplace in the U.S. or the advertising marketplace in Australia could result in a downward revision to the Company’s current assumptions and judgments. Various factors may contribute to a future decline in an advertising marketplace including declines in economic conditions; an other-than-temporary decrease in spending by advertisers in certain industries that have historically represented a significant portion of television advertising revenues in that market; a shift by advertisers to competing advertising platforms; changes in consumer behavior; and/or a change in population size. A downward revision to the present value of future cash flows could result in impairment and a noncash charge would be required.  Such a charge could have a material effect on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Goodwill-

For its annual impairment test, the Company performs qualitative assessments for each reporting unit that management estimates have fair values that significantly exceed their respective carrying values. For the


annual impairment test, the Company performed qualitative assessments for

seven

reporting units. For each of these reporting units, the Company weighed the relative impact of factors that are specific to the reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors. The reporting unit specific factors that were considered included financial performance and changes to the reporting units’ carrying amounts since the most recent impairment tests. For each industry in which the reporting units operate, the Company considered growth projections from independent sources and significant developments or transactions within the industry. The Company also determined that the impact of macroeconomic factors on the discount rates and growth rates used for the most recent impairment tests would not significantly affect the fair value of the reporting units, and that the lower tax rate from recent tax law changes would positively impact the fair value of the reporting units.  Based on the qualitative assessments, considering the aggregation of the relevant factors, the Company concluded that for these

seven

reporting units, it is not more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its respective carrying amount and therefore performing the quantitative impairment test was unnecessary.

For


, the Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test for the CBS Sports Network reporting unit prior to the inclusion of this business in the CBS Television reporting unit. The quantitative goodwill impairment test examines whether the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, which is computed based upon the present value of future cash flows (“Discounted Cash Flow Method”) and the traded or transaction values of comparable businesses (“Market Comparable Method”). If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recognized as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value. For


, the Discounted Cash Flow Method and Market Comparable Method for CBS Sports Network resulted in similar estimated fair values. The Discounted Cash Flow Method adds the present value of the estimated annual cash flows over a discrete projection period to the residual value of the business at the end of the projection period. This technique requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions such as growth rates, operating margins, capital expenditures and discount rates. The estimated growth rates, operating margins and capital expenditures for the projection period are based on the Company’s internal forecasts of future performance as well as historical trends.  The residual value is estimated based on a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and long-term industry projections and for


was

2.0%

.  The discount rate, which for


was

8.5%

, is determined based on the risk of achieving the projected cash flows, including the risk applicable to the industry and the market as a whole.

II-


Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

For the


annual impairment test the Company concluded that the estimated fair value of the CBS Sports Network reporting unit, which at December 31,


had a goodwill balance of

$261 million

, exceeded its carrying value by

16%

and therefore no impairment charge was required. An increase to the discount rate of 83 basis points, or a decrease to the perpetual nominal growth rate of 135 basis points, assuming no changes to other factors, would cause the fair value of the CBS Sports Network reporting unit to fall below its carrying value.

Certain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital, a decline in the advertising market, a decrease in audience acceptance of programming, a shift by advertisers to competing advertising platforms; and/or changes in consumer behavior could result in changes to the Company’s assumptions and judgments used in its goodwill impairment tests. A downward revision of these assumptions could cause the fair values of the reporting units to fall below their respective carrying values and a noncash impairment charge would be required. Such a charge could have a material effect on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Reserves and Legal Matters

Estimates of reserves and liabilities related to legal issues and discontinued businesses, including asbestos and environmental matters, require significant judgments by management.  The Company continually evaluates these estimates based on changes in the relevant facts and circumstances and events that may impact estimates.  While management believes that the current reserves for matters related to predecessor operations of the Company, including environmental and asbestos, are adequate, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods. This belief is based upon many factors and assumptions, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims.

Pensions

Pension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using many actuarial assumptions. Two key assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate is determined based on the yield on a portfolio of high quality bonds, constructed to provide cash flows necessary to meet the Company’s pension plans’ expected future benefit payments, as determined for the projected benefit obligation. The expected return on plan assets assumption is derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets. As of

December 31, 2018

, the unrecognized actuarial losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income increased from the prior year-end due primarily to the unfavorable performance of pension plan assets, partially offset by the impact from an increase in the discount rate and the amortization of actuarial losses. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate would result in an estimated change to the projected benefit obligation of approximately

$92 million

and would not have a material impact on


pension expense. A decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would increase pension expense. The estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets is a change of approximately

$6 million

to


pension expense.

Income Taxes

The Company is subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes.  When recording an interim worldwide provision for income taxes, an estimated effective tax rate for the year is applied to interim operating results.  In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in the quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded in the same quarter. A number of years may elapse before a tax return containing tax matters

II-

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

for which a reserve has been established is audited and finally resolved. For positions taken in a previously filed tax return or expected to be taken in a future tax return, the Company evaluates each position to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and the appropriate reserve to establish, if any. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold a tax reserve is established and no benefit is recognized. The Company is continually audited by U.S. federal and state as well as foreign tax authorities. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, the Company believes that its reserve for uncertain tax positions of

$266 million

at December 31,


is properly recorded pursuant to the recognition and measurement provisions of FASB guidance for uncertainty in income taxes.

During 2017, as a result of the enactment of the Tax Reform Act on December 22, 2017, the Company recorded a provisional charge of

$407 million

for the estimated tax impact on the Company’s historical accumulated foreign earnings and profits. This amount was based on the Company’s initial estimate. During 2018, the Company completed its analysis of the provisional amounts and recorded a charge of

$15 million

to adjust the estimated transition tax on cumulative foreign earnings and profits. In January 2019, the U.S. government issued guidance relating to the transition tax. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance, which will be recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements in the first quarter of 2019. In addition, future guidance issued by federal and state authorities regarding the Tax Reform Act could have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Legal Matters

General.

On an ongoing basis, the Company vigorously defends itself in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and responds to various investigations and inquiries from federal, state, local and international authorities (collectively, “litigation’’). Litigation may be brought against the Company without merit, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on its understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company believes that the below-described legal matters and other litigation to which it is a party are not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Under the separation agreement between the Company and Viacom Inc., the Company and Viacom Inc. have agreed to defend and indemnify the other in certain litigation in which the Company and/or Viacom Inc. is named.

Investigation-Related Matters

.  As announced on August 1, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors (“Board”) retained two law firms to conduct a full investigation of the allegations in recent press reports about the Company’s former Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Leslie Moonves, CBS News and cultural issues at all levels of the Company. On December 17, 2018, the Board announced the completion of the investigation, certain findings of the investigation and the Board’s determination, discussed below, with respect to the termination of Mr. Moonves’s employment. The Company has received subpoenas from the New York County District Attorney’s Office and the New York City Commission on Human Rights regarding the subject matter of this investigation and related matters. The New York State Attorney General’s Office has also requested information about these matters. The Company may receive additional related regulatory and investigative inquiries from these and other entities in the future. The Company is cooperating with these inquiries.

On August 27, 2018 and on October 1, 2018, each of Gene Samit and John Lantz, respectively, filed putative class action suits in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, individually and on behalf of others similarly situated, for claims that are similar to those alleged in the amended complaint described below. On November 6, 2018, the Court entered an order consolidating the two actions. On November 30, 2018, the Court appointed Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern California as the lead plaintiff of the consolidated action. On February 11, 2019, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended putative class action complaint against the

II-


Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Company, certain current and former senior executives and members of the Board. The consolidated action is stated to be on behalf of purchasers of the Company’s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock between September 26, 2016 and December 4, 2018. This action seeks to recover damages arising during this time period allegedly caused by the defendants’ purported violations of the federal securities laws, including by allegedly making materially false and misleading statements or failing to disclose material information, and seeks costs and expenses as well as remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.

Separation Agreement

.  On September 9, 2018, the Company entered into a separation and settlement agreement and releases (the “Separation Agreement”) with Mr. Leslie Moonves, pursuant to which Mr. Moonves resigned as a director and as Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, the Company is contributing the aggregate amount of $20 million toward various charitable organizations that support the #MeToo movement and equality for women in the workplace, which organizations were mutually agreed by the Company and Mr. Moonves. The Company has recorded the contribution of $20 million in “Restructuring and other corporate matters” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2018. In October 2018, the Company contributed $120 million to a grantor trust. On December 17, 2018, the Board announced that, following its consideration of the findings of the investigation referred to above, it had determined that there were grounds to terminate Mr. Moonves’s employment for cause under his employment agreement with the Company. Any dispute related to the Board’s determination is subject to binding arbitration as set forth in the Separation Agreement. On January 16, 2019, Mr. Moonves notified the Company of his election to demand binding arbitration with respect to this matter and the related Board investigation. The assets of the grantor trust will remain in the trust until a final determination in the arbitration. The Company is currently unable to determine the outcome of the arbitration and the amount, if any, that may be awarded thereunder and, accordingly, no accrual has been made for this matter in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Claims Related to Former Businesses: Asbestos.

The Company is a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. The Company is typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of the Company’s products is the basis of a claim. Claims against the Company in which a product has been identified most commonly relate to allegations of exposure to asbestos-containing insulating material used in conjunction with turbines.

Claims are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. The Company does not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets that some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of

December 31, 2018

, the Company had pending approximately

31,570

asbestos claims, as compared with approximately

31,660

as of

December 31, 2017

and

33,610

as of

December 31, 2016

. During


, the Company received approximately

3,290

new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately

3,380

claims. The Company reports claims as closed when it becomes aware that

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when the Company has reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claims, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. The Company’s total costs for the years


and


for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax were approximately $

45 million

and $

57 million

, respectively. The Company’s costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year and insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses.

Filings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure; other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos-related disease. The predominant number of pending claims against the Company are non-cancer claims. The Company believes that its reserves and insurance are adequate to cover its asbestos liabilities. This belief is based upon many factors and assumptions, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims. While the number of asbestos claims filed against the Company has remained generally flat in recent years, it is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may occur, including, among others, the number and types of claims and average cost to resolve such claims, which could affect the Company’s estimate of its asbestos liabilities.

Other.

The Company from time to time receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that it is or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to historical and predecessor operations of the Company. In addition, the Company from time to time receives personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from historical operations of the Company and its predecessors.

Market Risk

The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and uses derivative financial instruments to manage this exposure. In accordance with its policy, the Company does not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, the Company does not hold or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.

Foreign Exchange Risk

The Company conducts business in various countries outside the U.S., resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the U.S. dollar. In order to hedge anticipated cash flows in currencies such as the British Pound, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, foreign currency forward contracts, for periods generally up to 24 months, are used. Additionally, the Company designates forward contracts used to hedge committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions as cash flow hedges. Gains or losses on the effective portion of designated cash flow hedges are initially recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to the statement of operations when the hedged item is recognized. Additionally, the Company enters into non-designated forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. The change in fair value of the non-designated contracts is included in “Other items, net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company manages the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally.

At

December 31, 2018 and 2017

, the notional amount of all foreign currency contracts was

$325 million

and

$410 million

, respectively, which represents hedges of expected foreign currency cash flows.

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Interest Risk

The Company did not have any interest rate swaps outstanding at

December 31, 2018

or

December 31, 2017

but in the future may use derivatives to manage its exposure to interest rates.

Credit Risk

The Company continually monitors its positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to its financial instruments. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, the Company does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.

The Company’s receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at

December 31, 2018

or


, due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which the Company’s products and services are sold.

MANAGEMENT’ S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or Rule 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (a) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of assets; (b) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and (c) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements prepared for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2018

based on the framework set forth in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2018

.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2018

has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of CBS Corporation:

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CBS Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of

December 31, 2018 and 2017

, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2018

, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2018

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of

December 31, 2018 and 2017

, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2018

in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2018

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the COSO.

Change in Accounting Principles

As discussed in Note


to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for revenues from contracts with customers and the manner in which it accounts for net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost in 2018.

Basis for Opinions

The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

II-


Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Description of Business

—CBS Corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires, the “Company” or “CBS Corp.”) is comprised of the following segments: Entertainment (CBS Television, comprised of the CBS Television Network, CBS Television Studios, and CBS Global Distribution Group; Network 10; CBS Interactive; CBS Sports Network and CBS Films;), Cable Networks (Showtime Networks and Smithsonian Networks), Publishing (Simon & Schuster) and Local Media (CBS Television Stations and CBS Local Digital Media).  During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company began presenting CBS Sports Network in the Entertainment segment, to reflect changes in management structure and the integration of CBS Sports Network programming with the CBS Television Network. CBS Sports Network was previously included in the Cable Networks segment. Results for all periods presented have been reclassified to conform to this presentation.

Discontinued Operations

—On November 16, 2017, the Company completed the disposition of CBS Radio Inc. (“CBS Radio”) through a split-off. CBS Radio has been presented as a discontinued operation in the Company’s consolidated financial statements (See Note


). In addition, certain businesses that were previously disposed of by the Company prior to January 1, 2002, were accounted for as discontinued operations in accordance with accounting rules in effect prior to 2002.

Principles of Consolidation

—The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CBS Corp. and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is maintained. Controlling interest is determined by majority ownership interest and the absence of substantive third party participating rights.  Investments over which the Company has a significant influence or ownership of more than 20% but less than or equal to 50%, without a controlling interest, are accounted for under the equity method. Investments of 20% or less, over which the Company has no significant influence, that do not have a readily determinable fair value, are measured at cost less impairment, if any, and adjusted for observable price changes. If the fair value is readily determinable, the investment is measured at fair value. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated.

Amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests are immaterial for all periods presented.

Reclassifications-

Certain amounts reported for prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation.

Use of Estimates

—The preparation of the Company’s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

—Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase, including money market funds, commercial paper and bank time deposits.

Included within “Other assets” on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2018 is restricted cash of

$


million

. Restricted cash consists of amounts held in a grantor trust related to the separation and settlement agreement between the Company and the former Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company (See Note


).

CBS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Programming Inventory

—The Company acquires rights to programming and produces programming to exhibit on its broadcast and cable networks, broadcast television stations, direct to consumers through its digital streaming services and the internet, and in theaters. The costs incurred in acquiring and producing programs are capitalized and amortized over the license period or projected useful life of the programming. Program rights and the related liabilities are recorded at the gross amount of the liabilities when the license period has begun, the cost of the program is determinable, and the program is accepted and available for airing.

Television production costs (which include direct production costs, production overhead and acquisition costs) are stated at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value. The Company then estimates total revenues to be earned and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each television program.  For television programming, estimates for remaining total lifetime revenues are initially limited to the amount of revenue contracted for each episode in the initial market. Accordingly, television programming costs and participation costs incurred in excess of the amount of revenue contracted for each episode in the initial market are expensed as incurred on an episode by episode basis. Estimates for all secondary market revenues such as domestic and foreign syndication, basic cable, digital streaming, home entertainment and merchandising are included in the estimated lifetime revenues of such television programming once it can be demonstrated that a program can be successfully licensed in such secondary market. For each television program, management bases these estimates on the performance in the initial markets, the existence of future firm commitments to sell and the past performance of similar television programs. Television programming costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of the secondary market are initially capitalized and amortized, and estimated liabilities for participations are accrued, based on the proportion that current period revenues bear to the estimated remaining total lifetime revenues.

The costs incurred in acquiring television series and feature film programming are capitalized when the program is accepted and available for airing.  These costs are amortized over the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived based on the timing of the Company’s usage of and benefit from such programming. The costs of programming rights licensed under multi-year sports programming agreements are capitalized if the rights payments are made before the related economic benefit has been received.  These costs are expensed over the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived based on the relative value of the events broadcast by the Company during a period.  The relative value for an event is determined based on the revenues generated for that event in relation to the estimated total revenues over the remaining term of the sports programming agreement.

Lifetime revenue estimates for internally produced television programming, and the estimated economic benefit for acquired programming, including revenue projections for multi-year sports programming, are periodically reviewed. Adjustments, if any, will result in changes to amortization rates, future net realizable value adjustments and/or estimated accruals for participation expense.

Property and Equipment

—Property and equipment is stated at cost.  Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over estimated useful lives as follows:

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

—The Company assesses long-lived assets and intangible assets, other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, for impairment whenever there is an indication that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.  Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by these assets to their net carrying value. If the carrying value is not recoverable, the amount of impairment loss, if any, will be measured by the difference between the net carrying value and the estimated fair value of the asset.

II-


CBS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Impairment of Investments

—Investments are reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis by comparing their fair value to their respective carrying amounts. The Company determines the fair value of public company investments by reference to their publicly traded stock price. With respect to private company investments, the Company makes its estimate of fair value by considering recent investee equity transactions, discounted cash flow analyses, recent operating results, estimates based on comparable public company operating cash flow multiples and, in certain situations, balance sheet liquidation values.  The amount of impairment loss, if any, will be measured by the difference between the net carrying amount and the market value or estimated fair value of the investment.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

—Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are at or one level below the Company’s operating segments. Intangible assets with finite lives, which primarily consist of trade names, are generally amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from


to


years.  Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, which consist of FCC licenses and international broadcast licenses, are not amortized but are tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below its carrying amount.  If the carrying value of goodwill or the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized

(See Note


).

Other Liabilities

—Other liabilities consist primarily of the noncurrent portion of residual liabilities of previously disposed businesses, program rights obligations, long-term income tax liabilities, deferred compensation and other employee benefit accruals.

Revenues

Advertising Revenues

—Advertising revenues are recognized when the advertising spots are aired on television or displayed on digital platforms. If there is a guarantee to deliver a targeted audience rating or number of impressions, the delivery of the advertising spots that achieve the guarantee represents the performance obligation and revenues are recognized based on the proportion of the audience rating or impressions delivered to the total guaranteed in the contract. Audience ratings and impressions are determined based on data provided by independent third-party companies. Advertising contracts, which are generally short-term, are billed monthly, with payments due shortly after the invoice date.

Advertising revenues are primarily generated by the Entertainment and Local Media segments.

Content Licensing and Distribution Revenues

—Content licensing and distribution revenues are generated from the licensing of internally-produced television programming, fees from the distribution of third-party programming, and the publishing and distribution of consumer books.

Program Licensing and Distribution

For licenses of internally-produced television programming, each individual episode delivered represents a separate performance obligation and revenues are recognized when the episode is made available to the licensee for exhibition and the license period has begun. For license agreements containing multiple deliverables, revenues are allocated based on the relative standalone selling price of each episode of a television series, which is based on licenses for comparable series within the marketplace. Agreements to license programming are often long term, with collection terms ranging from

one

to

five

years.

The Company also distributes programs on behalf of third parties. In such arrangements, the Company generally obtains control of the program before selling it to the customer. Therefore, revenues from such distribution arrangements, which include both content licensing and advertising revenues, are recognized based on the gross

II-


CBS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

amount of consideration received from the customer, with a participation expense recognized for the fees paid to the third-party producer.

Substantially all of the Company’s program licensing and distribution revenues are generated by the Entertainment segment, with the remainder generated by the Cable Networks segment.

Publishing

Publishing revenues are recognized when merchandise is shipped or electronically delivered to the consumer. Consumer print books are generally sold with a right of return. The Company records a returns reserve and corresponding decrease in revenue at the time of sale based upon historical trends. For publishing revenues, payments are due shortly after shipment or electronic delivery.

Affiliate and Subscription Fees

—A majority of the Company’s affiliate and subscription fees are generated by the Cable Networks segment and consist of fees received from multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”) and third-party live television digital streaming offerings (“virtual MVPDs”) for carriage of the Company’s cable networks and subscription fees for the

Showtime

direct-to-consumer digital streaming subscription offering. The Entertainment segment generates affiliate and subscription fees primarily from television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network and subscribers to

CBS All Access

, its owned streaming subscription service. In addition, the Local Media segment generates retransmission fees from MVPDs and virtual MVPDs for carriage of the Company’s television stations. Costs for advertising and marketing services provided to the Company by cable, satellite and other distributors are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses.

The performance obligation for the Company’s affiliate agreements is a license to the Company’s programming provided through the continuous delivery of live linear feeds and, for agreements with MVPDs, also includes a license to programming for video on demand viewing. Affiliate and subscription fees are recognized over the term of the agreement as the Company continuously provides its customer with the right to use its programming. For agreements that provide for a variable fee, revenues are determined each month based on an agreed upon contractual rate applied to the number of subscribers to

the customer’s service. For agreements that provide for a fixed fee, which primarily include agreements with television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network (“network affiliates”), revenues are recognized based on the relative fair value of the content provided over the term of the agreement, which is determined based on the fair value of the network affiliate’s service and the value of the Company’s programming. For affiliate and subscription fee revenues, payments are generally due monthly.

Noncurrent Receivables

—Included in “Other assets” on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets are noncurrent receivables of

$

1.55

billion

at

December 31, 2018

and

$

2.12

billion

at

December 31, 2017

, which decreased to

$

1.59

billion

on

January 1, 2018

upon the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance. Noncurrent receivables primarily relate to revenues recognized under long-term television licensing arrangements. Television license fee revenues are recognized at the beginning of the license period in which programs are made available to the licensee for exhibition, while the related cash is collected over the term of the license period.

Deferred Revenues

—Deferred revenues primarily consist of cash received related to advertising arrangements and the licensing of television programming for which the revenues have not yet been earned. Advertising revenues that have been deferred are recognized when the required audience rating or impressions are delivered and revenues deferred under licensing arrangements are recognized when the content is made available to the customer and the license period has begun.

Total deferred revenues, including both current and noncurrent, were

$


million

and

$


million

at

December 31, 2018

and

January 1, 2018

, respectively. The change in deferred revenue for the year ended

December 31, 2018

primarily reflects

$


million

of revenues recognized that were included in deferred revenues at

January 1, 2018

, offset by cash payments received during the period for which the performance obligation was not satisfied prior to the end of the period.

Unrecognized Revenues Under Contract

—As of

December 31, 2018

, unrecognized revenue attributable to unsatisfied performance obligations under the Company’s long-term contracts was

$

3.45

billion

, of which

$

2.02

billion

is expected to be recognized for


,

$


million

$


million

for


, and

$


million

thereafter. These amounts only include contracts subject to a guaranteed fixed amount or the guaranteed minimum under variable contracts. Such amounts change on a regular basis as the Company renews existing agreements or enters into new agreements. Unrecognized revenues under contract disclosed above do not include (i) contracts with an original expected term of one year or less, mainly consisting of the Company’s advertising contracts (ii) contracts for which variable consideration is determined based on the customer’s subsequent sale or usage, mainly consisting of affiliate and subscription fee agreements and (iii) long-term licensing agreements for multiple programs for which the Company’s right to invoice corresponds with the value of the programs provided to the customer.

Collaborative Arrangements

—Collaborative arrangements primarily consist of joint efforts with third parties to produce and distribute programming such as television series and live sporting events, including the agreement between the Company and Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. to telecast the

NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Championship

(“NCAA Tournament”), which runs through 2032. In connection with this agreement for the NCAA Tournament, advertisements aired on the CBS Television Network are recorded as revenues and the Company’s share of the program rights fees and other operating costs are recorded as operating expenses.

For episodic television programming, co-production costs are initially capitalized as programming inventory and amortized over the television series’ estimated economic life.  In such arrangements where the Company has distribution rights, all proceeds generated from such distribution are recorded as revenues and any participation profits due to third party collaborators are recorded as operating expenses.  In co-production arrangements where third party collaborators have distribution rights, the Company’s net participating profits are recorded as revenues.

Amounts attributable to transactions arising from collaborative arrangements between participants were not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.

Advertising

—Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.

The Company incurred total advertising expenses of

$


million

in


,

$


million

in


and

$


million

in


.

Other Operating Items, Net

—Other operating items, net for


reflects a net gain relating to the disposal of property and equipment and for


includes a gain from the sales of businesses and a multiyear, retroactive impact of a new operating tax.

Interest

—Costs associated with the refinancing or issuance of debt, as well as debt discounts or premiums, are recorded as interest over the term of its related debt.  The Company may enter into interest rate exchange agreements; the amount to be paid or received under such agreements is accrued and recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense.

II-


CBS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Income Taxes

—The provision for income taxes includes federal, state, local, and foreign taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed. The Company evaluates the realizability of deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. For tax positions taken in a previously filed tax return or expected to be taken in a future tax return, the Company evaluates each position to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and the appropriate reserve to establish, if any. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold a tax reserve is established and no benefit is recognized.  A number of years may elapse before a tax return containing tax matters for which a reserve has been established is audited and finally resolved.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions

—The Company’s assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at foreign exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, while results of operations are translated at average foreign exchange rates for the respective periods.  The resulting translation gains or losses are included as a separate component of stockholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  Foreign currency transaction gains and losses have been included in “Other items, net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Other Items, net

—“Other items, net” primarily consists of pension and postretirement benefit costs, other than service costs, and foreign exchange gains and losses.

Provision for Doubtful Accounts

—The provision for doubtful accounts is estimated based on historical bad debt experience, the aging of accounts receivable, industry trends and economic indicators, as well as recent payment history for specific customers.

The provision for doubtful accounts charged to expense was

Net Earnings (Loss) per Common Share

—Basic earnings (loss) per share (“EPS”) is based upon net earnings (loss) divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted EPS reflects the effect of the assumed exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) only in the periods in which such effect would have been dilutive.

Excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive, were

Stock-based Compensation-

The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award.  The cost is recognized over the vesting period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

During the first quarter of


, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) guidance on the recognition of revenues which provides a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers and supersedes most existing revenue recognition guidance. The main principle under this guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue at the amount it expects to be entitled to in exchange for the transfer of goods or services to customers. The Company applied the modified retrospective method of adoption with the cumulative effect of the initial adoption of

$


million

reflected as an adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit as of

January 1, 2018

. Prior periods continue to be presented under previous accounting guidance (See Note


).

Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost

During the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted FASB amended guidance on the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost (“net benefit cost”). This guidance requires the Company to present the service cost component of net benefit cost in the same line items on the statement of operations as other compensation costs of the related employees. All of the other components of net benefit cost are presented in the statement of operations separately from the service cost component and below the subtotal of operating income. As a result of the adoption of this guidance, the Company presented

$


million

of net benefit costs in “Other items, net” on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for


representing the components of net benefit cost other than service cost. This guidance is required to be applied retrospectively and therefore, the Company reclassified net benefit costs of

$


million

and

$


million

, including pension settlement charges, below operating income for


and


, respectively, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations (See Note


). All related amounts presented herein have been recast to conform to this presentation.

Stock Compensation: Scope of Modification Accounting

During the first quarter of


, the Company adopted FASB amended guidance on the accounting for stock-based compensation which clarifies when to account for a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award as a modification. Under this guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the classification of the award as equity or liability changes as a result of the change in the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Clarifying the Definition of a Business

During the first quarter of


, the Company adopted FASB amended guidance on the accounting for business combinations which clarifies the definition of a business and assists entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. Under this guidance, when substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single asset (or group of similar assets), the assets acquired would not represent a business. In addition, in order to be considered a business, an acquisition would have to include at a minimum an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create an output. The amended guidance also narrows the definition of outputs by more closely aligning it with how outputs are described in FASB guidance for revenue recognition. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory

During the first quarter of


, the Company adopted FASB amended guidance on the accounting for income taxes, which eliminates the exception in existing guidance that defers the recognition of the tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers other than inventory until the transferred asset is sold to a third party. Under this guidance, an entity recognizes the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash

During 2018, the Company adopted FASB amended guidance on the presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The guidance requires companies to include restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in their cash and cash equivalents balance in the statements of cash flows. This guidance also requires a reconciliation of the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows to the related balance sheet line items. This guidance is required to be applied retrospectively; however, it did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for prior years.

Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

Collaborative Arrangements: Clarifying the Interaction with the New Revenue Standard

In November 2018, the FASB issued guidance to clarify that certain transactions between parties to collaborative arrangements should be accounted for in accordance with FASB revenue guidance when the counterparty is a customer. This guidance also prohibits the presentation of collaborative arrangements as revenues from contracts with customers if the counterparty is not a customer. This guidance, which is required to be applied retrospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted, is not expected to have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that is a Service Contract

In August 2018, the FASB issued guidance on the accounting for implementation costs of a cloud computing arrangement that is considered to be a service contract. This guidance requires companies to follow the guidance for capitalizing costs associated with internal-use software to determine which costs to capitalize in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract. The guidance also specifies the financial statement presentation for capitalized implementation costs and the related amortization, as well as required financial statement disclosures. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance, which is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted.

Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans

In August 2018, the FASB issued amended guidance that eliminates, adds and clarifies certain disclosure requirements for defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance, which is required to be applied retrospectively and is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted.

Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurements

In August 2018, the FASB issued amended guidance that eliminates, adds and modifies certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. This guidance, which is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted, is not expected to have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

In February 2018, the FASB issued amended guidance that permits an entity to reclassify the income tax effects of federal tax legislation enacted in December 2017 (the “Tax Reform Act”) on items within accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance, which is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.

Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities

In August 2017, the FASB issued amended guidance for hedge accounting, which expands the eligibility of hedging strategies that qualify for hedge accounting, modifies the recognition and presentation of hedges in the financial statements, and changes how companies assess hedge effectiveness. In addition, this guidance amends and expands disclosure requirements. This guidance, which is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted, is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Leases

In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on the accounting for leases, which supersedes previous lease guidance. Under this guidance, for all leases with terms in excess of one year, including operating leases, the Company will be required to recognize on its balance sheet a lease liability and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The new guidance retains a distinction between finance leases and operating leases and the classification criteria is substantially similar to previous guidance. Additionally, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee have not significantly changed. This guidance is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2019.  The Company will apply the modified retrospective method of adoption as of January 1, 2019 and comparative periods will continue to be presented under existing lease guidance. The Company is still in the process of evaluating the impact of this guidance, including reviewing its lease portfolio as well as implementing new lease accounting software for administering its leases under the new guidance and therefore the estimated impact on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet cannot currently be determined. This change is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Goodwill and Intangible Assets Impairment Test

The Company performs a fair value-based impairment test of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, comprised of television FCC licenses and international broadcast licenses, annually during the fourth quarter and also between annual tests if an event occurs or if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value.

FCC licenses are tested for impairment at the geographic market level. The Company considers each geographic market, which is comprised of all of the Company’s television stations within that geographic market, to be a single unit of accounting because the FCC licenses at this level represent their highest and best use. At December 31,


, the Company had


television markets with FCC license book values. For international broadcast licenses, the Company considers all of its broadcast licenses within a country to be a single unit of accounting because the international broadcast licenses at this level represent their highest and best use. At December 31,


, the Company had international broadcast licenses in Australia.

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. During the fourth quarter of


, the Company began including CBS Sports Network within the Television reporting unit, which is a component of the Entertainment operating segment, reflecting changes in management structure and the integration of CBS Sports Network programming with the CBS Television Network. Prior to this change, CBS Sports Network was a standalone reporting unit and a component of the Cable Networks operating segment. At December 31,


, the Company had

seven

reporting units with goodwill balances, each one level below their respective operating segments, except for the Cable Networks reporting unit and the Publishing reporting unit, which are each the same as their respective operating segments because these operating segments each have only one component.

For its annual impairment test, the Company performs qualitative assessments for the reporting units, U.S. television markets with FCC licenses, and international broadcast licenses that management estimates have fair values that significantly exceed their respective carrying values. In selecting reporting units, markets, and broadcast licenses for a qualitative assessment, the Company also considers the duration of time since a quantitative test was performed. For the


annual impairment test, the Company performed qualitative assessments for

seven

reporting units and all of its


U.S. television markets. For each reporting unit, the Company weighed the relative impact of factors that are specific to the reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors. For each television market, the Company weighed the relative impact of market-specific and macroeconomic factors. Based on the qualitative assessments, considering the aggregation of the relevant factors, the Company concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of these reporting units and the fair value of FCC licenses within each market are less than their respective carrying values. Therefore, performing the quantitative impairment test was unnecessary.

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

For


, the Company performed a quantitative impairment test for international broadcast licenses. A quantitative impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the licenses with their carrying value. The estimated fair value is computed using the Greenfield Discounted Cash Flow Method (‘‘Greenfield Method’’), which attempts to isolate the income that is attributable to the license alone. The Greenfield Method is based upon modeling a hypothetical start-up station and building it up to a normalized operation that, by design, lacks inherent goodwill and whose other assets have essentially been added as part of the build-up process. The Greenfield Method adds the present value of the estimated annual cash flows of the start-up station over a projection period to the residual value at the end of the projection period. The annual cash flows over the projection period include assumptions for overall revenues in the relevant market, the start-up station’s operating costs and capital expenditures, and a five-year build-up period for the start-up station to reach a normalized state of operations, which reflects the point at which it achieves an average market share. The overall revenues in the subject market are estimated based on recent industry projections. Operating costs and capital expenditures are estimated based on both industry and internal data. The residual value is calculated using a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and long-term industry projections. The discount rate is determined based on the risk of achieving the projected cash flows, including the risk applicable to the industry and the market as a whole. The discount rate and perpetual nominal growth rate used for international broadcast licenses for


were


%

and

0.5

%

, respectively. The Company concluded that the estimated fair value of international broadcast licenses, which were recorded at fair value in the fourth quarter of 2017 when the Company acquired Ten Network Holdings Limited (“Network 10”), continues to approximate the carrying value and therefore no impairment charge was required.

For


, the Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test for the CBS Sports Network reporting unit prior to the inclusion of this business in the CBS Television reporting unit. The quantitative goodwill impairment test examines whether the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, which is computed based upon the present value of future cash flows (“Discounted Cash Flow Method”) and the traded or transaction values of comparable businesses (“Market Comparable Method”). If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recognized as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value. For


, the Discounted Cash Flow Method and Market Comparable Method for CBS Sports Network resulted in similar estimated fair values. The Discounted Cash Flow Method includes the Company’s assumptions for growth rates, operating margins and capital expenditures for the projection period plus the residual value of the business at the end of the projection period.  The estimated growth rates, operating margins and capital expenditures for the projection period are based on the Company’s internal forecasts of future performance as well as historical trends. The residual value is estimated based on a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and long-term industry projections and for


was

2.0

%

. The discount rate, which for


was

8.5

%

, is determined based on the risk of achieving the projected cash flows, including the risk applicable to the industry and the market as a whole.

For the


annual impairment test, the Company concluded that the estimated fair value of the CBS Sports Network reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and therefore no impairment charge was required.

Transactions

During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Network 10, one of three major commercial broadcast networks in Australia, for approximately

The Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily to manage its exposure to market risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  The Company does not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, the Company does not hold or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.

Foreign Exchange Contracts

Foreign exchange forward contracts have principally been used to hedge projected cash flows, in currencies such as the British Pound, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, generally for periods up to 24 months. The Company designates foreign exchange forward contracts used to hedge committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions as cash flow hedges.  Gains or losses on the effective portion of designated cash flow hedges are initially recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified to the statement of operations when the hedged item is recognized. Additionally, the Company enters into non-designated forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows.

At

December 31, 2018 and 2017

, the notional amount of all foreign currency contracts was

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively.

Gains (losses) recognized on derivative financial instruments were as follows:

The fair value of the Company’s derivative instruments was not material to the Consolidated Balance Sheets for any of the periods presented.

The Company continually monitors its positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to its financial instruments. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, the Company does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.

The Company’s receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at

December 31, 2018 and 2017

, due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which the Company’s products and services are sold.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The following tables set forth the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at

December 31, 2018 and 2017

. These assets and liabilities have been categorized according to the three-level fair value hierarchy established by the FASB, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. Level 1 is based on publicly quoted prices for the asset or liability in active markets. Level 2 is based on inputs that are observable other than quoted market prices in active markets, such as quoted prices for the asset or liability in inactive markets or quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities. Level 3 is based on unobservable inputs reflecting the Company’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

The Company has equity incentive plans (the “Plans”) under which stock options, RSUs and market-based performance share units (“PSUs”) were issued. The purpose of the Plans is to benefit and advance the interests of the Company by attracting, retaining and motivating participants and to compensate participants for their contributions to the financial success of the Company. The Plans provide for awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted and unrestricted shares, RSUs, dividend equivalents, performance awards and other equity-related awards. Upon exercise of stock options or vesting of RSUs, the Company issues new shares from its existing authorization. At

December 31, 2018

, there were


million

shares available for future grant under the Plans.

The following table summarizes the Company’s stock-based compensation expense for the years ended

, respectively.

II-


CBS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

RSUs and PSUs

Compensation expense for RSUs is determined based upon the market price of the shares underlying the awards on the date of grant and expensed over the vesting period, which is generally a

one

- to

four

-year service period. Certain RSU awards are also subject to satisfying performance conditions. Compensation expense is recorded based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions. Forfeitures for RSUs are estimated on the date of grant based on historical forfeiture rates. On an annual basis, the Company adjusts the compensation expense based on actual forfeitures and revises the forfeiture rate as necessary.

The weighted average grant date fair value of RSUs was

$

53.96

,

$

66.59

and

$

47.30

in

2018, 2017, and 2016

, respectively. Total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs at

December 31, 2018

was

$


million

which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of

2.4

years

.

During

2018, 2017, and 2016

, the Company also granted PSU awards. The number of shares to be issued upon vesting of the PSUs is based on the Company’s stock price performance over a designated measurement period, as well as the achievement of established operating goals. The fair value of PSU awards is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Compensation expense for PSUs is expensed over the required employee service period. The fair value of the PSU awards granted during the years ended

December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016

was

$


million

,

$


million

and

$

, respectively. All PSU awards were forfeited during


.

The following table summarizes the Company’s RSU activity.

Stock Options

Compensation expense for stock options is determined based on the grant date fair value of the award calculated using the Black-Scholes options-pricing model. Stock options generally vest over a

three

- to

four

-year service period and expire

eight

years from the date of grant. Forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant based on historical forfeiture rates. On an annual basis, the Company adjusts the compensation expense based on actual forfeitures and revises the forfeiture rate as necessary.

The weighted average fair value of stock options as of the grant date was

14.48

,

$

17.50

and

$

12.30

II-


CBS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

The expected stock price volatility is determined using a weighted average of historical volatility for CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock and implied volatility of publicly traded options to purchase CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock. Given the existence of an actively traded market for CBS Corp. options, the Company was able to derive implied volatility using publicly traded options to purchase CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock that were trading near the grant date of the employee stock options at a similar exercise price and a remaining term of greater than

one

year.

The risk-free interest rate is based on a U.S. Treasury rate in effect on the date of grant with a term equal to the expected term. The expected term is determined based on historical employee exercise and post-vesting termination behavior. The expected dividend yield represents the Company’s future expectation of the dividend yield based on current rates and historical patterns of dividend changes.

Total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock option awards at

December 31, 2018

was

The following table summarizes the components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities.

In addition to the deferred income taxes reflected in the table above, included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are net deferred income tax assets of

$


million

at both

December 31, 2018 and 2017

relating to discontinued operations.

At

December 31, 2018

, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal, state and local, and foreign jurisdictions of approximately

$

1.73

billion

, the majority of which expire in various years from


through


.

The

2018 and 2017

deferred income tax assets were reduced by a valuation allowance of

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively, principally relating to income tax benefits from capital losses and net operating losses in foreign jurisdictions which are not expected to be realized.

In December 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Reform Act which contained significant changes to U.S. federal tax law, including a reduction in the federal corporate tax rate from

35%

to

21%

and a one-time transition tax on cumulative foreign earnings and profits. For the year ended

December 31, 2017

, the Company recorded a net provisional charge of

$


million

, reflecting the estimated transition tax of

$


million

on cumulative foreign earnings and profits, offset by an estimated benefit of

$


million

to adjust the Company’s deferred income tax balances as a result of the reduced corporate income tax rate. During


, the Company completed its analysis of these provisional amounts and recorded a charge of

$


million

to adjust the estimated transition tax on cumulative foreign earnings and profits. In January 2019, the U.S. government issued guidance relating to the transition tax. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance, which will be recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements in the first quarter of 2019.

The Tax Reform Act includes a deduction for foreign derived intangible income and a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”), which imposes a U.S. tax on certain income earned by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries. The Company elected to treat the tax on GILTI as a period cost when incurred and therefore, the tax on GILTI is included in its tax provision for the year ended

December 31, 2018

.

Generally, the future remittance of foreign undistributed earnings will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes under the provisions of the Tax Reform Act and as a result, for substantially all of its foreign subsidiaries, the Company does not intend to assert indefinite reinvestment of both cash held outside of the U.S. and future cash earnings. However, a future repatriation of cash could be subject to state and local income taxes, foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes. Accordingly, the Company recorded deferred income tax liabilities associated with future

II-

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

repatriations, which were not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Additional income taxes have not been provided for outside basis differences inherent in these entities as these amounts continue to be indefinitely invested in foreign operations. The determination of the U.S. federal deferred income tax liability for such outside basis difference is not practicable.

The following table sets forth the change in the reserve for uncertain tax positions, excluding related accrued interest and penalties.

The reserve for uncertain tax positions of

$


million

at

December 31, 2018

includes

$


million

which would affect the Company’s effective income tax rate, including discontinued operations, if and when recognized in future years.

The Company recognizes interest and penalty charges related to the reserve for uncertain tax positions as income tax expense. The Company recognized interest and penalties of

$

for the year ended

December 31, 2018

,

$

December 31, 2017

and

$

, the Company has recorded liabilities for accrued interest and penalties of

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The statute of limitations for the 2014 tax year expired in September 2018. The IRS is expected to commence its examination of the 2016 and 2017 tax years during the first quarter of 2019. Various tax years are also currently under examination by state and local and foreign tax authorities. In addition, there are significant uncertainties with respect to the interpretation of tax law provisions contained in the Tax Reform Act. Guidance issued by the U.S. government in January 2019 may result in a decrease to the reserve for uncertain tax positions within the next twelve months; however, the Company is still evaluating the impact of this guidance and therefore, the amount of this decrease cannot currently be determined. In addition, future guidance issued by federal and state authorities could result in further changes to the reserve for uncertain tax positions.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans, principally non-contributory, covering eligible employees. The majority of participants in these plans are retired employees or former employees of previously divested businesses. Most of the Company’s pension plans are closed to new entrants. The benefits for some plans are based primarily on an employee’s years of service and average pay near retirement. Benefits under other plans are based primarily on an employee’s pay for each year that the employee participated in the plan. Participating employees are vested in the plans after

five years

of service. The Company funds its pension plans in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), the Pension Protection Act of 2006, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and other applicable rules and regulations. Plan assets consist principally of corporate bonds, equity securities and U.S. government securities. The Company’s common stock represents approximately

2.5

%

and

2.8

%

of the plan assets’ fair values at

December 31, 2018 and 2017

, respectively.

During the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted FASB amended guidance on the presentation of net benefit cost. This guidance requires the Company to present the service cost component of net benefit cost in the same line items on the statement of operations as other compensation costs of the related employees. All of the other components of net benefit cost are presented in the statement of operations separately from the service cost component and below the subtotal of operating income. As a result of the adoption of this guidance, the Company presented

$


million

of net benefit costs in “Other items, net” on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for


representing the components of net benefit cost other than service cost. This guidance is required to be applied retrospectively and therefore, the Company reclassified net benefit costs of

$


million

and

$


million

, including pension settlement charges, for


and


, respectively, below operating income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. All related amounts presented herein have been recast to conform to this presentation.

During


, the Company purchased a group annuity contract under which an insurance company permanently assumed the Company’s obligation to pay and administer pension benefits to certain of the Company’s pension plan participants, or their designated beneficiaries, who had been receiving pension benefits. The purchase of this group annuity contract was funded with pension plan assets. As a result, the Company’s outstanding pension benefit obligation was reduced by approximately

$


million

, which represented approximately


%

of the total obligations of the Company’s qualified pension plans. In connection with this transaction, the Company recorded a settlement charge of

$


million

in


, reflecting the accelerated recognition of a portion of unamortized actuarial losses in the plan. Additionally, during


, the Company made discretionary contributions totaling

$


million

to prefund its qualified pension plans.

During 2016, the Company offered eligible former employees who had not yet initiated pension benefit payments the option to make a one-time election to receive the present value of their pension benefits as a lump-sum distribution or to commence an immediate monthly annuity benefit. As a result, the Company paid a total of

$


million

of lump-sum distributions in 2016 using its pension plan assets, which represented


%

of the total obligations of its qualified pension plans. Accordingly, the Company recorded a settlement charge of

$


million

, reflecting the accelerated recognition of a portion of unamortized actuarial losses in the plan.

In addition, the Company sponsors health and welfare plans that provide postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retired employees and their covered dependents. Eligibility is based in part on certain age and service requirements at the time of their retirement. Most of the plans are contributory and contain cost-sharing features such as deductibles and coinsurance which are adjusted annually, as well as caps on the annual dollar amount the Company will contribute toward the cost of coverage. Claims are paid primarily with the Company’s funds.

Plan Assets

The asset allocations for the Company’s U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan trust and international pension plan trusts are based upon an analysis of the timing and amount of projected benefit payments, projected company contributions, the expected returns and risk of the asset classes and the correlation of those returns. The target asset allocation for the Company’s U.S. pension plan trust, which accounted for

%

in equity investments, and the remainder in cash, cash equivalents and other investments. Long duration fixed income investments consist of a diversified portfolio of fixed income instruments that are substantially all investment grade, with a duration that approximates the duration of the liabilities covered by the trust. All equity portfolios are diversified between U.S. and non-U.S. equities and include large and small capitalization equities. The asset allocations are reviewed regularly.

The following tables set forth the Company’s pension plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis at

December 31, 2018 and 2017

. These assets have been categorized according to the three-level fair value hierarchy established by the FASB which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. Level 1 is based on quoted prices for the asset in active markets. Level 2 is based on inputs that are observable other than quoted market prices in active markets, such as quoted prices for the asset in inactive markets or quoted prices for similar assets. Level 3 is based on unobservable inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset.

(a)  Assets categorized as Level 2 reflect investments in money market funds.

(b)  Securities of diverse sectors and industries, substantially all investment grade.

(c)  In accordance with FASB guidance investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.

(d)  Underlying investments consist mainly of U.S. large capitalization and international equity securities.

Money market investments are carried at amortized cost which approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of these investments. Investments in equity securities are reported at fair value based on quoted market prices on national security exchanges. The fair value of investments in common collective funds and mutual funds are determined using the net asset value (“NAV”) provided by the administrator of the fund as a practical expedient. The NAV is determined by each fund’s trustee based upon the fair value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, less liabilities, divided by the number of outstanding units. The fair value of U.S. treasury securities is determined based on quoted market prices in active markets. The fair value of government related securities and corporate bonds is determined based on quoted market prices on national security exchanges, when available, or using valuation models which incorporate certain other observable inputs including recent trading activity for comparable securities and broker quoted prices. The fair value of mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities is based upon valuation models which incorporate available dealer quotes, projected cash flows and market information. The fair value of limited partnerships has been estimated using the NAV of the ownership interest. The NAV is determined using quarterly financial statements issued by the partnership which determine the value based on the fair value of the underlying investments.

Multiemployer Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans

The Company contributes to a number of multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover its union-represented employees including talent, writers, directors, producers and other employees, primarily in the entertainment industry. The other employers participating in these multiemployer plans are primarily in the entertainment and other related industries. The risks of participating in multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans as assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers and if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. In addition, if the Company chooses to stop participating in some of its multiemployer plans it may be required to pay those plans a withdrawal liability based on the underfunded status of the plan.

The financial health of a multiemployer plan is indicated by the zone status, as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. Plans in the red zone are in critical status; those in the yellow zone are in endangered status; and those in the green zone are neither critical nor endangered.

SEGMENT AND REVENUE INFORMATION

The following tables set forth the Company’s financial performance by reportable segment. The Company’s operating segments, which are the same as its reportable segments, have been determined in accordance with the Company’s internal management structure, which is organized based upon products and services. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company began presenting CBS Sports Network in the Entertainment segment, to reflect changes in management structure and the integration of CBS Sports Network programming with the CBS Television Network. CBS Sports Network was previously included in the Cable Networks segment. Results for all periods presented have been reclassified to conform to this presentation.

Revenues generated between segments primarily reflect advertising sales, content licensing and station affiliation fees. These transactions are recorded at market value as if the sales were to third parties and are eliminated in consolidation.

The Company presents operating income (loss) excluding costs for restructuring and other corporate matters, programming charges and other operating items, net, each where applicable, (“Segment Operating Income”) as the primary measure of profit and loss for its operating segments (“segment profit measure”) in accordance with FASB guidance for segment reporting. The Company believes the presentation of Segment Operating Income is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view segment performance in a manner similar to the primary method used by the Company’s management and enhances their ability to understand the Company’s operating performance.

(a) During the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted amended FASB guidance on the presentation of net benefit cost. As a result, the components of net benefit cost other than the service cost component are presented in the statement of operations below the subtotal of operating income. All prior periods have been recast to conform to this presentation.

ADOPTION OF

“

REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS

”

On

January 1, 2018

, the Company adopted FASB Accounting Standards Codification 606 (“ASC 606”) on the recognition of revenues using the modified retrospective method applied to all contracts. Results for reporting periods beginning after

January 1, 2018

are presented under ASC 606 while prior periods have not been adjusted. The Company recorded an increase to accumulated deficit of

$


million

as of

January 1, 2018

reflecting the cumulative impact of the adoption of ASC 606.

The adoption of ASC 606 primarily resulted in two changes to the Company’s revenue recognition policies.

•

Revenues from Distribution Arrangements

Revenues from the Company’s distribution of third-party content are now recognized based on the gross amount of consideration received from the customer, with an offsetting participation expense recognized for the fees paid to the third party. Under previous accounting guidance, such revenues, which include content licensing and distribution revenues and advertising revenues, were recognized at the net amount retained by the Company after the payment of fees to the third party. For the year ended

December 31, 2018

, revenues and operating expenses relating to such distribution arrangements were

$


million

higher under ASC 606 than the amounts that would have been reported under previous accounting guidance, with

no

impact to operating income.

•

Revenues from the Renewal of Licensing Agreements

Revenues associated with the renewal of an existing license agreement are now recognized at the beginning of the renewal period. Under previous accounting guidance, these revenues were recognized upon the execution of such renewal. Content licensing and distribution revenue comparisons will continue to be impacted by fluctuations resulting from the timing of when Company-owned television series are made available for multiyear licensing agreements. Therefore, this change is not expected to have a material impact on the trend of the Company’s financial results. Additionally, historically, on an annual basis, revenues from renewals executed each year have approximated revenues associated with renewal periods that began in the same year.

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

The following table presents the amount by which each applicable financial statement line item on the Consolidated Statement of Operations would have decreased for


if license renewals were recognized under previous accounting guidance.

In addition, the adoption of ASC 606 resulted in certain classification changes on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The primary change is the reclassification of the sales returns reserve relating to the publishing business to “Other current liabilities.” Such amount, which was

$


million

at

December 31, 2018

, was previously presented as a reduction to receivables.

The following table presents the amount by which each applicable financial statement line item on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at

December 31, 2018

would increase (decrease) if all of the above changes resulting from the adoption of ASC 606 were presented under previous accounting guidance.

ASC 606 also requires enhanced disclosures relating to the Company’s revenues from contracts with customers (See Note


), including the disaggregation of revenues into categories (See Note


).

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

On November 16, 2017, the Company completed the split-off of CBS Radio through an exchange offer, in which the Company accepted

17.9

million

shares of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock from its stockholders in exchange for the

101.4

million

shares of CBS Radio common stock that it owned. Immediately following the exchange offer, each share of CBS Radio common stock was converted into one share of Entercom Communications Corp. (“Entercom”) Class A common stock upon completion of the merger of CBS Radio and Entercom. CBS Radio has been presented as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.

The following tables set forth details of net earnings (loss) from discontinued operations for the years ended

December 31, 2017 and 2016

.

(a) During 2017, prior to the split-off, CBS Radio was measured each reporting period at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. The value of the transaction with Entercom was determined based on Entercom’s stock price at the closing of the transaction and therefore, the Company recorded a market value adjustment of

$


million

in 2017 to adjust the carrying value of CBS Radio to the value indicated by the stock valuation of Entercom.

(b) Reflects a tax benefit from the resolution of a tax matter in a foreign jurisdiction relating to a previously disposed business that was accounted for as a discontinued operation.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company’s commitments not recorded on the balance sheet primarily consist of programming and talent commitments, operating lease arrangements and purchase obligations for goods and services resulting from the Company’s normal course of business.

Programming and talent commitments of the Company, estimated to aggregate

$

8.98

billion

as of

December 31, 2018

, primarily include

$

6.62

billion

for sports programming rights,

$

1.71

billion

relating to the production and licensing of television and film programming, and

$


million

for talent contracts.  The Company also has committed purchase obligations which include agreements to purchase goods or services in the future that totaled

$


million

as of

December 31, 2018

.

Other long-term contractual obligations recorded on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet include program liabilities; participations due to producers; residuals; and a tax liability resulting from the enactment of the Tax Reform Act in December 2017. This tax liability reflects the estimated tax on the Company’s historical accumulated foreign earnings and profits, which is payable to the IRS over eight years.

At

December 31, 2018

, commitments for programming and talent and purchase obligations not recorded on the balance sheet, and other long-term contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet were payable as follows:

The Company has long-term noncancellable operating lease commitments for office space, equipment, transponders and studio facilities. The Company also enters into capital leases for satellite transponders.

At

Guarantees

The Company has indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business. At

December 31, 2018

, the outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds approximated

$


million

and were not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

In the course of its business, the Company both provides and receives indemnities which are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, the Company may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification obligation. The Company records a liability for its indemnification obligations and other contingent liabilities when probable and reasonably estimable.

Legal Matters

General.

On an ongoing basis, the Company vigorously defends itself in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and responds to various investigations and inquiries from federal, state, local and international authorities (collectively, “litigation’’). Litigation may be brought against the Company without merit, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on its understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company believes that the below-described legal matters and other litigation to which it is a party are not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Under the separation agreement between the Company and Viacom Inc., the Company and Viacom Inc. have agreed to defend and indemnify the other in certain litigation in which the Company and/or Viacom Inc. is named.

Investigation-Related Matters

. As announced on August 1, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors (“Board”) retained two law firms to conduct a full investigation of the allegations in recent press reports about the Company’s former Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Leslie Moonves, CBS News and cultural issues at all levels of the Company. On December 17, 2018, the Board announced the completion of the investigation, certain findings of the investigation and the Board’s determination, discussed below, with respect to the termination of Mr. Moonves’s employment. The Company has received subpoenas from the New York County District Attorney’s Office and the New York City Commission on Human Rights regarding the subject matter of this investigation and related matters. The New York State Attorney General’s Office has also requested information about these matters. The Company may receive additional related regulatory and investigative inquiries from these and other entities in the future. The Company is cooperating with these inquiries.

On August 27, 2018 and on October 1, 2018, each of Gene Samit and John Lantz, respectively, filed putative class action suits in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, individually and on behalf of others similarly situated, for claims that are similar to those alleged in the amended complaint described below. On November 6, 2018, the Court entered an order consolidating the two actions. On November 30, 2018, the Court appointed Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern California as the lead plaintiff of the consolidated action. On February 11, 2019, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended putative class action complaint against the Company, certain current and former senior executives and members of the Board. The consolidated action is stated to be on behalf of purchasers of the Company’s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock between September 26, 2016 and December 4, 2018. This action seeks to recover damages arising during this time period allegedly caused by the defendants’ purported violations of the federal securities laws, including by allegedly making materially false and misleading statements or failing to disclose material information, and seeks costs and expenses as well as remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.

Separation Agreement

.  On September 9, 2018, the Company entered into a separation and settlement agreement and releases (the “Separation Agreement”) with Mr. Leslie Moonves, pursuant to which Mr. Moonves resigned as a director and as Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Pursuant to the

II-


CBS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Separation Agreement, the Company is contributing the aggregate amount of

$


million

toward various charitable organizations that support the #MeToo movement and equality for women in the workplace, which organizations were mutually agreed by the Company and Mr. Moonves. The Company has recorded the contribution of

$


million

in “Restructuring and other corporate matters” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended

December 31, 2018

. In October 2018, the Company contributed

$


million

to a grantor trust. On December 17, 2018, the Board announced that, following its consideration of the findings of the investigation referred to above, it had determined that there were grounds to terminate Mr. Moonves’s employment for cause under his employment agreement with the Company. Any dispute related to the Board’s determination is subject to binding arbitration as set forth in the Separation Agreement. On January 16, 2019, Mr. Moonves notified the Company of his election to demand binding arbitration with respect to this matter and the related Board investigation. The assets of the grantor trust will remain in the trust until a final determination in the arbitration. The Company is currently unable to determine the outcome of the arbitration and the amount, if any, that may be awarded thereunder and, accordingly, no accrual for this matter has been made in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Claims Related to Former Businesses: Asbestos.

The Company is a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. The Company is typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of the Company’s products is the basis of a claim. Claims against the Company in which a product has been identified most commonly relate to allegations of exposure to asbestos-containing insulating material used in conjunction with turbines.

Claims are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. The Company does not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets that some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of

December 31, 2018

, the Company had pending approximately

31,570

asbestos claims, as compared with approximately

31,660

as of

December 31, 2017

and

33,610

as of

December 31, 2016

. During


, the Company received approximately

3,290

new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately

3,380

claims. The Company reports claims as closed when it becomes aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when the Company has reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claims, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. The Company’s total costs for the years


and


for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax were approximately $


million

and $


million

, respectively. The Company’s costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year and insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses.

II-


CBS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

The Company believes that its reserves and insurance are adequate to cover its asbestos liabilities. This belief is based upon many factors and assumptions, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims. While the number of asbestos claims filed against the Company has remained generally flat in recent years, it is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may occur, including, among others, the number and types of claims and average cost to resolve such claims, which could affect the Company’s estimate of its asbestos liabilities.

Other.

The Company from time to time receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that it is or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to historical and predecessor operations of the Company. In addition, the Company from time to time receives personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from historical operations of the Company and its predecessors.
