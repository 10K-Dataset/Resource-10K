FILMED ENTERTAINMENT

Overview

Our

Filmed Entertainment

segment develops, produces, finances, acquires and distributes films, television programming and other entertainment content in various markets and media worldwide through its Paramount Pictures, Paramount Players, Paramount Animation and Paramount Television Studios divisions. It partners on various projects with key ViacomCBS brands, including Nickelodeon Movies, MTV Films

®

and BET Films

™

.

Films produced, acquired and/or distributed by the

Filmed Entertainment

segment are generally first exhibited theatrically in domestic and/or international markets and then released in various markets through airlines and hotels, electronic sell-through, DVDs and Blu-ray discs, transactional video-on-demand (“TVOD”), pay television, SVOD, basic cable television, free television and free video-on-demand (“FVOD”).

Our

Filmed Entertainment

segment’s revenues are generated primarily from the release and/or distribution of films theatrically, the release and/or distribution of film and television product through home entertainment, the licensing of film and television product to television and digital platforms and other ancillary activities.  In 2019, our

Filmed Entertainment

segment licensing revenues, home entertainment revenues and theatrical revenues were approximately 57%, 21% and 18%, respectively, of total revenues for this segment. Our

Filmed Entertainment

segment generated 10%, 11% and 12% of our consolidated revenues in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

®

nominations.

Film Production, Distribution and Financing

Paramount produces many of the films it releases and also acquires films for distribution from third parties. In some cases, Paramount co-finances and/or co-distributes films with third parties, including other studios. Paramount also enters into film-specific financing and slate financing arrangements from time to time under which third parties participate in the financing of the costs of a film or group of films in exchange for an economic participation and a partial copyright interest. Paramount

distributes films worldwide or in select territories or media, and may engage third-party distributors for certain pictures in certain territories.

Paramount has several multi-picture production, distribution and financing relationships, including its agreement with Skydance Productions (“Skydance”), under which Paramount

and Skydance produce and finance certain films, and Paramount has a first look on Skydance-initiated projects. Paramount also has an agreement with Hasbro Inc. (“Hasbro”) involving the production, financing and distribution of live action and animated films based on Hasbro’s expansive list of properties.  In December 2019, in connection with ViacomCBS’ entry into an agreement to acquire a 49% interest in Miramax, Paramount and Miramax entered into first-look, co-financing and distribution agreements under which they will collaborate on production and financing of new film and television projects, and Paramount

will distribute such new projects, as well as Miramax library content.

Domestically, Paramount generally performs marketing and distribution services for theatrical releases and sales and marketing services for its home entertainment releases. Paramount has an agreement with Universal Studios for certain back-office and distribution services for all physical DVD and Blu-ray discs released by Paramount in the U.S. and Canada. Paramount also distributes CBS’ television and other library content and Nickelodeon television shows on DVD and Blu-ray disc on a worldwide basis. Internationally, Paramount generally distributes its theatrical releases through its own international affiliates or, in territories where it does not have an operating presence, through United International Pictures, a joint venture with Universal Studios. For home entertainment releases, Paramount’s physical DVD and Blu-ray discs are distributed in certain international territories by Universal Pictures Home

I-


Entertainment and in certain other territories by Paramount licensees. Paramount also distributes films and television shows domestically and internationally on electronic sell-through, TVOD, SVOD, FVOD and television platforms. In the first domestic pay television distribution window, Paramount’s feature films initially theatrically released in the U.S. are generally exhibited on EPIX.

Producing, marketing and distributing films and television programming can involve significant costs, and the timing of a film’s release can cause our financial results to vary. For example, marketing costs are generally incurred before and throughout the theatrical release of a film and, to a lesser extent, other distribution windows, and are expensed as incurred. As a result, we typically incur losses with respect to a particular film prior to and during the film’s theatrical exhibition, and recoupment of investment as well as profitability for the film may not be realized until well after its theatrical release. Therefore, the results of the

Filmed Entertainment

segment can be volatile as films work their way through the various distribution windows.

Our revenues, expenses and operating

I-


results may vary based on the timing, mix, number and availability of our films and other programming and on seasonal factors

Advertising

Advertising revenues are generated primarily from the sale of advertising spots on the CBS Television Network, our basic cable networks and our television stations, as well as on our ad-supported streaming services, including CBS All Access and Pluto TV, and on our websites. Our advertising revenues include integrated marketing services, which provide unique branded content and custom sponsorship opportunities to our advertisers, as well as advanced marketing solutions, including addressable video and brand solutions.

Affiliate

Affiliate revenues are principally comprised of fees received from MVPDs and virtual MVPDs for carriage of our cable networks, fees received from television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network, fees for authorizing the MVPDs’ and virtual MVPDs’ carriage of our owned television stations, and subscription fees for our streaming services.

Content Licensing

Content licensing revenues are principally comprised of fees from the licensing of exhibition rights for our internally-produced television and film programming to television stations, cable networks and SVOD and FVOD services; home entertainment revenues, which are derived from the sale and distribution of our content through DVDs and Blu-ray discs to wholesale and retail partners, as well as from the viewing of our content on a transactional basis through TVOD and electronic sell-through services; fees from the use of our trademarks and brands for consumer products, recreation and live events, and fees from the distribution of third-party programming.

Theatrical

Theatrical revenues are principally comprised of the worldwide theatrical distribution of films through audience ticket sales.

Publishing

Publishing revenues are principally comprised of the domestic and international publishing and distribution of consumer books in printed, digital and audio formats.

COMPETITION

All of our businesses operate in highly competitive environments, and compete for creative talent and intellectual property, as well as audience and distribution of our content.

Our

TV Entertainment

,

Cable Networks

and

Filmed Entertainment

segments compete with a variety of media companies that have substantial resources to produce and acquire content worldwide, including broadcast networks, basic and premium cable networks, streaming services, film and television studios, production groups, independent producers and syndicators, television stations and television station groups.  These segments compete with other content creators for creative talent including producers, directors, actors and writers, as well as for new program ideas and intellectual property and for the acquisition of popular programming.  Similarly, our

Publishing

segment competes with large publishers for the rights to works by authors, and competition is particularly strong for well-known authors and public personalities.

Our businesses also face significant competition for audience share from various sources.  Our

Filmed Entertainment

segment competes for audiences for its theatrical films with releases by other major film studios, television producers and streaming services as well as with other forms of entertainment and consumer spending

I-


outlets.  Our

TV Entertainment

and

Cable Networks

segments compete for audiences and advertising revenues primarily with other cable and broadcast television networks; social media platforms; websites, apps and other online experiences; radio programming; and print media.  In addition, our television and basic cable networks businesses face increasing competition from technologies providing digital audio and visual content in ways that allow audiences to consume content of their choosing while avoiding traditional commercial advertising.   Moreover, our businesses face competition from the many other entertainment options available to consumers including video games, sports, travel and outdoor recreation.

We also face competition for distribution of our content.  Our

TV Entertainment

and

Cable Networks

segments compete for distribution of our program services (and receipt of related fees) with other broadcast networks, cable networks and programmers. The CBS Television Network also competes with other broadcast networks to secure affiliations with independently owned television stations to ensure the effective distribution of network programming nationwide.  Our

TV Entertainment

,

Cable Networks

and

Filmed Entertainment

segments compete with studios and other producers of entertainment content for distribution on third party platforms.  Our

Publishing

segment competes with large publishers for sales to retailers, and mass merchandisers and on-line retailers have contributed to a general trend toward consolidation in the retail channel.  In addition, the growth of the electronic book market has impacted print book retailers and wholesalers, and could result in a reduction of these channels for the sales and marketing of our books.

ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE STRATEGY

ViacomCBS is committed to responsible and sustainable business practices, which strengthen our ability to innovate and better serve our partners, audiences and stockholders. We are proactively identifying, measuring and mapping the environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) impacts of our global operations and are working to manage and report on various non-financial ESG impacts in an effort to transparently address them with stakeholders.

As content creators, we are passionate about entertaining and informing the world and are committed to our legacy of creating lasting impact through our work. From groundbreaking HIV awareness initiatives to campaigns supporting education, the empowerment of women and youth, health issues and the military, veterans and their families, we have always strived to be at the forefront of championing the causes that matter to our audiences. Today, we continue to leverage our brands and our global reach to amplify the efforts of those who are working to make positive changes in their communities. Striving to be a good corporate citizen and to make a positive impact in communities around the world is fundamental to what we do every day. Below are just a few examples of our efforts:

We continue to use the immense power of our media platforms to heighten social awareness on important issues through our award-winning CBS Cares public service announcement (“PSA”) campaigns. In 2019, the CBS Television Network scheduled CBS Cares PSAs with an estimated value of $276 million and featuring a wide array of CBS talent on a variety of important topics such as heritage and history months, child advocacy, empowerment of women and girls, support for the military, veterans and their families, and health awareness. Examples include:

•

We and Girls Inc. created a PSA that aired in-game during the CBS Television Network’s Super Bowl LIII coverage, and post-game on the CBS Sports Network. Featuring the voiceover of

CBS This Morning

’s Gayle King and players from the NY Giants, the PSA encourages girls to believe they can succeed at the highest levels.

I-


•

We produce and air annual PSAs as part of our commitment to honor the victims of the Holocaust on International Holocaust Remembrance Day.

•

We and the Association of National Advertisers again teamed up for a multi-pronged partnership in support of the #SeeHer initiative to accurately portray girls and women in media. Supporting PSAs ran in primetime as part of Women’s History Month and featured Norah O’Donnell, Gayle King, Tea Leoni, Carrie Ann Inaba and others.

•

CBS Cares tackled the issue of sexual harassment, by continuing to air PSAs featuring Bridget Moynahan, Daniela Ruah and Aisha Tyler.

•

PSAs featuring Shemar Moore, Aisha Tyler, Sara Gilbert and Sheryl Underwood continued to air, teaching children about the importance of other cultures, races and religions, and emphasizing that we are all enriched by our differences.

The Save The Music Foundation helps kids, schools, and communities realize their full potential through the power of making music.

Since inception, we have donated over $58 million worth of new musical instruments and technology to 2,159 schools in 276 school districts around the country, impacting the lives of countless students.

Beyond the Backpack is a celebration of Nickelodeon’s curriculum-based preschool properties. The initiative champions kindergarten and pre-k readiness by providing fun, simple and unique tools to address the five areas identified as critical to educational success: Family Engagement, Health & Wellness, Literacy Skills, Social & Emotional Skills, and STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math) Skills. Beyond the Backpack reinforces the academic community’s view that parents and caregivers are their child's first teachers and that it is never too early to start getting ready. In 2019, Nickelodeon donated 75,000 printed toolkits and 2,500 backpacks full of school supplies.

Paramount has a long and proud tradition of giving back with a corporate social responsibility program focused on four key initiatives: supporting public education; protecting the environment; combating HIV/AIDS; and promoting volunteerism. By offering employee engagement opportunities, coupled with financial and in-kind contributions, Paramount supports numerous local, national, and global non-profit organizations. Kindergarten to Cap & Gown - Paramount’s signature education program - mentors students through their educational experience, targeting four partner schools in Paramount’s Los Angeles neighborhood.

In 2019, Paramount Network debuted the first installments of Take Action - a short-form digital documentary series addressing important social issues related to our content themes. We believe that stories of individual volunteers and activists have the power to connect us, inspire action and, ultimately, create real change. Each film includes a call-to-action, partnering with a nonprofit organization to give the audience the opportunity to learn more and take action themselves.

The MTV Staying Alive Foundation produces multi-award-winning, impactful behavior change campaigns to further its purpose of storytelling to save lives and enable young people to make empowered, informed choices about their health and wellbeing.

Our robust Veterans Network (“VetNet”) engages in multiple programs and supports numerous veteran-related causes. Among its activities in 2019, VetNet worked with our legal teams to provide more than 4,000 hours of critical, pro-bono legal assistance to more than 200 veterans and their families, representing approximately $1.5 million of legal fees donated; hosted a virtual career advice event for veterans in partnership with American Corporate Partners; worked with partners to provide mentorship and internships for 850 veterans; and collected more than 100,000 donations, including toys for veteran families and toiletries for the homeless.

REGULATION AND PROTECTION OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

We are, fundamentally, a content company, so the trademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property laws that protect our brands and content are of paramount importance to us. Our businesses and the intellectual property they create or acquire are subject to and affected by laws and regulations of U.S. federal, state and local governmental authorities, as well as laws and regulations of countries other than the U.S. and pan-national bodies such as the European Union (“EU”). The laws and regulations affecting our businesses are constantly subject to change, as are the protections that those laws and regulations afford us. The discussion below describes certain, but not all, present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our businesses.

I-


FCC and Similar Regulation

General.

Broadcast television and certain aspects of cable programming are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act. The Communications Act empowers the FCC, among other actions, to issue, renew, revoke and modify broadcasting licenses; penalize broadcasters for airing indecent or profane content; regulate the airing of emergency alerting and the use of emergency alerting tones by broadcasters or cable channels; require video programming to be accessible to persons with disabilities; determine stations’ frequencies, locations and operating power; and impose penalties for violation of its regulations, including monetary forfeitures, short-term renewal of licenses and, in egregious cases, license revocation or denial of license renewals.

Under the Communications Act, the FCC also regulates certain aspects of the operation of MVPDs and certain other electronic media that compete with broadcast stations and cable programming.

We provide below a brief summary of certain laws and FCC regulations under which we operate.

License Renewals.

Television broadcast licenses are typically granted for standard terms of eight years. The Communications Act requires the FCC to renew a broadcast license if the FCC finds that the station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity and, with respect to the station, there have been no serious violations by the licensee of either the Communications Act or the FCC’s rules and regulations and there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or the FCC’s rules and regulations that, taken together, constitute a pattern of abuse.  We have no pending renewal applications, but we will be filing renewal applications with respect to all of our stations on a staggered basis between 2020 and 2023. A station remains authorized to operate while its license renewal application is pending.

License Assignments and Transfers of Licensee Control.

The Communications Act requires prior FCC approval for the assignment of a license or transfer of control of an FCC licensee. Third parties may oppose our applications to assign, acquire, or transfer control of broadcast licenses.

Ownership Regulation.

The Communications Act and FCC rules and regulations limit the ability of individuals and entities to have certain official positions or ownership interests, known as “attributable” interests, above specific levels in broadcast stations. In seeking FCC approval for the acquisition of a broadcast station license, the acquiring person or entity must demonstrate that the acquisition complies with the FCC’s ownership rules or that a waiver of the rules is in the public interest.

Below are descriptions of broadcast ownership rules. The FCC is reviewing its local television ownership and dual network rules through its most recent quadrennial review that commenced in November 2018 and is separately reviewing its television national audience reach rule. The FCC had relaxed certain of these rules in 2017, but in November 2019, a federal appellate court vacated that 2017 action and ordered the FCC to conduct further proceedings.

Local Television Ownership.

The FCC’s local television ownership rule limits the number of full-power television stations that may be commonly owned in the same DMA. For example, common ownership of two full-power stations in a market generally is allowed only if at least eight independently owned and operating full-power stations will remain in the market following the acquisition of the second station, and if at least one of the stations is outside of the top-four ranked stations in the market based on audience share.

Dual Network Rule.

The dual network rule prohibits any of the four major networks, ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC, from combining or being under common control.

Television National Audience Reach Limitation.

Under the national television ownership rule, one party may not own television stations that reach more than 39% of all U.S. television households, although under current FCC rules a UHF station is attributed with reaching only 50% of the television households in its market.  In December 2017, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking pursuant to which it will consider modifying, retaining or eliminating the 39% national television audience reach limitation and/or the UHF

I-


discount.  We currently own and operate television stations that reach approximately 38% or 25% of all U.S. television households on an undiscounted or discounted basis, respectively.

Cross-ownership restrictions

.  FCC “cross-ownership” rules reinstated as a result of a decision by a federal appellate court (a) prohibit common ownership of one or more broadcast stations (whether radio or television) and a daily newspaper in the same DMA, and (b) limit the number of radio and television broadcast stations that may be commonly owned in a given DMA. We do not currently own cognizable interests in any daily newspapers or radio broadcast stations.

Alien Ownership.

In general, the Communications Act restricts foreign individuals or entities from collectively owning more than 25% of our voting power or equity. FCC approval is required to exceed the 25% threshold. The FCC has recently approved foreign ownership levels of up to 100% in certain instances, subsequent to its review and approval of specific, named foreign individuals.

Cable and Satellite Carriage of Television Broadcast Stations.

The Communications Act and FCC rules govern the retransmission of broadcast television stations by cable system operators, direct broadcast satellite operators, and other MVPDs. Pursuant to these regulations, we have elected to negotiate with MVPDs for the right to carry our broadcast television stations pursuant to retransmission consent agreements. Federal law requires that broadcasters and MVPDs negotiate in good faith for retransmission consent.  Some MVPDs have sought changes to federal law that would eliminate or otherwise limit the ability of broadcasters to obtain fair compensation for the grant of retransmission consent.

National Broadband Plan/Post-Auction Repack

.  In 2017, the FCC concluded a series of voluntary auctions to repurpose certain spectrum then utilized by broadcast television stations for use by wireless broadband services. The FCC has mandated that certain television stations that are continuing to operate subsequent to these auctions must change their channels as the FCC “repacks” the remaining spectrum dedicated to broadcast television use. Congress provided that the FCC will assist television stations in retaining their current coverage areas and established a fund to at least partially reimburse broadcasters for reasonable relocation expenses relating to the spectrum-repacking. Certain broadcast television stations, including some of those owned by us, are in the process of undertaking this repacking process and seeking reimbursement of associated costs.

Program Regulation.

The FCC’s rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent or profane material between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. The FCC’s maximum forfeiture penalty per station for broadcasting indecent or profane programming is approximately $415,000 per indecent or profane utterance, with a maximum forfeiture exposure of approximately $3.83 million for any continuing violation arising from a single act or failure to act. FCC regulations also prohibit broadcast television stations and cable networks from transmitting or causing the transmission of Emergency Alert System (“EAS”) tones in the absence of an actual emergency, authorized test of the EAS, or a qualified public service announcement. In September 2019, the FCC issued a Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture finding that a CBS Television Network program broadcast in April 2018 violated the EAS rule and imposed a forfeiture of $272,000, which we timely paid.

Broadcast Transmission Standard

.  In November 2017, the FCC adopted rules to permit television broadcasters to voluntarily broadcast using the “Next Generation” broadcast television transmission standard developed by the Advanced Television Systems Committee, Inc., also called “ATSC 3.0.” Those full-service television stations using the new standard are subject to certain requirements, including the obligation to continue broadcasting a generally identical program stream in the current ATSC 1.0 broadcast standard. The ATSC 3.0 standard can be used to offer better picture quality and improved mobile broadcast viewing. A television station converting to ATSC 3.0 operation will incur significant costs in equipment purchases and upgrades. In addition, consumers may be required to obtain new television sets or other equipment that are capable of receiving ATSC 3.0 broadcasts. We are participating in various ATSC 3.0 testing with other broadcasters, but it is too early to predict any impact of this technical standard on our operations.

Children’s Programming.

Our business is subject to various regulations, both in the U.S. and abroad, applicable to children’s programming. Since 1990, federal legislation and rules of the FCC have limited the amount and content

I-


of commercial matter that may be shown on broadcast television stations and cable channels during programming designed for children 12 years of age and younger, and since 2006 the FCC has limited the display of certain commercial website addresses during children’s programming. Moreover, each of our broadcast television stations is required to air, in general, three hours per week of educational and informational programming (“E/I programming”) designed for children 16 years of age and younger, with at least two of those three hours appearing on the station’s primary program stream. The FCC made certain modifications to its E/I programming rules in 2019, which provided additional flexibility to broadcasters with respect to certain aspects of these rules.

In addition, some policymakers have sought limitations on food and beverage marketing in media popular with children and teens. For example, restrictions on the television advertising of foods high in fat, salt and sugar (“HFSS”) to children aged 15 and under have been in place in the UK since 2007. The UK government is currently considering tighter controls, including a ban on all HFSS advertising before 9:00 p.m. Various laws with similar objectives have also been enacted in Ireland, Turkey, Mexico, Chile, Peru, Taiwan and South Korea, and significant pressure for similar restrictions continues to be felt globally, most acutely in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, India, Hungary, Singapore, South Africa and France. The implementation of these or similar limitations and restrictions could have a negative impact on our

Cable Networks

advertising revenues, particularly for our networks with programming for children and teens.

Certain Other Regulations Affecting Our Business

Global Data Protection Laws and Children’s Privacy Laws.

A number of data protection laws impact, or may impact, the manner in which ViacomCBS collects, processes and transfers personal data. In the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) mandates data protection compliance obligations and authorizes significant fines for noncompliance, requiring significant compliance resources and efforts on our part. Further, a number of other regions where we do business, including the U.S., Asia and Latin America, have enacted or are considering new data protection regulations that may impact our business activities that involve the processing of personal data. For example, in the U.S., the California Consumer Privacy Act, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, creates a host of new obligations for businesses regarding how they handle the personal information of California residents, including creating new data access, data deletion and opt out rights. In addition, some of the mechanisms ViacomCBS relies upon for the transfer of personal data from the EU to the U.S., such as utilizing standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission (“EC”), have been subject to legal challenges, and the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework, which permits the transfer of personal data from the EU to the U.S., is subject to review by the relevant EU and U.S. authorities. The outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain and may require changes to our international data transfer mechanisms.

In addition, we are subject to other laws and regulations intended specifically to protect the interests of children, including the privacy of minors online. The U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) limits the collection by operators of websites or online services of personal information online from children under the age of 13. In July 2019, the Federal Trade Commission initiated a review of its regulations implementing COPPA, which we anticipate will be updated to address changes in technology. In the EU, GDPR also limits our ability to process data from children under the age of 16. Such regulations also restrict the types of advertising we are able to sell on these sites and apps and impose strict liability on us for certain actions of ViacomCBS, advertisers and other third parties, which could affect advertising demand and pricing. State and federal policymakers are also considering regulatory and legislative methods to protect consumer privacy on the Internet, and these efforts have focused particular attention on children and teens.

Compliance with enhanced data protection laws, which may be inconsistent with one another, requires additional resources and efforts on our part, and noncompliance with personal data protection regulations could result in increased regulatory enforcement and significant monetary fines.

EU Commission’s Digital Single Market Strategy.

The EU continues to pursue its Digital Single Market (“DSM”) Strategy, which contains a broad range of proposals designed to create a more complete EU-wide market for digital goods and services, several of which are likely to impact ViacomCBS’ businesses.

I-


In November 2018, the EU adopted a number of reforms to the Audiovisual Media Services Directive (the “AVMSD”), which sets content and advertising rules for European broadcasters. The AVMSD applies the country-of-origin principle to linear and non-linear TV services, enabling cross-border broadcasts from a single regulatory jurisdiction, and sets compulsory minimum pan-EU content and advertising rules that Member States may choose to exceed. These reforms include a mandatory quota for European works on on-demand audiovisual services platforms, the option for EU states to introduce levies on the revenues of audiovisual media-service providers, and liberalized rules governing the scheduling of advertising on linear broadcasters. Member States have until September 2020 to transpose the reforms into national law. These changes could impact revenues for the VCNI television channels business in Europe and affiliate deals with platforms for both film and TV distribution.

In June 2019, two new EU directives became effective and may impact the way we acquire and distribute content online. The Copyright Directive introduced a requirement to agree to terms for the carriage of copyrighted content on online platforms (or to remove content in the absence of such agreement), and also granted rights to authors and performers to “fair and proportionate” remuneration, greater transparency and a right to revoke agreements if their work is not adequately exploited. The Online Broadcasting Directive extends the system of mandatory collective exercise of cable retransmission rights to other forms of retransmission including Internet protocol television and mobile, thereby potentially reducing the control that rights owners have over online distribution. EU states have until June 2021 to transpose these Directives into national law, if similar provisions do not already exist.

In 2020, the EU will evaluate the impact of the 2018 EC Geo-blocking Regulation that prohibits unjustified geo-blocking and other forms of discrimination based on customers’ nationality, place of residence or place of establishment. As part of its evaluation, it will consider whether the scope of the regulation should be extended to services that offer audio-visual and other copyrighted content, which may impact content owners’ ability to distribute on an exclusive, territorial basis within the EU.

Restrictions on Content Distribution.

In addition to the EU, numerous countries around the world impose restrictions on the amount and nature of content that may be distributed in that country. Such regulations in China have the greatest impact, as only 34 foreign films, as selected by relevant authorities in China, may be distributed annually on a revenue share basis based on box office performance. In addition, in September 2018, China’s film and television regulator, the National Administration of TV and Radio, published proposed regulations that would severely limit the streaming and broadcasting of foreign film and television content in China, further reducing foreign access to the Chinese market.

UK Regulations Affecting Channel 5 Business.

As a PSB in the UK, Channel 5 is subject to certain UK Office of Communications (“OFCOM”) broadcasting regulations that impose detailed obligations, including mandating the proportion of total programming and programming during peak hours that must be original productions, the hours devoted to news and current affairs and the proportion of commissioned programming that must be made by independent producers. Channel 5 has also undertaken to air a certain amount of UK-originated children’s programming. Like all UK broadcasters, Channel 5 must abide by the OFCOM Broadcasting Code, which contains content and scheduling regulations relating to harm and offense, protection of individuals under the age of 18, privacy, fairness and product placement, and by OFCOM’s Code on the Scheduling of Television Advertising, which contains regulations on the amount and scheduling of advertising.

Protecting our Content from Copyright Theft

The unauthorized reproduction, distribution, exhibition or other exploitation of copyrighted material interferes with the market for copyrighted works and disrupts our ability to distribute and monetize our content. The theft of films, television, books and other entertainment content presents a significant challenge to our industry, and we take a number of steps to address this concern. Where possible, we use technological protection tools, such as encryption, to protect our content. We are actively engaged in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property, including: monitoring online destinations that distribute or otherwise infringe our content and sending takedown or cease and desist notices in appropriate circumstances; using filtering technologies employed by some user-generated content sites; and pursuing litigation and referrals to law enforcement with respect to websites and other online platforms that distribute or facilitate the distribution and exploitation of our content without authorization. Through

I-


partnerships with various organizations, we also are actively involved in educational outreach to the creative community, state and federal government officials and other stakeholders in an effort to marshal greater resources to combat copyright theft. Additionally, we participate in various industry-wide enforcement initiatives, public relations programs and legislative activities on a worldwide basis. We have had notable success with site-blocking efforts in parts of Europe and Asia, which can be effective in diverting consumers from piracy platforms to legitimate platforms.

Notwithstanding these efforts and the many legal protections that exist to combat piracy, the proliferation of content theft and technological tools with which to carry it out continue to be a challenge. The failure to maintain enhanced legal protections and enforcement tools and to update those tools as threats evolve could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could negatively impact its value and further increase the costs of enforcing our rights as we continue to expend substantial resources to protect our content.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

We create, own and distribute intellectual property worldwide. It is our practice to protect our films, programs, content, brands, formats, characters, games, publications and other original and acquired works, and ancillary goods and services.

I-


Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

A wide range of risks may affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, now and in the future.  We consider the risks described below to be the most significant. There may be other currently unknown or unpredictable factors that could have adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Risks Relating to ViacomCBS’ Business and Industry

Changes in consumer behavior, as well as evolving technologies, distribution platforms and packaging, may negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations

The ways in which consumers view content, and technology and business models in our industry continue to evolve rapidly, and new distribution platforms, as well as increased competition from new entrants and emerging technologies, have added to the complexity of maintaining predictable revenue streams.

Technological advancements have driven changes in consumer behavior and empowered consumers to seek more control over when, where and how they consume content and have affected the options available to advertisers for reaching their target audiences. The evolution of consumer preferences towards digital services and other subscription services, and the substantial increase in availability of programming without advertising or adequate methodologies for audience measurement, may continue to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Examples of the foregoing include the convergence of television telecasts and digital delivery of programming to televisions and other devices, video-on-demand platforms, tablets, new video and electronic book formats, user-generated content sites, unauthorized digital distribution of video content including via streaming and downloading, simultaneous live streaming of telecast content which allows users to consume content on demand and in remote locations while avoiding traditional commercial advertisements or subscription payments and “cloud-based” DVR storage.

In addition, consumers are increasingly using time-shifting and advertising-blocking technologies that enable users to fast-forward or circumvent advertisements, such as DVRs, or increase the sharing of subscription content and reduce the demand for electronic sell-through, DVD and Blu-ray disc products. Substantial use of these technologies could impact the attractiveness of our programming to advertisers, adversely affecting our advertising revenue. Our business also may be adversely affected by the use of antennas (and their integration with set-top boxes or other consumer devices) to access broadcast signals to avoid subscriptions and live and stored video streaming boxes and services, which deliver unauthorized copies of copyrighted content, including those emanating from other countries in various languages.

In response to perceived consumer demand, distributors of programming and program services are continuing to develop alternative offerings for consumers, including “skinny bundles,” smaller, often customizable programming packages delivered at lower costs than traditional offerings; SVOD and other subscription services; ad-supported FVOD services developed by television manufacturers, cable providers and others; and original programming hosted on mobile and social media platforms. Also, the impact of technological changes on MVPDs may adversely affect our cable networks’ ability to grow revenue. If these alternative offerings continue to gain traction and our networks and brands are not included in those packages and services, or if consumers increasingly favor alternative offerings over traditional broadcast television and cable subscriptions, we may continue to experience a decline in viewership and ultimately demand for our programming, which could lead to lower revenues. These changing distribution models may also impact our ability to negotiate carriage deals on terms favorable to us, thereby having an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

In order to respond to these developments, we regularly consider and from time to time implement changes to our business models and strategies to remain competitive, and there can be no assurance that we will successfully anticipate or respond to these developments, that we will not experience disruption as we respond to such developments, or that the business models we develop will be as profitable as our current business models.

I-


Our advertising revenues have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by changes in consumers’ content viewership, deficiencies in audience measurement and advertising market conditions

We derive substantial revenues from the sale of advertising on a variety of platforms, and a decline in advertising revenues could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in any given period.

Consumers are increasingly turning to online sources for viewing and purchasing content, and an increasing number of companies offer SVOD services, including some that offer exclusive high-quality original video programming delivered directly to consumers over the Internet. Consumers are also using new technologies that allow customers to live stream and time shift programming, make and store digital copies and skip or fast-forward through advertisements. The increasing number of entertainment choices available to consumers has intensified audience fragmentation and reduced the viewing of content through traditional MVPDs and virtual MVPDs, which has caused, and likely will continue to cause, audience ratings declines for our cable networks and may adversely affect the pricing and volume of advertising. In addition, the pricing and volume of advertising may be affected by shifts in spending toward digital and mobile offerings, which can deliver targeted advertising promptly, from more traditional media, or toward newer ways of purchasing advertising, such as through automated purchasing, dynamic advertising insertion, third parties selling local advertising spots and advertising exchanges, some or all of which may not be as beneficial to us as traditional advertising methods.

In addition, advertising sales are largely dependent on audience measurement, and the results of audience measurement techniques can vary for a variety of reasons, including the platforms on which viewing is measured and variations in the statistical sampling methods used. The use of evolving ratings technologies and measurements, and viewership on platforms or devices, such as tablets, smart phones and other mobile devices, that are not being fully measured, could have an impact on our program ratings and advertising revenues. Also, consumer viewership of streaming services continues to grow and is under measured. Low ratings can lead to lower pricing and advertising spending. While Nielsen’s statistical sampling method is the primary measurement technique used in our television advertising sales, we measure and monetize our campaign reach and frequency on and across digital platforms based on other third-party data as well as first-party data using a variety of methods, including the number of impressions served and demographics. In addition, multi-platform campaign verification remains in its infancy, and viewership on tablets, smartphones and other mobile devices, which continues to grow rapidly, still is not measured by any one consistently applied method. These variations and changes could have a significant effect on our advertising revenues.  There can be no assurance that any replacement programming on our television stations will generate the same level of revenues or profitability as previous programming.

The strength of the advertising market can fluctuate in response to the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries, advertisers’ current spending priorities and the economy in general or the economy of any individual geographic market, particularly a major market, such as Los Angeles or New York, in which we own and operate sizeable businesses, and this may adversely affect our advertising revenues. Natural and other disasters, acts of terrorism, political uncertainty or hostilities could lead to a reduction in domestic and international advertising expenditures as a result of disrupted programming and services, uninterrupted news coverage and economic uncertainty. In addition, advertising expenditures by companies in certain sectors of the economy, including the financial, pharmaceutical and automotive segments, represent a significant portion of our advertising revenues. Any political, economic, social or technological change resulting in a reduction in these sectors’ advertising expenditures may adversely affect our revenue. Our ability to generate advertising revenue is also dependent on demand for our content, the consumers in our targeted demographics, advertising rates and results observed by advertisers. These factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Our success depends on our ability to maintain attractive brands and

our reputation, and to offer popular programming and other content

Our ability to maintain attractive brands and our reputation, and to create popular programming and other content, tentpole and other live events and consumer products are key to the success of our business and our ability to generate revenues. The production and distribution of television and other programming, films and other entertainment content

I-


and the licensing of rights to the associated intellectual property is inherently risky because the revenues we derive from various sources primarily depend on our ability to satisfy consumer tastes and expectations in a consistent manner. The popularity of our content is affected by our ability to maintain or develop our strong brand awareness and reputation and to target key audiences, and by the quality and attractiveness of competing entertainment content and the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, including online, mobile and other offerings. Audience tastes change frequently and it is a challenge to anticipate what offerings will be successful at any point in time. We invest substantial capital in creating and promoting our content, including in the production of original content on our networks, in our films, in our television production business and in our publications, before learning the extent to which it will garner critical success and popularity with consumers.

In our

Cable Networks

and

TV Entertainment

businesses, the popularity of our brands and programming has a significant impact on the revenues we are able to generate from advertising, affiliate fees, content licensing, consumer products and other licensing activities, and our ability to expand our presence internationally depends, in part, on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences outside the U.S. In addition, the success of our

Publishing

business is similarly dependent on audience acceptance of its publications.  In our

Filmed Entertainment

business, the theatrical performance of a film affects not only the theatrical revenues we receive but also revenues from other distribution outlets, such as TVOD and SVOD, television, home entertainment and licensed consumer products. Additionally, a shortfall, now or in the future, in the expected popularity of our programming that we expect to distribute or the sports events for which we have acquired rights, could lead to decreased profitability or losses for a significant period of time. Significant negative claims or publicity regarding the Company or its operations, products, management, employees, practices, business partners and culture may damage our brands or reputation, even if such claims are untrue.  A lack of popularity of our offerings or damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in a particular period or over a longer term.

Increased costs for programming, films and other rights, and judgments we make on the potential performance of our content, may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations

In our

TV Entertainment

and

Cable Networks

segments, we produce a significant amount of original programming and other content and we invest significant resources in our brands, in part with the aim of developing higher quality and quantity of original content, and we also derive a portion of our revenue from the exploitation of our extensive library of television programming. In our

Filmed Entertainment

segment, we invest significant amounts in the production, marketing and distribution of films and television series. We also acquire programming, films and television series, as well as a variety of digital content and other ancillary rights such as consumer and home entertainment product offerings, and we pay license fees, royalties and/or contingent compensation in connection with these acquired rights. For example, some of CBS Television Network’s most widely viewed broadcasts, including golf’s Masters Tournament, NFL games and series such as

Young Sheldon

, are made available based upon programming rights of varying duration that we have negotiated with third parties. We also license various music rights from the major record companies, music publishers and performing rights organizations.

Our investments in original and acquired programming are significant and involve complex negotiations with numerous third parties, and rapid changes in consumer behavior have increased the risk associated with the success of all kinds of programming. Competition for popular content is intense, and we may have to increase the price we are willing to pay for talent and intellectual property rights, which may result in significantly increased costs. Further, increased competition in the market for development and production of original programming, such as from Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Hulu, Netflix and YouTube, and streaming services by large entertainment companies, increases our content costs as they introduce different ways of compensating talent and approaching production.  We may be outbid by our competitors for the rights to new, popular programming or in connection with the renewals of popular programming that we currently license. Finally, certain of our counterparties and vendors may encounter financial and operational pressures, which could result in increased costs to us or delays in production. As such, there can be no assurance that we will recoup our investments in programming, films and other content when the content is broadcast or distributed. If our content offerings cease to be widely accepted by audiences or are not continuously replenished with popular content, our revenues could be adversely affected.

I-


The accounting for the expenses we incur in connection with our programming and films requires that we make judgments about their potential success and useful life. We initially estimate the ultimate revenues of a television program or film and then update our estimate of ultimate revenues based on expected future and actual results, including following a television program’s initial broadcast or a film’s initial theatrical release.  If our estimates prove to be incorrect or are reduced, it may result in decreased profitability as a result of the accelerated recognition of the expense and/or write-down of the value of the asset. Similarly, if we determine it is no longer advantageous for us to air a program on our broadcast or cable networks, we would accelerate our amortization of the program costs.

These factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

The loss of key talent could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations

Our business depends upon the continued efforts, abilities and expertise of not only our corporate and divisional executive teams, but also the various creative talent and entertainment personalities with whom we work. For example, we employ or contract with several entertainment personalities with loyal audiences and we produce films with highly regarded directors, producers, writers, actors and other talent. These individuals are important to achieving the success of our programs, films and other content. There can be no assurance that these individuals will remain with us or will retain their current appeal, or that the costs associated with retaining them or new talent will be reasonable. If we fail to retain these individuals on current terms or if our entertainment personalities lose their current appeal or we fail to attract new talent, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our businesses operate in industries that are highly competitive and swiftly consolidating

We depend on the popularity of our content and other offerings, our appeal to advertisers and widespread distribution of our content. We compete with other media companies to attract creative talent and produce high quality content, and for distribution on a variety of third-party platforms to draw large audiences. Competition for talent, content, audiences, service providers, production infrastructure, advertising and distribution is intense and comes from broadcast television stations and networks, cable television systems and networks (including our own), streaming service distributors, the Internet and social media platforms, film studios and independent film producers and distributors, consumer products companies and other entertainment outlets and platforms, as well as from search engines, program guides and “second screen” applications and non-traditional programming services, such as streaming offerings. Additionally, other television stations or cable networks may change their formats or programming, a new station or new network may adopt a format to compete directly with our stations or networks, or stations or networks might engage in aggressive promotional campaigns. Further, competition from additional entrants into the market for development and production of original programming and streaming services, such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Hulu, Netflix and YouTube, and major entertainment companies, continues to increase. In book publishing, competition among electronic and print book retailers could decrease the prices for new releases and the outlets available for book sales. Moreover, the growing use of self-publishing technologies by authors increases competition and could result in decreased use of traditional publishing services.

Our ability to obtain widespread distribution on favorable terms, which contributes to our ability to attract audiences and, in turn, advertisers, is adversely affected by the consolidation of advertising agencies, programmers, content providers, distributors (including telecom companies) and television service providers. This consolidation reduces the number of distributors with whom we negotiate and increases the negotiating leverage and market power of the combined companies. In addition, consolidation in the film business may adversely affect the distribution of our films on various platforms. Consolidation among book retailers and the growth of online sales and electronic books sales have resulted in increased competition for limited physical shelf space for our publications and for the attention of consumers online.

In addition, our competitors generally include market participants with interests in multiple media businesses that are often vertically integrated, whereas our

Cable Networks

business generally relies on distribution relationships with third parties. As more cable and satellite operators, Internet service providers, telecom companies and other content distributors, aggregators and search providers create or acquire their own content, they may have significant

I-


competitive advantages, which could adversely affect our ability to negotiate favorable terms for distribution or otherwise compete effectively in the delivery marketplace. Our competitors could also have preferential access to important technologies, customer data or other competitive information, as well as significant financial resources.

This competition and consolidation could result in lower ratings and advertising, lower affiliate and other revenues, and increased content costs and promotional and other expenses, negatively affecting our ability to generate revenues and profitability. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that competition or consolidation in the marketplace will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Because we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of distributors, the loss of affiliation and distribution agreements, renewal on less favorable terms or adverse interpretations could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations

A significant portion of our revenues, particularly from

Cable Networks

and

TV Entertainment

, are attributable to agreements with MVPDs and virtual MVPDs, and other distributors of our programming and program services.  These agreements generally have fixed terms that vary by market and distributor, and there can be no assurance that these agreements will be renewed in the future, or renewed on favorable terms, including but not limited to those related to pricing and programming tiers.  We may also be unable to modify existing agreements with terms that have over time become less favorable. The loss of existing packaging, positioning, pricing or other marketing opportunities and the loss of carriage on cable and satellite programming tiers or the failure to renew our agreements with any distributor, or renew or modify them on favorable terms, could reduce the distribution of our programming and program services and decrease the potential audience for our programs, thereby negatively affecting our growth prospects and revenues from both affiliate fees and advertising.

The CBS Television Network provides its affiliates with up to approximately 98 hours of regularly scheduled programming per week. In return, the CBS Television Network’s affiliated stations broadcast network-inserted commercials during that programming and pay us station affiliation fees. Loss of station affiliation agreements of the CBS Television Network could adversely affect our results of operations by reducing the reach of our programming and therefore our attractiveness to advertisers, and renewal of these affiliation agreements on less favorable terms may also adversely affect our results of operations.

Consolidation among MVPDs and increased vertical integration of such distributors into the cable or broadcast network business have provided more leverage to these distributors and could adversely affect our ability to maintain or obtain distribution for our network programming or distribution and/or marketing of our subscription program services on favorable or commercially reasonable terms, or at all.  Also, consolidation among television station group owners could increase their negotiating leverage. Moreover, competitive pressures faced by MVPDs, particularly in light of the lower retail prices of streaming services, could adversely affect the terms of our renewals with MVPDs.  In addition, MVPDs and streaming services continue to develop alternative offerings for consumers, including “skinny bundles.” To the extent these packages do not include our programming and become widely accepted in lieu of traditional program packages, we could experience a decline in affiliate revenues.

Similarly, our revenues are dependent on the compliance of major distributors with the terms of our affiliation or distribution agreements. As these agreements have grown in complexity, the number of disputes regarding the interpretation, and even validity, of the agreements has grown, resulting in greater uncertainty and, from time to time, litigation with respect to our rights and obligations. For example, some of our distribution agreements contain “most favored nation” (“MFN”) clauses, which provide that if we enter into an agreement with a distributor and such agreement includes specified terms that are more favorable than those held by a distributor holding an MFN right, we must offer some of those terms to the distributor holding the MFN right. These clauses are generally complex and may lead to disagreement over their interpretation and application. Disagreements with a distributor on the interpretation or validity of an agreement could adversely impact our revenues from both affiliate fees and advertising, as well as our relationship with that distributor.

These factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

I-


The integration of the CBS and Viacom businesses may not be successful or may be more difficult, time consuming or costly than expected

.

Synergies and other benefits may not be realized within the expected time frames, or at all.

Operating costs, customer loss and business disruption may be greater than expected and revenues may be lower than expected following the Merger.  Our ongoing investment in new businesses, products, services and technologies present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals we had contemplated.

Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate the businesses of the combined companies in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and achieves the projected standalone cost savings and revenue growth trends that have been identified without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth. The failure to meet the challenges involved in combining CBS’ and Viacom’s businesses following the Merger and to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger, including expected synergies, could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the activities of ViacomCBS and could adversely affect the results of operations of ViacomCBS. The overall combination of our businesses may also result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, and loss of customer and other business relationships. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others:

•

the diversion of management attention to integration matters;

•

difficulties in integrating operations and systems, including administrative and information technology infrastructure and financial reporting and internal control systems;

•

challenges in conforming standards, controls, procedures and accounting and other policies, business cultures and compensation structures between the two companies;

•

difficulties in integrating employees and attracting and retaining key personnel, including talent;

•

challenges in retaining existing, and obtaining new customers, viewers, suppliers, distributors, licensors, employees and others, including material content providers, studios, producers, directors, actors, authors and other talent, and advertisers;

•

difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities, financing plans and growth prospects from the combination;

•

difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company;

•

challenges in continuing to develop valuable and widely accepted content and technologies;

•

contingent liabilities that are larger than expected; and

•

potential unknown liabilities, adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the Merger.

In addition, even if our operations are integrated successfully, the full benefits of the Merger may not be realized, including, among others, the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are expected. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our businesses. Many of these factors are outside of our control, and any one of them could result in lower revenues, higher costs and diversion of management time and energy, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In the past, we have acquired and invested, and expect to continue to acquire and invest, in new businesses, products, services and technologies as part of our ongoing strategic initiatives. Such acquisitions and strategic initiatives may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including the types described above as well as insufficient revenues from such investments to offset any new liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the new

I-


investments, unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence that could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such investments and incur unanticipated liabilities and a failure to successfully further develop an acquired business or technology. Because new investments are inherently risky, and the anticipated benefits or value of these investments may not materialize, no assurance can be given that such investments and other strategic initiatives will not adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Service disruptions or failures of, or cybersecurity attacks upon, our or our service providers’ networks, information systems and other technologies could result in the disclosure of confidential or valuable business or personal information, disruption of our businesses, damage to our brands and reputation, legal exposure and financial losses

Networks, cloud services, information systems and other technologies, including technology systems used in connection with the production and distribution of our programming, films and other content by us or our third-party providers (“Systems”), are critical to our business activities, and shutdowns or service disruptions of, and cybersecurity attacks on, these Systems pose increasing risks. Such shutdowns, disruptions and attacks may be caused by third-party hacking of computers and Systems; dissemination of computer viruses, worms, malware, ransomware and other destructive or disruptive software; denial of service attacks and other bad acts; human error; and power outages, natural disasters, extreme weather, terrorist attacks or other similar events. Shutdowns, disruptions and attacks could have an adverse impact on us, our business partners, employees, advertisers, viewers and users of our content offerings, including degradation or disruption of service, loss of data and damage to equipment and data. Steps we take to add software and hardware, upgrade our Systems and network infrastructure, and improve the stability and efficiency of our Systems may not be sufficient to avoid shutdowns, disruptions and attacks. Significant events could result in a disruption of our operations and reduction of our revenues, the loss of or damage to the integrity of data used by management to make decisions and operate our businesses, viewer or advertiser dissatisfaction or a loss of viewers or advertisers, and damage to our reputation or brands.

We operate communications and computer hardware Systems located both in our facilities and that of third-party providers. In addition, we use third-party “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations. We also use content delivery networks to help us stream programming, films and other content in high volume to viewers and users of our online, mobile and app offerings over the internet. Problems faced by us, our hosting providers, our third-party “cloud” computing or other network providers, including technological or business-related disruptions, as well as cybersecurity attacks and regulatory interference, could result in a disruption of our operations and reduction of our revenues, adversely impact the experience of our viewers and users, and could damage our reputation and brands.

We are subject to risks caused by the misappropriation, misuse, falsification or intentional or accidental release or loss of business or personal data or programming content maintained in our or our third-party providers’ Systems, including proprietary and personal information (of third parties, employees and users of our online, mobile and app offerings), business information including intellectual property, or other confidential information. Outside parties may attempt to penetrate our Systems or those of our third-party providers or fraudulently induce employees, business partners or users of our online, mobile and app offerings to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to our data or our subscribers’ or users’ data, or our programming. The number and sophistication of attempted and successful information security breaches in the U.S. and elsewhere have increased in recent years, and because of our prominence, we and/or third-party providers we use may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or disable, degrade or sabotage, these Systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, implement adequate security measures or remediate any intrusion on a timely or effective basis. Moreover, the development and maintenance of security measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Despite our efforts, the possibility of these events occurring cannot be eliminated.

If a material breach of our Systems or those of our third-party providers occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, we could lose subscribers, viewers, advertisers and other

I-


business partners, and users of our online, mobile and app offerings; and our reputation, brands and credibility could be damaged; and we could be required to expend significant amounts of money and other resources to repair or replace such Systems or to comply with regulatory requirements. We could also be subject to actions by regulatory authorities and claims asserted in private litigation. The costs relating to any data breach could be material, and we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate us for any losses associated with such events.

Each of these factors could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.

We are subject to complex, often inconsistent and potentially costly laws, rules, regulations, industry standards and contractual obligations relating to privacy and personal data protection

We are subject to laws, rules and regulations in the U.S. and in other countries relating to privacy and the collection, use and security of personal data. In the EU, for example, the GDPR mandates data protection compliance obligations and authorizes significant fines for noncompliance, requiring significant compliance resources and efforts on our part. Further, a number of other regions where we do business have enacted or are considering new data protection regulations that may impact our business activities. In the U.S., the California Consumer Privacy Act, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, creates a host of new obligations for businesses regarding how they handle the personal information of California residents. We are also subject to laws and regulations intended specifically to protect the interests of children and the privacy of minors online, including COPPA in the U.S. and the GDPR in the EU, and we have been required to limit some functionality on our websites and apps as a result of these regulations. Such regulations also restrict the types of advertising we are able to sell on these sites and apps and impose strict liability on us for certain actions of ViacomCBS, advertisers and other third parties, which could affect advertising demand and pricing. We will continue to expend resources to comply with data protection and privacy standards imposed by law, industry standards or contractual obligations, which may be inconsistent with one another, and despite such efforts we may face regulatory and other legal actions. See “Regulation and Protection of our Intellectual Property—Certain Other Regulations Affecting Our Business—Global Data Protection Laws and Children’s Privacy Laws.”

Each of these factors could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.

The failure, destruction and/or breach of satellites and facilities that we depend upon to distribute our programming could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations

We use satellite systems, fiber and other methods to transmit our programs and program services to broadcast television and cable television operators and other distributors worldwide. The distribution facilities include uplinks, communications satellites and downlinks. Notwithstanding certain back-up and redundant systems, transmissions may be disrupted as a result of power outages, natural disasters, extreme weather, terrorist attacks, cyber attacks, failures or impairments of communications satellites or on-ground uplinks or downlinks used to transmit programming or other similar events. Currently, there are a limited number of communications satellites available for the transmission of programming, and if a disruption occurs, we may not be able to secure alternate distribution facilities in a timely manner. There can be no assurance that such failure or disruption would not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Theft of our content, including digital copyright theft and other unauthorized uses of our content, reduces revenue received from legitimate distribution of our programming, films, books and other entertainment content and adversely affects our business, financial condition or results of operations

The success of our businesses depends in part on our ability to maintain and monetize our intellectual property rights. We are fundamentally a content company and theft of our content - specifically, the infringement of our films and home entertainment products, television programming, digital content, books and other intellectual property rights - affects us and the value of our content.  Intellectual property theft is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that either lack effective laws and technical protection measures similar to those existing in the U.S. and Europe or

I-


lack effective enforcement of such measures, or both. Such foreign copyright theft often creates a supply of pirated content for major markets as well. The interpretation of copyright, trademark and other intellectual property laws as applied to our content, and our infringement-detection and enforcement efforts, remain in flux, and some methods of enforcement have encountered political opposition. The failure to appropriately enforce and/or the weakening of existing intellectual property laws could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect our intellectual property and thus negatively affect its value.

Content theft is made easier by the wide availability of higher bandwidth and reduced storage costs, as well as tools that undermine encryption and other security features and enable infringers to cloak their identities online. We and our numerous production and distribution partners operate various technology systems in connection with the production and distribution of our programming and films, and intentional or unintentional acts could result in unauthorized access to our content. The continuing proliferation of digital formats and technologies heightens this risk. The unauthorized distribution and consumption of our content through a wide array of platforms and devices remain problematic and an ever-present challenge, as Internet-connected televisions, set-top boxes and mobile devices are ubiquitous and many can support illegal re-transmission platforms, illicit video-on-demand/streaming services and pre-loaded hardware, providing more accessible, versatile and legitimate-looking environments for consuming pirated film and television content. Unauthorized access to our content could result in the premature release of films, television programs or other content as well as a reduction in legitimate audiences, which would likely have significant adverse effects on the value of the affected content and our ability to monetize our content.

Copyright theft has an adverse effect on our business because it reduces the revenue that we are able to receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of our content, undermines lawful distribution channels, reduces the public’s and some affiliate partners’ perceived value of our content and inhibits our ability to recoup or profit from the costs incurred to create such content. While legal protections exist, piracy and technological tools with which to engage in copyright theft continue to escalate, evolve and present challenges for enforcement. We are actively engaged in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property, and it is likely that we will continue to expend substantial resources in connection with these efforts. Efforts to prevent the unauthorized reproduction, distribution and exhibition of our content may affect our profitability and may not be successful in preventing harm to our business and may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Political and economic conditions in a variety of markets around the world could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations

Our businesses operate and have audiences, customers and partners worldwide, and we are focused on expanding our international operations in key markets, some of which are emerging markets. For that reason, economic conditions in many different markets around the world affect a number of aspects of our businesses, in particular revenues in both domestic and international markets derived from advertising sales, theatrical releases, home entertainment distribution, television licensing and sales of consumer products. Economic conditions in each market can also impact our audience’s discretionary spending and therefore their willingness to access our content, as well as the businesses of our partners who purchase advertising on our networks, causing them to reduce their spending on advertising. We may also be subject to longer payment cycles. In addition, as we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar (compared to, for example, the Argentinian peso, the British pound and the Euro, among others) has increased. Such fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, and there is no assurance that downward trending currencies will rebound or that stable currencies will remain stable in any period.

Our businesses are also exposed to certain political risks inherent in conducting a global business, including retaliatory actions by governments reacting to changes in the U.S. and other countries, including in connection with trade negotiations; issues related to the presence of corruption in certain markets and enforcement of anti-corruption laws and regulations; increased risk of political instability in some markets as well as conflict and sanctions preventing us from accessing those markets; escalating trade, immigration and nuclear disputes; wars, acts of terrorism or other hostilities; and other political, economic or other uncertainties.

I-


The UK left the EU on January 31, 2020. It is now in a ‘transition period’ scheduled to end on December 31, 2020 that allows the negotiation of a future UK-EU trade relationship while remaining part of the EU Single Market. Depending on the ultimate terms of a trade deal, the UK could lose access to the single EU market and to the global trade deals negotiated by the EU on behalf of its members. It is p

ossible that the UK could revert to World Trade Organization terms if no deal is reached.

The effects of Brexit and the on-going trade negotiations may continue to adversely affect business activity, political stability and economic and market conditions in the UK, the Eurozone, the EU and elsewhere and contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the Euro and the British Pound. A new trade deal, or no deal at all, could lead to additional political, legal and economic instability and uncertainty in the EU, including changes in the regulatory environment, which could impact our ability to use UK law under “country of origin” rules for programming in the EU, potential trade barriers between the UK and the EU and between the UK and other countries, and potential content production quota regulations. Given that a portion of our business is conducted in the EU, including the UK, any of these effects of Brexit and a trade deal, and others we cannot anticipate, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

These political and economic risks could create instability in any of the markets where our businesses derive revenues, which could result in a reduction of revenue or loss of investment that adversely affects our businesses, financial condition or results of operations.

Changes in U

.

or foreign laws or regulations may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations

Our program services, filmed entertainment and online, mobile and app properties are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, both in the U.S. and/or in the foreign jurisdictions in which we or our partners operate, including relating to intellectual property, content regulation, user privacy, data protection, anti-corruption, repatriation of profits, tax regimes, quotas, tariffs or other trade barriers, currency exchange controls, operating license and permit requirements, restrictions on foreign ownership or investment, export and market access restrictions, and exceptions and limitations on copyright and censorship, among others.

The television broadcasting and distribution industries in the U.S. are highly regulated by U.S. federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies, including the FCC. For example, we are required to obtain licenses from the FCC to operate our television stations. It cannot be assured that the FCC will approve our future renewal applications or that the renewals will be for full terms or will not include conditions or qualifications.  The non-renewal, or renewal with substantial conditions or modifications, of one or more of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our revenues. We must also comply with extensive FCC regulations and policies in the ownership and operation of our television stations and our television networks, which prohibit common ownership of two or more of the top four television networks and limit the number of television stations that a licensee can own in a market and the number of television stations that can be owned in the U.S., which could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions and in certain circumstances could require us to divest some television stations. Our programming directed towards children is subject to a number of additional regulations. For example, privacy regulations make it difficult to measure online viewership by children. The threat of regulatory action or increased scrutiny that deters certain advertisers from advertising or reaching their intended audiences could adversely affect advertising revenue.

The U.S. Congress and the FCC currently have under consideration, and may in the future adopt, new laws, regulations, and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could, directly or indirectly, affect the operation and ownership of our television properties. For example, from time to time, proposals have been advanced in the U.S. Congress and at the FCC to require television stations to provide advertising time to political candidates for free or at a reduced charge.  Any restrictions on advertising may adversely affect our advertising revenues. Changes to the media ownership and other FCC rules may affect the competitive landscape in ways that could increase the competition faced by us. Proposals have also been advanced from time to time before the U.S. Congress and the FCC to extend the program access rules (currently applicable only to those cable program services which also own or are owned in whole or in part by cable distribution or telephone company systems) to all cable program services.  Our ability to

I-


obtain the most favorable terms available for our content could be adversely affected should such an extension be enacted into law. It is difficult to predict the likelihood or impact of any proposed actions by the U.S. Congress or the FCC on our television properties.

Laws in some non-U.S. jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the U.S., and the enforcement of such laws can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which could impact our ability to expand our operations and undertake activities that we believe are beneficial to our business.  In addition, changes in or new interpretations of international laws and regulations governing the broadcast and distribution of content, competition and the Internet, including those affecting data privacy, as well as the new EU law requiring 30% local content on SVOD services and proposed amendments to the law governing territorial exclusivity of the distribution of content in Europe, may have an adverse impact on our international businesses and digital properties.

Our businesses are also subject to laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally governing the collection, use, sharing, protection and retention of personal data, which has implications for how such data is managed. For example, GDPR expands the regulation of personal data processing throughout the EU and significantly increases penalties for non-compliance. Complying with these laws and regulations could be costly, require us to change our business practices, or limit or restrict aspects of our business in a manner adverse to our business operations. Many of these laws and regulations continue to evolve, and substantial uncertainty surrounds their scope and application.  Our failure to comply could result in exposure to enforcement by U.S. or foreign governments, as well as significant negative publicity and reputational damage.

Our businesses could be adversely affected by new laws and regulations, changes in existing laws, changes in interpretations of existing laws by courts and regulators and the threat that additional laws or regulations may be forthcoming, as well as our ability to enforce our legal rights. We could be required to change or limit certain of our business practices, which could impact our ability to generate revenues. We could also incur substantial costs to comply with new and existing laws and regulations, or substantial fines and penalties or other liabilities if we fail to comply with such laws and regulations.

Vigorous enforcement or modification of FCC indecency and other program content rules against the broadcast and cable industries could have an adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations

The FCC’s rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent or profane material on television stations between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. Broadcasters risk violating the prohibition against broadcasting indecent material because of the vagueness of the FCC’s indecency/profanity definition, coupled with the spontaneity of live programming. The FCC enforces its indecency rules against the broadcasting industry. The FCC has found on a number of occasions that the content of television broadcasts has contained indecent material.  In such instances, the FCC issued fines or advisory warnings to the offending licensees. Moreover, the FCC has in some instances imposed separate fines for each allegedly indecent “utterance,” in contrast with its previous policy, which generally considered all indecent words or phrases within a given program as constituting a single violation.  Broadcasting indecent material could result in fines per station of a maximum of approximately $415,000 per utterance and/or the loss of a station’s FCC license. If the FCC denied a license renewal or revoked the license for one of our television stations, we would lose our authority to operate the station. The determination of whether content is indecent is inherently subjective and, as such, it can be difficult to predict whether particular content could violate indecency standards. The difficulty in predicting whether individual programs, words or phrases may violate the FCC’s indecency rules adds significant uncertainty to our ability to comply with the rules. Violation of indecency rules could lead to sanctions which may adversely affect our businesses and results of operations. Some policymakers support the extension of the indecency rules that are applicable to over-the-air broadcasters to cover cable and satellite programming and/or attempts to increase enforcement of or otherwise expand existing laws and rules. If such an extension, attempt to increase enforcement or other expansion took place and were found to be constitutional, some of our cable content could be subject to additional regulation and might not be able to attract the same subscription and viewership levels.

I-


We could be subject to material liabilities as a result of adoption of or changes in tax laws, regulations and administrative practices, interpretations and policies

We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous international jurisdictions. Our tax rates are impacted by the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices, interpretations and policies in the federal, state and local and international territories where our businesses operate, and these rates may be subject to significant change. Our tax returns are routinely audited and litigation, adverse outcomes, or settlements may occur because tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, including our methodologies for intercompany arrangements. Additionally, shifting economic and political conditions may result in significant changes to tax policies, laws or tax rates in various jurisdictions. Such changes, litigation, adverse outcomes, or audit settlements may result in the recognition of additional charges to our income tax provision in any given period and may adversely affect our effective income tax rate or cash payments and may therefore adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Volatility and weakness in capital markets may adversely affect our credit availability and related financing costs

Bank and capital markets can experience periods of volatility and disruption. If the disruption in these markets is prolonged, our ability to refinance, and the related cost of refinancing, some or all of our debt could be adversely affected. Although we can currently access the bank and capital markets, there is no assurance that such markets will continue to be a reliable source of financing for us. In addition, our access to and cost of borrowing can be affected by our short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by ratings agencies. In addition, the interest rates included in certain agreements that govern certain of our debt securities and/or credit facilities may be based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). In the future, use of LIBOR may be discontinued and we cannot be certain how long LIBOR will continue to be a viable benchmark interest rate. Use of alternative interest rates could result in increased borrowing costs or volatility in the markets and interest rates. These factors, including the tightening of credit markets, or a decrease in our debt ratings, could adversely affect our ability to obtain cost-effective financing.

We could be adversely affected by strikes and other union activity

We and our business partners engage the services of writers, directors, actors, musicians and other talent, production crew members, trade employees, players in sports leagues and others who are subject to industry-wide or specially-negotiated collective bargaining agreements, and occasionally individual agreements. The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) is a multi-employer trade association that, along with and on behalf of hundreds of member companies including Paramount Pictures and CBS Studios, negotiates the industry-wide collective bargaining agreements with these parties, and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements. The Writers Guild of America contract expires on May 1, 2020, and the Directors Guild of America and Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists contracts expire on June 30, 2020.  The AMPTP expects to negotiate successor deals with these guilds and unions in the coming months. Any labor disputes that arise may disrupt our operations and cause delays in the production of our programming, and we may not be able to negotiate favorable terms for a renewal, which could increase our costs. Depending on its duration, any lockout, labor dispute, strike or work stoppage could have an adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows and/or operating income and/or their timing.

Our revenues, expenses and operating results may vary based on the timing, mix, number and availability of our films and other programming and on seasonal factors

Our revenues, expenses and operating results fluctuate due to the timing, mix, number and/or availability of our theatrical films, home entertainment releases and programs for licensing. For example, our operating results may increase or decrease during a particular period relative to the corresponding period in the prior year due to differences in the number and/or mix of films released, the commencement of a license period or the timing of delivery of programming to licensees for exhibition. Our operating results also fluctuate due to the timing of the recognition of marketing expenses, which are generally incurred before and throughout the theatrical release of a film, with the recognition of related revenues through the film’s theatrical exhibition and subsequent distribution windows.

I-


Our business also has experienced and is expected to continue to experience seasonality due to, among other things, seasonal advertising patterns and seasonal influences on audiences’ viewing, reading and attendance habits.  Typically, our revenue from advertising is highest in the first and fourth quarters. In the

Cable Networks

segment, advertising is typically highest in the fourth quarter due to the holiday season, among other factors. In the

TV Entertainment

segment, advertising revenues benefit principally in the first quarter of the years in which we telecast the Super Bowl a

nd NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Tournament National Semifinals and Championship and in the fourth quarter due to the holiday season and, in even-numbered years, advertising placed by candidates for political offices.

Revenues from the

Filmed Entertainment

segment’s theatrical film releases tend to be cyclical with increases during the summer. The

Publishing

segment is subject to increased periods of demand during the summer and year-end holiday season. The effects of these variances make it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the previous results of any specific quarter.

We could suffer losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, FCC licenses and programming

We test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including FCC licenses, for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events or circumstances require an interim impairment assessment. Certain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital, a decline in advertising markets, a decrease in audience acceptance of our programming or films, a shift by advertisers to competing advertising platforms and/or changes in consumer behavior could result in a downward revision in the estimated fair value of a reporting unit or intangible assets, including FCC licenses, which could result in a non-cash impairment charge. Any such impairment charge for goodwill, intangible assets and/or programming could have a material adverse effect on our reported net earnings.

Our liabilities related to discontinued operations and former businesses could adversely impact our financial conditions

We have both recognized and potential liabilities and costs related to discontinued operations and former businesses, certain of which are unrelated to the media business, including leases, guarantees, environmental liabilities, liabilities related to the pensions and medical expenses of retirees, asbestos liabilities, contractual disputes and other pending and threatened litigation. We cannot be assured that our accruals for these matters are sufficient to cover these liabilities in their entirety or any one of these liabilities when it becomes due or at what point any of these liabilities may come due. Therefore, there can be no assurances that these liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating performance or cash flow.

Risks Relating to NAI’s Voting Control of ViacomCBS and Pledged Shares

NAI, through its voting control of ViacomCBS, will be in a position to control actions that require stockholder approval

NAI, through its direct and indirect ownership of our Class A Common Stock, has voting control of ViacomCBS.  At December 31, 2019, NAI directly or indirectly owned approximately 79.4% of the shares of our Class A Common Stock outstanding, and approximately 10.2% of the shares of our Class A Common Stock and our Class B Common Stock outstanding on a combined basis. Sumner M. Redstone is the beneficial owner of the controlling interest in NAI and, accordingly, beneficially owns all such shares. Mr. Redstone is the controlling stockholder, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of NAI.  Shari E. Redstone, the President and a director of NAI, serves as non-executive Chair of the ViacomCBS Board of Directors (the “ViacomCBS Board”). NAI is controlled by Mr. Redstone through the Sumner M. Redstone National Amusements Trust (the “SMR Trust”), which owns 80% of the voting interest of NAI, and such voting interest of NAI held by the SMR Trust is voted solely by Mr. Redstone until his incapacity or death. The SMR Trust provides that in the event of Mr. Redstone’s death or incapacity, voting control of the NAI voting interest held by the SMR Trust will pass to seven trustees, who will include Ms. Redstone. No member of our management is a trustee of the SMR Trust.

I-


Subject to the terms of the Governance Agreement dated as of August 13, 2019, which is incorporated by reference as an exhibit in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, NAI is in a position to control the outcome of corporate actions that require, or may be accomplished by, stockholder approval, including amending ViacomCBS’ bylaws, the election or removal of directors and transactions involving a change of control. For example, the ViacomCBS bylaws provide that:

•

the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the aggregate voting power of all outstanding shares of our capital stock then entitled to vote generally in an election of directors, voting together as a single class, is required for our stockholders to amend, alter, change, repeal or adopt any of our bylaws;

•

any or all of our directors may be removed from office at any time prior to the expiration of his or her term of office, with or without cause, only by the affirmative vote of the holders of record of outstanding shares representing at least a majority of all the aggregate voting power of outstanding shares of our Common Stock then entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class at a special meeting of our stockholders called expressly for that purpose; provided that during the two-year period following the closing date of the ViacomCBS Merger, the removal of our Chief Executive Officer requires the approval of the ViacomCBS Board by the “Requisite Approval” (as defined in the ViacomCBS certificate of incorporation incorporated by reference as an exhibit in this Annual Report on Form 10-K); provided further, that during the two-year period following the closing date, NAI and NAI Entertainment Holdings LLC are not permitted to remove any other persons who were members of the ViacomCBS Board at the effective time of the Merger in accordance with the Merger Agreement or who otherwise become members the ViacomCBS Board (other than any of the NAI Affiliated Directors (as defined in the bylaws)) without the Requisite Approval; and

•

in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, our stockholders may act by written consent without a meeting if such stockholders hold the number of shares representing not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such actions at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.

Accordingly, ViacomCBS stockholders who may have different interests are unable to affect the outcome of any such corporate actions for so long as NAI retains voting control. For more information, see the Governance Agreement incorporated by reference as an exhibit in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Sales of NAI’s shares of ViacomCBS Common Stock, some of which are pledged to lenders, could adversely affect the stock price

At December 31, 2019, NAI directly or indirectly owned approximately 79.4% of the shares of our Class A Common Stock outstanding, and approximately 10.2% of the shares of our Class A Common Stock and our Class B Common Stock outstanding on a combined basis. Based on information received from NAI, NAI has pledged to its lenders a portion of shares of our Class A Common Stock and our Class B Common Stock owned directly or indirectly by NAI.

At December 31, 2019, the aggregate number of shares of our Common Stock pledged by NAI to its lenders represented approximately 4.1% of the total outstanding shares of our Class A Common Stock and our Class B Common Stock, on a combined basis. At December 31, 2019, the amount of our Class A Common Stock that NAI directly or indirectly owned and that was not pledged by NAI to its lenders represented approximately 64.0% of the total outstanding shares of our Class A Common Stock.

If there is a default on NAI’s debt obligations and the lenders foreclose on the pledged shares, the lenders may not effect a transfer, sale or disposition of any pledged shares of our Class A Common Stock, unless NAI and its affiliates beneficially own 50% or less of our Class A Common Stock then outstanding or such shares have first been converted into our Class B Common Stock. A sale of the pledged shares could adversely affect our Common Stock share price.  In addition, there can be no assurance that at some future time NAI will not sell or pledge additional shares of our Common Stock, which could adversely affect our Common Stock share price.

Overview

ViacomCBS is a leading global media and entertainment company that creates content and experiences for audiences worldwide.

Merger with Viacom Inc.

On December 4, 2019, Viacom Inc. (“Viacom”) merged with and into CBS Corporation (“CBS”), with CBS continuing as the surviving company (the “Merger”). At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), the combined company changed its name to ViacomCBS Inc. (“ViacomCBS”).

At the Effective Time, (1) each share of Viacom Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than shares held directly by Viacom as treasury shares or held by CBS, was converted automatically into

0.59625

shares of ViacomCBS Class A Common Stock, and (2) each share of Viacom Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than shares held directly by Viacom as treasury shares or held by CBS, was converted automatically into

0.59625

shares of ViacomCBS Class B Common Stock (together with ViacomCBS Class A Common Stock, the “ViacomCBS Common Stock”). At the Effective Time, each share of CBS Class A Common Stock and each share of CBS Class B Common Stock (together with CBS Class A Common Stock, the “CBS Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, remained an issued and outstanding share of ViacomCBS Class A Common Stock and ViacomCBS Class B Common Stock, respectively, and was not affected by the Merger.

Following the Merger, the CBS Common Stock was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and the Viacom Common Stock ceased trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”). On December 5, 2019, ViacomCBS

II-

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Class A Common Stock and ViacomCBS Class B Common Stock were listed on Nasdaq and began trading under the ticker symbols VIACA and VIAC, respectively.

The Merger is being accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control as National Amusements, Inc. (“NAI”) was the controlling stockholder of each of CBS and Viacom (and remains the controlling stockholder of ViacomCBS). The net assets of Viacom have been combined with those of CBS at their historical carrying amounts and the companies have been presented on a combined basis for all periods presented.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures

Results for the years ended

December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017

included certain items identified as affecting comparability. Adjusted OIBDA, adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, adjusted provision for income taxes, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to ViacomCBS and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations (together, the “adjusted measures”) exclude the impact of these items and are measures of performance not calculated in accordance with GAAP. We use these measures to, among other things, evaluate our operating performance. These measures are among the primary measures used by management for planning and forecasting of future periods, and they are important indicators of our operational strength and business performance. In addition, we use Adjusted OIBDA to, among other things, value prospective acquisitions. We believe these measures are relevant and useful for investors because they allow investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by our management; provide a clearer perspective on our underlying performance; and make it easier for investors, analysts and peers to compare our operating performance to other companies in our industry and to compare our year-over-year results.

Because the adjusted measures are measures of performance not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, operating income, earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, benefit (provision) for income taxes, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to ViacomCBS or diluted EPS from continuing operations, as applicable, as indicators of operating performance. These measures, as we calculate them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

Consolidated Results of Operations—


vs.


Revenues

Advertising

Advertising revenues are generated primarily from the sale of advertising spots on the CBS Television Network, our basic cable networks and our television stations, as well as on our ad-supported streaming services, including CBS All Access and Pluto TV, and on our websites. Our advertising revenues include integrated marketing services, which provide unique branded content and custom sponsorship opportunities to our advertisers, as well as advanced marketing solutions (“AMS”), including addressable video and brand solutions. For


, the

2%

increase

in advertising revenues was driven by 5% growth in domestic advertising revenues, reflecting CBS’ broadcast of tent-pole sporting events in 2019, mainly

Super Bowl LIII

and the national semifinals and championship game of the

NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Tournament

(“NCAA Tournament”), as well as higher revenues from AMS, which includes Pluto TV. These increases were partially offset by lower political advertising sales at our owned television stations, as a result of the benefit to last year from the 2018 midterm elections. International advertising revenues decreased

14%

, reflecting the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes, as well as softness in the Australian and UK markets, partially offset by increases in pricing and political advertising in Argentina. Foreign exchange rate changes had an unfavorable impact of 1-percentage point on the total advertising revenues comparison and 9-percentage points on the international advertising revenues comparison.

The Super Bowl is broadcast on the CBS Television Network on a rotating basis with other networks through the 2022 season under the current contract with the National Football League (“NFL”), and the national semifinals and championship games of the NCAA Tournament are broadcast on the CBS Television Network every other year through 2032 under the current agreement with the NCAA and Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. (“Turner”). In


, the advertising revenue comparison will be negatively affected by the benefit in


from CBS’ broadcasts of the Super Bowl and the national semifinals and championship game of the NCAA Tournament. These events will not be broadcast by CBS in 2020. Advertising revenues in


will benefit from higher political advertising sales, mainly in the second half of the year, associated with the U.S. Presidential election.

Affiliate

Affiliate revenues are principally comprised of fees received from multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”) and virtual MVPDs for carriage of our cable networks (“cable affiliate fees”), fees received from television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network (“station affiliation fees”); fees for authorizing the MVPDs’ and virtual MVPDs’ carriage of our owned television stations (“retransmission fees”); and subscription fees for our streaming services. For


, the

3%

increase

in affiliate revenues reflects

20%

growth in station affiliation fees and retransmission fees, driven by annual contractual increases and contract renewals with MVPDs and virtual MVPDs, as well as

45%

growth from our streaming services, including CBS All Access

and Showtime OTT, driven by subscriber growth. These increases were partially offset by

5%

lower cable affiliate fees, mainly resulting from subscriber declines. Domestic affiliate revenues increased

4%

, while international affiliate revenues decreased

6%

from the prior

II-


Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

year driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes. Foreign exchange rate changes had an unfavorable impact of 1-percentage point on the total affiliate revenues comparison and 6-percentage points on the international affiliate revenues comparison.

Content Licensing

Content licensing revenues are principally comprised of fees from the licensing of exhibition rights for our internally-produced television and film programming to television stations, cable networks, and subscription video-on-demand (“SVOD”) and free video-on-demand services; home entertainment revenues, which are derived from the sale and distribution of our content through DVDs and Blu-ray discs to wholesale and retail partners, as well as from the viewing of our content on a transactional basis through transactional video-on-demand (“TVOD”) and electronic sell-through services; fees from the use of our trademarks and brands for consumer products, recreation and live events; and fees from the distribution of third-party programming. For


, content licensing revenues increased

5%

, primarily reflecting higher revenues from the domestic licensing of our content, driven by the production of programming for third parties and the licensing of programming to SVOD providers. These increases were partially offset by a decline in international licensing revenues.

Revenues from the licensing of exhibition rights are recognized at the beginning of the license period in which programs are made available to the licensee for exhibition, and therefore, content licensing revenue comparisons are impacted by fluctuations resulting from the timing of the availability of our programming for multiyear licensing agreements.

Theatrical

Theatrical revenues are principally comprised of the worldwide theatrical distribution of films through audience ticket sales. For


, theatrical revenues decreased

26%

, principally reflecting a difficult comparison against the prior year, as a result of the 2018 releases of

Mission: Impossible - Fallout

and

A Quiet Place

. Theatrical revenues in 2019 benefited from the releases of

Rocketman

,

Gemini Man

and

Dora and the Lost City of Gold

, as well as the continued success of the 2018 release,

Bumblebee

. Domestic theatrical revenues decreased

31%

and international theatrical revenues decreased

23%

.

Theatrical revenues may be affected by many factors, including domestic and international audience response, the number, timing and mix of releases and competitive offerings in any given period, consumer tastes and consumption habits and overall economic conditions, including discretionary spending. Revenues from theatrical film releases tend to be cyclical with increases during the summer.

Publishing

Publishing revenues are principally comprised of the domestic and international publishing and distribution of consumer books in printed, digital and audio formats. For


, publishing revenues decreased

1%

,

driven by lower print book sales, which were partially offset by higher sales from digital audio books.

Other

Other revenues are principally comprised of revenues from the rental of production facilities and digital revenues from search and e-commerce partners. For


, other revenues decreased

3%

, mainly reflecting lower revenues from the rental of our production facilities as a result of the sale of CBS Television City in January 2019.

Operating Expenses

n/m - not meaningful

Production

Production expenses reflect the amortization of direct costs of internally-produced television and theatrical film content as well as other television production costs, including on-air talent. For


, the

5%

increase

in production expenses reflected an increased investment in content, including a higher number of series produced for distribution on multiple platforms, including our streaming services and cable networks, as well as higher amortization of television production costs associated with the increase in content licensing revenues. These increases were partially offset by lower amortization of feature film costs, driven by costs in 2018 associated with

Mission: Impossible - Fallout

.

Programming

Programming expenses reflect the amortization of acquired programs exhibited on our television broadcast networks, cable networks and television stations. For


, the

8%

increase

in programming expenses was driven by higher sports programming costs, mainly from CBS’ broadcasts of

Super Bowl LIII

and the national semifinals and championship game of the NCAA Tournament in 2019, which were not broadcast by CBS in 2018, and programming for Pluto TV, which we acquired in March 2019. These increases were partially offset by lower amortization of acquired programming for our cable networks.

Participation, Distribution and Royalty

Participation, distribution and royalty costs primarily include participation and residual expenses for television and film programming, royalty costs for publishing content and other distribution expenses incurred with respect to film and television content, such as print and advertising. For


, the

2%

increase

in participation, distribution and royalty costs was driven by higher participation costs associated with the increase in content licensing revenues.

Programming Charges

During


, in connection with the Merger, we implemented management changes across the organization. In connection with these changes, we performed an evaluation of our programming portfolio across all of our businesses, including an assessment of the optimal use of our programming in the marketplace, which resulted in the identification of programs not aligned with management’s strategy. As a result, we recorded programming charges of

$589 million

principally reflecting accelerated amortization associated with changes in the expected monetization of certain programs, and decisions to cease airing, alter future airing patterns or not renew certain programs.

In addition, during


, in connection with management changes, we recorded programming charges of

$162 million

relating to changes to our programming strategy, including at CBS Films, which shifted its focus from theatrical films to developing content for our streaming services, as well as at our

Cable Networks

segment where we ceased the use of certain programming.

II-

Other

Other operating expenses primarily include compensation and costs associated with book sales, including printing and warehousing. For


, the

8%

increase

in other operating expenses mainly reflected higher costs associated with growth and expansion of our streaming services.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses include expenses incurred for selling and marketing costs, occupancy, professional service fees and back office support, including employee compensation. The

8%

increase

in SG&A expenses was driven by higher advertising and marketing costs, reflecting an increase in the number of series premieres and costs associated with our streaming services, as well as the inclusion of Pluto TV and Pop TV since their acquisitions in the first quarter of 2019. These increases were partially offset by cost savings associated with restructuring activities and compensation cost savings resulting from changes in senior management at CBS in 2018.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expense reflects depreciation of fixed assets, including amortization of transponders and equipment under finance leases, and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. For


, depreciation and amortization expense also includes an impairment charge of

$20 million

to reduce the carrying value of broadcast licenses in Australia to their fair value.

Restructuring and Other Corporate Matters

During

2019 and 2018

, we recorded costs for restructuring and other corporate matters as follows:

During the year ended

December 31, 2019

, we recorded restructuring charges of

$424 million

, primarily for severance and the acceleration of stock-based compensation in connection with the Merger, as well as costs related to a restructuring plan initiated in the first quarter of 2019 under which severance payments are being provided to certain eligible employees who voluntarily elected to participate. In addition, in


we incurred costs of

$294 million

in connection with the Merger, consisting of financial advisory, legal and other professional fees, transaction-related bonuses, and contractual executive compensation, including the accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation, that was triggered by the Merger. We also incurred costs of

$40 million

in connection with the settlement of a commercial dispute and

$17 million

associated with legal proceedings involving the Company (see Note


) and other corporate matters.

II-

we recorded expenses of

$128 million

primarily for professional fees related to legal proceedings, investigations at our Company and the evaluation of potential merger activity.

Gain on Sale of Assets

In


, we completed the sale of CBS Television City for

$750 million

. We have guaranteed a specified level of cash flows to be generated by the business during the first five years following the completion of the sale. Included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at

December 31, 2019

is a liability of

$124 million

, reflecting the present value of the estimated amount payable under the guarantee obligation. This transaction resulted in a gain of

$549 million

Benefit (Provision) for Income Taxes

The benefit (provision) for income taxes represents federal, state and local, and foreign taxes on earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in loss of investee companies. For


, we recorded a benefit for income taxes of

$9 million

, reflecting an effective income tax rate of (0.3)%, which included discrete items such as a deferred tax benefit of

$768 million

resulting from the transfer of intangible assets between our subsidiaries in connection with a reorganization of our international operations; tax benefits of

$44 million

realized in connection with the preparation of the 2018 federal tax return, based on further clarity provided by the United States government on tax positions relating to the Tax Reform Act; and a tax benefit of $39 million triggered by the bankruptcy of an investee. For


, the provision for income taxes was

$617 million

, reflecting an effective income tax rate of 15.0%. The provision for income taxes for


included discrete items such as the reversal of a valuation allowance of

$140 million

relating to capital loss carryforwards that were utilized in connection with the sale of CBS Television City in 2019; a tax benefit of $80 million relating to the Tax Reform Act and other tax law changes; and a net tax benefit of $71 million relating to a tax accounting method change granted by the Internal Revenue Service.

Consolidated Results of Operations—


vs.


Revenues

Advertising

For


, the

2%

increase

in advertising revenues was driven by our acquisition of Network 10 in the fourth quarter of 2017; record political advertising sales in 2018 associated with the U.S. midterm elections; higher pricing at our broadcast and cable networks; and growth in revenues from AMS. Advertising revenues for


also benefited from the adoption of a new revenue recognition standard in the first quarter of 2018, under which revenues for certain distribution arrangements are recognized based on the gross amount of consideration received from the customer, with an offsetting increase to operating expenses. Under previous accounting guidance, such revenues were recognized at the net amount retained by us after the payment of fees to the third party. This guidance was applied prospectively from the date of adoption, and therefore, amounts for 2017 are reported under previous accounting guidance. These increases were partially offset by lower linear impressions at our cable networks and the absence of the broadcasts of five

Thursday Night Football

games and the national semifinals and championship game of the NCAA Tournament, which were broadcast on the CBS Television Network in 2017. The national semifinals and championship game of the NCAA Tournament are broadcast by the CBS Television Network every other year through 2032 under the current agreements with the NCAA and Turner. Foreign exchange rate changes had an unfavorable impact of 1-percentage point on the advertising revenues comparison.

Affiliate

For


, the

3%

increase

in affiliate revenues reflects

22%

growth in station affiliation and retransmission fees and

65%

growth from subscription fees for our streaming services, CBS All Access

and Showtime OTT. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable comparison against Showtime Networks’ distribution in 2017 of the Floyd Mayweather/Conor McGregor pay-per-view boxing event. Cable affiliate fees were relatively flat for


compared with


, as contractual rate increases under carriage agreements for our cable networks and the benefit of new channel launches and acquisitions were offset by subscriber declines.

Content Licensing

For


, the

4%

increase

in content licensing revenues reflects higher revenues from the distribution of third-party content, resulting from revenues under certain distribution arrangements now being recognized at the gross amount of consideration received from the customer, with an offsetting increase to participation expense, as a result of the adoption of a new revenue recognition standard in the first quarter of


. Under previous guidance, such

II-

distribution revenues were recognized at the net amount retained by us after the payment of fees to the third party. The increase also reflected growth from domestic and international license fees, including the 2018 availability of

Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan

Publishing revenues for


decreased

1%

driven by lower sales of print and electronic books, which were partially offset by higher sales of digital audio books.

Operating Expenses

Production

For


, the

8%

increase

in production expenses reflected an increased investment in content, including a higher number of series produced for distribution on multiple platforms, including our owned networks and streaming services, and the acquisition of Network 10 in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Programming

For


, the

7%

decrease

in programming expenses was driven by lower sports programming costs, resulting from Showtime Networks’ distribution of the Floyd Mayweather/Conor McGregor pay-per-view boxing event in


and the absence of

Thursday Night Football

and the national semifinals and championship game of the NCAA Tournament, which were broadcast on the CBS Television Network in 2017. These decreases were partially offset by costs for programming on Network 10, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of


, and an increased investment in programming for our cable networks.

Participation, Distribution and Royalty

For


, the

4%

increase

in participation, distribution and royalty costs was primarily driven by the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance in the first quarter of 2018, which resulted in revenues under certain distribution arrangements being recognized based on the gross amount of consideration received from the customer, with an offsetting participation expense recognized for the fees paid to the third party. Under previous accounting guidance, such revenues were recognized at the net amount retained by us after the payment of fees to the third party. This

change resulted in an increase to both revenues and participation expenses of $279 million for


, with no impact to our operating income. The increase also reflects higher participation costs associated with the increase in content licensing revenues. These increases were partially offset by lower film distribution costs, driven by the number and mix of theatrical releases and a charge in 2017 resulting from the termination of a slate financing agreement.

Programming Charges

During


, in connection with management changes, we recorded programming charges of

$162 million

relating to changes to our programming strategy, including at CBS Films, which shifted its focus from theatrical films to developing content for our streaming services, as well as at our

Cable Networks

segment where we ceased the use of certain programming.

In addition, during


, we recorded programming charges of

$144 million

associated with management’s decision to cease use of certain original and acquired programming, in connection with the execution of a strategy for certain of our flagship brands and strategic initiatives at Paramount.

Other

For


, the

6%

increase

in other operating expenses mainly reflected higher costs associated with growth in our streaming services and expenses of Network 10, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

For


, the

1%

increase in SG&A expenses reflected higher advertising and marketing costs, mainly for the launch of the Paramount Network and to support our growth initiatives. These increases were partially offset by savings from cost transformation initiatives.

, we recorded restructuring charges of

$258 million

, resulting from the execution of a strategy for certain of our flagship brands and strategic initiatives at Paramount, as well as costs relating to other restructuring plans across several of our businesses in a continued effort to reduce our cost structure. The restructuring charges for 2017 included a non-cash impairment charge resulting from the decision to abandon an international trade name in connection with the strategic initiatives.

Gain on Sale of Assets

In


, we completed the sale of broadcast spectrum in connection with the FCC’s broadcast spectrum auction. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $127 million on the Consolidated Statement of Operations, with $11 million attributable to the noncontrolling interest. In addition, in 2017 we recorded a net gain of $19 million relating to the disposition of property and equipment.

Pension Settlement Charge

During 2017, we purchased a group annuity contract under which an insurance company permanently assumed our obligation to pay and administer pension benefits to certain pension plan participants, or their designated beneficiaries, who had been receiving pension benefits. The purchase of this group annuity contract was funded with pension plan assets. As a result, our outstanding pension benefit obligation was reduced by approximately

$800 million

. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a settlement charge of

$352 million

Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to ViacomCBS and Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations Attributable to ViacomCBS

For


, the

5%

increase in net earnings from continuing operations attributable to ViacomCBS was driven by the lower effective income tax rate in 2018, partially offset by lower operating income. Diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to ViacomCBS grew

9%

, reflecting the higher earnings and lower weighted average shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases and the shares retired as a result of the split-off of CBS Radio Inc. (“CBS Radio) during the fourth quarter of 2017.

Net Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax

On November 16, 2017, we completed the split-off of CBS Radio through an exchange offer, in which we accepted

17.9 million

shares of CBS Class B Common Stock from our stockholders in exchange for the

101.4 million

shares of CBS Radio common stock that we owned. Immediately following the exchange offer, each share of CBS Radio common stock was converted into one share of Entercom Communications Corp. (“Entercom”) Class A common stock upon completion of the merger of CBS Radio and Entercom. CBS Radio has been presented as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.

(a) During 2017, prior to the split-off, CBS Radio was measured each reporting period at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. The value of the transaction with Entercom was determined based on Entercom’s stock price at the closing of the transaction and therefore, we recorded a market value adjustment of

$980 million

in 2017 to adjust the carrying value of CBS Radio to the value indicated by the stock valuation of Entercom.

(b) Primarily reflects a tax benefit from the resolution of a tax matter in a foreign jurisdiction relating to a previously disposed business that was accounted for as a discontinued operation.

segment creates and acquires programming for distribution and viewing on multiple media platforms, including our broadcast network, through multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”) and virtual MVPDs, and our streaming services, as well as for licensing to third parties both domestically and internationally.

TV Entertainment

consists of the CBS Television Network, CBS Television Studios, CBS Television Distribution, CBS Interactive, CBS Sports Network, CBS Television Stations and CBS-branded streaming services CBS All Access and CBSN, among others.

TV Entertainment’s

revenues are generated primarily from advertising sales, the licensing and distribution of its content, and affiliate revenues.

CABLE NETWORKS:  Our

Cable Networks

segment creates and acquires programming for distribution and viewing on multiple media platforms, including our cable networks, through MVPDs and virtual MVPDs, and our streaming services, as well as for licensing to third parties both domestically and internationally.

Cable Networks

consists of our premium subscription cable networks Showtime, The Movie Channel and Flix, and a subscription streaming offering of Showtime; our basic cable networks Nickelodeon, MTV, BET, Comedy Central, Paramount Network, Nick Jr., VH1, TV Land, CMT, Pop TV and Smithsonian Channel, among others, as well as the international extensions of these brands operated by ViacomCBS Networks International; international broadcast networks, Network 10, Channel 5 and Telefe; and Pluto TV, a leading free streaming TV platform in the United States.

Cable Networks’

revenues are generated primarily from affiliate revenues, advertising sales and the licensing of its content and brands.

FILMED ENTERTAINMENT:  Our

Filmed Entertainment

segment develops, produces, finances, acquires and distributes films, television programming and other entertainment content in various markets and media worldwide primarily through Paramount Pictures, Paramount Players, Paramount Animation and Paramount Television Studios.

Filmed Entertainment’s

revenues are generated primarily from the release and/or distribution of films theatrically, the release and/or distribution of film and television product through home entertainment, the licensing of film and television product to television and digital platforms and other ancillary activities.

PUBLISHING:  Our

Publishing

segment publishes and distributes Simon & Schuster consumer books domestically and internationally and includes imprints such as Simon & Schuster, Scribner, Atria Books and Gallery Books

.

generates revenues from the publishing and distribution of consumer books in print, digital and audio formats.

We present operating income (loss) excluding depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, costs for restructuring and other corporate matters, programming charges and gain on sale of assets, each where applicable (“Adjusted OIBDA”), as the primary measure of profit and loss for our operating segments in accordance with FASB guidance for segment reporting. We began presenting Adjusted OIBDA as our segment profit measure in the fourth quarter of 2019 in order to align with the primary method used by our management beginning after the Merger to evaluate segment performance and to make decisions regarding the allocation of resources to our segments. We believe the presentation of Adjusted OIBDA is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view segment performance in a manner similar to the primary method used by our management and enhances their ability to understand our operating performance. Stock-based compensation is excluded from our segment measure of profit and loss because it is set and approved by our Board of Directors in consultation with corporate executive management. Stock-based compensation is included as a component of our consolidated Adjusted OIBDA. The reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to our consolidated net earnings is presented in Note


to the consolidated financial statements.

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Operating Activities.

The

decrease

in cash

provided by

operating activities from continuing operations for


compared with


was primarily driven by an increased investment in television and film programming, higher payments for income taxes and payments of

$132 million

associated with costs related to the Merger. Operating cash flow for


and


also included payments for restructuring activities of

$234 million

and

$219 million

, respectively.

The increase in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for 2018 compared with 2017 was primarily driven by lower cash payments for income taxes and growth in affiliate revenues, which were partially offset by an increased investment in television and film programming. Operating cash flow for 2017 also included discretionary pension contributions of $600 million to prefund our qualified pension plans.

Cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations primarily reflected the operating activities of CBS Radio. Operating activities from discontinued operations also included payments and refunds for tax matters in foreign jurisdictions related to previously disposed businesses that are accounted for as discontinued operations.

The increase in cash payments for income taxes for 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to a payment in 2019 as a result of guidance issued by the United States government in January 2019 relating to the transition tax on cumulative foreign earnings and profits that resulted from the enactment of federal tax legislation in December 2017. In addition, cash taxes for 2018 benefited from the application of a federal income tax overpayment carryforward from 2017.

The decrease in cash payments for income taxes for 2018 compared to 2017 reflects the benefit from a federal income tax overpayment, which included the impact from the retroactive renewal of a federal tax law.

Investing Activities

Financing Activities

Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow reflects our net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities before operating cash flow from discontinued operations, and less capital expenditures. Our calculation of free cash flow includes capital expenditures because investment in capital expenditures is a use of cash that is directly related to our operations. Our net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to us to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, maintain our capital assets, satisfy our tax obligations, and fund ongoing operations and working capital needs. As a result, free cash flow is a significant measure of our ability to generate long-term value. It is useful for investors to know whether this ability is being enhanced or degraded as a result of our operating performance. We believe the presentation of free cash flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from our underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. Free cash flow is among several components of incentive compensation targets for certain management personnel. In addition, free cash flow is a primary measure used externally by our investors, analysts and industry peers for purposes of valuation and comparison of our operating performance to other companies in our industry.

As free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, either net cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity or net earnings (loss) as a measure of operating performance. Free cash flow, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, free cash flow as a measure of liquidity has certain limitations, does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs.

The following table presents a reconciliation of our net cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow.

Share Repurchase Program

During December


, we repurchased

1.2 million

shares of ViacomCBS Class B Common Stock under our share repurchase program for

$50 million

, at an average cost of

$40.78

per share. At

December 31, 2019

,

$2.41 billion

of authorization remained under the share repurchase program.

Capital Structure

The following table sets forth our debt.

(a)

At

December 31, 2019 and 2018

, the senior and junior subordinated debt balances included (i) a net unamortized discount of

$412 million

and

$422 million

, respectively, (ii) unamortized deferred financing costs of

$92 million

and

$98 million

, respectively, and (iii) a decrease in the carrying value of the debt relating to previously settled fair value hedges of

$6 million

and

$5 million

, respectively. The face value of our total debt was

$19.23 billion

at

December 31, 2019

and

$19.64 billion

at

December 31, 2018

.

During the year ended

December 31, 2019

, we issued

$500 million

of

4.20%

senior notes due 2029

. We used the net proceeds from this issuance in the redemption of our

$600 million

outstanding

2.30%

senior notes due August 2019. During 2019, we also repaid the $220 million aggregate principal amount of our

5.625%

senior notes due September 2019 and the $90 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.75% senior notes due December 2019.

During the year ended

December 31, 2018

, we redeemed

$1.13 billion

of senior notes and debentures for a redemption price of $1.10 billion, resulting in a pre-tax gain on early extinguishment of debt of

$18 million

(

$14 million

, net of tax).

During the year ended

December 31, 2017

, we issued

$3.10 billion

of senior notes and junior subordinated debentures. Also during

$4.67 billion

of senior notes, of which

$4.27 billion

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

redeemed prior to maturity, resulting in a pre-tax loss on early extinguishment of debt of

$38 million

(

$21 million

, net of tax).

Our

5.875%

junior subordinated debentures due February 2057 and 6.25% junior subordinated debentures due February 2057 accrue interest at the stated fixed rates until February 28, 2022 and February 28, 2027, respectively, on which dates the rates will switch to floating rates based on three-month LIBOR plus

3.895%

and

3.899%

, respectively, reset quarterly. These debentures can be called by us at any time after the expiration of the fixed-rate period.

The subordination, interest deferral option and extended term of the junior subordinated debentures provide significant credit protection measures for senior creditors and, as a result of these features, the debentures received a 50% equity credit by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services and Fitch Ratings Inc., and a 25% equity credit by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.

The interest rate payable on our 2.25% senior notes due February 2022 and 3.45% senior notes due October 2026, collectively the “Senior Notes”, will be subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. or S&P Global Ratings downgrades (or downgrades and subsequently upgrades) the credit rating assigned to the Senior Notes. The interest rate on these Senior Notes would increase by 0.25% upon each credit agency downgrade up to a maximum of 2.00%, and would similarly be decreased for subsequent upgrades. At

December 31, 2019

, the outstanding principal amount of our 2.25% senior notes due February 2022 and 3.45% senior notes due October 2026 was $50 million and $124 million, respectively.

Some of our outstanding notes and debentures provide for certain covenant packages typical for an investment grade company. There is an acceleration trigger for the majority of the notes and debentures in the event of a change in control under specified circumstances coupled with ratings downgrades due to the change in control, as well as certain optional redemption provisions for our junior debentures.

We had outstanding commercial paper borrowings under our

$2.50 billion

commercial paper program of

$699 million

and

$674 million

at

December 31, 2019 and 2018

, respectively, each with maturities of less than


days. The weighted average interest rate for these borrowings was

2.07%

and

3.02%

at

December 31, 2019 and 2018

, respectively.

In January 2020, our commercial paper program was increased to $3.50 billion in conjunction with the new

$3.50 billion

revolving credit facility described below.

Credit Facility

At

December 31, 2019

, we had a

$2.50 billion

revolving credit facility held by CBS prior to the Merger (the “CBS Credit Facility”) with a maturity in June 2021 and a $2.50 billion revolving credit facility held by Viacom prior to the Merger (the “Viacom Credit Facility”), with a maturity in February 2024. At

December 31, 2019

, we had no borrowings outstanding under the CBS Credit Facility or the Viacom Credit Facility and the remaining availability, net of outstanding letters of credit, was

$2.50 billion

for each facility.

In January 2020, the CBS Credit Facility was terminated and the Viacom Credit Facility was amended and restated to a

$3.50 billion

revolving credit facility with a maturity in January 2025 (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility is used for general corporate purposes and to support commercial paper outstanding, if any. We may, at our option, also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the Credit Facility. Borrowing rates under the Credit Facility are determined at our option at the time of each borrowing and are based generally on the prime rate in the U.S. or LIBOR plus a margin based on our senior unsecured debt rating. The Credit Facility requires our Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio to be less than 4.5x (which we may elect to increase to 5.0x for up to four consecutive

quarters following a qualified acquisition) at the end of each quarter, to be applied retrospectively from December 31, 2019. The Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio reflects the ratio of our Consolidated Indebtedness at the end of a quarter, to our Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the amended credit agreement) for the trailing twelve-month period. We met this covenant as of December 31, 2019.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We project anticipated cash requirements for our operating, investing and financing needs as well as cash flows generated from operating activities available to meet these needs. Our operating needs include, among other items, commitments for sports programming rights, television and film programming, talent contracts, leases, interest payments, income taxes payments and pension funding obligations. Our investing and financing spending includes capital expenditures, investments and acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends and principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness.

We believe that our operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, borrowing capacity under the $3.50 billion Credit Facility, and access to capital markets are sufficient to fund our operating, investing and financing requirements for the next twelve months.

Our funding for short-term and long-term obligations will come primarily from cash flows from operating activities. Any additional cash funding requirements are financed with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and long-term debt. To the extent that commercial paper is not available to us, the Credit Facility provides sufficient capacity to satisfy short-term borrowing needs. We routinely assess our capital structure and opportunistically enter into transactions to lower our interest expense, which could result in a charge from the early extinguishment of debt.

Funding for our long-term debt obligations due over the next five years of

$5.90 billion

is expected to come from our ability to refinance our debt and cash generated from operating activities.

Our access to capital markets can be impacted by factors outside our control, including economic conditions; however, we believe that our strong cash flows and balance sheet, our credit facility and our credit rating will provide us with adequate access to funding for our expected cash needs. The cost of any new borrowings are affected by market conditions and short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to access capital markets on terms and conditions that will be favorable to us.

At December 31,


, we had

$2.41 billion

of remaining availability under our share repurchase program. Share repurchases under the program are expected to be funded by cash flows from operations and, as appropriate, with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and/or the issuance of long-term debt.

Contractual Obligations

As of

December 31, 2019

, payments due by period under our significant contractual obligations with remaining terms in excess of one year were as follows:

(a) Our programming and talent commitments include

$5.39 billion

for sports programming rights,

$3.80 billion

relating to the production and licensing of television and film programming, and

$1.17 billion

for talent contracts.

(b) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders.

(c) Consists of operating lease commitments for office space, equipment, satellite transponders and studio facilities.

(d) Long-term debt obligations are presented at face value, excluding finance leases.

(e) Future interest based on scheduled debt maturities. Interest payments on junior subordinated debentures subsequent to the expiration of their fixed-rate periods have been included based on their current fixed rates.

(f) Includes finance lease obligations for satellite transponders and equipment.

(g) Reflects long-term contractual obligations recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, including program liabilities; participations due to producers; residuals; and a tax liability resulting from the enactment of the Tax Reform Act in December 2017. This tax liability reflects the remaining tax on our historical accumulated foreign earnings and profits, which is payable to the IRS in 2024 and 2025.

The table above does not include payments relating to reserves for uncertain tax positions of

$384 million

, and related interest and penalties, interest under our credit facility and for commercial paper borrowings, redeemable noncontrolling interest of

$254 million

, our guarantee liability of

$124 million

relating to the sale of CBS Television City; lease indemnification obligations of

$86 million

or potential future contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans. The amount and timing of payments with respect to these items are subject to a number of uncertainties such that we are unable to make sufficiently reliable estimations of future payments.

In


, we expect to make contributions of approximately

$70 million

to our non-qualified pension plans to satisfy the benefit payments due under these plans. Also in


, we expect to contribute approximately

$43 million

to our other postretirement benefit plans to satisfy our portion of benefit payments due under these plans.

Guarantees

Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds.

We have indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business. At

December 31, 2019

, the outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds approximated

$136 million

and were not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

CBS Television City

.  During


, we completed the sale of CBS Television City. We have guaranteed a specified level of cash flows to be generated by the business during the first

five

years following the completion of the sale. Included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at

December 31, 2019

is a liability of

$124 million

, reflecting the present value of the estimated amount payable under the guarantee obligation.

Lease Guarantees.

As noted above, we have indemnification obligations of

$86 million

with respect to leases primarily associated with the previously discontinued operations of Famous Players Inc.

Film Financing Arrangements.

From time to time we enter into film or television programming (collectively referred to as “film”) financing arrangements that involve the sale of a partial copyright interest in a film to third-party investors. Since the investors typically have the risks and rewards of ownership proportionate to their ownership in the film, we generally record the amounts received for the sale of copyright interest as a reduction of the cost of the film and related cash flows are reflected in net cash flow from operating activities. We also enter into collaborative arrangements with other studios to jointly finance and distribute films (“co-financing arrangements”), under which each partner is responsible for distribution of the film in specific territories or distribution windows. The partners’ share in the profits and losses of the films under these arrangements are included within participations expense.

In the course of our business, we both provide and receive indemnities which are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, we may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification obligation. We record a liability for its indemnification obligations and other contingent liabilities when probable and reasonably estimable.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions.

We consider the following accounting policies to be the most critical as they are important to our financial condition and results of operations, and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. The risks and uncertainties involved in applying our critical accounting policies are provided below. Unless otherwise noted, we applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented, and have discussed such policies with our Audit Committee. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when control of a good or service is transferred to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Significant judgments used in the determination of the amount and timing of revenue recognition include the identification of distinct performance obligations in contracts containing bundled advertising sales and content licenses, and the allocation of consideration among individual performance obligations within these arrangements based on their relative standalone selling prices.

II-


Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Advertising Revenues

—Advertising revenues are recognized when the advertising spots are aired on television or displayed on digital platforms. If a contract includes a guarantee to deliver a targeted audience rating or number of impressions, the delivery of the advertising spots that achieve the guarantee represents the performance obligation to be satisfied over time and revenues are recognized based on the proportion of the audience rating or impressions delivered to the total guaranteed in the contract. To the extent the amounts billed exceed the amount of revenue recognized, such excess is deferred until the guaranteed audience ratings or impressions are delivered. For contracts that do not include impressions guarantees, the individual advertising spots are the performance obligation and consideration is allocated among the individual advertising spots based on relative standalone selling price.

Content Licensing Revenues

—For licenses of exhibition rights for internally-produced programming, each individual episode or film delivered represents a separate performance obligation and revenues are recognized when the episode or film is made available to the licensee for exhibition and the license period has begun. For license agreements that include delivery of content on one or more dates for a fixed fee, consideration is allocated based on the relative standalone selling price of each episode or film, which is based on licenses for comparable content within the marketplace. Estimation of standalone selling prices requires judgment, which can impact the timing of recognizing revenues.

Affiliate Revenues

—The performance obligation for our affiliate agreements is a license to our programming provided through the continuous delivery of live linear feeds and, for agreements with MVPDs and subscribers to our digital streaming services, also includes a license to programming for video on demand viewing. Affiliate revenues are recognized over the term of the agreement as we satisfy our performance obligation by continuously providing our customer with the right to use our programming. For agreements that provide for a variable fee, revenues are determined each month based on an agreed upon contractual rate applied to the number of subscribers to

our customer’s service. For agreements that provide for a fixed fee, revenues are recognized based on the relative fair value of the content provided over the term of the agreement. These agreements primarily include agreements with television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network (“network affiliates”) for which fair value is determined based on the fair value of the network affiliate’s service and the value of our programming.

Film and Television Production Costs

Costs incurred to produce television programs and feature films are capitalized and amortized over the projected life of each television program or feature film based on the ratio of current period revenues to estimated remaining total revenues to be earned (“Ultimate Revenues”). Management’s judgment is required in estimating Ultimate Revenues and the costs to be incurred throughout the life of each television program or feature film. These estimates are used to determine the amortization of capitalized production costs, expensing of participation costs, and any necessary impairments to capitalized production costs.

For television programming, our estimates of Ultimate Revenue are initially limited to the amount of revenue contracted for each episode in the initial market and estimates of revenue from a secondary market where we can demonstrate a history of earning such revenue in that market. Estimates for additional secondary market revenues such as domestic and foreign syndication and home entertainment are included in the estimates of Ultimate Revenues once it can be demonstrated that a program can be successfully licensed in such secondary market. For each television program, management bases these estimates on the performance in the initial markets, the existence of future firm commitments to sell and the past performance of similar television programs.

For feature films, our estimate of Ultimate Revenues includes revenues from all sources that are estimated to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film’s initial theatrical release. For acquired film libraries, our estimate of Ultimate Revenues is for a period within 20 years from the date of acquisition. Prior to the release of feature films, we estimate Ultimate Revenues based on the historical performance of similar content and pre-release market research

II-


Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

(including test market screenings), as well as factors relating to the specific film, including the expected number of theaters and markets in which the original content will be released, the genre of the original content and the past box office performance of the lead actors and actresses. For films intended for theatrical release, we believe the performance during the theatrical exhibition is the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues as subsequent markets have historically exhibited a high correlation to theatrical performance. Upon a film’s initial release, we update our estimate of Ultimate Revenues based on actual and expected future performance. Our estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships to theatrical performance and an analysis of current market trends. We also review and revise estimates of Ultimate Revenue and participation costs as of each reporting date to reflect the most current available information. After their theatrical release the most sensitive factor affecting our estimates for feature films is the extent of home entertainment sales. In addition to theatrical performance, home entertainment sales vary based on a variety of factors including demand for our titles, the volume and quality of competing products, marketing and promotional strategies, as well as economic conditions.

Estimates of Ultimate Revenues for internally-produced television programming are updated regularly based on information available as the television program progresses through its life cycle. If Ultimate Revenue estimates are revised, the difference between amortization expense determined using the new estimate and any amounts previously expensed during that year are reflected in our Consolidated Statement of Operations in the quarter in which the estimates are revised. Overestimating Ultimate Revenues for internally-produced programming could result in the understatement of the amortization of capitalized production costs and future net realizable value adjustments, as well as the misstatement of accruals for participation expense.

Acquired Program Rights

The costs incurred in acquiring television series and feature film programming rights, including advances, are capitalized when the program is accepted and available for airing at the commencement of the license period. The costs of programming rights licensed under multi-year sports programming agreements are capitalized if the rights payments are made before the related economic benefit has been received. These costs are expensed over the shorter of the license period or the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived. The economic benefit is determined based on management’s estimates of revenues to be derived from the programming, the expected number of future airings, which may differ from the contracted number of airings, and the length of the license period. If initial airings are expected to generate higher revenues an accelerated method of amortization is used. Management’s judgment is required in determining the value of the future economic benefit and the timing of the expensing of these costs.

The estimated economic benefit for acquired programming, including revenue projections for multi-year sports programming, are periodically reviewed and updated based on information available throughout the contractual term. A failure to adjust for a downward revision in the estimated economic benefit to be generated from acquired programming could result in the understatement of programming costs or future net realizable value adjustments.

The net realizable value of acquired programming is regularly evaluated either by title or on a daypart basis, which is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or an aggregation of programs of a similar type based on the specific demographic targeted by each respective program or program service. Net realizable value is determined by estimating advertising revenues to be derived from the future airing of the programming within the daypart and allocating affiliate revenues to the programming, each as applicable. An impairment charge may be necessary if our estimates of future cash flows are below the carrying value of the programming or if programming is abandoned.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets Impairment Test

We perform fair value-based impairment tests of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, comprised primarily of television FCC licenses in the U.S. and broadcast licenses in Australia, on an annual basis and also between annual tests if an event occurs or if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value.

Television FCC Licenses and International Broadcast Licenses

—FCC licenses are tested for impairment at the geographic market level. We consider each geographic market, which is comprised of all of our television stations within that geographic market, to be a single unit of accounting because the FCC licenses at this level represent their highest and best use. At December 31,


, we had


television markets with FCC license book values. For broadcast licenses in Australia, we consider all of our broadcast licenses within the country to be a single unit of accounting because this represents their highest and best use.

For our annual impairment test, we perform qualitative assessments for each U.S. television market that we estimate has an aggregate fair value of FCC licenses that significantly exceed their respective carrying values, and for our Australian broadcast licenses when we estimate that the aggregate fair value significantly exceeds the carrying value. Additionally, we consider the duration of time since a quantitative test was performed. For the


annual impairment test, we performed qualitative assessments for all of our U.S. television markets. For each market, we weighed the relative impact of market-specific and macroeconomic factors. The market-specific factors considered include recent projections by geographic market from both independent and internal sources for revenue and operating costs, as well as market share and capital expenditures. We also considered the macroeconomic impact on discount rates and growth rates, as well as the impact from tax law changes that were enacted since the most recent quantitative tests were performed on these markets. Based on the qualitative assessments, considering the aggregation of the relevant factors, we concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of the FCC licenses in each of these television markets are less than their respective carrying values. Therefore, performing the quantitative impairment test was unnecessary.

A quantitative impairment test of broadcast licenses calculates an estimated fair value using the Greenfield Discounted Cash Flow Method, which values a hypothetical start-up station in the relevant market by adding discounted cash flows over a five-year build-up period to a residual value. The assumptions for the build-up period include industry projections of overall market revenues; the start-up station’s operating costs and capital expenditures, which are based on both industry and internal data; and average market share. The discount rate is determined based on the industry and market-based risk of achieving the projected cash flows, and the residual value is calculated using a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and industry projections.

For


, we performed a quantitative impairment test for our Australian broadcast licenses. The discount rate and perpetual nominal growth rate were

11%

and

0.5%

, respectively. The impairment test indicated that the estimated fair value of the broadcast licenses was lower than the carrying value, which was the result of a sustained decline in the advertising marketplace in Australia. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge during the fourth quarter of 2019 of $20 million, which is included within “Depreciation and amortization” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The estimated fair values of the FCC licenses and Australian broadcast licenses are highly dependent on the assumptions of future economic conditions in the individual geographic markets in which we own and operate television stations. Certain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital, or a decline in the local television advertising marketplace in the U.S. or further decline in the advertising marketplace in Australia could result in a downward revision to our current assumptions and judgments. Various factors may contribute to a future decline in an advertising marketplace including declines in economic conditions;

II-

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

an other-than-temporary decrease in spending by advertisers in certain industries that have historically represented a significant portion of television advertising revenues in that market; a shift by advertisers to competing advertising platforms; changes in consumer behavior; and/or a change in population size. A downward revision to the present value of future cash flows could result in impairment and a noncash charge would be required.  Such a charge could have a material effect on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Goodwill

—Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is an operating segment, or one level below. At December 31,


, we had

six

reporting units with goodwill balances, which were determined based on the post-Merger reporting structure. For the 2019 annual impairment test, the reporting units tested were those in place prior to the Merger, which closed after the testing dates. We tested two reporting units for impairment as of August 31 and eight reporting units as of October 31.

For our annual impairment test, we perform a qualitative assessment for each reporting unit that management estimates has a fair value that significantly exceeds its respective carrying value. For the


annual impairment test, we performed qualitative assessments for all of our reporting units. For each reporting unit, we weighed the relative impact of factors that are specific to the reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors. The reporting unit specific factors that were considered included financial performance and changes to the reporting units’ carrying amounts since the most recent impairment tests. For each industry in which the reporting units operate, we considered growth projections from independent sources and significant developments or transactions within the industry. We also determined that the impact of macroeconomic factors on the discount rates and growth rates used for the most recent impairment tests would not significantly affect the fair value of the reporting units, and that the lower tax rate from tax law changes enacted since the most recent quantitative tests would positively impact the fair value of the reporting units. Based on the qualitative assessments, considering the aggregation of the relevant factors, we concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its respective carrying amount and therefore performing quantitative impairment tests was unnecessary.

As of the closing date of the Merger on December 4, 2019, we performed qualitative assessments on the pre-Merger reporting units that were to be combined as a result of the new reporting structure, as well as the post-Merger reporting units that resulted from this combination. Based on these assessments, we concluded that there were no changes to the conclusions reached in our annual impairment test.

A quantitative goodwill impairment test, when performed, requires estimating fair value of a reporting unit based on a discounted cash flow analysis. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions, including assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates.

Certain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital, a decline in the advertising market, a decrease in audience acceptance of programming, a shift by advertisers to competing advertising platforms; and/or changes in consumer behavior could result in changes to our assumptions and judgments used in the goodwill impairment tests. A downward revision of these assumptions could cause the fair values of the reporting units to fall below their respective carrying values and a noncash impairment charge would be required. Such a charge could have a material effect on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Legal Matters

Estimates of liabilities related to legal issues and discontinued businesses, including asbestos and environmental matters, require significant judgments by management.  We continually evaluate these estimates based on changes in the relevant facts and circumstances and events that may impact estimates.  It is difficult to predict future asbestos

II-

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

liabilities as events and circumstances may impact the estimate of our liabilities. While we believe that our liabilities for matters related to our predecessor operations, including environmental and asbestos, are adequate to cover our liabilities, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods. Our liability estimate is based upon many factors, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims, as well as consultation with a third party firm on trends that may impact our future asbestos liability.

Pensions

Pension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using many actuarial assumptions. Two key assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate is determined based on the yield on a portfolio of high quality bonds, constructed to provide cash flows necessary to meet our pension plans’ expected future benefit payments, as determined for the projected benefit obligation. The expected return on plan assets assumption is derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets. As of December 31,


, the unrecognized actuarial losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income increased from the prior year-end due primarily to a decrease in the discount rate, partially offset by the favorable performance of pension plan assets. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate would result in an estimated change to the projected benefit obligation of approximately

$137 million

and would not have a material impact on


pension expense. A decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would increase pension expense. The estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets is a change of approximately

$8 million

to


pension expense.

Income Taxes

We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes and evaluating our income tax positions.  When recording an interim worldwide provision for income taxes, an estimated effective tax rate for the year is applied to interim operating results.  In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in the quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded in the same quarter. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed. We evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.

A number of years may elapse before a tax return containing tax matters for which a reserve has been established is audited and finally resolved. For positions taken in a previously filed tax return or expected to be taken in a future tax return, we evaluate each position to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and the appropriate reserve to establish, if any. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold a tax reserve is established and no benefit is recognized. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions quarterly based on many factors, including, changes in tax laws and interpretations, information received from tax authorities, and other changes in facts and circumstances. Our income tax returns are routinely audited by U.S. federal and state as well as foreign tax authorities. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe that the reserve for uncertain tax positions of

$384 million

at December 31,


is properly recorded pursuant to the recognition and measurement provisions of FASB guidance for uncertainty in income taxes.

Legal Matters

General.

On an ongoing basis, we vigorously defend ourselves in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and respond to various investigations and inquiries from federal, state, local and international authorities (collectively, “litigation’’). Litigation may be brought against us without merit, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on our understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, we believe that the below-described legal matters and other litigation to which we are a party are not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Litigation Relating to the Merger.

On September 27, 2019, Bucks County Employees Retirement Fund (the “Bucks County Fund”), a purported holder of CBS Class B Common Stock, served us with a demand for inspection of books and records pursuant to 8 Del. C. § 220 in connection with the Merger (the “Demand”). On October 10, 2019, we offered to produce certain categories of documents properly within the scope of a books and records demand under § 220. The Bucks County Fund rejected our offer and filed litigation in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware on October 15, 2019, seeking to compel production of all documents requested in the Demand (the “Section 220 Complaint”). A trial on the Section 220 Complaint took place on November 22, 2019, and the Court ordered limited additional production on November 25, 2019. On December 2, 2019, we certified that we had completed production of all relevant documents. On February 20, 2020, the Bucks County Fund filed a putative derivative and class action complaint in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against Shari Redstone, NAI, Sumner M. Redstone National Amusements Trust (“SMR Trust”), the CBS board of directors (comprised of Candace K. Beinecke, Barbara M. Byrne, Gary L. Countryman, Brian Goldner, Linda M. Griego, Robert N. Klieger, Martha L. Minow, Susan Schuman, Frederick O. Terrell and Strauss Zelnick), former CBS President and Acting Chief Executive Officer Joseph Ianniello and ViacomCBS Inc. The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties to CBS stockholders and waste in connection with the negotiation and approval of the Merger Agreement. The complaint seeks unspecified damages, costs and expenses as well as other relief. We believe that the claims are without merit and we intend to defend against them vigorously. We are currently unable to determine a range of potential liability, if any. Accordingly, no accrual for this matter has been made in our consolidated financial statements.

On January 23, 2020, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware consolidated four putative class action suits filed by purported Viacom stockholders against NAI, NAI Entertainment Holdings LLC, Shari E. Redstone, the members of the Viacom special transaction committee of the Viacom board of directors (comprised of Thomas J. May, Judith A. McHale, Ronald L. Nelson and Nicole Seligman) and our President and Chief Executive Officer and director, Robert M. Bakish, in

In re Viacom Inc. Stockholders Litigation

. The four actions allege breaches of fiduciary duties to Viacom stockholders in connection with the negotiation and approval of the Merger Agreement, and seek unspecified damages, costs and expenses. On February 6, 2020, the Court appointed the California Public Employees’ Retirement System as the lead plaintiff in the consolidated action. We believe that the claims are without merit and we intend to defend against them vigorously. We are currently unable to determine a range of potential liability, if any. Accordingly, no accrual for this matter has been made in our consolidated financial statements.

Investigation-Related Matters

. As announced on August 1, 2018, the CBS Board of Directors (the “CBS Board”) retained two law firms to conduct a full investigation of the allegations in press reports about CBS’ former Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, Leslie Moonves, CBS News and cultural issues at CBS. On December 17, 2018, the CBS Board announced the completion of its investigation, certain findings of the investigation and the CBS Board’s determination, discussed below, with respect to the termination of Mr. Moonves’ employment. We have received subpoenas from the New York County District Attorney’s Office and the New York City Commission on Human Rights regarding the subject matter of this investigation and related matters. The New York State Attorney General’s Office and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission have also requested information about these matters, including with respect to CBS’ related public disclosures. We may continue to receive additional related regulatory and investigative inquiries from these and other entities in the future. We are cooperating with these inquiries.

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

On August 27, 2018 and on October 1, 2018, each of Gene Samit and John Lantz, respectively, filed putative class action suits in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, individually and on behalf of others similarly situated, for claims that are similar to those alleged in the amended complaint described below. On November 6, 2018, the Court entered an order consolidating the two actions. On November 30, 2018, the Court appointed Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern California as the lead plaintiff of the consolidated action. On February 11, 2019, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended putative class action complaint against CBS, certain current and former senior executives and members of the CBS Board. The consolidated action is stated to be on behalf of purchasers of CBS Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock between September 26, 2016 and December 4, 2018. This action seeks to recover damages arising during this time period allegedly caused by the defendants’ purported violations of the federal securities laws, including by allegedly making materially false and misleading statements or failing to disclose material information, and seeks costs and expenses as well as remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. On April 12, 2019, the defendants filed motions to dismiss this action, which the Court granted in part and denied in part on January 15, 2020. With the exception of one statement made by Mr. Moonves at an industry event in November 2017, in which he allegedly was acting as the agent of CBS, all claims as to all other allegedly false and misleading statements were dismissed. We believe that the remaining claims are without merit and we intend to defend against them vigorously. We are currently unable to determine a range of potential liability, if any. Accordingly, no accrual for this matter has been made in our consolidated financial statements.

Separation Agreement

. On September 9, 2018, CBS entered into a separation and settlement agreement and releases (the “Separation Agreement”) with Mr. Moonves, pursuant to which Mr. Moonves resigned as a director and as Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of CBS. In October 2018, we contributed $120 million to a grantor trust pursuant to the Separation Agreement. On December 17, 2018, the CBS Board announced that, following its consideration of the findings of the investigation referred to above, it had determined that there were grounds to terminate Mr. Moonves’ employment for cause under his employment agreement with CBS. Any dispute related to the CBS Board’s determination is subject to binding arbitration as set forth in the Separation Agreement. On January 16, 2019, Mr. Moonves commenced a binding arbitration proceeding with respect to this matter and the related CBS Board investigation, which proceeding is ongoing. The assets of the grantor trust will remain in the trust until a final determination in the arbitration. We are currently unable to determine the outcome of the arbitration and the amount, if any, that may be awarded thereunder and, accordingly, no accrual for this matter has been made in our consolidated financial statements.

Claims Related to Former Businesses: Asbestos.

We are a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. We are typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of our products is the basis of a claim. Claims against us in which a product has been identified most commonly relate to allegations of exposure to asbestos-containing insulating material used in conjunction with turbines and electrical equipment.

Claims are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. We do not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets that some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of

December 31, 2019

, we had pending approximately

30,950

asbestos claims, as compared with approximately

31,570

as of

December 31, 2018

and

31,660

as of

December 31, 2017

. During


, we received approximately

3,460

new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately

4,080

claims. We report claims as closed when we become aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when we have reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claims, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other

II-


Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

factors. Our total costs for the years


and


for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax were approximately $

58 million

and $

45 million

, respectively. Our costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year and insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses.

Filings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure; other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos-related disease. The predominant number of pending claims against us are non-cancer claims. It is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may impact the estimate of our asbestos liabilities, including, among others, the number and types of claims and average cost to resolve such claims. We record an accrual for a loss contingency when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We believe that our accrual and insurance are adequate to cover our asbestos liabilities. Our liability estimate is based upon many factors, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims, as well as consultation with a third party firm on trends that may impact our future asbestos liability.

Other.

From time to time we receive claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that we are or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to our historical and predecessor operations. In addition, from time to time we receive personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from our historical operations and predecessors.

Market Risk

We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and use derivative financial instruments to manage this exposure. In accordance with our policy, we do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, we do not hold or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.

Foreign Exchange Risk

We conduct business in various countries outside the U.S., resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the U.S. dollar. In order to hedge anticipated cash flows in currencies such as the British Pound, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, foreign currency forward contracts, for periods generally up to 24 months, are used. Additionally, we designate forward contracts used to hedge committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions, including future production costs and programming obligations, as cash flow hedges. Gains or losses on the effective portion of designated cash flow hedges are initially recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to the statement of operations when the hedged item is recognized. Additionally, we enter into non-designated forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. The change in fair value of the non-designated contracts is included in “Other items, net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We manage the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally.

At

December 31, 2019 and 2018

, the notional amount of all foreign currency contracts was

$1.44 billion

and

$995 million

, respectively. For 2019, $833 million related to future production costs and $606 million

related to our foreign currency balances and other expected foreign currency cash flows. For 2018, $481 million related to future production costs and $514 million related to our foreign currency balances and other expected foreign currency cash flows.

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Interest Risk

Interest on commercial paper borrowings is exposed to risk related to movements in short-term interest rates. A 100 basis point change to the weighted average interest rate on commercial paper borrowings in 2019 would increase or decrease interest expense by approximately $7 million. In addition, interest rates on future long-term debt issuances are exposed to risk related to movements in long-term interest rates. Interest rate hedges may be used to modify both of these exposures at our discretion. There were no interest rate hedges outstanding at

December 31, 2019

or


but in the future we may use derivatives to manage our exposure to interest rates.

At

December 31, 2019

, the carrying value of our outstanding notes and debentures was

$17.98 billion

and the estimated fair value was

$20.6 billion

. A 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our notes and debentures by approximately $1.22 billion and $2.68 billion, respectively.

Credit Risk

We continually monitor our positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to our financial instruments. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.

Our receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at

December 31, 2019

or


, due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which our products and services are sold.

MANAGEMENT’ S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or Rule 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. ViacomCBS Inc. and its subsidiaries’ (the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (a) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of assets; (b) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and (c) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements prepared for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

based on the framework set forth in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2019

.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of ViacomCBS Inc.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ViacomCBS Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the COSO.

Changes in Accounting Principles

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019 and the manner in which it accounts for revenues from contracts with customers in 2018.

Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

II-


Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

M

erger with Viacom Inc.

As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, Viacom Inc. (“Viacom”) merged with and into CBS Corporation (“CBS”) on December 4, 2019 (the “Merger”), with CBS continuing as the surviving company. At the effective time of the Merger, the combined company changed its name to ViacomCBS Inc. The Merger has been accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control as National Amusements, Inc. was the controlling stockholder of each of CBS and Viacom. Upon the closing of the Merger, the net assets of Viacom were combined with those of CBS at their historical carrying amounts and the companies have been presented on a combined basis for all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.

The principal considerations for our determination that the Merger is a critical audit matter are significant audit effort was necessary to perform procedures and evaluate the audit evidence obtained relating to management’s accounting for the Merger due to the pervasive nature of the Merger on the composition of the Company’s consolidated financial statements and disclosures to include the entirety of the legacy Viacom businesses.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls over the accounting for the Merger, including the combination and presentation of the historical carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures also included evaluating management’s assessment of the accounting associated with the transaction between entities under common control and the completeness and accuracy of the consolidated financial statements, including the presentation of Viacom’s financial information given the change in Viacom’s fiscal year-end, and the retrospective combination of Viacom and CBS. Procedures were also performed to evaluate the sufficiency of the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

Amortization of Internally Produced Television Programming Inventory Based on Estimated Secondary Market Revenues

As described in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s internally produced television programming inventory was $6.3 billion as of December 31, 2019, a portion of which relates to costs that will be amortized based on estimated secondary market revenues.  Television programming costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of the secondary market are initially capitalized and amortized, based on the proportion that current period revenues bear to the estimated remaining total lifetime revenues. Estimates for secondary market revenues such as domestic and foreign syndication are included in the estimated lifetime revenues once it can be demonstrated that a program can be successfully licensed in such secondary market. Management bases these estimates on the performance in the initial markets, the existence of future firm commitments to sell and the past performance of similar television programs.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to amortization of internally produced television programming inventory based on estimated secondary market revenues is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment required by management when estimating secondary market revenues.  This led to a high degree of auditor judgment, effort and subjectivity in performing procedures to evaluate management’s estimate of secondary market revenues and the significant assumptions, including consideration of the performance in the initial markets and past performance of similar television programs.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to amortization of internally produced television programming inventory, including the control over the estimation of secondary market revenues.  These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for estimating secondary market revenues, including evaluating whether the significant assumptions were reasonable considering information such as the historical performance in the initial markets and past performance of television programs. Procedures were also performed to test the reliability, completeness and relevance of management's data used in the estimate of ultimate revenues.

Amortization of Film Inventory

As described in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, film inventory was approximately $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2019. Management uses an individual-film-forecast-computation method to amortize capitalized production costs based upon the ratio of current period revenues to estimated remaining total gross revenues to be earned (“Ultimate Revenues”) for each title. The estimate of Ultimate Revenues for feature films includes revenues from all sources that are estimated to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film’s initial theatrical release. Prior to the release of feature films, management estimates Ultimate Revenues based on the historical performance of similar content and pre-release market research (including test market screenings), as well as factors relating to the specific film, including the expected number of theaters and markets in which the original content will be released, the genre of the original content and the past box office performance of the lead actors and actresses. Upon a film’s initial release, management updates their estimate of Ultimate Revenues based on actual and expected future performance. As disclosed by management, management believes the most sensitive factor affecting the estimate of Ultimate Revenues for films intended for theatrical release is theatrical exhibition, as revenues from subsequent markets have historically exhibited a high correlation to theatrical performance.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to amortization of film inventory is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management when estimating ultimate revenues. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, effort and subjectivity in performing procedures to evaluate management’s estimate of ultimate revenues and the significant assumptions, including the historical performance of similar films and theatrical exhibition.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of

II-


controls over management’s estimation of ultimate revenues and controls over the significant assumptions used in the ultimate revenues estimate. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for estimating ultimate revenues, including evaluating whether the significant assumptions were reasonable considering information such as historical performance of similar content, market research performed, impact of competing products, marketing budget and strategy, economic conditions, and theatrical exhibition, including actual box office performance. Procedures were also performed to test the reliability, completeness and relevance of management's data used in the estimate of ultimate revenues.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Description of Business

—ViacomCBS Inc. is comprised of the following segments:

TV Entertainment

(CBS Television Network, CBS Television Studios, CBS Television Distribution, CBS Interactive, CBS Sports Network, CBS Television Stations and CBS-branded streaming services),

Cable Networks

(Showtime Networks, Nickelodeon, MTV, BET, Comedy Central, Paramount Network, Nick Jr., VH1, TV Land, CMT, Pop TV, Smithsonian Networks, ViacomCBS Networks International, Network 10, Channel 5, Telefe and Pluto TV),

Filmed Entertainment

(Paramount Pictures, Paramount Players, Paramount Animation and Paramount Television Studios); and

Publishing

(Simon & Schuster). References to “ViacomCBS”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” and “our” refer to ViacomCBS Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires.

Merger with Viacom Inc.

—On December 4, 2019, Viacom Inc. (“Viacom”) merged with and into CBS Corporation (“CBS”), with CBS continuing as the surviving company (the “Merger”). At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), the combined company changed its name to ViacomCBS Inc. (“ViacomCBS”). At the Effective Time, (1) each share of Viacom Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than shares held directly by Viacom as treasury shares or held by CBS, was converted automatically into

0.59625

shares of ViacomCBS Class A Common Stock, and (2) each share of Viacom Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than shares held directly by Viacom as treasury shares or held by CBS, was converted automatically into

0.59625

shares of ViacomCBS Class B Common Stock (together with ViacomCBS Class A Common Stock, the “ViacomCBS Common Stock”). At the Effective Time, each share of CBS Class A Common Stock and each share of CBS Class B Common Stock (together with CBS Class A Common Stock, the “CBS Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, remained an issued and outstanding share of ViacomCBS Class A Common Stock and ViacomCBS Class B Common Stock, respectively, and was not affected by the Merger.

Following the Merger, the CBS Common Stock was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and the Viacom Common Stock ceased trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”). On December 5, 2019, ViacomCBS Class A Common Stock and ViacomCBS Class B Common Stock were listed on Nasdaq and began trading under the ticker symbols VIACA and VIAC, respectively.

Change in Reporting Entity

—

The Merger has been accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control as National Amusements, Inc. (“NAI”) was the controlling stockholder of each of CBS and Viacom (and remains the controlling stockholder of ViacomCBS). Upon the closing of the Merger, the net assets of Viacom were combined with those of CBS at their historical carrying amounts and the companies have been presented on a combined basis for all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. This presentation constitutes a change in reporting entity.

The following table provides the impact of the change in reporting entity on our results of operations for periods prior to the Merger.

Discontinued Operations

—On November 16, 2017, we completed the disposition of CBS Radio Inc. (“CBS Radio”) through a split-off. CBS Radio has been presented as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial

II-

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

statements (see Note


). Also included in discontinued operations are liabilities associated with indemnification obligations for leases primarily associated with the previously discontinued operations of Famous Players Inc.

Principles of Consolidation

—The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ViacomCBS, its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is maintained and variable interest entities (“VIEs”) where we are considered the primary beneficiary, after the elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions. Controlling interest is determined by majority ownership interest and the absence of substantive third party participating rights.  Investments over which we have a significant influence, without a controlling interest, are accounted for under the equity method. Our proportionate share of net earnings or loss of the entity is recorded in “Equity in earnings (loss) of investee companies, net of tax” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Use of Estimates

—The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Business Combinations

—We generally account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, once control is obtained of a business, 100% of the assets, liabilities and certain contingent liabilities acquired, as well as amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests, are recorded at fair value. Any transaction costs are expensed as incurred. The Merger was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control as NAI was the controlling stockholder of each of CBS and Viacom.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

—Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase, including money market funds, commercial paper and bank time deposits.

At

December 31, 2019 and 2018

, we had restricted cash of

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively, consisting of amounts held in grantor trusts related to agreements with former executives. Restricted cash is included within “Other current assets” and “Other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Programming Inventory

—We acquire rights to programming and produce programming to exhibit on our broadcast and cable networks, on our broadcast television stations, direct to consumers through our digital streaming services, and in theaters. We also produce programming for third parties.

Internally-Produced Programming

—Costs incurred to produce television programs and feature films (which include direct production costs, production overhead, acquisition costs and development costs) are capitalized when incurred. We use an individual-film-forecast-computation method to amortize capitalized production costs and to accrue estimated liabilities for residuals and participations over the applicable title’s life cycle based upon the ratio of current period revenues to estimated remaining total gross revenues to be earned (“Ultimate Revenues”) for each title. The estimate of Ultimate Revenues impacts the timing of amortization and accrual of residuals and participations. For television programming, Ultimate Revenue estimates are initially limited to the amount of revenue contracted for each episode in the initial market and estimates of revenue from a secondary market where we can demonstrate a history of earning such revenue in that market. Television programming costs and participation costs incurred in excess of such amounts are expensed as incurred on an episode by episode basis. Estimates for additional secondary market revenues such as domestic and foreign syndication and home entertainment are included in the estimated lifetime revenues once it can be demonstrated that a program can be successfully licensed in such secondary market. For each television program, management bases these estimates on the performance in the initial markets, the existence

II-


VIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

of future firm commitments to sell and the past performance of similar television programs. Television programming costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of the secondary market are initially capitalized and amortized, and estimated liabilities for participations are accrued, based on the proportion that current period revenues bear to the estimated remaining total lifetime revenues.

For feature films, our estimate of Ultimate Revenues includes revenues from all sources that are estimated to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film’s initial theatrical release. Prior to the release of feature films, we estimate Ultimate Revenues based on the historical performance of similar content and pre-release market research (including test market screenings), as well as factors relating to the specific film, including the expected number of theaters and markets in which the original content will be released, the genre of the original content and the past box office performance of the lead actors and actresses. Upon a film’s initial release, we update our estimate of Ultimate Revenues based on actual and expected future performance. Our estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships to theatrical performance and an analysis of current market trends. For acquired film libraries, our estimate of Ultimate Revenues is for a period within 20 years from the date of acquisition.

Ultimate Revenue estimates are periodically reviewed and adjustments, if any, will result in changes to inventory amortization rates and estimated accruals for residuals and participations. An impairment charge is recorded if the fair value of a television program or feature film falls below the unamortized production costs. Film development costs that have not been set for production are expensed within

three years

unless they are abandoned earlier, in which case these projects are written down to their estimated fair value in the period the decision to abandon the project is determined.

Acquired Programming Rights

—Costs incurred in acquiring program rights, including advances, are capitalized when the license period has begun and the program is accepted and available for airing. These costs are amortized over the shorter of the license period or the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived based on the timing of our usage of and benefit from such programming. The net realizable value of acquired programming rights is regularly evaluated by us either by title or on a daypart basis, which is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or an aggregation of programs of a similar type based on the specific demographic targeted by each respective program or program service. Net realizable value is determined by estimating advertising revenues to be derived from the future airing of the programming and allocating affiliate revenue to the programming, each as applicable. An impairment charge is recorded if our estimates of future cash flows are below the carrying amount of the programming or if programming is abandoned.

The costs of programming rights licensed under multi-year sports programming agreements are capitalized if the rights payments are made before the related economic benefit has been received. These costs are expensed over the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived based on the relative value of the events broadcast by us during a period. The relative value for an event is determined based on the revenues generated for that event in relation to the estimated total revenues over the remaining term of the sports programming agreement.

The estimated economic benefit for acquired programming, including revenue projections for multi-year sports programming, are periodically reviewed. Adjustments, if any, will result in changes to amortization rates and could result in future net realizable value adjustments.

Television and feature film programming and production costs, including inventory amortization, development costs, residuals and participations and impairment charges, if any, are included within “Operating expenses” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Property and Equipment

—Property and equipment is stated at cost.  Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives as follows:

Costs associated with repairs and maintenance of property and equipment are expensed as incurred.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

—The Company assesses long-lived assets and intangible assets, other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, for impairment whenever there is an indication that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.  Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by these assets to their net carrying value. If the carrying value is not recoverable, the amount of impairment charge, if any, is measured by the difference between the net carrying value and the estimated fair value of the asset.

Investments

—Investments over which we have a significant influence, without a controlling interest, are accounted for under the equity method. Investments for which we have no significant influence are measured at fair value where a readily determinable fair value exists. Investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value are measured at cost less impairment, if any, and adjusted for observable price changes. Gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of equity investments are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Prior to the adoption of new Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) guidance in 2018, we recorded unrealized gains and losses on publicly traded equity investments in other comprehensive income. We monitor our investments for impairment and reduce the carrying value of the investment if we determine that an impairment charge is required based on qualitative and quantitative information.

Our investments are included in “Other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

—Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are at or one level below our operating segments. Intangible assets with finite lives, which primarily consist of trade names, licenses, and customer agreements are generally amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from


to


years.  Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, which consist primarily of FCC licenses in the U.S. and broadcast licenses in Australia, are not amortized but are tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below its carrying amount.  If the carrying value of goodwill or the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized

(see Note


).

Guarantees

—At the inception of a guarantee, we recognize a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed by issuing the guarantee. The related liability is subsequently reduced as utilized or extinguished and increased if there is a probable loss associated with the guarantee which exceeds the value of the recorded liability.

Treasury Stock

—Treasury stock is accounted for using the cost method. Retirements of treasury stock are reflected as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.

Fair Value Measurements

—Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The framework for measuring fair value provides a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used in measuring fair value. Level 1 is based on publicly quoted prices for the asset or liability in active markets. Level 2 is based on inputs that are observable other than quoted market prices in active markets, such as quoted prices for the asset or liability in inactive markets or quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities. Level 3 is based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions

II-

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Certain assets and liabilities, including foreign currency hedges and deferred compensation liabilities, are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Film and television production costs, goodwill, intangible assets, and equity method investments are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized. Impairment charges, if applicable, are determined using discounted cash flows, which is a Level 3 valuation technique.

Derivative Financial Instruments

—Derivative financial instruments are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of assets or liabilities, the changes in fair value of both the derivatives and the hedged items are recorded in “Other items, net”

in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivatives is recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss

”

on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and subsequently recognized in net earnings.

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

—The service cost component of net benefit cost for our pension and postretirement benefits is recorded on the same line items in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as other compensation costs of the related employees. All of the other components of net benefit cost are presented separately from the service cost component and below the subtotal of operating income in “Other items, net” or “Pension settlement charge” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Other Liabilities

—Other liabilities consist primarily of the noncurrent portion of residual liabilities of previously disposed businesses, long-term income tax liabilities, deferred compensation and other employee benefit accruals.

Revenues

Revenue is recognized when control of a good or service is transferred to a customer. Control is considered to be transferred when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits of that good or service.

Advertising Revenues

—Advertising revenues are recognized when the advertising spots are aired on television or displayed on digital platforms. Advertising spots are typically sold as part of advertising campaigns consisting of multiple commercial units. If a contract includes a guarantee to deliver a targeted audience rating or number of impressions, the delivery of the advertising spots that achieve the guarantee represents the performance obligation to be satisfied over time and revenues are recognized based on the proportion of the audience rating or impressions delivered to the total guaranteed in the contract. Audience ratings and impressions are determined based on data provided by independent third-party companies. To the extent the amounts billed exceed the amount of revenue recognized, such excess is deferred until the guaranteed audience ratings or impressions are delivered. For contracts that do not include impressions guarantees, the individual advertising spots are the performance obligation and consideration is allocated among the individual advertising spots based on relative standalone selling price.  Advertising contracts, which are generally short-term, are billed monthly, with payments due shortly after the invoice date.

Advertising revenues are generated by the

TV Entertainment

and

Cable Networks

segments.

II-


VIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Affiliate Revenues

—Affiliate revenues primarily consist of fees received from multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”) and third-party live television digital streaming offerings (“virtual MVPDs”) for carriage of our cable networks (“cable affiliate fees”) and television stations (“retransmission fees”); fees from television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network (“station affiliation fees”); and subscription fees for our digital streaming subscription offerings, including CBS All Access

,

the Showtime streaming subscription offering (“Showtime OTT”) and

BET+. Costs incurred for advertising, marketing and other services provided to us by cable, satellite and other distributors that are in exchange for a distinct service are recorded as expenses. If a distinct service is not received, such costs are recorded as a reduction to revenues.

The performance obligation for our affiliate agreements is a license to our programming provided through the continuous delivery of live linear feeds and, for agreements with MVPDs and subscribers to our digital streaming services, also includes a license to programming for video-on-demand viewing. Affiliate revenues are recognized over the term of the agreement as we satisfy our performance obligation by continuously providing our customer with the right to use our programming. For agreements that provide for a variable fee, revenues are determined each month based on an agreed upon contractual rate applied to the number of subscribers to

our customer’s service. For agreements that provide for a fixed fee, revenues are recognized based on the relative fair value of the content provided over the term of the agreement. These agreements primarily include agreements with television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network (“network affiliates”) for which fair value is determined based on the fair value of the network affiliate’s service and the value of our programming. For affiliate revenues, payments are generally due monthly.

Affiliate revenues are generated by the

TV Entertainment

and

Cable Networks

segments.

Content Licensing Revenues

—Content licensing revenues are generated from the licensing of exhibition rights for our internally-produced television and film programming to television stations, cable networks and subscription streaming services; licensing of our content for distribution on transactional video-on-demand services; the distribution of our content through DVD and Blu-ray disc sales to wholesale and retail partners; the use of our trademarks and brands for consumer products, recreation and live events; and fees from the distribution of third-party programming.

For licenses of exhibition rights for internally-produced programming, each individual episode or film delivered represents a separate performance obligation and revenues are recognized when the episode or film is made available to the licensee for exhibition and the license period has begun. For license agreements that include delivery of content on one or more dates for a fixed fee, consideration is allocated based on the relative standalone selling price of each episode or film. Estimation of standalone selling prices requires judgment, which can impact the timing of recognizing revenues. Agreements to license programming are often long term, with collection terms ranging from

one

to

five

years.

When payment is due from a customer more than one year before or after revenue is recognized, we consider the contract to contain a significant financing component and the transaction price is adjusted for the effects of the time value of money. We do not adjust the transaction price for the time value of money if payment is expected within one year of recognizing revenues.

We also license our programming to distributors of transactional video-on-demand and similar services. Under these arrangements, our performance obligation is the delivery of our content to such distributors who then license our content to the end customer. Our revenues are determined each month based on a contractual rate applied to the number of licenses to the distributors’ end customers. Similarly, revenues earned from electronic sell-through services are recognized as each program is downloaded by the end customer.

II-


VIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Revenues associated with the licensing of our brands for consumer products, recreation and live events are generally determined based on contractual royalty rates applied to sales reported by the licensees. For consumer products and recreation arrangements that include minimum guaranteed consideration, revenue is recognized as sales occur by the licensee, if the sales-based consideration is expected to exceed the minimum guarantee, or ratably if it is not expected to exceed the minimum guarantee. For live events, we recognize revenue when the event is held.

Revenues from the sales of DVDs and Blu-ray discs to wholesalers and retailers are recognized upon the later of the physical delivery to the customer or the date that any sales restrictions on the retailers are lifted.

We earn revenues from the distribution of content on behalf of third parties. We also have arrangements for the distribution or sale of our content by third parties. Under such arrangements, we determine whether revenues should be recognized based on the gross amount of consideration received from the customer or the net amount of revenue we retain after payment to the third party producer or distributor, based on an assessment of which party controls the good or service being transferred.

Content licensing revenues are generated by the

TV Entertainment

,

Cable Networks

and

Filmed Entertainment

segments.

Theatrical Revenues

—Theatrical revenue is earned from the theatrical distribution of our films during the exhibition period. Under these arrangements, revenues are recognized based on sales to the end customer. Theatrical revenues are generated by the

Filmed Entertainment

segment.

Publishing

—Publishing revenues are recognized when merchandise is shipped or electronically delivered to the consumer. Payments for publishing revenues are due shortly after shipment or electronic delivery.

Revenue Allowances

—Print books, DVDs and Blu-ray discs are generally sold with a right of return. We record a provision for sales returns and allowances at the time of sale based upon an estimate of future returns, rebates and other incentives. In determining this provision, we consider sources of qualitative and quantitative evidence including forecast sales data, customers’ rights of return, sales levels for units already shipped, historical return rates for similar products, current economic trends, the competitive environment, promotions and our sales strategies. Reserves for sales returns and allowances of

$


million

and

$


million

at

December 31, 2019 and 2018

, respectively, are recorded in “Other current liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Reserves for accounts receivable are estimated based on historical bad debt experience, the aging of accounts receivable, industry trends and economic indicators, as well as recent payment history for specific customers. Our allowance for doubtful accounts was

$


million

at both

December 31, 2019 and 2018

. The provision for doubtful accounts charged to expense was

$


million

in each of the years

2019 and 2018

, and

$


million

in


.

Noncurrent Accounts Receivables

—Included in “Other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are noncurrent accounts receivables of

$

2.11

billion

and

$

1.84

billion

at

December 31, 2019 and 2018

, respectively. Noncurrent accounts receivables primarily relate to revenues recognized under long-term television licensing arrangements. Television license fee revenues are recognized at the beginning of the license period in which programs are made available to the licensee for exhibition, while the related cash is generally collected over the term of the license period.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Contract Liabilities

—A contract liability is recorded when consideration is received from a customer prior to fully satisfying a performance obligation in a contract. Our contract liabilities primarily consist of cash received related to advertising arrangements for which the required audience rating or impressions have not been delivered; consumer products arrangements with minimum guarantees; and television licensing arrangements under which the content has not yet been made available to the customer. These contract liabilities will be recognized as revenues when control of the related product or service is transferred to the customer.

Contract liabilities are included in “Deferred revenues” and “Other liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and were

$


million

and

$


million

at

December 31, 2019

and

December 31, 2018

, respectively. The change in contract liabilities for the year ended

December 31, 2019

primarily reflects cash payments received during the period for which the performance obligation was not satisfied prior to the end of the period partially offset by

$


million

of revenues recognized that were included in deferred revenues at

December 31, 2018

. For the year ended

December 31, 2018

, we recognized revenues of

$


million

that were included in deferred revenues at

December 31, 2017

.

Unrecognized Revenues Under Contract

—As of

December 31, 2019

, unrecognized revenues attributable to unsatisfied performance obligations under our long-term contracts was

$

7.72

billion

, of which

$

4.27

billion

is expected to be recognized in


,

$

1.93

billion

in


,

$

1.04

billion

in


, and

$


million

thereafter. These amounts only include contracts subject to a guaranteed fixed amount or the guaranteed minimum under variable contracts, primarily consisting of television and film licensing contracts and affiliate arrangements that are subject to a fixed or guaranteed minimum fee. Such amounts change on a regular basis as we renew existing agreements or enter into new agreements. Unrecognized revenues under contract disclosed above do not include (i) contracts with an original expected term of one year or less, mainly consisting of our advertising contracts (ii) contracts for which variable consideration is determined based on the customer’s subsequent sale or usage, mainly consisting of affiliate agreements and (iii) long-term licensing agreements for multiple programs for which our right to invoice corresponds with the value of the programs provided to the customer.

Performance Obligations Satisfied in Previous Periods

—Under certain licensing arrangements, the amount and timing of our revenue recognition is determined based on our licensees’ subsequent sale to its end customers.  As a result, under such arrangements, which primarily include licensing of our content to distributors of transactional video-on-demand and electronic sell-through services, we often satisfy our performance obligation of delivery of our content in advance of revenue recognition. During the years ended

December 31, 2019 and 2018

, we recognized revenues of approximately

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively in our

Filmed Entertainment

segment for such performance obligations satisfied, or partially satisfied, in a prior period.

Collaborative Arrangements

—Collaborative arrangements primarily consist of joint efforts with third parties to produce and distribute programming such as television series and live sporting events, including the agreement between us and Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. to telecast the

NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Championship

(“NCAA Tournament”), which runs through 2032. In connection with this agreement for the NCAA Tournament, advertisements aired on the CBS Television Network are recorded as revenues and our share of the program rights fees and other operating costs are recorded as operating expenses.

We also enter into collaborative arrangements with other studios to jointly finance and distribute film and television programming, under which each partner is responsible for distribution of the program in specific territories or distribution windows. Under these arrangements, co-production costs are initially capitalized as programming inventory and amortized over the estimated economic life of the program. In such arrangements where we have distribution rights, all proceeds generated from such distribution are recorded as revenues and any participation profits due to third party collaborators are recorded as participation expenses.  In co-production arrangements where third party collaborators have distribution rights, our net participating profits are recorded as revenues.

Amounts attributable to transactions arising from collaborative arrangements between participants were not material to the consolidated financial statements for any period presented.

Adoption of Revenue Recognition Standard

— On January 1, 2018, we adopted FASB guidance on the recognition of revenues, which provides a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers and supersedes most existing revenue recognition guidance. The primary impact to our revenue recognition policies resulting from this standard relates to the timing of revenue recognition for the renewal of an existing licensing agreement, which under the new standard is recognized as revenue when the renewal term begins. Under previous guidance, these revenues were recognized upon the execution of such renewal. In addition, under the new standard, revenues for certain distribution arrangements are recognized based on the gross amount of consideration received from the customer, with an offsetting increase to operating expenses. Under previous accounting guidance, such revenues were recognized at the net amount retained by us after the payment of fees to the third party. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under the new standard while prior periods have not been adjusted. We applied the modified retrospective method of adoption with the cumulative effect of the initial adoption of

$


million

reflected as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of January 1, 2018.

Leases

—

We have operating leases primarily for office space, equipment, satellite transponders and studio facilities and finance leases for satellite transponders and equipment. We determine that a contract contains a lease if we obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of, and the right to direct the use of, an asset identified in the contract. For leases with terms greater than 12 months, we record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability representing the present value of future lease payments. The discount rate used to measure the lease asset and liability is determined at the beginning of the lease term using the rate implicit in the lease, if readily determinable, or our collateralized incremental borrowing rate. For those contracts that include fixed rental payments for both the use of the asset (“lease costs”) as well as for other occupancy or service costs relating to the asset (“non-lease costs”), we generally include both the lease costs and non-lease costs in the measurement of the lease asset and liability. We also own buildings and production facilities where we lease space to lessees.

Our leases have remaining terms ranging from

one

to


years and often contain renewal options to extend the lease for periods of generally up to

ten

years. For leases that contain renewal options, we include the renewal period in the lease term if it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Lease expense and income for our operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, with the exception of variable lease costs, which are expensed as incurred, and leases of assets used in the production of programming, which are capitalized in programming assets and amortized over the projected useful life of the related programming. For finance leases, amortization of the right-of-use asset is recognized in amortization expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest expense is accreted on the lease liability using the effective interest method. This results in an accelerated recognition of cost over the lease term

.

Advertising

—Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.

We incurred total advertising expenses of

$

1.70

billion

in


,

$

1.41

billion

in


and

$

1.58

billion

in


.

Interest

—Costs associated with the refinancing or issuance of debt, as well as debt discounts or premiums, are recorded as interest over the term of the related debt.  We may enter into interest rate exchange agreements; the amount to be paid or received under such agreements is accrued and recognized over the life of the agreement as an adjustment to interest expense.

Income Taxes

—The provision for income taxes includes federal, state, local, and foreign taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed.

II-


VIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

We evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are classified as noncurrent on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

For tax positions taken in a previously filed tax return or expected to be taken in a future tax return, we evaluate each position to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and the appropriate reserve to establish, if any. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, a tax reserve is established and no benefit is recognized.  A number of years may elapse before a tax return containing tax matters for which a reserve has been established is audited and finally resolved. We recognize interest and penalty charges related to the reserve for uncertain tax positions as income tax expense.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions

—Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the United States (“U.S.”) Dollar are translated into U.S. Dollars at foreign exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, while results of operations are translated at average foreign exchange rates for the respective periods.  The resulting translation gains and losses are included as a separate component of stockholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Effective July 1, 2018, Argentina has been designated as a highly inflationary economy. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency will result in remeasurement gains and losses, which are included in “Other items, net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Net Earnings (Loss) per Common Share

—Basic earnings (loss) per share (“EPS”) is based upon net earnings (loss) divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted EPS reflects the effect of the assumed exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) only in the periods in which such effect would have been dilutive.

Excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive, were


million

stock options and RSUs for each of the years ended

December 31, 2019 and 2018

and


million

stock options and RSUs for the year ended

December 31, 2017

.

The table below presents a reconciliation of weighted average shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted EPS.

Stock-based Compensation

—We measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award. The cost is recognized over the vesting period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

Leases

During the first quarter of 2019, we adopted FASB guidance on the accounting for leases, which supersedes previous lease guidance. Under this guidance, for all leases with terms in excess of one year, we recognize on our

II-


VIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

balance sheet a lease liability and a right-of-use asset representing our right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The new guidance retains a distinction between finance leases and operating leases and the classification criteria is substantially similar to previous guidance. Additionally, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee have not significantly changed. We applied the modified retrospective method of adoption and therefore, results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2019 are presented under the new guidance while prior periods have not been adjusted. This guidance did not have an impact on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. See Note


for the impact of this guidance on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and additional information.

Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

During the first quarter of 2019, we adopted FASB guidance that permits an entity to reclassify certain income tax effects of federal tax legislation enacted in December 2017 (the “Tax Reform Act”) on items within accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) to retained earnings. As a result of the Tax Reform Act, in 2017, we remeasured our deferred income tax assets and liabilities to reflect the reduction in the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The remeasurement was recognized in net earnings and as a result, the income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act on items within AOCI remained at historical rates (“stranded tax effects”). During the first quarter of 2019, as a result of the adoption of this guidance, we elected to reclassify the stranded tax effects of

$


million

relating to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations from AOCI to retained earnings. This guidance also requires entities to disclose their accounting policy for releasing stranded tax effects unrelated to the Tax Reform Act from AOCI. For pension and postretirement benefit plans, we release stranded tax effects from AOCI when the pension and postretirement plans are terminated.

Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes

In December 2019, the FASB issued guidance on the accounting for income taxes that, among other provisions, eliminates certain exceptions to existing guidance related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. This guidance also requires an entity to reflect the effect of an enacted change in tax laws or rates in its effective income tax rate in the first interim period that includes the enactment date of the new legislation, aligning the timing of recognition of the effects from enacted tax law changes on the effective income tax rate with the effects on deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Under existing guidance, an entity recognizes the effects of the enacted tax law change on the effective income tax rate in the period that includes the effective date of the tax law. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance, which is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted.

Improvements to Accounting for Costs of Films and License Agreements for Program Materials

In March 2019, the FASB issued guidance on the accounting for costs of films and episodic television series, which aligns the accounting for capitalizing production costs of episodic television series with the guidance for films. As a result, the capitalization of costs incurred to produce episodic television series will no longer be limited to the amount of revenue contracted in the initial market until persuasive evidence of a secondary market exists. In addition, this guidance requires an entity to test for impairment of films or television series on a title-by-title basis or together with other films and series as part of a group, based on the predominant monetization strategy of the film or series. Further, this guidance requires that an entity reassess estimates of the use of a film or series in a film group and account for changes, if any, prospectively. In addition, this guidance eliminates existing balance sheet classification guidance and adds new disclosure requirements relating to costs for acquired and produced television series. We are currently

II-


VIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

evaluating the impact of this guidance, which is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019.

Collaborative Arrangements: Clarifying the Interaction with the New Revenue Standard

In November 2018, the FASB issued guidance to clarify that certain transactions between parties to collaborative arrangements should be accounted for in accordance with FASB revenue guidance when the counterparty is a customer. This guidance also prohibits the presentation of collaborative arrangements as revenues from contracts with customers if the counterparty is not a customer. This guidance, which is required to be applied retrospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that is a Service Contract

In August 2018, the FASB issued guidance on the accounting for implementation costs of a cloud computing arrangement that is considered to be a service contract. This guidance requires companies to follow the guidance for capitalizing costs associated with internal-use software to determine which costs to capitalize in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract. The guidance also specifies the financial statement presentation for capitalized implementation costs and the related amortization, as well as required financial statement disclosures. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance, which is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019.

Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans

In August 2018, the FASB issued amended guidance that eliminates, adds and clarifies certain disclosure requirements for defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance, which is required to be applied retrospectively and is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2020.

Financial Instruments

In June 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance on the accounting for credit losses on financial instruments.  Among other provisions, this guidance introduces a new impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. For trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and other instruments, entities will be required to use a forward-looking “expected loss” model that will replace the current “incurred loss” model that will generally result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Goodwill and Intangible Assets Impairment Test

We perform a fair value-based impairment test of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, comprised primarily of television FCC licenses in the U.S. and broadcast licenses in Australia, on an annual basis, and also between annual tests if an event occurs or if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value.

II-


VIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

FCC licenses are tested for impairment at the geographic market level. We consider each geographic market, which is comprised of all of our television stations within that geographic market, to be a single unit of accounting because the FCC licenses at this level represent their highest and best use. At December 31,


, we had


television markets with FCC license book values. For broadcast licenses in Australia, we consider all of our licenses within the country to be a single unit of accounting because this represents their highest and best use.

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is an operating segment, or one level below. At December 31,


, we had

six

reporting units with goodwill balances, which were determined based on the post-Merger reporting structure.

For our annual impairment test, we perform qualitative assessments for the reporting units, U.S. television markets with FCC licenses, and Australian broadcast licenses that management estimates have fair values that significantly exceed their respective carrying values. In making this determination, we also consider the duration of time since a quantitative test was performed. For the


annual impairment test, we performed qualitative assessments for all of our U.S. television markets and all of our

reporting units. As of the date of our annual impairment tests, which were performed prior to the Merger, we had

ten

reporting units. For each reporting unit, we weighed the relative impact of factors that are specific to the reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors. For each television market, we weighed the relative impact of market-specific and macroeconomic factors. Based on the qualitative assessments, considering the aggregation of the relevant factors, we concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of these reporting units and the fair value of FCC licenses within each market are less than their respective carrying values. Therefore, performing the quantitative impairment test was unnecessary.

As of the closing date of the Merger on December 4, 2019, we performed qualitative assessments on the pre-Merger reporting units that were to be combined as a result of the new reporting structure, as well as the post-Merger reporting units that resulted from this combination. Based on these assessments, we concluded that there were no changes to the conclusions reached in our annual impairment test.

A quantitative impairment test of broadcast licenses calculates an estimated fair value using the Greenfield Discounted Cash Flow Method, which values a hypothetical start-up station in the relevant market by adding discounted cash flows over a five-year build-up period to a residual value. The assumptions for the build-up period include industry projections of overall market revenues; the start-up station’s operating costs and capital expenditures, which are based on both industry and internal data; and average market share. The discount rate is determined based on the industry and market-based risk of achieving the projected cash flows, and the residual value is calculated using a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and industry projections.

For


, we performed a quantitative impairment test for our Australian broadcast licenses. The discount rate and perpetual nominal growth rate were


%

and

0.5

%

, respectively. The impairment test indicated that the estimated fair value of the broadcast licenses was lower than the carrying value, which was the result of a sustained decline in the advertising marketplace in Australia. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge during the fourth quarter of 2019 of

$


million

, which is included within “Depreciation and amortization” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, and recorded in our

Cable Networks

segment.

junior subordinated debentures due February


accrue interest at the stated fixed rates until

February 28, 2022

senior notes due October


, collectively the “Senior Notes”, will be subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody’s Investor Services, Inc. or S&P Global Ratings downgrades (or downgrades and subsequently upgrades) the credit rating assigned to the Senior Notes. The interest rate on these Senior Notes would increase by

0.25

%

upon each credit agency downgrade up to a maximum of

Some of our outstanding notes and debentures provide for certain covenant packages typical for an investment grade company. There is an acceleration trigger for the majority of the notes and debentures in the event of a change in control under specified circumstances coupled with ratings downgrades due to the change in control, as well as certain optional redemption provisions for our junior debentures.

At

Credit Facility

At

December 31, 2019

, we had a

$

2.50

billion

revolving credit facility held by CBS prior to the Merger (the “CBS Credit Facility”) with a maturity in June 2021 and a

$

2.50

billion

revolving credit facility held by Viacom prior to the Merger (the “Viacom Credit Facility”), with a maturity in February 2024. At

December 31, 2019

, we had no borrowings outstanding under the CBS Credit Facility or the Viacom Credit Facility and the remaining availability, net of outstanding letters of credit, was

$

2.50

billion

for each facility.

In January 2020, the CBS Credit Facility was terminated and the Viacom Credit Facility was amended and restated to a

$

3.50

billion

revolving credit facility with a maturity in January 2025 (the “Credit Facility”). The credit facility is used for general corporate purposes and to support commercial paper outstanding, if any. We may, at our option, also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the Credit Facility. Borrowing rates under the Credit Facility are determined at our option at the time of each borrowing and are based generally on the prime rate in the U.S. or LIBOR plus a margin based on our senior unsecured debt rating. The Credit Facility requires our Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio to be less than

4.5x

(which we may elect to increase to

5.0x

for up to four consecutive quarters following a qualified acquisition) at the end of each quarter, to be applied retrospectively from December 31, 2019. The Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio reflects the ratio of our Consolidated Indebtedness at the end of a quarter, to our Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the amended credit agreement) for the trailing twelve-month period. We met the covenant as of December 31, 2019.

LEASES

On

January 1, 2019

, we adopted FASB guidance on the accounting for leases. We applied the modified retrospective method of adoption and therefore, results for reporting periods beginning after

January 1, 2019

are presented under the new guidance while prior periods have not been adjusted.

The adoption of this guidance resulted in the recognition on the Consolidated Balance Sheet of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities representing the present value of future lease payments of all leases with terms in excess of one year.

At

December 31, 2019

, the following amounts were recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet relating to our leases.

II-


VIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

For existing leases at the time of adoption, we elected to not reassess (i) whether each contract is or contains a lease, (ii) the classification of leases as operating or finance leases, and (iii) initial direct costs for existing leases.

Lessee Contracts

We have operating leases primarily for office space, equipment, satellite transponders and studio facilities. We also have finance leases for satellite transponders and equipment. Lease costs are generally fixed, with certain contracts containing variable payments for non-lease costs based on usage and escalations in the lessors’ annual costs.

The following table presents our lease cost.

(a) Includes fixed lease costs and non-lease costs (consisting of other occupancy and service costs relating to the use of an asset) associated with long-term operating leases.

(b) Includes costs capitalized in programming assets during the period for leased assets used in the production of programming.

(c) Short-term leases have a term of 12 months or less and exclude month-to-month leases. Short-term leases are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

(d) Primarily includes non-lease costs (consisting of other occupancy and service costs relating to the use of an asset) and costs for equipment leases that vary based on usage.

The following table presents supplemental cash flow information related to our leases.

Lessor Contracts

We enter into operating leases for the use of our owned production facilities and office buildings. Lease payments received under these agreements consist of fixed payments for the rental of space and certain building operating costs, as well as variable payments based on usage of production facilities and services, and escalating costs of building operations. We recorded total lease income of

$

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The carrying value of financial instruments approximates fair value, except for notes and debentures, which are not recorded at fair value.  At

December 31, 2019 and 2018

, the carrying value of our notes and debentures was

$

17.98

billion

and

$

18.37

billion

, respectively, and the fair value, which is determined based on quoted prices in active markets (Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy) was

$

20.6

billion

and

$

18.4

billion

, respectively.

We use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to market risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  We do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, we do not hold or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.

Foreign Exchange Contracts

Foreign exchange forward contracts have principally been used to hedge projected cash flows, in currencies such as the British Pound, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, generally for periods up to


months. We designate foreign exchange forward contracts used to hedge committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions as cash flow hedges.  Gains or losses on the effective portion of designated cash flow hedges are initially recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to the statement of operations when the hedged item is recognized. Additionally, we enter into non-designated forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows.

At

December 31, 2019 and 2018

, the notional amount of all foreign currency contracts was

$

1.44

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

We continually monitor our position with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to our financial instruments. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.

Our receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at

December 31, 2019 and 2018

, due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which our products and services are sold.


)

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The following tables set forth our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at

December 31, 2019 and 2018

. These assets and liabilities have been categorized according to the three-level fair value hierarchy established by the FASB, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. Level 1 is based on publicly quoted prices for the asset or liability in active markets. Level 2 is based on inputs that are observable other than quoted market prices in active markets, such as quoted prices for the asset or liability in inactive markets or quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities. Level 3 is based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

The fair value of marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices in active markets. The fair value of foreign currency hedges is determined based on the present value of future cash flows using observable inputs including foreign currency exchange rates. The fair value of deferred compensation liabilities is determined based on the fair value of the investments elected by employees.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

We have equity incentive plans (the “Plans”) under which stock options and RSUs are issued. The purpose of the Plans is to benefit and advance the interests of our company by attracting, retaining and motivating participants and to compensate participants for their contributions to the financial success of our company. The Plans provide for awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted and unrestricted shares, RSUs, dividend equivalents, performance awards and other equity-related awards. Upon exercise of stock options or vesting of RSUs, we issue new shares from our existing authorization. At

December 31, 2019

, there were


million

shares available for future grant under the Plans. Prior to the Merger, stock-based compensation awards were also granted under Viacom’s equity incentive plans. Upon exercise of stock options or vesting of RSUs under Viacom’s equity incentive plans, shares were either issued from Viacom’s existing authorization or from treasury stock.

At the Effective Time, each RSU for Viacom Class B common stock was converted into

0.59625

RSUs for ViacomCBS Class B Common Stock and each outstanding stock option for Viacom Class B common stock was converted into

0.59625

options for ViacomCBS Class B common stock. The exercise price of stock options was

RSUs and PSUs

Compensation expense for RSUs is determined based upon the market price of the shares underlying the awards on the date of grant and expensed over the vesting period, which is generally a

one

- to

four

-year service period. Certain RSU awards are also subject to satisfying internal performance conditions. Compensation expense is recorded based on the probable outcome of the internal performance conditions. Forfeitures for RSUs are estimated on the date of grant based on historical forfeiture rates. We adjust the compensation expense based on actual forfeitures and on an annual basis we revise the forfeiture rate as necessary. RSUs accrue dividends each time we declare a quarterly cash dividend, which are paid upon vesting when the shares are delivered and are forfeited if the award does not vest.

The weighted average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was

$

41.71

,

$

53.90

$

64.26

in

which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of

3.0

years

.

During

2018 and 2017

, we also granted PSU awards. The number of shares to be issued upon vesting of the PSUs was based on the stock price performance of CBS Class B Common Stock or the total shareholder return of Viacom Class B Common Stock measured against the companies comprising the S&P 500 Index, as applicable, over a designated measurement period, as well as the achievement of established operating goals. The fair value of PSU awards is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Compensation expense for PSUs is expensed over the required employee service period. The fair value of the PSU awards granted during the years ended

December 31, 2018 and 2017

was

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively. There were no PSU awards granted in

The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions in effect for Viacom at the time of grant:

The expected stock price volatility for stock options for CBS Class B Common Stock was determined using a weighted average of historical volatility for CBS Class B Common Stock and implied volatility of publicly traded options to purchase CBS Class B Common Stock. The expected stock price volatility for stock options for Viacom Class B Common Stock was principally determined based on the implied volatility of publicly traded options to purchase Viacom Class B Common Stock. Given the existence of an actively traded market for CBS and Viacom options prior to the closing of the Merger, we were able to derive implied volatility using publicly traded options that were trading near the grant date of the employee stock options at a similar exercise price and a remaining term of greater than

one

year.

The risk-free interest rate is based on a U.S. Treasury rate in effect on the date of grant with a term equal to the expected term. The expected term is determined based on historical employee exercise and post-vesting termination

In December 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Reform Act which contained significant changes to U.S. federal tax law, including a reduction in the federal corporate tax rate from

35%

to

21%

and a one-time transition tax on cumulative foreign earnings and profits. For the year ended

December 31, 2017

, we recorded a net provisional charge of

$


million

, reflecting the estimated transition tax of

$


million

on cumulative foreign earnings and profits, offset by an estimated benefit of

$


million

to adjust our deferred income tax balances as a result of the reduced corporate income tax rate. During 2018, we completed our analysis of these provisional amounts and recorded a charge of

$


million

to adjust the provisional amount of transition tax on cumulative foreign earnings and profits. In January


, the U.S. government issued guidance relating to the transition tax, which resulted in a decrease of

$


million

to our reserve for uncertain tax positions during


for amounts paid as a result of this guidance; however, it did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Tax Reform Act includes a deduction for foreign derived intangible income and a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”), which imposes a U.S. tax on certain income earned by our foreign subsidiaries. We elected to treat the tax on GILTI as a period cost when incurred and therefore, the tax on GILTI is included in our tax provision for the years ended

Generally, the future remittance of foreign undistributed earnings will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes under the provisions of the Tax Reform Act and as a result, for substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries, we do not intend to assert indefinite reinvestment of both cash held outside of the U.S. and future cash earnings. However, a future repatriation of cash could be subject to state and local income taxes, foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes. Accordingly, we recorded deferred income tax liabilities associated with future repatriations, which were not material to the consolidated financial statements. Additional income taxes have not been provided for outside basis differences inherent in these entities, which could be recognized upon sale or other transaction, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely invested in foreign operations. The determination of the U.S. federal deferred income tax liability for such outside basis difference is not practicable.

The following table sets forth the change in the reserve for uncertain tax positions, excluding related accrued interest and penalties.

The reserve for uncertain tax positions of

$

at

December 31, 2019

includes

which would affect our effective income tax rate, including discontinued operations, if and when recognized in future years.

We recognize interest and penalty charges related to the reserve for uncertain tax positions as income tax expense. We recognized interest and penalties of

December 31, 2019 and 2018

and

$

ViacomCBS and its subsidiaries file income tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and various state and international jurisdictions. For periods prior to the Merger, Viacom and CBS filed separate tax returns. For CBS, the U.S. federal statute of limitations for the 2015 tax year expired in September 2019. During the third quarter of 2019, CBS and the IRS settled the income tax audit for the year 2016, which did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. The IRS commenced its examination of the 2017 tax year during the fourth quarter of 2019 and commenced its examination of the 2018 tax year in February 2020. For Viacom, the IRS began its examination of the 2014 and 2015 tax years in April 2017. Various tax years are also currently under examination by state and local and foreign tax authorities. With respect to open tax years in all jurisdictions, we currently believe that it is reasonably possible that the reserve for uncertain tax positions may decrease by

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

ViacomCBS and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans, principally non-contributory, covering eligible employees. Our pension plans consist of both funded and unfunded plans. The majority of participants in these plans are retired employees or former employees of previously divested businesses. Most of our pension plans are closed to new entrants and pension plans sponsored by Viacom prior to the Merger are frozen to future benefit accruals. The benefits for some plans are based primarily on an employee’s years of service and average pay near retirement. Benefits under other plans are based primarily on an employee’s pay for each year that the employee participated in the plan. Participating employees are vested in the plans after

five years

of service. We fund our pension plans in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), the Pension Protection Act of 2006, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and other applicable rules and regulations. Plan assets consist principally of corporate bonds, equity securities, common collective trust funds and U.S. government securities. At

December 31, 2019

, ViacomCBS Common Stock represented approximately

2.1

%

of the fair value of plan assets. At

December 31, 2018

,

2.4

%

of the fair value of plan assets was invested in CBS Common Stock or Viacom Common Stock.

During


, we purchased a group annuity contract under which an insurance company permanently assumed our obligation to pay and administer pension benefits to certain pension plan participants, or their designated beneficiaries, who had been receiving pension benefits. The purchase of this group annuity contract was funded with pension plan assets. As a result, our outstanding pension benefit obligation was reduced by approximately

$


million

. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a settlement charge of

$


million

in


, reflecting the accelerated recognition of a portion of unamortized actuarial losses in the plan. Additionally, during


, we made discretionary contributions totaling

$


million

to prefund our qualified pension plans.

In addition, ViacomCBS sponsors health and welfare plans that provide postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retired employees and their covered dependents. Eligibility is based in part on certain age and service requirements at the time of their retirement. Most of the plans are contributory and contain cost-sharing features such as deductibles and coinsurance which are adjusted annually, as well as caps on the annual dollar amount we will contribute toward the cost of coverage. Claims and premiums for which we are responsible are paid with our own funds.

The pension plan disclosures herein include information related to our domestic plans only, unless otherwise noted. At

December 31, 2019 and 2018

, the Consolidated Balance Sheets include a liability of

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively, in “Pension and postretirement benefit obligations” relating to our non-U.S. pension plans.

We use a December 31 measurement date for all pension and other postretirement benefit plans.

The discount rates are determined primarily based on the yield of a portfolio of high quality bonds, providing cash flows necessary to meet the pension plans’ expected future benefit payments, as determined for the projected benefit obligations. The expected return on plan assets assumption is derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets.

The following additional assumptions were used in accounting for postretirement benefits.

Plan Assets

Prior to the Merger, the investments committees of Viacom and CBS determined the strategies for the investment of pension plan assets. These committees established target asset allocations for our pension plan trusts based upon an analysis of the timing and amount of projected benefit payments, projected company contributions, the expected returns and risk of the asset classes and the correlation of those returns. The target asset allocation for CBS’s domestic pension plans is to invest between

in long duration fixed income investments,

in equity securities and the remainder in cash and other investments. At

December 31, 2019

, this trust was invested approximately


%

in long duration fixed income securities,


%

in equity investments, and the remainder in cash, cash equivalents and other investments. Long duration fixed income investments consist of a diversified portfolio of fixed income instruments that are substantially investment grade, with a duration that approximates the duration of the liabilities covered by the trust. All equity portfolios are diversified between U.S. and non-U.S. equities and include large and small capitalization equities. The asset allocations are reviewed regularly.

The target asset allocation for Viacom’s domestic pension plans is to invest

in return-seeking investments,

The following tables set forth our pension plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis at

December 31, 2019 and 2018

. These assets have been categorized according to the three-level fair value hierarchy established by the FASB which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. Level 1 is based on quoted prices for the asset in active markets. Level 2 is based on inputs that are observable other than quoted market prices in active markets, such as quoted prices for the asset in inactive markets or quoted prices for similar assets. Level 3 is based on unobservable inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset.

II-


VIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

(a)  Assets categorized as Level 2 reflect investments in money market funds.

(b)  Securities of diverse sectors and industries, substantially all investment grade.

(c)  In accordance with FASB guidance investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.

(d)  Underlying investments consist mainly of U.S. large capitalization and international equity securities.

Money market investments are carried at amortized cost which approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of these investments. Investments in equity securities are reported at fair value based on quoted market prices on national security exchanges. The fair value of investments in common collective funds and mutual funds are determined using the net asset value (“NAV”) provided by the administrator of the fund as a practical expedient. The NAV is determined by each fund’s trustee based upon the fair value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, less liabilities, divided by the number of outstanding units. The fair value of U.S. treasury securities is determined based on quoted market prices in active markets. The fair value of government related securities and corporate bonds is determined based on quoted market prices on national security exchanges, when available, or using valuation models which incorporate certain other observable inputs including recent trading activity for comparable securities and broker quoted prices. The fair value of mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities is based upon valuation models which incorporate available dealer quotes, projected cash flows and market information. The fair value of limited partnerships has been estimated using the NAV of the ownership interest. The NAV is determined using quarterly financial statements issued by the partnership which determine the value based on the fair value of the underlying investments.

Future Benefit Payments

Estimated future benefit payments are as follows:

In


, we expect to make contributions of approximately

$


million

to our non-qualified pension plans to satisfy the benefit payments due under these plans. Also in


, we expect to contribute approximately

$


million

to our other postretirement benefit plans to satisfy our portion of benefit payments due under these plans.

Multiemployer Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans

We contribute to a number of multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover our union-represented employees including talent, writers, directors, producers and other employees, primarily in the entertainment industry. The other employers participating in these multiemployer plans are primarily in the entertainment and other related industries. The risks of participating in multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans as assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers and if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. In addition, if we choose to stop participating in some of its multiemployer plans we may be required to pay those plans a withdrawal liability based on the underfunded status of the plan.

The financial health of a multiemployer plan is indicated by the zone status, as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. Plans in the red zone are in critical status; those in the yellow zone are in endangered status; and those in the green zone are neither critical nor endangered.

The table below presents information concerning our participation in multiemployer defined benefit pension plans.

(a) The Zone status for each individual plan listed was certified by each plan’s actuary as of the beginning of the plan years for


and


. The plan year is the twelve months ending December 31 for each plan listed above except AFTRA Retirement Plan which has a plan year ending November 30.

(b) The Company was listed in AFTRA Retirement Plan’s Form 5500 as providing more than 5% of total contributions for the plan year ended November 30, 2018.

(c) The expiration dates range from

June 30, 2020

through

June 30, 2021

(f) The Company was listed in I.A.T.S.E. Local No. 33 Pension Trust Fund’s Form 5500 as providing more than 5% of total contributions for the plan year ended December 31, 2018.

As a result of the above noted zone status there were no funding improvements or rehabilitation plans implemented, as defined by ERISA, nor any surcharges imposed for any of the individual plans listed.

We also contribute to multiemployer plans that provide postretirement healthcare and other benefits to certain employees under collective bargaining agreements. The contributions to these plans were

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Revenues generated between segments primarily reflect advertising and content licensing sales. These transactions are recorded at market value as if the sales were to third parties and are eliminated in consolidation.

We present operating income (loss) excluding depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, costs for restructuring and other corporate matters, programming charges and gain on sale of assets, each where applicable (“Adjusted OIBDA”), as the primary measure of profit and loss for our operating segments in accordance with FASB guidance for segment reporting. We began presenting Adjusted OIBDA as our segment profit measure in the fourth quarter of 2019 in order to align with the primary method used by our management beginning after the Merger to evaluate segment performance and to make decisions regarding the allocation of resources to our segments. We believe the presentation of Adjusted OIBDA is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view segment performance in a manner similar to the primary method used by our management and enhances their ability to understand our operating performance. Stock-based compensation is excluded from our segment measure of profit and loss because it is set and approved by our Board of Directors in consultation with corporate executive management.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

On November 16, 2017, we completed the split-off of CBS Radio through an exchange offer, in which we accepted

17.9

million

shares of CBS Class B Common Stock from CBS stockholders in exchange for the

101.4

million

shares of CBS Radio common stock that we owned. Immediately following the exchange offer, each share of CBS Radio common stock was converted into one share of Entercom Communications Corp. (“Entercom”) Class A common stock upon completion of the merger of CBS Radio and Entercom. CBS Radio has been presented as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.

The following table sets forth details of net earnings (loss) from discontinued operations for the year ended

(a) During 2017, prior to the split-off, CBS Radio was measured each reporting period at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. The value of the transaction with Entercom was determined based on Entercom’s stock price at the closing of the transaction and therefore, we recorded a market value adjustment of

$


million

in 2017 to adjust the carrying value of CBS Radio to the value indicated by the stock valuation of Entercom.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Commitments

Our commitments not recorded on the balance sheet primarily consist of programming and talent commitments and purchase obligations for goods and services resulting from our normal course of business.

Our programming and talent commitments, estimated to aggregate

$

10.36

billion

as of

December 31, 2019

, include

$

5.39

billion

for sports programming rights,

$

3.80

relating to the production and licensing of television and film programming, and

$

billion

for talent contracts.  We also have committed purchase obligations which include agreements to purchase goods or services in the future that totaled

$

1.52

billion

as of

December 31, 2019

.

Other long-term contractual obligations recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet include program liabilities, participations due to producers, residuals, and a tax liability resulting from the enactment of the Tax Reform Act in December 2017. This tax liability reflects the remaining tax on the Company’s historical accumulated foreign earnings and profits, which is payable to the IRS in 2024 and 2025.

At

December 31, 2019

, commitments for programming and talent and purchase obligations not recorded on the balance sheet, and other long-term contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet were payable as follows:

We also have long-term operating and finance lease commitments for office space, equipment, transponders and studio facilities, which are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at

Guarantees

Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds.

We have indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business. At

December 31, 2019

, the outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds approximated

Lease Guarantees.

We have certain indemnification obligations with respect to leases primarily associated with the previously discontinued operations of Famous Players Inc. (“Famous Players”). These lease commitments amounted to

$


million

as of

December 31, 2019

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

individual underlying leases, or the related indemnification obligation, and foreign exchange rates, among other things. We may also have exposure for certain other expenses related to the leases, such as property taxes and common area maintenance. We believe our accrual is sufficient to meet any future obligations based on our consideration of available financial information, the lessees’ historical performance in meeting their lease obligations and the underlying economic factors impacting the lessees’ business models.

In the course of our business, we both provide and receive indemnities which are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, we may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification obligation. We record a liability for our indemnification obligations and other contingent liabilities when probable and reasonably estimable.

Legal Matters

General.

On an ongoing basis, we vigorously defend ourselves in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and respond to various investigations and inquiries from federal, state, local and international authorities (collectively, “litigation’’). Litigation may be brought against us without merit, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on our understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, we believe that the below-described legal matters and other litigation to which we are a party are not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Litigation Relating to the Merger.

On September 27, 2019, Bucks County Employees Retirement Fund (the “Bucks County Fund”), a purported holder of CBS Class B Common Stock, served us with a demand for inspection of books and records pursuant to 8 Del. C. § 220 in connection with the Merger (the “Demand”). On October 10, 2019, we offered to produce certain categories of documents properly within the scope of a books and records demand under § 220. The Bucks County Fund rejected our offer and filed litigation in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware on October 15, 2019, seeking to compel production of all documents requested in the Demand (the “Section 220 Complaint”). A trial on the Section 220 Complaint took place on November 22, 2019, and the Court ordered limited additional production on November 25, 2019. On December 2, 2019, we certified that we had completed production of all relevant documents. On February 20, 2020, the Bucks County Fund filed a putative derivative and class action complaint in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against Shari Redstone, NAI, Sumner M. Redstone National Amusements Trust (“SMR Trust”), the CBS board of directors (comprised of Candace K. Beinecke, Barbara M. Byrne, Gary L. Countryman, Brian Goldner, Linda M. Griego, Robert N. Klieger, Martha L. Minow, Susan Schuman, Frederick O. Terrell and Strauss Zelnick), former CBS President and Acting Chief Executive Officer Joseph Ianniello and ViacomCBS Inc. The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties to CBS stockholders and waste in connection with the negotiation and approval of the Merger Agreement. The complaint seeks unspecified damages, costs and expenses as well as other relief. We believe that the claims are without merit and we intend to defend against them vigorously. We are currently unable to determine a range of potential liability, if any. Accordingly, no accrual for this matter has been made in our consolidated financial statements.

On January 23, 2020, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware consolidated

four

putative class action suits filed by purported Viacom stockholders against NAI, NAI Entertainment Holdings LLC, Shari E. Redstone, the members of the Viacom special transaction committee of the Viacom board of directors (comprised of Thomas J. May, Judith A. McHale, Ronald L. Nelson and Nicole Seligman) and our President and Chief Executive Officer and director, Robert M. Bakish, in

In re Viacom Inc. Stockholders Litigation

. The four actions allege breaches of fiduciary duties to Viacom stockholders in connection with the negotiation and approval of the Merger Agreement, and seek unspecified damages, costs and expenses. On February 6, 2020, the Court appointed the California Public Employees’ Retirement System as the lead plaintiff in the consolidated action. We believe that the claims are without merit and we intend to

II-

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

defend against them vigorously. We are currently unable to determine a range of potential liability, if any. Accordingly, no accrual for this matter has been made in our consolidated financial statements.

Investigation-Related Matters

. As announced on August 1, 2018, the CBS Board of Directors (the “CBS Board”) retained two law firms to conduct a full investigation of the allegations in press reports about CBS’ former Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, Leslie Moonves, CBS News and cultural issues at CBS. On December 17, 2018, the CBS Board announced the completion of its investigation, certain findings of the investigation and the CBS Board’s determination, discussed below, with respect to the termination of Mr. Moonves’ employment. We have received subpoenas from the New York County District Attorney’s Office and the New York City Commission on Human Rights regarding the subject matter of this investigation and related matters. The New York State Attorney General’s Office and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission have also requested information about these matters, including with respect to CBS’ related public disclosures. We may continue to receive additional related regulatory and investigative inquiries from these and other entities in the future. We are cooperating with these inquiries.

On August 27, 2018 and on October 1, 2018, each of Gene Samit and John Lantz, respectively, filed putative class action suits in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, individually and on behalf of others similarly situated, for claims that are similar to those alleged in the amended complaint described below. On November 6, 2018, the Court entered an order consolidating the two actions. On November 30, 2018, the Court appointed Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern California as the lead plaintiff of the consolidated action. On February 11, 2019, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended putative class action complaint against CBS, certain current and former senior executives and members of the CBS Board. The consolidated action is stated to be on behalf of purchasers of CBS Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock between September 26, 2016 and December 4, 2018. This action seeks to recover damages arising during this time period allegedly caused by the defendants’ purported violations of the federal securities laws, including by allegedly making materially false and misleading statements or failing to disclose material information, and seeks costs and expenses as well as remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. On April 12, 2019, the defendants filed motions to dismiss this action, which the Court granted in part and denied in part on January 15, 2020. With the exception of one statement made by Mr. Moonves at an industry event in November 2017, in which he allegedly was acting as the agent of CBS, all claims as to all other allegedly false and misleading statements were dismissed. We believe that the remaining claims are without merit and we intend to defend against them vigorously. We are currently unable to determine a range of potential liability, if any. Accordingly, no accrual for this matter has been made in our consolidated financial statements.

Separation Agreement

. On September 9, 2018, CBS entered into a separation and settlement agreement and releases (the “Separation Agreement”) with Mr. Moonves, pursuant to which Mr. Moonves resigned as a director and as Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of CBS. In October 2018, we contributed

$


million

to a grantor trust pursuant to the Separation Agreement. On December 17, 2018, the CBS Board announced that, following its consideration of the findings of the investigation referred to above, it had determined that there were grounds to terminate Mr. Moonves’ employment for cause under his employment agreement with CBS. Any dispute related to the CBS Board’s determination is subject to binding arbitration as set forth in the Separation Agreement. On January 16, 2019, Mr. Moonves commenced a binding arbitration proceeding with respect to this matter and the related CBS Board investigation, which proceeding is ongoing. The assets of the grantor trust will remain in the trust until a final determination in the arbitration. We are currently unable to determine the outcome of the arbitration and the amount, if any, that may be awarded thereunder and, accordingly, no accrual for this matter has been made in our consolidated financial statements.

Claims Related to Former Businesses: Asbestos.

We are a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

nor a manufacturer of asbestos. We are typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of our products is the basis of a claim. Claims against us in which a product has been identified most commonly relate to allegations of exposure to asbestos-containing insulating material used in conjunction with turbines and electrical equipment.

Claims are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. We do not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets that some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of

December 31, 2019

, we had pending approximately

30,950

asbestos claims, as compared with approximately

31,570

as of

December 31, 2018

and

31,660

as of

December 31, 2017

. During


, we received approximately

3,460

new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately

4,080

claims. We report claims as closed when we become aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when we have reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claims, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. Our total costs for the years


and


for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax were approximately

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively. Our costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year and insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses.

Filings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure; other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos-related disease. The predominant number of pending claims against us are non-cancer claims. It is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may impact the estimate of our asbestos liabilities, including, among others, the number and types of claims and average cost to resolve such claims. We record an accrual for a loss contingency when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We believe that our accrual and insurance are adequate to cover our asbestos liabilities. Our liability estimate is based upon many factors, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims, as well as consultation with a third party firm on trends that may impact our future asbestos liability.

Other.

From time to time we receive claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that we are or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to our historical and predecessor operations. In addition, from time to time we receive personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from our historical operations and predecessors.
