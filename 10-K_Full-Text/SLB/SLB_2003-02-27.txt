PART I

Item 1

Business

All references herein to “Registrant”, “Company” and “Schlumberger” refer to Schlumberger Limited and its consolidated subsidiaries. The following discussion of results should be read in conjunction with
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Founded in 1927,
Schlumberger Limited is a global technology services company consisting of three business segments: first, Schlumberger Oilfield Services, one of the leading providers of technology services and solutions to the international petroleum industry;
second, SchlumbergerSema, an IT services company providing consulting and systems integration services, and network and infrastructure solutions, primarily to the global energy sector, including oil and gas, and other regional markets spanning the
telecommunications, finance and public sectors and third, the Other business segment which principally comprises the Cards, Terminals, Meters North America and NPTest activities. With approximately 78,500 employees and operations in over 100
countries, Schlumberger has principal executive offices in Paris, New York and The Hague. The following summary describes the services and products for each business segment.

Schlumberger Oilfield Services

is one of the leading providers of technology services and solutions to the
international petroleum industry.

With 48,000 employees,
Schlumberger Oilfield Services manages its business through 27 Oilfield Services GeoMarket* regions, which are grouped into four geographic areas: North America; Latin America; Europe, CIS and West Africa; and the Middle East & Asia. The
GeoMarket regions offer customers a single point of contact at the local level for field operations and bring together geographically focused teams to meet local needs and deliver customized solutions.

Schlumberger invented wireline logging in 1927 as a technique for obtaining
downhole data in oil and gas wells. Today, Schlumberger Oilfield Services operates in each of the major oilfield service markets covering the entire life cycle of the reservoir. These services are organized into seven technology segments, in which
Schlumberger holds a number of market leading positions, to capitalize on technical synergies and introduce innovative solutions within the GeoMarket regions.

n

Wireline – services that provide the information necessary to evaluate the reservoir, plan and monitor well construction, and monitor and evaluate production,
divided into open-hole and cased-hole wireline logging.

n

Drilling & Measurements – directional drilling, measurement-while-drilling and logging-while-drilling services.

n

Well Services – services to construct oil and gas wells, as well as maintain optimal production through the life of an oil and gas field. These include pressure
pumping, well stimulation services, coiled tubing, cementing and engineering services.

n

Well Completions & Productivity – services for testing, completing and producing oil and gas wells ranging from well testing and perforating services,
completions systems, intelligent completions to a full spectrum of artificial lift services.

n

Integrated Project Management – consulting, project management and engineering services leveraging the expertise from the other technology segments for the
E&P industry.

n

Schlumberger Information Solutions – integrated business solutions comprising GeoQuest software, information management services, information technology and a
complete range of expert services.

n

WesternGeco Joint Venture (70% Schlumberger, 30% Baker Hughes) – land and marine seismic acquisition and processing.

The technology segments are also responsible for overseeing operational
processes, resource allocation, personnel and quality, health, safety and environmental matters in the GeoMarket.

Supporting the service technology segments are 13 technology centers and five research centers. Through its research and product development, Schlumberger
is committed to advanced technology programs that



will enhance oilfield efficiency, lower finding and producing costs, improve productivity, maximize
reserve recovery, increase asset value and accomplish all of these goals in a safe, environmentally sound manner.

In addition, Schlumberger is a minority owner in M-I Drilling Fluids, a joint venture with Smith International that offers drilling and completion fluids
utilized to stabilize rock strata during the drilling process and minimize formation damage during completion and workover operations.

Schlumberger also owns several jack up rigs, two of which were sold in the fourth quarter of 2002. In addition, the Reed Hycalog drillbits business was
sold to Grant Prideco in December 2002 and has been treated as a discontinued operation.

Schlumberger’s oilfield services are marketed by its own personnel. The customer base, business risks and opportunities for growth are essentially uniform across all services. There is a sharing of manufacturing and
engineering facilities as well as research centers; labor force is interchangeable. Technological innovation, quality of service, and price are the principal methods of competition. Competition varies geographically with respect to the different
services offered. While there are numerous competitors, both large and small, Schlumberger believes that it is an industry leader in providing seismic services, measurements-while-drilling and logging-while-drilling services, and fully computerized
logging and geoscience software and computing services. Land and marine seismic operations and technologies are managed and developed by WesternGeco. A large proportion of Schlumberger’s oilfield services are non-rig related; consequently,
revenue does not necessarily correlate to rig count fluctuations.

The focus of Schlumberger Oilfield Services is on increasing the productivity of oil and gas reservoirs, which is being enhanced through the delivery, and application of real-time data. As oil and gas operators face declining
production and challenges in adding new reserves economically, they are increasing their focus on improving recovery rates from existing and new reserves while reducing overall costs. As a result, the long-term objective is to fully integrate
SchlumbergerSema IT solutions and services with oilfield operations to provide real-time reservoir management services that allow customers to optimize production and the recovery of their hydrocarbon reserves.

SchlumbergerSema

provides IT consulting, systems integration, managed
services together with network and infrastructure solutions, primarily in the global energy market which includes the oil and gas industry where Schlumberger holds a leadership position and the energy and utilities market. In addition,
SchlumbergerSema provides these services in specific regional markets spanning the telecommunications, finance, transport and public sectors.

During 2002 SchlumbergerSema underwent two organizational changes:

n

First, Schlumberger Network Solutions, previously under Oilfield Services, was combined with the Global Infrastructure Services business of SchlumbergerSema to
create today’s Network & Infrastructure Solutions division of SchlumbergerSema.

n

Second, on December 10, 2002 Schlumberger announced that it would separate the products businesses from the services businesses in SchlumbergerSema. The products
businesses are now reported in the ‘Other’ business segment, which includes Payment Systems, Cards, Point of Sales Terminals, Electricity Metering and Parking Meters. Telecom software products remain part of the SchlumbergerSema segment
but are managed separately.

The objective of the
reorganizations is to maximize the synergies between SchlumbergerSema and Oilfield Services by rapidly developing IT services for the Energy sector.

With approximately 25,000 people serving customers in 65 countries, SchlumbergerSema is organized into 19 GeoMarkets grouped into three major geographic
areas: North and South America; Europe, Africa, Middle East; and Asia.

SchlumbergerSema services are organized as follows:

n

Network & Infrastructure Solutions that combines specialized technologies, domain experience and global infrastructure to enable the digital enterprise through
their DeXa Suite of Services and provides secure global IP infrastructure, integrated information security solutions, wireless and remote network connectivity and complete network managed services.



n

Consulting & Systems Integration which offers consulting services, business systems and large-scale technical systems designed to operate to the highest levels
of reliability in demanding conditions. The knowledge, skills and methods used by Schlumberger consultants around the world, combined with technical, systems integration and outsourced managed services capability within SchlumbergerSema, enable the
development, implementation and management of major business and IT programs that are core to the strategic goals and long-term success of all businesses.

n

Telecom Products, which provides telecommunications enterprise software systems, such as billing, customer relationship management (CRM).

SchlumbergerSema was formed in April 2001, when Schlumberger Limited acquired
Sema plc, and combined it with part of its former Test & Transactions business and other recent acquisitions.

Other

Schlumberger Volume Products offers a broad portfolio of hardware and software products that provide the foundation of the company’s best-in-class services and solutions. With more than 20 years
experience as the smart card industry leader, Schlumberger was the first company to introduce Java-based smart card technology, and has sold more than 2.5 billion smart cards to date. Product expertise includes:

n

Cards

n

Payphones

n

Point-of-sale (POS) terminals

n

Parking and mass transit terminals

n

Meters

n

Trading systems

Also included in this segment is NPTest, which provides advanced test and diagnostic systems as well as engineering services to the semiconductor
industry. These devices range from microprocessors, graphics processors, chipsets, devices for high-speed data transfer and communication applications to those used in increasingly complex consumer electronics such as DVDs and set-top boxes.

Acquisitions

Information on acquisitions made by Schlumberger or its subsidiaries appears
under the heading “Acquisitions” on page 47 of this Report within the “

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

”.

GENERAL

Research & Development

Research to support the engineering and development efforts of Schlumberger’s activities is conducted at Schlumberger Doll Research, Ridgefield, Connecticut, USA; Schlumberger Cambridge Research, Cambridge, England, and
at Stavanger, Norway; Moscow, Russia and Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.

Patents

While Schlumberger seeks and
holds numerous patents, no particular patent or group of patents is considered material to Schlumberger’s business.

Seasonality

Although weather and natural phenomena can temporarily affect delivery of oilfield services, the widespread geographic location of such services precludes
the overall business from being characterized as seasonal. However, because oilfield services are provided predominantly in the Northern Hemisphere, severe weather can temporarily affect the delivery of such services and products.



Customers and Backlog of
Orders

No single customer exceeded 10% of consolidated
revenue. Oilfield Services has no backlog since it is primarily service rather than product related. SchlumbergerSema backlog at December 31, 2002 was $4.7 billion of which $1.5 billion is the subsequent twelve month backlog. At December 31, 2001,
the SchlumbergerSema backlog was $4.3 billion of which $1.5 billion was the subsequent twelve month backlog. The orders are believed to be firm but there is no assurance that any of the current backlog will actually result in sales.

Government Contracts

No material portion of Schlumberger’s business is subject to
renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts by the US or other governments.

Employees

As of December 31,
2002, Schlumberger had approximately 78,500 employees.

Non-US
Operations

Schlumberger’s non-US operations are
subject to the usual risks which may affect such operations. Such risks include unsettled political conditions in certain areas, exposure to possible expropriation or other governmental actions, exchange controls, and currency fluctuations. Although
it is impossible to predict such occurrences or their effect on Schlumberger, management believes these risks to be acceptable.

Environmental Protection

Compliance with governmental provisions relating to the protection of the environment does not materially affect Schlumberger’s capital expenditures,
earnings or competitive position. Management believes that Schlumberger is currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. For more information, see

Environmental Matters

on page 30.

Item 7

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

and Results of Operations

Schlumberger operates three business segments: Oilfield Services, SchlumbergerSema and Other. The following discussion and analysis of results of
operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(Stated in millions)


Restated, in part, for organizational changes and discontinued operations.


Pretax segment income represents income before taxes and minority interest, excluding
interest income, interest expense, gain on sale of securities and amortization of intangibles and charges, net (see pages 23-24 of this Report).


Sema plc was acquired April 1, 2001. Compared to 2001 and on a pro forma basis (assuming the
acquisition occurred on January 1, 2001) SchlumbergerSema revenue for 2002 was up 7%.


Principally comprises the Cards, Terminals, Meters North America and NPTest activities and in
2001, the divested Resource Management Services businesses.

Oilfield Services

2002 Results

Revenue for 2002 was $9.3 billion versus $9.9 billion in
2001 reflecting a 5% decrease due to reduced activity in North America and Latin America, which were 24% and 7% lower respectively. This was partially mitigated by higher activity in Europe/CIS/West Africa, up 14% and the Middle East & Asia,
where revenue increased 10%. The M-I rig count fell 17%. Pretax operating income decreased 26% primarily from reduced margins in wireline, well services and seismic technologies as activity declined in North America.

A sharp fall in revenue at the beginning of 2002 reflected declining activity
levels in North America, which remained depressed for the remainder of the year, together with political and economic uncertainty in Latin America. In the second and third quarters, robust activity in Europe/CIS/West Africa, and signs of a possible
recovery in Asia, mitigated the effects of low North American drilling levels resulting in increased revenues. However, this trend was short-lived as slower activity outside North America due mainly to seasonal influences coupled with budget cuts
resulted in lower fourth quarter revenues. In 2002, the Caspian, Russia and Mexico GeoMarkets posted the highest double-digit revenue growth of 89%, 62% and 48% respectively versus 2001.

From a technology standpoint, the strongest performer was Well Completions & Productivity where acquisitions, testing,
advanced completions systems and artificial lift technology market share gains resulted in 8% revenue growth. During the year Schlumberger acquired A. Comeau & Associates a leading provider of electrical engineering products and services for
artificially lifted wells. This latest addition, combined with the successful integration of Sensa and Phoenix technologies into the Schlumberger Artificial Lift services portfolio, contributed to higher sales in 2002 particularly in the Eastern
Hemisphere. The Drilling & Measurements technology segment also recorded solid revenue growth of 7% fuelled largely by the continued penetration of the PowerDrive475* rotary steerable system into new GeoMarkets.



In addition to A. Comeau & Associates Limited, Schlumberger made two further acquisitions during the
year to bolster its real-time reservoir management suite of services. In January, Schlumberger acquired Norwegian-based Inside Reality AS providing new 3D virtual reality systems that create a unique and powerful environment for interactive well
planning and real-time geosteering analysis. Schlumberger also acquired the software and services business of Technoguide AS a leader in the reservoir modeling domain.

The seismic downturn continued throughout 2002 resulting in significantly lower activity levels, a reduction in multiclient
license sales and extreme pricing pressures for WesternGeco. As a result, Schlumberger announced operating losses in the third quarter related to contracts in India and Mexico, and in the fourth quarter, workforce reductions of 1,700 people coupled
with the closure of its land-based seismic operations in the US lower 48 states and Canada. WesternGeco revenue of $1.5 billion decreased 13% and pretax operating income of $71 million fell 68%.

North America

North America revenue of $2.8 billion decreased 24% versus 2001 while the M-I
rig count dropped 27%.

A steep revenue decline at the outset of
the year reflected a continued lackluster drilling environment and unseasonably mild weather conditions. Throughout the remainder of the year activity levels remained depressed resulting in essentially flat revenue for 2002. Other factors
contributing to reduced revenues included lower non-rig related activity resulting in lower wireline, well services and well completions & productivity revenues, the effects of the tropical storms in the third quarter, a slow pick-up in Canadian
activity post spring break-up and the previously stated closure of US land-based and Canadian seismic operations.

Pretax operating income of $409 million decreased 52% due to pricing pressures across all services, particularly in well services, well completions &
productivity and seismic services.

WesternGeco revenue of $548
million and pretax operating income of $131 million fell 36% and 40% respectively.

Latin America

Latin America
revenue of $1.5 billion decreased 7% versus 2001 while the M-I rig count decreased 20%.

Ongoing political and economic uncertainty in the region continued to affect business conditions, particularly in Venezuela and Argentina. This particularly impacted results in the first half of the year. In sharp contrast,
the second half of 2002 saw solid growth partly as a result of higher demand for drilling & measurements and well completions technologies connected to contracts in the Burgos Basin. In addition, the completion of an IPM project that involved
the sale of production facilities in Ecuador for $26.5 million in the fourth quarter contributed to end-of-year higher revenue.

Pretax operating income of $175 million declined 13% as a result of decreased activity in Venezuela and Argentina.

WesternGeco revenue of $169 million increased 25%; however, pretax operating
income of $4.9 million dropped 71% due to the recognition of land seismic contract losses in Mexico in the third quarter.

Europe/CIS/West Africa

Europe/CIS/West Africa revenue of $2.7 billion increased 14% versus 2001 as the M-I rig count decreased 5%.

Strong revenue growth was recorded in the first three quarters reflecting
increased activity levels and market share gains particularly in the Caspian and Russia GeoMarkets in respect to artificial lift and drilling technologies. The Well Completions & Productivity technology segment recorded the strongest growth of
27% followed by Drilling & Measurements, which grew 24%.



This growth was partially
mitigated by a steep revenue drop in the fourth quarter due to exceptionally severe winter weather conditions in the North Sea and Russia that affected all services, particularly seismic and fracturing activities. In addition, operator budget cuts
in the Nigeria GeoMarket and refocused investment decisions in the UK contributed to lower fourth quarter revenues.

Pretax operating income of $322 million decreased 6% due to softening in pricing towards the end of the year and restructuring in the region to reduce
support infrastructure to match slowing activity levels.

WesternGeco revenue of $267 million decreased 5% and the pretax operating loss of $52 million was 67% higher than 2001.

Middle East & Asia

Middle East & Asia revenue of $2.4 billion increased 10% outpacing the M-I rig count, which grew 6% for the same period.

After a decline at the beginning of the year resulting from exceptional
artificial lift sales at the end of 2001, the Asian market showed signs of recovery highlighted by strong revenue growth in the second quarter. Over the year, the India and Malaysia/Brunei/Philippines GeoMarkets recorded the strongest growth due to
increased activity in these countries. In addition, the Wireline and Well Services technology segments posted the highest growth, up 14% and 10% respectively.

This was partly offset, however, by a slowdown in activity in the second half of 2002 due to a number of major projects nearing completion, lower
equipment sales and a significant reduction in seismic activity throughout the Area.

Pretax operating income of $457 million was flat despite the revenue growth due to marine seismic contract losses incurred in India in the third quarter coupled with softening pricing in well completions and productivity
services.

WesternGeco revenue of $490 million increased 15%;
however, pretax operating income of $3.2 million declined 93% due to the recognition of marine seismic contract losses in India.

2001 Results

Record Oilfield Services operating revenue of $9.9 billion increased 36% over 2000 in sharp contrast with the worldwide M-I rig count, which grew only
15%. Increased non-rig related activity, partly attributable to the WesternGeco Joint Venture, and higher pricing levels contributed to the growth.

Operating revenue started to grow in the first quarter, due to continued high activity in North America and increased demand internationally. The latter
continued throughout 2001 and was reflected in the Europe/CIS/West Africa and Middle East & Asia Area results. However, softening North American drilling activity in the third quarter, as a result of slower economic growth and declining natural
gas drilling activity, offset international growth.

The
WesternGeco Joint Venture in its first full financial reporting year was the largest contributor to double-digit growth in all Areas with the Malaysia/Brunei/Philippines, Alaska, Gulf Coast and West & South Africa GeoMarkets recording the
strongest results versus 2000. Market share gains, improved pricing levels and the introduction of new technology contributed to strong growth in the Drilling & Measurements technology business. In addition, improved Reda submersible pump sales
and the continued expansion of the PowerSTIM* well production optimization solution contributed to significant growth in the Well Completions & Productivity technology segment.

2001 was a significant year as Oilfield Services acquired several key technologies as part of its continuing focus to build a
complete suite of real-time reservoir optimization services. In April 2001, Schlumberger acquired Baker Jardine, a leading provider of software tools, IT consulting and integrated solutions that help operators increase oil and gas production.
Secondly, a unique Distributing Temperature Sensing technique was added to the Schlumberger real-time offering through the acquisition of Sensa. The



recognized leader in fiber optic sensing technologies, Sensa provides operators with a continuous measurement for the monitoring of producing
wells. Thirdly, Schlumberger acquired Phoenix, a leading provider of technologies and techniques for optimizing production from artificially lifted wells, in October 2001.

North America

North American operating revenue increased 49% versus 2000 outpacing the M-I rig count, which grew 17%. The strong operating revenue growth that continued
in the first quarter of 2001 plateaued in the middle of the year. This was due to slower economic conditions and declining natural gas prices, which resulted in reduced activity towards the end of the year. The Alaska and Gulf Coast GeoMarkets
recorded the strongest revenue growth due to increased demand for drilling and measurements and well services, wireline technologies and higher seismic activity.

Pretax operating income increased 124% particularly due to strong demand for well services technologies and the significant
impact of the WesternGeco Joint Venture.

Latin America

Operating revenue increased 32% exceeding the M-I rig count
growth of 13%. Increased activity across all services contributed to double-digit growth in the GeoMarkets. Growth was led by the Peru/Colombia/Ecuador and Latin America South GeoMarkets as a result of increased drilling and measurements and well
services. Further, higher well completions services during the year, and an increase in land seismic activity in Bolivia during the fourth quarter contributed to growth in these GeoMarkets.

Pretax operating income increased 133% principally as a result of increases in
IPM, Wireline and the impact of the WesternGeco Joint Venture.

Europe/CIS/West Africa

Operating revenue
increased 41% in the Europe/CIS/West Africa Area, more than double the M-I rig count growth, which rose 15%. Overall moderate growth was recorded for the year led by high demand for well completions services in Nigeria and strong growth in drilling
and measurements and wireline services in the Russia GeoMarket. In particular, strong growth was seen in the West and South Africa GeoMarket partly due to an Early Production Facility Project for IPM during the year.

Pretax operating income increased 59% due mainly to the Well Completions &
Productivity segment, which recorded strong growth across most GeoMarkets.

Middle East & Asia

A 26% increase in
operating revenue surpassed the M-I rig count four-fold in 2001. Almost all GeoMarkets in the region recorded strong double-digit growth led by seismic, drilling and measurements and well services activities in the Malaysia, Brunei and Philippines
GeoMarket, and as a result of new contract wins in the Gulf GeoMarket. Moderate sequential growth was recorded throughout the year reflecting the pick up in international activity.

Pretax operating income increased 50% comprised mostly of an increase in Drilling & Measurements and in the Well
Completions & Productivity technology segments.

Results

Moderate growth was recorded during the first half
of the year with sharp sequential growth in the second half of the year led by increased activity in North America and higher demand for drilling & measurements technologies, up 29%, and well services up 25%. The seismic down cycle, which
started at the beginning of 1999, continued through the first half of the year. The second half of 2000 saw significant improvement leading to higher Schlumberger activity due to the introduction of new generation seismic Q* Marine technology and
increased multiclient data sales.



Oilfield Services operating
revenue increased 20% compared with 1999 as the worldwide M-I rig count grew 30%.

operating revenue increased 46% versus 1999, in line with the M-I rig count, which grew 47%. Increased activity, which started in the third quarter of 1999, continued into the beginning of 2000 with a significant increase in drilling activity due to
the continued shift to natural gas exploration and development. Well Services posted the strongest revenue growth, up 56% followed by Drilling & Measurements, up 46% and Wireline, which increased 40%. Pretax operating income increased 233%.

Latin America

Latin America operating revenue increased 23% for the year, consistent with a
23% increase in the M-I rig count. There was strong growth in the second half of 2000 across most technology segments. Pretax operating segment income increased 390% due to improved profitability led by Drilling & Measurements and Well Services.

Europe/CIS/West Africa

Operating revenue increased 7% in Europe/CIS/West Africa during 2000,
consistent with a 10% increase in the M-I rig count. Results in the first quarter were lower year over year due to continued flat activity and a sharp decline in seismic activity in this region for the same period. The increase in activity in the
second half of the year was moderate compared with the other Areas. Pretax operating income increased 86% as a result of increased pricing for wireline and drilling & measurements technologies.

Middle East & Asia

Operating revenue in Middle East & Asia increased 5%, in line with a 5%
increase in the M-I rig count. Lower first quarter results resulted from the continued industry down cycle, and the growth was moderate for the remainder of the year due to a slow increase in activity. Stronger sequential growth in the second half
of the year resulted from increased activity in the Middle East and improved demand particularly for drilling & measurements and testing technologies. Pretax operating income increased 3%.

SchlumbergerSema

2002 Results

SchlumbergerSema operating revenue increased 32% compared with 2001 mainly
due to the acquisition of Sema plc whose results were consolidated with effect from April 1, 2001. On a proforma basis, assuming the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2001, operating revenue in 2002 was up 7% compared to 2001. The pretax segment
income of $34 million compared to a loss of $33 million in 2001, reflecting the cost reductions initiatives implemented since the integration of Sema plc into Schlumberger. The 2002 pretax segment income excludes the charges discussed on pages 23-24
of this Report.

In December an updated strategy for
SchlumbergerSema was announced. The SchlumbergerSema focus is now on IT consulting and systems integration together with network and infrastructure solutions, primarily in global energy while continuing to develop specific regional market sectors in
areas where it has a successful competitive position based on scale and domain knowledge. This strategy is designed to create industry leadership in the energy market by combining the systems integration skills of Sema with the global reach and
energy sector knowledge of Schlumberger.



SchlumbergerSema won the top
prize at the prestigious Management Consultancies Association (MCA) Best Management Practice Awards in London for its work on the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympic Winter Games. At the 2002 Winter Olympic Games, SchlumbergerSema led a consortium of 15
technology partners in a three-year long project to deliver the IT infrastructure needed to run the Games. Dr Jacques Rogge, president of the International Olympic Committee commented “The Information Technology operations of any Olympic Games
play a vital role in the overall success of the Games”. Schlumberger is also the official Worldwide Information Technology Partner for the Olympic Games in 2004, 2006 and 2008.

North & South America

Operating revenue increased 4% over 2001 primarily due to increased activity from the Network Infrastructure Solutions (NIS) business as a result of
several large IT outsourcing projects. These include the Conoco and Dallas County IT projects and the DeXa.Net global connectivity solution to provide communications for Houston-based Atwood Oceanics offshore and land facilities around the world.
Partially offsetting the increase in activity from NIS, revenue declined in the telecom and utility industries due primarily to the weak IT services spending environment as customers faced economic challenges and continued to revise budgets
downwards and delay decisions on contract awards. However, major contracts have been awarded in the energy segment such as the Online Energy Management System for AES Infoenergy in Brazil and the systems integration and data management services
contracts with Nebraska Public Power District (NPPD) of Columbus, Nebraska.

Despite the marginal increase in revenue, pretax operating loss of $43 million represented an improvement of 18% over 2001, mainly attributable to the cost reduction programs implemented throughout the area.

Europe/Middle East/Africa

Operating revenue increased 35% mainly due to the inclusion of a full
year’s revenue from the acquisition of Sema plc compared to nine months in 2001. On a comparable basis the revenue increased by 4% despite a declining IT services market in Europe for the first time since 1993. The main contributor to the
growth was the public sector mainly in the UK where SchlumbergerSema won large outsourcing contracts with the Association of Train Operating Companies, the Department of Work and Pension and the Vehicle Inspectorate. Also contributing to the
improvements were an energy-related project for Brussels-based Electrabel S.A., a leading energy producer, distributor and supplier in Belgium, with power plants in eight European countries serving about 4.5 million customers daily and a health and
welfare services project to Consignia’s 220,000 employees in the UK.

Pretax operating income increased 33% due mainly to the cost cutting program implemented throughout the year.

Asia

Operating revenue increased 38%. On a comparable basis, operating revenue would have been flat. The decreased activity in telecommunications, mainly in China and Taiwan, was offset by the increase in
the finance segment on new outsourcing contracts in the insurance sector in Japan for Mass Mutual and delivery of payment systems in China.

Pretax operating income decreased 61% mainly attributable to pricing pressure and economic declines in the telecommunications IT services industry.

Telecom Products

Operating revenue increased 22% over 2001 principally due to the inclusion of
Sema plc. On a comparable basis the activity was flat despite the sharp decline in the telecommunications industry. During the year the focus was on streamlining the product portfolio and reducing the number of R&D centers and reducing the
workforce to the level of activity.

The pretax operating loss of
$24 million was an improvement over the loss of $34 million in 2001 mainly due to the significant workforce reduction aimed at aligning R&D with the product development cycles.



2001 Results

On April 6, 2001, Schlumberger completed the acquisition of
Sema plc for $5.15 billion. Sema plc is a leading IT and technical services company with a strong European presence. The acquisition was financed through existing cash resources of Schlumberger and from borrowings under a $3 billion floating rate
credit facility. As a result of the acquisition, the SchlumbergerSema business segment was created combining Sema plc and certain businesses of Schlumberger Test & Transactions and Resource Management Services, including CellNet and Convergent.

Operating revenue increased $2.0 billion over 2000 due to the
acquisition of Sema plc. Excluding the acquisition of Sema plc the operating revenue increase would have been $383 million on a pro forma basis.

NIS experienced a 91% operating revenue growth for 2001 versus 2000 mostly due to E&P contracts demonstrating that this industry is recognizing the
importance of IT connectivity and security.

North & South
America

Operating revenue increased 233% versus 2000
essentially due to the inclusion of the full year’s activity for the Convergent Group, acquired in November 2000 and CellNet Data Systems, acquired in June 2000. Additionally the increased utilities activity was a result of strong demand for
Real Time Energy Management Systems (RTEMS) services and further deployment of related networks, the extension of key existing utility business contracts in North America for utility data management services and the award of a significant contract
for consulting and personal energy management advanced data services. Contributing to the growth was the award of NIS projects by University of Texas Medical Board, Shell and Ecopetrol.

Pretax operating loss was 22% lower than the previous year.

Europe/Middle East/Africa

Operating revenue increased significantly due to the inclusion of Sema plc. Excluding Sema plc the year on year pro forma operating revenue increase would
have been $83 million due principally to the full inclusion of Data Marine Systems Limited acquired in October 2000 and to the award of multi-million dollar contracts in France for Banque de France and in the UK for Metropolitan Police.

Pretax operating income increased significantly due to the
inclusion of Sema plc.

Asia

Operating revenue increased almost eight-fold largely due to the integration
of Sema plc. Excluding Sema plc the year on year growth would have been $24 million entirely due to stronger NIS activity and to sustained demand for business continuity and outsourcing services throughout the area exemplified by the desktop
outsourcing project for Caltex in Sumatra, Indonesia.

Pretax
operating income increased significantly due to the inclusion of Sema plc.

Telecom Products

There was no activity
prior to 2001.

The activity was mainly led by strong bookings in
mobile messaging systems, with the first SemaPortal* short message server implementation and customer care and billing products system integration for mobile operators, such as the project awarded by Telecom Italia Mobile (TIM) which covers their
operations in Europe and Brazil.

2000 Results

During the year, SchlumbergerSema took strategic steps in
the global energy segment to build its solutions offerings through the acquisition in June 2000 of CellNet Data Systems, the leading provider of telemetry technology for the development and deployment of large-scale automatic meter reading (AMR)
systems and the Convergent Group, a leading builder of digital enterprises focusing on the utility sector, in November 2000.



Operating revenue increased
250% year-on-year reflecting the above two acquisitions and the acquisition of the remaining 50% stake in Omnes, a joint venture previously equally owned by Schlumberger and Cable & Wireless.

North & South America

Operating revenue increased more than four-fold over 1999 due to market
expansion, including the acquisition of CellNet Data Systems and the Convergent Group, the receipt of several major orders in Real Time Energy Management Systems (RTEMS) and the University of Texas Medical Board NIS’ contract.

The pretax operating loss reflected the newly acquired CellNet and Convergent
activities.

Europe/Middle East/Africa

Operating revenue increased 158% and pretax operating income increased 37%
due to the 50% consolidation of Omnes and the full consolidation of Data Marine Systems.

Asia

Operating revenue
increased 108% and pretax operating income increased 8-fold entirely due to the consolidation of 100% of Omnes into Schlumberger.

Telecom Products

There was no activity in Telecom Products during the year 2000.

Other

Included in this segment are NPTest, consisting of the core product lines of Schlumberger Semiconductor Solutions, smart cards, point-of-sale terminals,
eCity terminals, payphones, payments systems, electricity meters and the divested businesses of the former Resource Management Services segment.

On May 21, 2002 NPTest filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a proposed initial public offering of its shares of
common stock which is not yet effective.

2002 Results

Operating revenue decreased 32% reflecting the divestiture
of the Resource Management Services North American water metering activities and the non-North American electricity and water meter and worldwide gas meter businesses in November 2001.

NPTest activity increased due to a partial recovery in test equipment sales in North America and Asia partially offset by
decreases in diagnostic equipment sales and equipment support services.

Volume Product activity remained flat despite the continuing slump in the telecommunications industry and the continued pricing pressure. This was partially offset by higher activity in banking and IT cards coupled with a favorable
euro-dollar exchange rate.

Pretax operating income decreased 78%
mainly due to the divestiture of Resource Management Services and eroded profitability in the smart cards business.

2001 Results

Operating revenue decreased 13% reflecting mainly the divestiture of the Resource Management Services businesses, which were sold in November 2001 and the
decline in semiconductor activity, which followed the down cycle in the worldwide semiconductor industry.



Volume Products operating
revenue grew by 13% despite a slowdown in the telecommunications industry. Smart cards operating revenue increased 9% compared with 2000.

NPTest revenue decreased approximately 47% from the prior year due to the sharp decline in the industry, with all product lines affected.

Pretax operating income decreased 40% due mainly to pricing pressure in both
the semiconductor and the smart cards industries.

Results

Operating revenue was flat. Increased activity in
the smart cards business, driven by outstanding growth of the mobile communications market and in NPTest (up 5%) was offset by the decline in Resource Management Services (down 16%) where pressure on utility prices resulted in a continued downturn
for the utility industry.

Pretax operating income grew 49%
year-on-year mainly attributable to the improved profitability in smart cards.

In 2002, Oilfield Services segment net income decreased $267 million, or 21%,
to $987 million as revenue declined 5% compared to the worldwide M-I rig count reduction of 17%. North America registered the most significant decline as revenue decreased 24% on a M-I rig count reduction of 27%. SchlumbergerSema segment net income
of $21 million improved from a loss of $22 million in 2001, reflecting the revenue increase of 32% (7% on a proforma basis – assuming the Sema plc acquisition took place on January 1, 2001) and the effect of the previously announced cost
reduction program. In the Other segment, net income declined to $14 million, from $85 million in 2001 which included the divested Resource Management Services businesses.

In 2001, Oilfield Services segment net income increased $498 million, or 66%, to $1,254 million reflecting the 36% growth in
revenue, which outpaced the 15% increase in the worldwide M-I rig count. Higher pricing levels and increased non-rig related activity were the major factors attributable to the record Oilfield Services revenues. SchlumbergerSema segment net loss of
$22 million improved $19 million reflecting the incremental income from the newly acquired Sema plc. In the Other segment, net income of $85 million declined $34 million from the prior year with declines in the semiconductor-related and Cards
activities.

In 2000, Oilfield Services segment net income
increased $328 million, or 76%, to $756 million. Increases in E&P expenditures and in oil and gas prices, resulting from increased oil demand and the lowest level of excess oil production capacity in decades, were the underlying factors of the
strong increases in most areas, and notably in North America. Average worldwide rig count increased 30% compared to 1999. SchlumbergerSema segment net loss of $41 million was down $43 million due to losses in the newly acquired CellNet and
Convergent businesses in North America. In the Other segment, net income of $119 million increased $32 million from the prior year mainly due to stronger results from the Cards activity where revenue was up 26%.

Currency Risks

Refer to page 39,

Translation of Non-US Currencies

in the

Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements

, for a description of the Schlumberger policy on currency hedging. There are no material unhedged assets, liabilities or commitments which are denominated in other than a business’ functional currency.
Schlumberger businesses operate principally in US dollars, the euro and most other European currencies and most South American currencies.

While changes in exchange rates affect revenue, especially in the SchlumbergerSema segment, they also affect costs. Generally speaking, Schlumberger is
currency neutral. For example, a 5% change in average



exchange rates of OECD currencies would have had no material effect on consolidated revenue and net income.

In general, when the US dollar weakens against other currencies, consolidated
revenue increases, usually with no material effect on net income. This is principally because the fall-through incremental margin in the SchlumbergerSema segment offsets the higher Oilfield Services segment non-US dollar denominated expenses.

Research & Engineering

Expenditures by business segment were as follows:


Relating to the Bull CP8 acquisition.

Interest Expense

Interest expense decreased $17 million, to $368 million mainly due to a decrease in average borrowing rates from 5.8% to 4.9%. The increase in 2001 of
$109 million, to $385 million, was principally due to the significantly higher debt balances incurred, relating to the acquisition of Sema plc, which were only partially offset by a reduction in average borrowing rate from 6.9% to 5.8%. The increase
in 2000 of $83 million, to $276 million, was mainly due to an increase in average borrowing rates from 5.8% to 6.9%.

Hanover Compressor Transaction

In August 2001, Schlumberger sold its Oilfield Services worldwide gas compression activity to Hanover Compressor Company. The proceeds included common
stock of Hanover Compressor, with a value at closing of $173 million, which is restricted from marketability until August 30, 2004 and a $150 million long-term subordinated note maturing December 15, 2005.

The market value of Schlumberger’s investment in Hanover Compressor
common stock was $80 million as of December 31, 2002. Following the decline in the market value of the stock below carrying value during the second quarter of 2002, Schlumberger has performed, and continues to perform, a periodic assessment in
accordance with its policy to determine whether an other-than-temporary decline in fair value has occurred. Schlumberger evaluated the recoverability of its investment by reviewing recent information related to the industry and the operating results
and financial position of Hanover Compressor and by considering Schlumberger’s requirement, ability and intent to hold the investment on a long-term basis. Schlumberger concluded that evidence existed at December 31, 2002 to support the
recoverability of its carrying value, that there were no events or changes in circumstances specifically relating to the business prospects of Hanover Compressor, that the underlying business fundamentals are good with natural gas supplies reduced
and higher natural gas prices in North America. In addition, the recently announced Hanover cutbacks in workforce and capital expenditures coupled with no immediate debt maturities should provide adequate capital resources in the near-term.
Accordingly, Schlumberger concluded that the decline in market value of its investment ($93 million) in Hanover Compressor as of December 31, 2002 was temporary in nature and has not reduced the cost basis of that investment. If the decline in value
persists or should Schlumberger’s assessment change, Schlumberger would take a charge to its earnings for the amount that is deemed unrecoverable.

The $150 million long-term subordinated note has a mandatory prepayment upon the issuance, sale or other disposition by Hanover Compressor of any shares
of capital stock or other equity interests pursuant to a



public offering or a private placement otherwise prepayment is discretionary. As of December 31, 2002, Schlumberger considers the carrying
value of the note to be fully collectible.

As part of the sale
agreement, Schlumberger agreed that the financing of the PIGAP II joint venture in Venezuela would be non-recourse to the buyer and would be executed prior to December 31, 2002. Accordingly, Schlumberger was obligated, with respect to the financing,
to guarantee 30% (approximately $80 million) until the project was completed in 2002 and, if as of December 31, 2002, refinancing had not become non-recourse to the buyer or the project had not achieved substantial completion, Hanover Compressor had
an option to put its interest in the joint venture back to Schlumberger.

As an outcome of the turmoil in Venezuela, although the project reached substantial completion, the non-recourse financing for the project was not achieved by December 31, 2002. On January 30, 2003, Hanover Compressor gave notice of
its intention to exercise its right to put its ownership interest in the joint venture back to Schlumberger. The put is subject to certain consents and other conditions. Schlumberger’s obligation to provide a guarantee with respect to the
financing was eliminated.

As Schlumberger originally deferred
the gain on the sale of the joint venture in 2001, there is no impact on Schlumberger results of operations due to the Hanover Compressor exercise of its option.

Charges – Continuing Operations

Schlumberger recorded the following after-tax and minority interest charges/credits for continuing operations in 2002, 2001
and 2000:

n

On December 10, 2002, Schlumberger announced that the Board of Directors had approved an updated strategy for its SchlumbergerSema business segment. The new
strategic plan outlook, current business values and the reorganization of SchlumbergerSema constitute significant events that required an impairment analysis to be performed in accordance with FAS 142. SchlumbergerSema was ‘valued’ on a
stand-alone basis; each reporting unit within SchlumbergerSema was valued using a discounted cash flow analysis based on a long-term forecast prepared by SchlumbergerSema management with the assistance of a third party valuation expert. The implied
multiples yielded by the discounted cash flow analysis were compared to observed trading multiples of comparable companies and recent transactions in the IT services industry to assess the fair value of the reporting units. The fair value was below
the book value. As a result, goodwill was written down to its estimated fair value based on Schlumberger’s valuation. The impairment of goodwill mainly reflects the current difficulties of the telecommunications industry and the severely
depressed market values of the IT companies serving SchlumbergerSema’s sector. Certain intangible assets were also identified and written down as part of this process.

Schlumberger recorded severance, facility and other costs in an effort to reduce costs at SchlumbergerSema
and WesternGeco. These costs related to expenses that offer no future benefit to the ongoing operations of these businesses. During the fourth quarter, Schlumberger also recorded an impairment charge, to reflect a change in the business projections
of the WesternGeco business, related to capitalized multiclient seismic library costs, a deferred tax valuation allowance and other costs.

The total of the above charges was $3,168 million and consisted of (1) a goodwill impairment charge of $2,638 million; (2) an intangible
assets impairment charge of $132 million; (3) SchlumbergerSema severance and other charges of $77 million in response to current business conditions; (4) WesternGeco severance and other charges of $72 million in response to current business
conditions; (5) a WesternGeco multiclient library impairment charge of $129 million following a valuation of the library; (6) environmental related charges of $26 million; (7) a deferred tax valuation allowance charge of $94 million.

n

In December 2002, a credit of $87 million reflecting the gain on the sale of two drilling rigs.

n

In March 2002, a charge of $29 million related to the financial/economic crisis in Argentina.

n

In March 2001, a charge of $25 million for in-process R&D related to the Bull CP8 acquisition.



n

In June 2001, a charge of $280 million for the estimated impairment charge from the disposition of certain Resource Management Services businesses.

n

In September 2001, a net credit of $3 million representing the gain on the sale of the worldwide gas compression business, partially offset by an impairment charge
relating to the expected disposition of certain activities.

n

In December 2001, a net credit of $5 million, including an after tax gain on the sale of the former Resource Management Services North American Water division ($117
million). This gain was partially offset by certain charges: (1) a provision of $37 million for employee termination costs, principally in Europe and the US, related to Oilfield Services and SchlumbergerSema in response to the prevailing business
conditions; (2) tax reorganization costs of $29 million; (3) a further $20 million charge related to the second quarter estimated loss on the divestiture of certain Resource Management Services businesses following the actual closing in the fourth
quarter; (4) asset write down of $23 million for technological impairment related to certain Land seismic assets in the newly formed WesternGeco Joint Venture.

n

In December 2000, $25 million charge primarily relating to the write down of certain inventory and severance costs in the semiconductor business resulting from
reduced activity levels in the semiconductor test market, $39 million related to the creation of the WesternGeco joint venture (including asset impairment and severance costs for Schlumberger’s existing Geco-Prakla business), and a credit of
$61 million from the gain on sale of two Gas Services businesses in Europe.

An analysis of the December 2002 pretax severance and facility charges is as follows:

The remaining severance
costs are expected to be paid before September 30, 2003.

The
December 2001 charge included severance costs of $41 million (775 people) which have been paid.

The December 2000 charges included severance costs of $9 million (380 people) which have been paid.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Schlumberger’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon Schlumberger’s consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires Schlumberger to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.

On an on-going basis, Schlumberger evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, valuation of inventories and investments, recoverability
of long-lived assets, income tax provision and deferred taxes, profit assumptions on long-term percentage-of-completion contracts, contingencies and litigation and actuarial assumptions for employee benefit plans. Schlumberger bases its estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.



Schlumberger believes the critical accounting policies described below affect its more significant
judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.

Schlumberger recognizes revenue and profit as work progresses on long-term, fixed price contracts using the percentage-of-completion method, which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs.
Schlumberger follows this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made. Recognized revenue and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion.
Revisions in profit estimates are charged or credited to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known as a change in estimate. Losses on long-term contracts are provided for when such losses are known and
reasonably estimated.

Schlumberger recognizes revenue from the
sale of software licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Whether the fee is fixed and
determinable is assessed based on the payment terms associated with the transaction. Collection is assessed based on a number of factors, including past transaction history with the customer and the credit-worthiness of the customer.

Revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements, such as those
including installation and integration services, are recognized as each element is earned based on the relative fair value of each element and when there are no undelivered elements that are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements.

For sales, either a binding purchase order, signed license
agreement or a written contract is used as evidence of an arrangement.

Revenue from maintenance services is recognized ratably over the contract term. The training and consulting services (time and materials) are billed based on hourly rates, and revenue is generally recognized as these services are
performed. Revenue from outsourcing services is generally recognized as services are performed.

The Oilfield Services segment capitalizes the cost associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data. Such costs are charged to

Cost of Goods Sold and Services

based on a percentage of
estimated total revenue that Schlumberger estimates that it will receive from the sales of such data. The carrying value of individual surveys is reviewed at least annually and adjustments to the value are made based upon the revised estimated
revenues for the surveys.

Schlumberger maintains allowances for
doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of Schlumberger’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make
payments, additional allowances may be required.

Schlumberger
writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market
conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory writedowns may be required.

Schlumberger assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long-lived assets and related goodwill at least annually, or whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors considered important, which could trigger an impairment review, include the following:

n

significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;

n

significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business;

n

significant negative industry or economic trends;

n

significant decline in Schlumberger’s stock price for a sustained period; and our market capitalization relative to net book value.



When Schlumberger determines
that the carrying value of intangibles, long-lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, any impairment is measured based on projected net cash flows
expected to result from that asset, including eventual disposition.

Schlumberger has net deferred tax assets of $583 million at December 31, 2002. Schlumberger considers future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances. In December 2002, in connection
with the SchlumbergerSema strategic review Schlumberger determined that it would not be able to realize a part of its October 1, 2002 net deferred asset in the future relating to a certain European net operating loss. A valuation allowance of $94
million was charged to income in the fourth quarter. The cumulative valuation allowance relating to this European net operating loss is approximately $147 million at December 31, 2002.

With regard to pension and postretirement benefits, Schlumberger evaluates the
appropriateness of assumptions used by an independent actuary, in particular assumptions as to discount rate, return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates. The assumptions are revised at least annually as circumstances require.



Liquidity

A measure of financial position is liquidity, which Schlumberger defines as
cash plus short-term and fixed income investments, less debt. Negative liquidity indicates net debt. The following table summarizes the change in consolidated liquidity for each of the past three years:


Reclassified, in part, for comparative purposes.


Including multiclient seismic data costs.

At December 31, 2002, Schlumberger’s liquidity was negative (debt exceeded cash plus investments). At December 31, 2002, Schlumberger had
cash/short-term investments of $1.7 billion and remaining capacity in debt facilities of $3.7 billion which are sufficient to meet future business requirements.

Based on forecast 2003 net income, depreciation/amortization estimates, and other liquidity components, Schlumberger expects
to improve liquidity with an objective of reducing the net debt to under $4 billion by year end 2003. This will largely be dependent upon the business segments operating results and the successful completion of certain business divestitures.



Acquisition of Sema plc

On February 12, 2001, Schlumberger announced that it had reached an agreement with the board of directors of Sema plc on the
terms of a recommended offer for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Sema plc.

On March 8, 2001, a wholly owned subsidiary of Schlumberger acquired, through market purchases, approximately 20% of the issued share capital of Sema at a cost of $1 billion.

On April 6, 2001, the offer for the shares of Sema plc was declared
unconditional in all respects. The aggregate consideration for the acquisition of 100% of the issued Sema shares was $5.15 billion (including expenses of the transaction) which was financed from existing cash resources and borrowings under a $3
billion credit facility.

On October 3, 2001, wholly owned
subsidiaries of Schlumberger issued $1.9 billion European bonds (Euro 1.4 billion and £425 million). The average interest rate of these bonds is 5.9% with maturity from 2008 through 2032. The proceeds from the issues were used to repay
short-term bank loans originally taken out by those subsidiaries to finance the acquisition of Sema plc.

The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the goodwill and identifiable intangibles aggregated $5.19 billion which were being amortized on a straight-line basis in
2001. Effective January 1, 2002, with the adoption of SFAS 142 (see

New Accounting Standards

), amortization of goodwill and workforce ceased. Identifiable intangibles continue to be amortized on a straight-line basis over a life of 10 years.

The aggregate value of goodwill and identifiable intangibles
comprised the following:

adjustments consisted primarily of severance costs ($84 million – 1781 people), facility reductions ($33 million), pension plan adjustments ($136 million) and tax restructuring costs ($50 million). At December 31, 2001, $26 million (593 people)
of the severance costs had been paid. All remaining severance was paid in 2002.

For financial reporting purposes, Schlumberger included the results of operations of Sema in its consolidated accounts commencing April 1, 2001. If Sema had been included in the consolidated financial statements of Schlumberger from
January 1, consolidated revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2001 would have increased by $538 million to $14.3 billion and consolidated net income would have decreased by approximately $140 million, to $382 million, related primarily to
increased interest expense, amortization of intangibles and lower interest income. On a proforma basis, Schlumberger 2000 operating revenue and net income would have been $12 billion and $300 million, respectively.

Sema is an IT services company (with approximately 22,000 employees at the
date of acquisition) that provides its customers with design, implementation, operations and management of information systems and IT-related consulting services. Among the industry sectors which Sema serves, Sema has increasingly focused on the
telecommunications and finance sectors, and provides a range of its own software products specifically designed for these sectors in addition to its IT services. Sema’s customers include a wide variety of businesses and governmental departments
around the world. Sema’s services and product offerings include systems integration and consulting; software products for the telecommunications, energy, transport and finance sectors; and outsourcing.



Business Divestitures

During 2002, Schlumberger divested the following businesses:

n

In December, the Reed Hycalog drillbits business. The proceeds included $259 million in cash and 9.7 million shares of Grant Prideco common stock with a value of
$103 million. The after tax gain was $66 million. The divestiture of Reed Hycalog has been accounted for in

Discontinued Operations

.

During 2001, Schlumberger divested the following businesses:

n

In August, the Oilfield Services worldwide gas compression activity primarily consisting of the Production Operators Corp. subsidiary. The proceeds included $274
million in cash, a $150 million long-term subordinated note and newly issued Hanover Compressor Company shares with a value of $173 million. The shares have a three year marketability restriction. The after-tax gain was $52 million.

n

In November, the Resource Management Services North American water metering activities. Cash proceeds were $304 million and the after-tax gain was $117 million.

n

In November, the Resource Management Services non-North American electricity and water meter, and worldwide gas meter businesses. The net cash proceeds were $256
million and the after-tax loss was $300 million, of which $280 million had been recorded as an impairment charge in June (See

Charges-Continuing Operations

).

n

In November, the Yield Enhancement Systems division of Semiconductor Solutions. Cash proceeds were $62 million and the after-tax gain was $12 million.

Summary of Major Contractual Commitments

Letters of
credit/guarantees outstanding aggregated $771 million at December 31, 2002.

In general, the remaining amount of letters of credit/guarantees relate to business performance bonds, custom/excise tax commitments, facility lease/rental obligations, etc. All such were entered into in the ordinary course of
business and are customary practices in the various countries where Schlumberger operates.



Common Stock, Market Prices and Dividends Declared per Share

Quarterly high and low prices for Schlumberger common stock as reported by
the New York Stock Exchange (composite transactions), together with dividends declared per share in each quarter of 2002 and 2001, were:

The number of holders of
record of Schlumberger common stock at December 31, 2002, was approximately 24,825. There are no legal restrictions on the payment of dividends or ownership or voting of such shares, except as to shares held in the Schlumberger Treasury. US
stockholders are not subject to any Netherlands Antilles withholding or other Netherlands Antilles taxes attributable to ownership of such shares.

Environmental Matters

The Consolidated Balance Sheet includes accruals for the estimated future costs associated with certain environmental remediation activities related to
the past use or disposal of hazardous materials. Substantially all such costs relate to divested operations and to facilities or locations that are no longer in operation. Due to a number of uncertainties, including uncertainty of timing, the scope
of remediation, future technology, regulatory changes, the risk of personal injury, natural resource or property damage claims and other factors, it is possible that the ultimate remediation costs may exceed the amounts estimated. However, in the
opinion of management, such additional costs are not expected to be material relative to consolidated liquidity, financial position or future results of operations.

New Accounting Standards

In June 2001, SFAS 141 (

Business Combinations

) and SFAS 142 (

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

) were issued.
SFAS 141 was adopted by Schlumberger for acquisitions subsequent to June 30, 2001. SFAS 142 was adopted by Schlumberger commencing January 1, 2002. As required by SFAS 142, Schlumberger undertook an initial review of goodwill impairment in the first
quarter of 2002 and completed an “event driven” review in the fourth quarter of 2002. The findings of the independent valuation indicated there was an impairment write down of $2.6 billion which was approved by the Board of Directors in
December 2002 in conjunction with the approval of the new strategic plan for SchlumbergerSema.

Amortization of goodwill and workforce ceased with effect from January 1, 2002. Assembled workforce, net of deferred taxes, of $175 million was reclassified to

Goodwill

.



Amortization of goodwill and
other intangibles included in Schlumberger’s results are as follows:

In June 2001, SFAS 143
(

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

) was issued. SFAS 143 will be adopted by Schlumberger commencing January 1, 2003. Schlumberger does not believe that the implementation of this standard will have any material effect on its
financial position or results of operations.

In August 2001,
SFAS 144 (

Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

) was issued. SFAS 144 was adopted by Schlumberger commencing January 1, 2002 and did not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations.

Effective January 1, 2002, Schlumberger adopted the FASB EITF
Abstract 01-14, (

Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for “Out-of-Pocket” Expenses Incurred

). Prior year revenue has been restated to include reimbursable costs billed to customers which had been classified
as a contra expense and now must be classified as revenue. The reclassification was only required in the Oilfield Services (OFS) segment as the SchlumbergerSema segment was already in compliance with the new standard. OFS

operating revenue

and

cost of goods sold & services

increased in 2001 by $557 million and in 2000 by $416 million. There was no effect on cash flow or net income.

On July 29, 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 146 (

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities

). The
standard required companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. Examples of costs covered by the standard include lease
termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring, discontinued operation, plant closing, or other exit or disposal activity. Previous accounting guidance was provided by EITF Issue No. 94-3,
(

Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity [including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring])

. SFAS 146 replaced Issue 94-3. Schlumberger will apply SFAS 146 prospectively to exit
or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002.

In
November 2002, FASB Interpretation No. 45 (

Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others

) was issued. It requires certain accounting and disclosures of
guarantees to third parties including indebtedness. The statement is effective on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. Schlumberger does not believe that the implementation of this statement will have a
material effect on its financial position or results of operations.

In January 2003, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued No. 00-21 “

Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables

”. This EITF establishes the criteria for recognizing revenue in arrangements
when several items are bundled into one agreement. EITF 00-21 does not allow revenue recognition unless the fair value of the undelivered element(s) is available and the element has stand-alone value to the customer. EITF 00-21 also provides
guidance on allocating the total contract revenue to the individual elements based upon the available fair value of each deliverable. Schlumberger is in the process of determining if this pronouncement will have a material impact on its financial
position or results of operations.



Forward-looking Statements

This 10-K report, the fourth quarter and full year 2002 earnings release, associated web-based publications and other
statements we make contain forward looking statements, which include any statements that are not historical facts, such as our expectations regarding business outlook, economic recovery, improvements in liquidity, expected capex, multi-client and
depreciation and amortization expenditures, the funding of pension plans and related pension expense, the timing and likelihood of NPTest’s initial public offering, conditions in the oilfield service business, including activity levels during
2003, production increases in non-OPEC areas, issues affecting the seismic industry, continued deepwater drilling activity, benefits from contract awards, future results of operations, pricing, future effective tax rates, the realization of cost
reduction and savings in SchlumbergerSema and expectations regarding the future business and performance of SchlumbergerSema resulting from the updated strategy and business realignment. These statements involve risks and uncertainties, including,
but not limited to, the extent and timing of a rebound in the global economy; changes in exploration and production spending by major oil companies; recovery of activity levels; improved pricing and realization of cost reduction and cost savings
targets associated with the seismic business; continuing customer commitment to certain key oilfield projects; general economic and business conditions in key regions of the world, including Argentina and political and economic uncertainty in
Venezuela and further socio-political unrest in the Gulf and/or Asia; changes in business strategy for SchlumbergerSema businesses including the expected growth of Schlumberger IT Consulting and Systems Integration Services and Network and
Infrastructure Solutions in the global energy sector; continuing customer commitment to key long-term services and solutions contracts in our SchlumbergerSema businesses; a reversal of the weak IT environment and a significant increase in IT
spending; the extent and timing of a recovery in the telecommunications industry; continued growth in the demand for smart cards and related products; Schlumberger’s ability to meet its identified liquidity projections, including the generation
of sufficient cash flow from oilfield operating results and the successful completion of certain business divestitures; the adoption and effect of new accounting standards; potential contributions to pension plans and other factors detailed in our
fourth quarter and full year 2002 earnings release; and our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize (or the consequences of such a
development changes), or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from those forecasted or expected. Schlumberger disclaims any intention or obligation to update publicly or revise such statements, whether
as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Item 7A

Quantitative & Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Schlumberger does not believe it has a material exposure to financial market risk. Schlumberger manages the exposure to interest rate changes by using a
mix of debt maturities and variable- and fixed-rate debt together with interest rate swaps, where appropriate, to fix or lower borrowing costs. With regard to foreign currency fluctuations, Schlumberger enters into various contracts, which change in
value as foreign exchange rates change, to protect the value of external and intercompany transactions in foreign currencies. Schlumberger does not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes.

Schlumberger Oilfield Services has operations in Venezuela which represented
about 4% of the 2002 Oilfield Services operating revenue. In light of the present labor unrest in Venezuela, Schlumberger is reviewing its potential currency and business exposure, and taking appropriate steps to minimize the risks. While the
ultimate loss is not determinable at this time, such loss will not have a significant effect on Schlumberger’s consolidated financial position or liquidity.

Principles of
Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include
the accounts of majority-owned subsidiaries. Significant 20% - 50% owned companies are carried on the equity method and classified in

Investments in Affiliated Companies

. The pro rata share of Schlumberger after-tax earnings is included in

Interest and Other Income

. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Reclassifications

Certain items from prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis,
Schlumberger evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, valuation of inventories and investments, recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets, income tax provision and deferred taxes, profit assumptions on long-term
percentage-of-completion contracts, contingencies and litigation and actuarial assumptions for employee benefit plans. Schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of



which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Revenue Recognition

Products and Services Revenue

Schlumberger’s products and services are generally sold based upon purchase orders or contracts with the customer that include fixed or determinable prices and that do not include right of return or other similar provisions or
other significant post delivery obligations. Revenue is recognized for products upon delivery, customer acceptance and when title passes. Revenue is recognized when services are rendered and collectibility is reasonably assured.

Certain revenues are recognized on a time and materials basis, or on a
percentage of completion basis, depending on the contract, as services are provided. Revenue from time and material service contracts is recognized as the services are provided. Revenue from fixed price contracts is recognized over the contract term
based on the percentage of the cost of services provided during the period compared to the total estimated cost of services to be provided over the entire contract. Losses on contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes
probable and reasonably estimated.

Software Revenue

Revenue derived from the sale of licenses for its software,
maintenance and related services may include installation, consulting and training services.

If services are not essential to the functionality of the software, the revenue for each element of the contract is recognized separately based on its respective vendor specific objective evidence of
fair value when all of the following conditions are met: a signed contract is obtained, delivery has occurred, fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is probable.

If an ongoing vendor obligation exists under the license arrangement, or if any uncertainties with regard to customer
acceptance are significant, revenue for the related element is deferred based on its vendor specific objective evidence of fair value. Vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is determined as being the price for the element when sold
separately. If vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements, all revenue is deferred until sufficient evidence exists or all elements have been delivered.

Multiple Element Arrangement and Collectibility

Many sales are generated from complex contractual arrangements that require
significant revenue recognition judgments, particularly in the areas of multiple element arrangements. Revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements, such as those including installation and integration services, are recognized as each
element is earned based on the relative fair value of each element and when there are no undelivered elements that are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements.

The assessment of collectibility is particularly critical in determining whether revenue should be recognized in the current
market environment. As part of the revenue recognition process, Schlumberger determines whether trade and notes receivables are reasonably assured of collection based on various factors, including the ability to sell those receivables and whether
there has been deterioration in the credit quality of customers that could result in the inability to sell the receivables. In situations where Schlumberger has the ability to sell the receivables without recourse, revenue is recognized to the
extent of the value Schlumberger could reasonably expect to realize from the sale. Schlumberger defers revenue and related costs when it is uncertain as to whether it will be able to collect or sell the receivable. Schlumberger defers revenue but
recognizes costs when it determines that the collection or sale of the receivable is unlikely.



Translation of Non-US Currencies

The Oilfield Services segment functional currency is primarily the US dollar. The SchlumbergerSema segment and Other segment
functional currencies are primarily local currencies. All assets and liabilities recorded in functional currencies other than US dollars are translated at current exchange rates. The resulting adjustments are charged or credited directly to the

Stockholders’ Equity

section of the

Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Revenue and expenses are translated at the weighted-average exchange rates for the period. All realized and unrealized transaction gains and losses are included in
income in the period in which they occur. Schlumberger’s policy is to hedge against unrealized gains and losses on a monthly basis. Included in the 2002 results were transaction losses of $2 million, compared with losses of $7 million and $4
million in 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Currency exchange
contracts are entered into as a hedge against the effect of future settlement of assets and liabilities denominated in other than the functional currency of the individual businesses. Gains or losses on the contracts are recognized when the currency
exchange rates fluctuate, and the resulting charge or credit partially offsets the unrealized currency gains or losses on those assets and liabilities. On December 31, 2002, contracts were outstanding for the US dollar equivalent of $1,594 million
in various foreign currencies. These contracts mature on various dates in 2003.

Investments

Both short-term investments
and fixed income investments, held to maturity comprise primarily eurodollar time deposits, certificates of deposit and commercial paper, euronotes and eurobonds, substantially all denominated in US dollars. They are stated at cost plus accrued
interest, which approximates market. Substantially all the investments designated as held to maturity that were purchased and matured during the year had original maturities of less than three months. Short-term investments that are designated as
trading are stated at market. The unrealized gains/losses on such securities at December 31, 2002 were not significant.

For purposes of the

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows

, Schlumberger does not consider short-term investments to be cash equivalents as they
generally have original maturities in excess of three months.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at
average cost or at market, whichever is lower. Inventory consists of materials, supplies and finished goods.

Fixed Assets and Depreciation

Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, which is provided for by charges to income over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method. Fixed assets include the manufacturing
cost (average cost) of oilfield technical equipment manufactured or assembled by subsidiaries of Schlumberger. Expenditures for renewals, replacements and improvements are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expenses as
incurred. Upon sale or other disposition, the applicable amounts of asset cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the net amount, less proceeds from disposal, is charged or credited to income.

Multiclient Seismic Data

Schlumberger capitalizes the cost of obtaining multiclient surveys. Such
costs are charged to

Cost of goods sold and services

based on a percentage of estimated total revenue that Schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data. The carrying value of individual surveys is reviewed, at least annually,
and adjustments to the value are made based upon the revised estimated revenues for the surveys.

Capitalized Software

The costs incurred for the development of computer software that will be sold, leased or otherwise marketed are capitalized when technological feasibility has been established, generally when all of the planning, designing, coding
and testing activities that are necessary in order to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications including functions, features and technical performance requirements are completed. These capitalized costs are
subject to an ongoing assessment of recoverability



based on anticipated future revenues and changes in hardware and software technologies. Costs that are capitalized include direct labor and
related overheads.

Amortization of capitalized software
development costs begins when the product is available for general release. Amortization is provided on the lesser of a product-by-product basis on the straight-line method or the sales ratio method over the estimated useful life. Unamortized
capitalized software development costs determined to be in excess of the net realizable value of the product are expensed immediately.

Schlumberger capitalizes certain costs of internally developed software. Capitalized costs include purchased materials and services, payroll and payroll
related costs and interest costs. The costs of internally developed software is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life which is principally 6 years.

Impairment of Long-lived Assets

On an annual basis Schlumberger reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets, including goodwill and intangible
assets. In addition, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the historical cost-carrying value of an asset may no longer be appropriate, a review is performed. Schlumberger assesses recoverability of the carrying value of the
asset by estimating the future net cash flows expected to result from the asset, including eventual disposition. If the future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference
between the asset’s carrying value and fair value.

In
accordance with SFAS 142 (

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

), which was adopted by Schlumberger commencing January 1, 2002, goodwill ceased to be amortized.

Taxes on Income

Schlumberger and its subsidiaries compute taxes on income in accordance with the tax rules and regulations of the many taxing authorities where the income
is earned. The income tax rates imposed by these taxing authorities vary substantially. Taxable income may differ from pretax income for financial accounting purposes. To the extent that differences are due to revenue or expense items reported in
one period for tax purposes and in another period for financial accounting purposes, an appropriate provision for deferred income taxes is made. Any effect of changes in income tax rates or tax laws are included in the provision for income taxes in
the period of enactment. When it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future, Schlumberger provides a corresponding valuation allowance against deferred tax assets.

Approximately $2.5 billion of consolidated income retained for use in the
business on December 31, 2002 represented undistributed earnings of consolidated subsidiaries and the pro rata Schlumberger share of 20%-50% owned companies. No provision is made for deferred income taxes on those earnings considered to be
indefinitely reinvested or earnings that would not be taxed when remitted.

Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per
share is calculated by dividing net income by the average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the average number of common shares outstanding assuming dilution, the
calculation of which assumes that all stock options and warrants which are in the money are exercised at the beginning of the period and the proceeds used, by Schlumberger, to purchase shares at the average market price for the period. The following
is a reconciliation from basic earnings per share to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for each of the last three years:




There is no dilution of shares or earnings per share in 2002 due to the net loss.

Adjusted Net Income

The following is a reconciliation of reported net income (loss) to adjusted net income (loss) following the adoption of SFAS 142 (

Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

) on January 1, 2002 – see

New Accounting Standards

below.

Research &
Engineering

All research and engineering expenditures are
expensed as incurred, including costs relating to patents or rights that may result from such expenditures. Included in 2001 expenditures was a charge of $25 million for in-process R&D related to the Bull CP8 acquisition.

New Accounting Standards

In June 2001, SFAS 141 (

Business Combinations

) and SFAS 142
(

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

) were issued. SFAS 141 was adopted by Schlumberger for acquisitions subsequent to June 30, 2001. SFAS 142 was adopted by Schlumberger commencing January 1, 2002. As required by SFAS 142, Schlumberger
undertook an initial review of goodwill impairment in the first quarter of 2002 and completed an “event driven” review in the fourth quarter of 2002. The findings of the independent valuation indicated there was



an impairment writedown of $2.6 billion which was approved by the Board of Directors in December 2002 in conjunction with the approval of the
new strategic plan for SchlumbergerSema.

Amortization of
goodwill and workforce ceased with effect from January 1, 2002. Assembled workforce, net of deferred taxes, of $175 million was reclassified to

Goodwill

.

Amortization of goodwill and other intangibles included in Schlumberger’s results are as follows:

In June 2001, SFAS 143
(

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

) was issued. SFAS 143 will be adopted by Schlumberger commencing January 1, 2003. Schlumberger does not believe that the implementation of this standard will have any material effect on its
financial position and results of operations.

In August 2001,
SFAS 144 (

Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

) was issued. SFAS 144 was adopted by Schlumberger commencing January 1, 2002 and did not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations.

Effective January 1, 2002, Schlumberger adopted the FASB EITF
Abstract 01-14, (

Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for “Out-of-Pocket” Expenses Incurred

). Prior year revenue has been restated to include reimbursable costs billed to customers which had been classified
as a contra expense and now must be classified as revenue. The reclassification was only required in the Oilfield Services (OFS) segment as the SchlumbergerSema segment was already in compliance with the new standard. OFS

operating revenue

and

cost of goods sold & services

increased in 2001 by $557 million and in 2000 by $416 million. There was no effect on cash flow or net income.

On July 29, 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 146 (

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities

). The
standard required companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. Examples of costs covered by the standard include lease
termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring, discontinued operation, plant closing, or other exit or disposal activity. Previous accounting guidance was provided by EITF Issue No. 94-3,
(

Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity [including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring])

. SFAS 146 replaced Issue 94-3. Schlumberger will apply SFAS 146 prospectively to exit
or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. As a result, in the future, charges related to restructuring plans may be recorded over multiple reporting periods as opposed to the date the plan was approved.

In November 2002, FASB Interpretation No. 45 (

Guarantor’s Accounting
and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others

) was issued. It requires certain accounting and disclosures of guarantees to third parties including indebtedness. The statement is effective on
a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. Schlumberger does not believe that the implementation of this statement will have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations.

In January 2003, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued No. 00-21
“

Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables

”. This EITF establishes the criteria for recognizing revenue in arrangements when several items are bundled into one agreement. EITF 00-21 does not allow revenue
recognition unless the fair value of the undelivered element(s) is available and the element has stand-alone value to the customer. EITF 00-21 also provides guidance on allocating the total contract revenue to the



individual elements based upon the available fair value of each deliverable. Schlumberger is in the process of determining if this
pronouncement will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

Hanover Compressor Transaction

In August 2001, Schlumberger sold its Oilfield Services worldwide gas compression activity to Hanover Compressor Company. The proceeds included common stock of Hanover Compressor, with a value at
closing of $173 million, which is restricted from marketability until August 30, 2004 and a $150 million long-term subordinated note maturing December 15, 2005.

The market value of Schlumberger’s investment in Hanover Compressor common stock was $80 million as of December 31,
2002. Following the decline in the market value of the stock below carrying value during the second quarter of 2002, Schlumberger has performed, and continues to perform, a periodic assessment in accordance with its policy to determine whether an
other-than-temporary decline in fair value has occurred. Schlumberger evaluated the recoverability of its investment by reviewing recent information related to the industry and the operating results and financial position of Hanover Compressor and
by considering Schlumberger’s requirement, ability and intent to hold the investment on a long-term basis. Schlumberger concluded that evidence existed at December 31, 2002 to support the recoverability of its carrying value, that there were no
events or changes in circumstances specifically relating to the business prospects of Hanover Compressor, that the underlying business fundamentals are good with natural gas supplies reduced and higher natural gas prices in North America, that the
decline in the market value of the stock is consistent with historical industry volatility and is largely attributable to the general market conditions. In addition, the recently announced Hanover cutbacks in workforce and capital expenditures
coupled with no immediate debt maturities should provide adequate capital resources in the near-term. Schlumberger views the recent changes to Hanover Compressor’s senior management team as positive with respect to its investment. Accordingly,
Schlumberger concluded that the decline in market value of its investment ($93 million) in Hanover Compressor as of December 31, 2002 was temporary in nature and has not reduced the cost basis of that investment. If the decline in value persists or
should Schlumberger’s assessment change, Schlumberger would take a charge to its earnings for the amount that is deemed unrecoverable.

The $150 million long-term subordinated note has a mandatory prepayment upon the issuance, sale or other disposition by Hanover Compressor of any shares
of capital stock or other equity interests pursuant to a public offering or a private placement otherwise prepayment is discretionary. As of December 31, 2002, Schlumberger considers the carrying value of the note to be fully collectible.

As part of the sale agreement, Schlumberger agreed that the
financing of the PIGAP II joint venture in Venezuela would be non-recourse to the buyer and would be executed prior to December 31, 2002. Accordingly, Schlumberger was obligated, with respect to the financing, to guarantee 30% (approximately $80
million) until the project was completed in 2002 and, if as of December 31, 2002, refinancing had not become non-recourse to the buyer or the project had not achieved substantial completion, Hanover Compressor had an option to put its interest in
the joint venture back to Schlumberger.

As Schlumberger
originally deferred the gain on the sale of the joint venture in 2001, there would be no impact on Schlumberger results of operations if Hanover Compressor were to exercise its option.

Subsequent event (unaudited)

As an outcome of the turmoil in Venezuela, although the project reached substantial completion, the non-recourse financing
for the project was not achieved by December 31, 2002. On January 30, 2003, Hanover Compressor gave notice of its intention to exercise its right to put its ownership interest in the joint venture back to Schlumberger. The put is subject to certain
consents and other conditions. Schlumberger’s obligation to provide a guarantee with respect to the financing was eliminated.



Charges –
Continuing Operations

Schlumberger recorded the
following charges/credits in continuing operations:

In December
2002, a net charge of $3,081 million ($5.30 per share). On December 10, 2002, Schlumberger announced that the Board of Directors had approved an updated strategy for its SchlumbergerSema business segment. The new strategic plan outlook, current
business values and the reorganization of SchlumbergerSema constitute significant events that required an impairment analysis to be performed in accordance with FAS 142. SchlumbergerSema was ‘valued’ on a stand-alone basis; each reporting
unit within SchlumbergerSema was valued using a discounted cash flow analysis based on a long-term forecast prepared by SchlumbergerSema management with the assistance of a third party valuation expert. The implied multiples yielded by the
discounted cash flow analysis were compared to observed trading multiples of comparable companies and recent transactions in the IT services industry to assess the fair value of the reporting units. The fair value was below the book value. As a
result, goodwill was written down to its estimated fair value based on Schlumberger’s valuation. The impairment of goodwill mainly reflects the current difficulties of the telecommunications industry and the severely depressed market values of
the IT companies serving SchlumbergerSema’s sector. Certain intangible assets were also identified and written down as part of this process.

Schlumberger recorded severance, facility and other costs in an effort to reduce costs at SchlumbergerSema and WesternGeco. These costs related to
expenses that offer no future benefit to the ongoing operations of these businesses. During the fourth quarter, Schlumberger also recorded an impairment charge, to reflect a change in the business projections of the WesternGeco business, related to
capitalized multiclient seismic library costs, a deferred tax valuation allowance and other costs.

The total of the above charges was $3,168 million. A summary, including the gain on the sale of drilling rigs of $87 million, is as follows:


Includes deferred tax valuation allowance of $94 million.

The above charges before tax and minority interest and the gain on sale of drilling rigs are recorded in

Cost of goods sold & services

.

In March 2002, a charge of $29 million (pretax $30 million and
minority interest credit of $1 million; $0.05 per share – diluted) related to the financial/economic crisis in Argentina where in January, the government eliminated all US dollar contracts and



converted US dollar denominated accounts receivable into pesos. As a result, Schlumberger’s currency exposure increased significantly.
With currency devaluation, an exchange loss (net of hedging) on net assets, primarily customer receivables, was incurred. In addition, a provision was recorded for downsizing facilities and headcount. The small SchlumbergerSema exposure in Argentina
was also provided for. The pretax change is classified in

Cost of goods sold and services

in the

Consolidated Statement of Income

.

In March 2001, a charge of $25 million ($0.04 per share – diluted) for in-process research and development related to the Bull CP8 acquisition.

In June 2001, a charge of $280 million ($0.48 per share –
diluted) for the estimated impairment charge from the disposition of certain Resource Management Services businesses (Electricity and Water outside North America and worldwide Gas businesses). This charge included the writeoff of goodwill ($139
million) and cumulative translation adjustment ($79 million).

In
September 2001, a pretax credit of $42 million (after tax $3 million) representing the gain on the sale of the worldwide gas compression business, partially offset by an impairment charge relating to the expected disposition of certain activities.
The proceeds from the sale of the worldwide gas compression business included $274 million in cash, a $150 million long-term subordinated note and newly issued Hanover Compressor Company shares with a value of $173 million. The shares have a three
year marketability restriction. As part of the transaction, Schlumberger agreed that the financing of a certain joint venture project (PIGAP II) would be non-recourse to the buyer and would be executed prior to December 31, 2002. Accordingly,
Schlumberger was obligated with respect to the financing to guarantee 30% (approximately $80 million) until the project was completed in late 2002. If as of December 31, 2002 refinancing had not become non-recourse to the buyer or the project has
not achieved substantial completion, the buyer has an option to put its interest in such joint venture back to Schlumberger. The gain on the sale of this joint venture was deferred.

In December 2001, a pretax credit of $119 million (net – $5 million after tax and minority interest, $0.01 per share
– diluted), consisting primarily of the following:

n

A credit of $223 million ($117 million after tax) from the sale of the former Resource Management Services North American Water division.

n

A pretax charge of $43 million ($37 million after tax) for employee termination costs, principally in Europe and the US, related to Oilfield Services and
SchlumbergerSema in response to the prevailing business conditions.

n

A tax charge for reorganization costs of $29 million.

n

A further pretax charge of $28 million ($20 million after tax) related to the second quarter estimated loss on the divestiture of certain Resource Management
Services businesses following the actual closing in the fourth quarter.

n

A $33 million pretax asset writedown ($23 million after tax and minority interest) for technological impairment related to certain Land seismic assets in the newly
formed joint venture.

The above 2001 pretax
amounts are recorded: an aggregated $119 million charge in

Cost of goods sold and services

, a $25 million charge in

Research & engineering

and a $10 million credit in

Minority interest

.

In December 2000, a pretax charge of $84 million offset by a pretax gain of
$82 million (net – $3 million after tax and minority interest, $0.00 per share – diluted), consisting of the following:

n

A charge of $29 million ($25 million after tax) related primarily to the writedown of certain inventory and severance costs in the semiconductor business due to weak
market conditions.



n

A charge of $55 million ($39 million after tax and minority interest) related to the creation of the WesternGeco seismic joint venture, including asset impairments
and severance costs for Schlumberger’s existing Geco-Prakla business.

n

A credit of $82 million ($61 million after tax) resulting from the gain on the sale of two Gas Services businesses in Europe. Revenue and operating net results for
these divested activities were $110 million and a $740,000 loss, respectively, in 2000 (10 months) and $163 million and $2.7 million profit, respectively in 1999.

The pretax gain on the sale of the Gas Services businesses is included in

An analysis of the December 2002 pretax severance and facility charges is as
follows:

The remaining severance
costs are expected to be paid before September 30, 2003.

The
December 2001 charge included severance costs of $41 million (775 people) which have been paid.

The December 2000 charges included severance costs of $9 million (380 people) which have been paid.

Acquisitions

Acquisition of Sema plc

On February 12, 2001, Schlumberger announced that it had reached an agreement with the board of directors of Sema plc on the terms of a recommended offer
for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Sema plc.

On March 8, 2001, a wholly owned subsidiary of Schlumberger acquired, through market purchases, approximately 20% of the issued share capital of Sema at a cost of $1 billion.

On April 6, 2001, the offer for the shares of Sema plc was declared
unconditional in all respects. The aggregate consideration for the acquisition of 100% of the issued Sema shares was $5.15 billion (including expenses of the transaction) which was financed from existing cash resources and borrowings under a $3
billion credit facility.

On October 3, 2001, wholly owned
subsidiaries of Schlumberger issued $1.9 billion European bonds (Euro 1.4 billion and £425 million). The average rate of these bonds is 5.9% with maturity from 2008 through 2032. The proceeds from the issues were used to repay short-term bank
loans originally taken out by those subsidiaries to finance the acquisition of Sema plc.

The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the goodwill and identifiable intangibles aggregated $5.19 billion which were being amortized on a straight-line basis in 2001. Effective January
1, 2002, with the adoption of SFAS 142 (see

New Accounting Standards

), amortization of goodwill and workforce ceased. Identifiable intangibles continue to be amortized on a straight-line basis over 10 years.

The aggregate value of goodwill and identifiable intangibles comprised the
following:



Purchase accounting
adjustments consisted primarily of severance costs ($84 million – 1781 people), facility reductions ($33 million), pension plan adjustments ($136 million) and tax restructuring costs ($50 million). At December 31, 2001, $26 million (593 people)
of the severance costs had been paid. All remaining severance costs were paid in 2002.

For financial reporting purposes, Schlumberger included the results of operations of Sema in its consolidated accounts commencing April 1, 2001. If Sema had been included in the consolidated financial statements of
Schlumberger from January 1, consolidated revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2001 would have increased by $538 million (unaudited) to $14.3 billion (unaudited) and consolidated net income would have decreased by approximately $140
million (unaudited), to $382 million (unaudited), related primarily to increased interest expense and amortization of intangibles, and lower interest income. On a proforma basis, Schlumberger 2000 operating revenue and net income would have been $12
billion (unaudited) and $300 million (unaudited), respectively.

Sema is an IT services company (with approximately 22,000 employees at the date of acquisition) that provides its customers with design, implementation, operations and management of information systems and IT-related consulting
services. Among the industry sectors which Sema serves, Sema has increasingly focused on the telecommunications and finance sectors, and provides a range of its own software products specifically designed for these sectors in addition to its IT
services. Sema’s customers include a wide variety of businesses and governmental departments around the world. Sema’s services and product offerings include systems integration and consulting; software products for the telecommunications,
energy, transport and finance sectors; and outsourcing.

Long-term Debt

A summary of long-term debt by currency at December 31 follows:

During January 2002, two
principal subsidiaries of Schlumberger in Europe initiated a Euro commercial paper program, which is guaranteed by Schlumberger Limited and supported by a long-term credit facility. Commercial paper borrowings are classified as long-term debt to the
extent of their backup by available and unused committed facilities maturing in more than one year and the intent to maintain these obligations for longer than one year.

On April 4, 2002, the principal US subsidiary of Schlumberger issued $1 billion of 10 year notes with a coupon rate of 6.50%
in the US market. The notes were issued under rule 144A without registration rights for life. The fair market value at December 31, 2002 was $1,112 million.

At December 31, 2002, the borrowings in euro included $881 million of bonds at 5.25% due in 2008 and $518 million of bonds at 5.875% due in 2011 issued in
the Euro market by the principal subsidiary in France. The aggregate fair market value at December 31, 2002 was $1,483 million.

At December 31, 2002, the borrowings in UK pound included $398 million of bonds at 6.25% due in 2008 and $278 million of bonds at 6.50% due in 2032 issued
in the Euro market by the principal subsidiary in the UK. The aggregate fair market value at December 31, 2002 was $734 million.

The remainder of the long-term debt is at variable interest rates. Such rates are reset every six months or sooner. The carrying value of this long-term
debt on December 31, 2002 approximates its fair market value. The weighted-average interest rate of the total debt outstanding on December 31, 2002 was 5.0%, including the effect of the interest rate swaps discussed below.

Long-term debt on December 31, 2002, is due as follows: $410 million in 2004,
$355 million in 2005, $315 million in 2006, $1,835 million in 2007 and $3,114 million thereafter.

On December 31, 2002, interest rate swap arrangements outstanding were: pay fixed/receive floating on US dollar debt of $800 million; pay fixed/receive floating on Japanese yen debt of $67 million.
These arrangements mature at various dates to December 2009. Interest rate swap arrangements increased consolidated interest expense in 2002 by $37 million.

Lines of Credit

On December 31, 2002, wholly owned subsidiaries of Schlumberger had separate lines of credit agreements aggregating $7.7 billion with commercial banks, of
which $7.3 billion was committed and $3.7 billion was available and unused. It included $4.6 billion of committed facilities which support borrowings under commercial paper programs in the United States and Europe, of which $3.6 billion matures in
January 2007 and $1 billion which matured in January 2003 was renewed for $500 million. Interest rates and other terms of borrowing under these lines of credit vary from country to country.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

Commencing January 1, 2001, Schlumberger adopted SFAS 133 (Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities). Schlumberger uses derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps, currency



swaps, forward currency contracts and foreign currency options. Forward currency contracts provide a hedge against currency fluctuations on
assets/liabilities denominated in other than a functional currency. Options are usually entered into as a hedge against currency variations on firm commitments generally involving the construction of long-lived assets.

Schlumberger maintains a foreign-currency risk management strategy that uses
derivative instruments to protect its interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates. Movements in foreign currency exchange rates pose a risk to Schlumberger’s operations as
exchange rate changes may affect profitability and cash flow. Schlumberger uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts, swaps and options. Schlumberger also maintains an interest rate risk management strategy that uses fixed rate debt and
derivatives to minimize significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations caused by interest rate volatility.

Schlumberger’s specific goals are (1) to manage interest rate sensitivity by modifying the repricing or maturity characteristics of certain of its debt and (2) to lower (where possible) the cost
of borrowed funds.

By using derivative financial instruments to
hedge exposure to changes in exchange rates and interest rates, Schlumberger exposes itself to credit risk and market risk. Schlumberger minimizes the credit risk by entering into transactions with high-quality counterparties, limiting the exposure
to each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of its counterparties. Market risk is managed through the setting and monitoring of parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk which are acceptable.

At December 31, 2002, Schlumberger recognized a net $83 million charge in
Stockholders’ Equity relating to derivative instruments and hedging activities. This charge was primarily due to the change in the fair market value of Schlumberger’s US interest rate swaps as a result of declining interest rates.

Capital Stock

Schlumberger is authorized to issue 1,500,000,000 shares of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of which 582,173,115 and 575,890,398 shares were outstanding on December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Schlumberger is also authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of cumulative preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share,
which may be issued in series with terms and conditions determined by the Board of Directors. No shares of preferred stock have been issued. Holders of common stock and preferred stock are entitled to one vote for each share of stock held.

Stock Compensation Plans

As of December 31, 2002, Schlumberger had two types of stock-based
compensation plans, which are described below. Schlumberger applies APB Opinion 25 and related Interpretations in accounting for its plans. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for its stock option plans and its stock purchase plan.
Had compensation cost for the stock-based Schlumberger plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under those plans, consistent with the method of SFAS 123, Schlumberger net income and earnings per share would have
been the pro forma amounts indicated below:



Stock Option Plans

During 2002, 2001, 2000 and in prior years, officers and
key employees were granted stock options under Schlumberger stock option plans. For all of the stock options granted, the exercise price of each option equals the market price of Schlumberger stock on the date of grant; an option’s maximum term
is ten years, and options generally vest in 20% increments over five years.

As required by SFAS 123, the fair value of each grant is estimated on the date of grant using the multiple option Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions used for 2002, 2001 and 2000:
dividend of $0.75; expected volatility of 32-36% for 2002 grants, 32-35% for 2001 grants and 27-33% for 2000 grants; risk-free interest rates for the 2002 grants of 4.34%-5.25% for officers and 3.04%-4.73% for the 2002 grants to all other employees;
risk-free interest rates for the 2001 grants of 4.91% for officers and 3.87%-5.01% for the 2001 grants to all other employees; risk-free interest rates for the 2000 grants of 5.75%-6.84% for officers and 5.69%-6.72% for the 2000 grants to all other
employees; and expected option lives of 6.6 years for officers and 5.07 years for other employees for 2002 grants, expected option lives of 5.51 years for officers and 5.02 years for other employees for 2001 grants, expected option lives of 7.16
years for officers and 5.49 years for other employees for 2000 grants.

A summary of the status of the Schlumberger stock option plans as of December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, and changes during the years ending on those dates is presented below:

The following table
summarizes information concerning currently outstanding and exercisable options by five ranges of exercise prices on December 31, 2002:



Employee Stock Purchase
Plan

Under the Schlumberger Discounted Stock Purchase Plan,
Schlumberger is authorized to issue up to 22,012,245 shares of common stock to its employees. Under the terms of the Plan, employees can choose each year to have up to 10% of their annual earnings withheld to purchase Schlumberger common stock. The
purchase price of the stock is 85% of the lower of its beginning or end of the Plan year market price. Under the Plan, Schlumberger sold 2,677,842, 1,752,833 and 1,431,309 shares to employees in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Proforma
compensation cost has been computed for the fair value of the employees’ purchase rights, which was estimated using the Black-Scholes model with the following assumptions for 2002, 2001 and 2000: Dividend of $0.75; expected life of one year;
expected volatility of 34% for 2002, 36% for 2001 and 38% for 2000; and risk-free interest rates of 1.74% for 2002, 3.03% for 2001, 5.71% for 2000. The weighted-average fair value of those purchase rights granted in 2002, 2001 and 2000, was $13.324,
$15.540 and $23.141, respectively.

Income Tax Expense

Schlumberger and its subsidiaries operate in more than 100
taxing jurisdictions where statutory tax rates generally vary from 0% to 50%.

In 2002, pretax book income in the US included gains from a business divestiture aggregating approximately $143 million. Pretax book income from continuing operations subject to US and non-US income taxes for each of the three years
ended December 31, was as follows:

Schlumberger has net
deferred tax assets of $583 million on December 31, 2002 including a partial valuation allowance of $147 million relating to a certain European net operating loss, and $488 million on December 31, 2001. Significant components of net deferred tax
assets at December 31, 2002 included postretirement and other long-term benefits ($200 million), current employee benefits ($225 million), fixed assets, inventory and other ($123 million) and net operating losses ($182 million less a partial
valuation allowance of $147 million). At December 31, 2001, it included postretirement and other long-term benefits ($186 million), current employee benefits ($93 million), fixed assets, inventory and other ($120 million) and net operating losses
($49 million).

The components of consolidated income tax expense
from continuing operations were as follows:



Schlumberger reported several
charges/credits in continuing operations in each of the three years. These are more fully described in the note

Charges – Continuing Operations

on page 45. A reconciliation of the US statutory federal tax rate (35%) to the consolidated
effective tax rate is:

Schlumberger’s
effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 26%, 32% and 23% in 2002, 2001 and 2000 respectively.

Leases and Lease Commitments

Total rental expense was $458 million in 2002, $390 million in 2001 and $287 million in 2000. Future minimum rental commitments under noncancelable leases for years ending December 31 are: $219 million
in 2003; $187 million in 2004; $130 million in 2005; $109 million in 2006; and $117 million in 2007. For the ensuing three five-year periods, these commitments decrease from $309 million to $19 million. The minimum rentals over the remaining terms
of the leases aggregate to $29 million.

Contingencies

The Consolidated Balance Sheet includes accruals for the
estimated future costs associated with certain environmental remediation activities related to the past use or disposal of hazardous materials. Substantially all such costs relate to divested operations and to facilities or locations that are no
longer in operation. Due to a number of uncertainties, including uncertainty of timing, the scope of remediation, future technology, regulatory changes, the risk of personal injury, natural resource or property damage claims and other factors, it is
possible that the ultimate remediation costs may exceed the amounts estimated. However, in the opinion of management, such additional costs are not expected to be material relative to consolidated liquidity, financial position or future results of
operations.

In addition, Schlumberger and its subsidiaries are
party to various other legal proceedings. Although the ultimate disposition of these proceedings is not presently determinable, in the opinion of Schlumberger any liability that might ensue would not be material in relation to the consolidated
liquidity, financial position or future results of operations.

Schlumberger’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and receivables from clients. Schlumberger places its cash and cash equivalents with financial
institutions and corporations, and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one of them. Schlumberger actively evaluates the creditworthiness of the issuers in which it invests. The receivables from clients are concentrated within a few
significant industries and geographies.



Segment Information

Schlumberger operates three reportable business segments:
Oilfield Services (OFS), SchlumbergerSema (SLSEMA) and Other.

The Oilfield Services segment falls into four clearly defined economic and geographical areas and is evaluated on the following basis: North America is a major self-contained market; Latin America comprises regional markets that
share a common dependence on the United States; Europe is a major self-contained market that includes the CIS and West Africa, whose economy is increasingly linked to that of Europe; Middle East/Asia includes the remainder of the Eastern Hemisphere,
which consists of many countries at different stages of economic development that share a common dependence on the oil and gas industry. The Oilfield Services segment provides virtually all exploration and production services required during the
life of an oil and gas reservoir. Schlumberger believes that all the products/services are interrelated and expects similar performance from each.

The SchlumbergerSema segment falls into three clearly defined economic and geographic areas and is evaluated on the following basis: North and South
America is a major self-contained market; Europe is a major self-contained market that includes the Middle East and Africa; Asia includes the remainder of the Eastern Hemisphere. The SchlumbergerSema segment is a leading information technology
services company providing domain expertise and global capabilities delivered on a local basis. SchlumbergerSema has proven capabilities delivering consulting, systems integration, managed services and products serving the telecommunications, energy
& utilities, finance, transport, public sector markets and oil and gas markets.

The Other segment comprises principally the Cards, Terminals, Meters North America and NPTest activities. In 2001 and 2000, also included are the divested Resource Management Services businesses.

Financial information for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, by
segment, is as follows:



Oilfield Services net
income eliminations include certain headquarters administrative costs which are not allocated geographically, manufacturing and certain other operations, and costs maintained at the Oilfield Services level including the WesternGeco minority interest
expense.

SchlumbergerSema net income eliminations include
certain headquarters administrative costs which are not allocated geographically and other costs maintained at the SchlumbergerSema level.

Corporate income eliminations principally comprise the amortization of goodwill (in 2001 and 2000) and other intangibles, as well as nonoperating
expenses, such as certain intersegment charges and interest expense (except as shown above), which are not included in the segments’ income. Corporate assets largely comprise short-term investments and fixed income investments, held to
maturity.



During the three years ended
December 31, 2002, no single customer exceeded 10% of consolidated revenue.

Schlumberger did not have revenue from third-party customers in its country of domicile during the last three years. In each of the three years, only revenue in the US exceeded 10% of consolidated revenue. Revenue in the US in 2002,
2001 and 2000 was $4.0 billion, $5.1 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively.

Interest expense excludes amounts which are included in the segments’ income (2002 – $4 million: 2001 – $5 million: 2000 – $5 million).

Depreciation & Amortization and Capital Expenditure include Multiclient seismic data costs.

Pension and Other Benefit Plans

US Pension Plans

Schlumberger and its US subsidiary sponsor several defined benefit pension
plans that cover substantially all employees. The benefits are based on years of service and compensation on a career-average pay basis. These plans are funded with a trustee in respect to past and current service. Charges to expense are based upon
costs computed by independent actuaries. The funding policy is to annually contribute amounts that are allowable for federal income tax purposes. These contributions are intended to provide for benefits earned to date and those expected to be earned
in the future.

The assumed discount rate, compensation increases
and return on plan assets used to determine pension expense in 2002 were 7.25%, 3% and 8.5%, respectively. In 2001, the assumptions were 7.5%, 4.5% and 9%, respectively. In 2000, the assumptions were 7.75%, 4.5% and 9%, respectively.

Net pension cost in the US for 2002, 2001 and 2000, included the following
components:

Effective January 1,
2000, Schlumberger and its subsidiaries amended their pension plans to improve retirement benefits for active employees.



The change in the projected
benefit obligation, plan assets and funded status of the plans on December 31, 2002 and 2001, was as follows:

The market performance
over the last two years has decreased the value of assets held in the US pension plans and has correspondingly increased the amount by which the pension plans are under-funded. As a result of the decline in the value of the pension plan assets and a
decline in the interest rates, which increases the present value of the benefit obligations, Schlumberger recorded in the fourth quarter a non-cash charge to

Stockholders’ Equity

of $224 million. A recovery in market returns in future
periods would reverse a portion of the charge.

The assumed
discount rate, the rate of compensation increases and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used to determine the projected benefit obligations were 6.75%, 3% and 8.5%, respectively, in 2002, and 7.25%, 4.5% and 9%, respectively, in
2001. Plan assets, excluding the contribution receivable, on December 31, 2002, consisted of common stocks ($524 million), cash or cash equivalents ($98 million), fixed income investments ($228 million) and other investments ($52 million). On
December 31, 2002, there is no investment of the plan assets in Schlumberger common stock.

Non-US Pension Plans

Outside the US, subsidiaries of Schlumberger sponsor several defined benefit and defined contribution plans that cover substantially all employees who are not covered by statutory plans. For defined benefit plans, charges to expense
are based upon costs computed by independent actuaries. These plans are funded with trustees in respect to past and current service. For all defined benefit plans, pension expense was $58 million, $52 million and $23 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. Based on plan assets and the projected benefit obligation, the only significant defined benefit plan is in the UK.



The assumed discount rate,
compensation increases and return on plan assets used to determine pension expense in 2002 were 5.75%, 4.0% and 9.0% respectively. In 2001, the assumptions were 6%, 4% and 9%, respectively.

Net pension cost in the UK plan for 2002, 2001 (including the Sema plc plans)
and 2000 (translated into US dollars at the average exchange rate for the periods), included the following components:



The change in the projected
benefit obligation, plan assets and funded status of the plan (translated into US dollars at year-end exchange rates) was as follows:

The market performance
over the last two years has decreased the value of assets held in the UK pension plans and has correspondingly increased the amount by which the pension plans are under-funded. As a result of the decline in the value of the pension plan assets and a
decline in the interest rates, which increased the present value of the benefit obligations, Schlumberger recorded in the fourth quarter a non-cash charge to

Stockholders’ Equity

of $90 million. A recovery in market returns in future
periods would reverse a portion of the charge.

The assumed
discount rate and rate of compensation increases used to determine the projected benefit obligation were 5.70% and 3.75%-2.55% respectively in 2002, and 5.75% and 4%, respectively in 2001. Plan assets consisted of common stocks ($610 million), cash
or cash equivalents ($64 million) and fixed income investments ($141 million). None of the segregated plan assets represented Schlumberger common stock.

For defined contribution plans, funding and cost are generally based upon a predetermined percentage of employee compensation. Charges to expense in 2002,
2001 and 2000, were $44 million, $32 million and $22 million, respectively.

Other Deferred Benefits

In addition to
providing pension benefits, Schlumberger and its subsidiaries have other deferred benefit programs, primarily profit sharing. Expenses for these programs were $143 million, $192 million and $114 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.



Health Care Benefits

Schlumberger and its US subsidiary provide health care
benefits for certain active employees. The cost of providing these benefits is recognized as expense when incurred and aggregated $79 million, $68 million and $60 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Outside the US, such benefits are mostly
provided through government-sponsored programs.

Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions

Schlumberger and its US subsidiary provide certain health care benefits to former employees who have retired under the US pension plans.

The principal actuarial assumptions used to measure costs were a discount rate of 7.25% in 2002, 7.5% in 2001 and 7.75% in 2000. The overall medical cost
trend rate assumption is 9.5% graded to 5% over the next six years and 5% thereafter.

Net periodic postretirement benefit cost in the US for 2002, 2001 and 2000, included the following components:

The change in
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and funded status on December 31, 2002 and 2001, was as follows:



The components of the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation on December 31, 2002 and 2001, were as follows:

The assumed discount
rate used to determine the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 6.75% for 2002 and 7.25% for 2001.

If the assumed medical cost trend rate was increased by one percentage point, health care cost in 2002 would have been $76 million, and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation would have been
$806 million on December 31, 2002.

If the assumed medical cost
trend rate was decreased by one percentage point, health care cost in 2002 would have been $52 million, and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation would have been $574 million on December 31, 2002.

To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders

of Schlumberger Limited

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, of stockholders’ equity and of cash
flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Schlumberger Limited and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

are entitled to defer the receipt of the annual stock award until up to one year after their termination as a director. During the period of deferral, non-employee directors are credited with any dividends paid on shares of Schlumberger common stock
in the interim, and such dividends are paid out in cash, without interest at the same time that the shares are ultimately delivered. The Plan is administered by a Committee appointed by the Board.

Controls and Procedures

Within the 90-day period prior to the filing of this Annual Report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of Schlumberger’s management, including the Chief
Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Schlumberger’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a – 14 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that Schlumberger’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Schlumberger in
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. Subsequent to the date of their evaluation, there were
no significant changes in Schlumberger’s internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls.
