Part I, Item 1

PART I

Item 1.

Business.

All references in this report to “Registrant,”
    “Company,” “Schlumberger,” “we” or
    “our” are to Schlumberger Limited (Schlumberger N.V.,
    incorporated in Curaçao) and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Founded in 1926, Schlumberger is the world’s leading
    supplier of technology, integrated project management and
    information solutions to the international oil and gas
    exploration and production industry. Having invented wireline
    logging as a technique for obtaining downhole data in oil and
    gas wells, the Company today provides the industry’s widest
    range of products and services from exploration through
    production. As of December 31, 2010, the Company employed
    approximately 108,000 people of over 140 nationalities
    operating in approximately 80 countries. Schlumberger has
    principal executive offices in Paris, Houston and The Hague.

On August 27, 2010, Schlumberger acquired all of the
    outstanding shares of Smith International, Inc.
    (“Smith”), a leading supplier of premium products and
    services to the oil and gas exploration and production industry.
    In connection with this transaction, Schlumberger issued
    176 million shares of its common stock, valued at
    approximately $9.8 billion as of the acquisition date. As a
    result of this transaction, Schlumberger consists of five
    business segments as of December 31, 2010 –
    Schlumberger Oilfield Services, WesternGeco, M-I SWACO, Smith
    Oilfield and Distribution.

Schlumberger Oilfield Services

operates in each of the
    major oilfield service markets, managing its business through
    its GeoMarket* regions, which are grouped into four geographic
    areas: North America, Latin America, Europe/CIS/Africa and
    Middle East & Asia. The GeoMarket structure offers
    customers a single point of contact at the local level for field
    operations and brings together geographically focused teams to
    meet local needs and deliver customized solutions. Within this
    business structure, Schlumberger Oilfield Services products and
    services are developed by a number of technology-based product
    lines, or Technologies, to capitalize on technical synergies.
    These products and services cover the entire life cycle of the
    reservoir and correspond to a number of markets in which
    Schlumberger Oilfield Services holds leading positions. The
    Technologies are also responsible for overseeing operational
    processes, resource allocation, personnel and quality in the
    GeoMarkets.

The Technologies are:

•

Wireline – provides the information necessary to
    evaluate the subsurface formation rocks and fluids to plan and
    monitor well construction, and to monitor and evaluate well
    production. Wireline offers both open-hole and cased-hole
    services as well as a range of well remediation services.

•

Drilling & Measurements – supplies
    engineering support, directional-drilling,
    measurement-while-drilling and logging-while-drilling services
    for all well profiles.

•

Testing Services – provides exploration and production
    pressure and flow-rate measurement services both at the surface
    and downhole. The Technology also provides tubing-conveyed
    perforating services.

•

Well Services – provides services used during oil and
    gas well drilling and completion as well as those used to
    maintain optimal production throughout the life of a well. The
    services include pressure pumping, well cementing and
    stimulation operations as well as intervention activities. The
    Technology also develops coiled-tubing equipment and services.

•

Completions – supplies well completion services and
    equipment that includes upper and lower completion systems, sand
    management systems and permanently installed instrumentation for
    all types of well completion.

•

Artificial Lift – provides electrical submersible
    pumps and gas lift equipment together with associated
    instrumentation, engineering and production optimization
    services.

•

Data & Consulting Services – supplies
    interpretation and integration of all exploration and production
    data types, as well as expert consulting services for reservoir
    characterization, production enhancement, field development
    planning and multi-disciplinary reservoir and production
    solutions.



Part I, Item 1

•

Schlumberger Information Solutions (SIS) – provides
    consulting, software, information management and IT
    infrastructure services that support core oil and gas industry
    operational processes.

•

Geoservices – supplies mud logging services for
    geological and drilling surveillance. Geological surveillance
    includes formation evaluation to provide information on
    lithology and hydrocarbons encountered while drilling. Drilling
    surveillance enhances safety and optimizes drilling efficiency
    using a range of drilling parameter measurements. Geoservices
    also supplies slickline services for downhole mechanical well
    intervention and reservoir monitoring and downhole data
    acquisition.

Supporting the Technologies are various research and engineering
    centers. Through this organization, Schlumberger is committed to
    advanced technology programs that enhance oilfield efficiency,
    lower finding and producing costs, improve productivity,
    maximize reserve recovery and increase asset value while
    accomplishing these goals in a safe and environmentally sound
    manner.

Schlumberger Oilfield Services also offers customers its
    services through a business model known as Integrated Project
    Management (IPM). IPM combines the required services and
    products of the Technologies with drilling rig management
    expertise and project management skills to provide a complete
    solution to well construction and production improvement. IPM
    projects are typically of multi-year duration and include

start-up

costs and significant third-party components which cover
    services that Schlumberger does not provide directly. Projects
    may be fixed price in nature, contain penalties for
    non-performance and may also offer opportunities for bonus
    payments where performance exceeds agreed targets. IPM also
    provides specialized engineering and project management
    expertise when Schlumberger is requested to include these
    capabilities with services and products across the Technologies
    in a single contract. In no circumstances do IPM projects fail
    to respect the Schlumberger business profile that precludes any
    stake in the ownership of oil or gas reserves.

Schlumberger Oilfield Services uses its own personnel to market
    its offerings. The customer base, business risks and
    opportunities for growth are essentially uniform across all
    services. There is a sharing of manufacturing and engineering
    facilities as well as research centers, and the labor force is
    interchangeable. Technological innovation, quality of service,
    and price differentiation are the principal methods of
    competition, which varies geographically with respect to the
    different services offered. While there are numerous
    competitors, both large and small, Schlumberger believes that it
    is an industry leader in providing wireline logging, well
    testing, measurement-while-drilling, logging-while-drilling and
    directional-drilling services, as well as fully computerized
    logging and geoscience software and computing services. A large
    proportion of Schlumberger offerings is non-rig related;
    consequently, revenue does not necessarily correlate to rig
    count fluctuations.

WesternGeco

, the world’s most technologically
    advanced surface seismic company, provides comprehensive
    reservoir imaging, monitoring and development services with the
    most extensive seismic crews and data processing centers in the
    industry as well as a leading multiclient seismic library.
    Services range from 3D and time-lapse (4D) seismic surveys to
    multi-component surveys for delineating prospects and reservoir
    management. WesternGeco benefits from full access to the
    Schlumberger research, development and technology organization
    and shares similar business risks, opportunities for growth,
    principal methods of competition and means of marketing as
    Schlumberger Oilfield Services. Seismic solutions include
    proprietary single-sensor technologies for enhanced reservoir
    description, characterization and monitoring throughout the life
    of the field – from exploration through enhanced
    recovery. Other WesternGeco solutions include development of
    controlled-source electromagnetic and magneto-telluric surveys

Part I, Item 1

Acquisitions

Information about acquisitions made by Schlumberger appears in
    Note 4 of the

Consolidated Financial Statements

.

GENERAL

Patents

While Schlumberger seeks and holds numerous patents covering
    various products and processes, no particular patent or group of
    patents is considered material to Schlumberger’s business.

Seasonality

Although weather and natural phenomena can temporarily affect
    delivery of oilfield services, the widespread geographic
    location of such services precludes the overall business from
    being characterized as seasonal.

Customers and
    Backlog of Orders

For the year ended December 31, 2010, no single customer
    exceeded 10% of consolidated revenue. Other than WesternGeco, we
    have no significant backlog due to the nature of our businesses.
    The WesternGeco backlog, which is based on signed contracts with
    customers, was $0.9 billion at December 31, 2010
    ($1.0 billion at December 31, 2009).

Employees

As of December 31, 2010, Schlumberger had approximately
    108,000 employees.

Part I, Item 1A

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors.

The following discussion of risk factors contains
    “forward-looking statements,” which are discussed
    immediately following Item 7A. of this

Form 10-K.

These risk factors may be important to understanding any
    statement in this

Form 10-K

or elsewhere. The following information should be read in
    conjunction with Item 7. Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and
    the consolidated financial statements and related notes included
    in this

Form 10-K.

We urge you to consider carefully the risks described below,
    as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the
    SEC and the other information included or incorporated by
    reference in

Form 10-K.

If any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this

Form 10-K

were to materialize, our business, financial condition, results
    of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially
    adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our
    common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of
    your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not
    currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may
    also materially adversely affect our financial condition,
    results of operations and cash flows.

Demand
    for the majority of our services is substantially dependent on
    the levels of expenditures by the oil and gas industry. A
    substantial or an extended decline in oil and gas prices could
    result in lower expenditures by the oil and gas industry, which
    could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
    results of operations and cash flows.

Demand for the majority of our services depends substantially on
    the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the
    exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas
    reserves. These expenditures are generally dependent on the
    industry’s view of future oil and natural gas prices and
    are sensitive to the industry’s view of future economic
    growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural
    gas. Declines, as well as anticipated declines, in oil and gas
    prices could also result in project modifications, delays or
    cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in, or
    nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us. These effects could
    have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and
    cash flows.

The prices for oil and natural gas have historically been
    volatile and may be affected by a variety of factors, including:

•

demand for hydrocarbons, which is affected by worldwide
    population growth, economic growth rates and general economic
    and business conditions;

•

the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
    (“OPEC”) to set and maintain production levels for oil;

•

oil and gas production by non-OPEC countries;

•

the level of excess production capacity;

•

political and economic uncertainty and sociopolitical unrest;

•

the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration and production
    activity;

•

the cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas;

•

technological advances affecting energy consumption; and

•

weather conditions.

The oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic
    downturns, which have been characterized by diminished demand
    for oilfield services and downward pressure on the prices we
    charge. A significant downturn in the oil and gas industry could
    result in a reduction in demand for oilfield services and could
    adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations
    and cash flows.



Part I, Item 1A

A
    significant portion of our revenue is derived from our

non-United

States operations, which exposes us to risks inherent in doing
    business in each of the approximately 80 countries in which we
    operate.

Our

non-United

States operations accounted for approximately 76% of our
    consolidated revenue in 2010, 84% in 2009 and 78% in 2008.
    Operations in countries other than the United States are subject
    to various risks, including:

•

unsettled political and economic conditions in certain areas;

•

exposure to possible expropriation of our assets or other
    governmental actions;

•

social unrest, acts of terrorism, war or other armed conflict;

•

confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies;

•

deprivation of contract rights;

•

trade restrictions or embargoes imposed by the United States or
    other countries;

•

restrictions under the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices
    Act or similar legislation in other countries;

•

restrictions on the repatriation of income or capital;

•

currency exchange controls;

•

inflation; and

•

currency exchange rate fluctuations and devaluations.

In addition, we are subject to risks associated with our
    operations in countries, including Iran, Syria, Sudan and Cuba,
    that are subject to trade and economic sanctions or other
    restrictions imposed by the United States or other governments
    or organizations. United States law enforcement authorities are
    currently conducting a grand jury investigation and an
    associated regulatory inquiry related to our operations in
    certain of these countries. Additionally, in 2009 prior to its
    merger with Schlumberger, Smith received an administrative
    subpoena with respect to its historical business practices in
    certain countries that are subject to United States trade and
    economic sanctions. If any of the risks described above
    materialize, or if any governmental investigation results in
    criminal or civil penalties or other remedial measures, it could
    reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations.

We are also subject to risks related to investment in our common
    stock in connection with certain US state divestment or
    investment limitation legislation applicable to companies with
    operations in these countries, and similar actions by some
    private investors, which could adversely affect the market price
    of our common stock.

Our
    merger with Smith will continue to be dilutive to our earnings
    per share in the near term, which may negatively affect the
    market price of our common stock.

Our merger with Smith will continue to be dilutive to earnings
    per share in the near term. Future events and conditions could
    decrease or delay any accretion, result in dilution or cause
    greater dilution than is currently expected, including adverse
    changes in:

•

energy market conditions;

•

commodity prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids;

•

production levels;

•

reserve levels;

•

operating results;

•

competitive conditions;

•

laws and regulations affecting the energy business;

•

capital expenditure obligations; and

•

general economic conditions.



Part I, Item 1A

Any dilution of, or decrease or delay of any accretion to, our
    earnings per share could cause the price of our common stock to
    decline.

Our
    offshore oil and gas operations could be adversely impacted by
    the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig accident and resulting oil
    spill; changes in and compliance with restrictions or
    regulations on offshore drilling in the US Gulf of Mexico and in
    other areas around the world may adversely affect our business
    and operating results.

On April 20, 2010, a fire and explosion occurred onboard
    the semisubmersible drilling rig

Deepwater Horizon

, owned
    by Transocean Ltd. and under contract to a subsidiary of BP plc.
    As a result of the incident and related oil spill, the Secretary
    of the US Department of the Interior directed the Bureau of
    Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement
    (“BOEMRE”) to issue a suspension, until
    November 30, 2010, of drilling activities for specified
    drilling configurations and technologies. Although this
    moratorium was lifted on October 12, 2010, effective
    immediately, we cannot predict with certainty when drilling
    operations will fully resume in the US Gulf of Mexico. The
    BOEMRE has also issued new guidelines and regulations regarding
    safety, environmental matters, drilling equipment and
    decommissioning applicable to drilling in the US Gulf of Mexico,
    and may take other additional steps that could increase the
    costs of exploration and production, reduce the area of
    operations and result in permitting delays.

At this time, we cannot predict with any certainty what further
    impact, if any, the

Deepwater Horizon

incident may have
    on the regulation of offshore oil and gas exploration and
    development activity, or on the cost or availability of
    insurance coverage to cover the risks of such operations.
    Ongoing effects of and delays from the lifted suspension of
    drilling activity in the US Gulf of Mexico, or the enactment of
    new or stricter regulations in the United States and other
    countries where we operate, could materially adversely affect
    our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Environmental
    compliance costs and liabilities could reduce our earnings and
    cash available for operations.

We are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations
    relating to importation and use of hazardous materials,
    radioactive materials and explosives, environmental protection,
    including laws and regulations governing air emissions, water
    discharges and waste management. We incur, and expect to
    continue to incur, capital and operating costs to comply with
    environmental laws and regulations. The technical requirements
    of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex,
    stringent and expensive to implement. These laws may provide for
    “strict liability” for damages to natural resources or
    threats to public health and safety. Strict liability can render
    a party liable for damages without regard to negligence or fault
    on the part of the party. Some environmental laws provide for
    joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and
    releases of hazardous substances.

We use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our
    operations. In addition, many of our current and former
    properties are, or have been, used for industrial purposes.
    Accordingly, we could become subject to potentially material
    liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of
    contaminated properties, and to claims alleging personal injury
    or property damage as the result of exposures to, or releases
    of, hazardous substances. In addition, stricter enforcement of
    existing laws and regulations, new laws and regulations, the
    discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition
    of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs
    or become the basis of new or increased liabilities that could
    reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations. We
    believe we are currently in substantial compliance with
    environmental laws and regulations.

We could
    be subject to substantial liability claims, which would
    adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations
    and cash flows.

Certain equipment used in the delivery of oilfield services,
    such as directional drilling equipment, perforating systems,
    subsea completion equipment, radioactive materials and
    explosives and well completion systems, are used in hostile
    environments, such as exploration, development and production
    applications. An accident or a failure of a product could cause
    personal injury, loss of life, damage to property, equipment or
    the environment, and suspension of operations. Our insurance may
    not protect us against liability for some kinds of events,
    including events involving pollution, or against losses
    resulting from business interruption. Moreover, in the future we
    may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage
    or policy limits that we deem adequate. Substantial claims made
    under our policies could cause our premiums to increase. Any
    future damages caused by our products that are not covered by
    insurance, or



Part I, Item 1A

are in excess of policy limits or are subject to substantial
    deductibles, could adversely affect our financial condition,
    results of operations and cash flows.

If we are
    unable to maintain technology leadership, this could adversely
    affect any competitive advantage we hold.

If we are unable to develop and produce competitive technology
    or deliver it to our clients in the form of service offerings in
    a timely and cost-competitive manner in the various markets we
    serve, it could adversely affect our financial condition,
    results of operations and cash flows.

Limitations
    on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights,
    including our trade secrets, could cause a loss in revenue and
    any competitive advantage we hold.

Some of our products or services, and the processes we use to
    produce or provide them, have been granted patent protection,
    have patent applications pending or are trade secrets. Our
    business may be adversely affected if our patents are
    unenforceable, the claims allowed under our patents are not
    sufficient to protect our technology, our patent applications
    are denied, or our trade secrets are not adequately protected.
    Our competitors may be able to develop technology independently
    that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or
    gaining access to our trade secrets.

We may be
    subject to litigation if another party claims that we have
    infringed upon its intellectual property rights.

The tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we
    use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual
    property rights of others. Infringement claims generally result
    in significant legal and other costs and may distract management
    from running our core business. Royalty payments under licenses
    from third parties, if available, would increase our costs. If a
    license were not available we might not be able to continue
    providing a particular service or product, which could adversely
    affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flows. Additionally, developing non-infringing technologies
    would increase our costs.

Failure
    to obtain and retain skilled technical personnel could impede
    our operations.

We require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide
    technical services and support for our business. Competition for
    the personnel required for our businesses intensifies as
    activity increases. In periods of high utilization it may become
    more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals. This
    could increase our costs or have other adverse effects on our
    operations.

Severe
    weather conditions may affect our operations.

Our business may be materially affected by severe weather
    conditions in areas where we operate. This may entail the
    evacuation of personnel and stoppage of services. In addition,
    if particularly severe weather affects platforms or structures,
    this may result in a suspension of activities until the
    platforms or structures have been repaired. Any of these events
    could adversely affect our financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flows.

Demand
    for our products and services could be reduced or eliminated by
    governmental regulation or a change in the law.

International, national, and state governments and agencies are
    currently evaluating and promulgating climate-related
    legislation and regulations that are focused on restricting
    greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. In the United
    States, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) is
    taking steps to require monitoring and reporting of GHG
    emissions and to regulate GHGs as pollutants under the Clean Air
    Act (“CAA”). The EPA’s “Mandatory Reporting
    of Greenhouse Gases” rule established a comprehensive
    scheme of regulations that require monitoring and reporting of
    GHG emissions that began in 2010. Furthermore, the EPA recently
    proposed additional GHG reporting rules specifically for the oil
    and gas industry. The EPA has also published a final rule, the
    “Endangerment Finding,” finding that GHGs in the
    atmosphere endanger public health and welfare, and that
    emissions of GHGs from mobile sources cause or



Part I, Item 1A

contribute to the GHG pollution. Following issuance of the
    Endangerment Finding, the EPA promulgated final motor vehicle
    GHG emission standards on April 1, 2010. The EPA has
    asserted that the final motor vehicle GHG emission standards
    will trigger construction and operating permit requirements for
    stationary sources. In addition, climate change legislation is
    pending in the United States Congress. These developments may
    curtail production and demand for fossil fuels such as oil and
    gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus
    adversely affect future demand for our services, which may in
    turn adversely affect future results of operations.
    Additionally, legislation to reduce greenhouse gases may have an
    adverse effect on our operations, including payment of
    additional costs due to carbon emissions. Higher carbon emission
    activities include transportation, including marine vessels,
    cement production (by third party suppliers), and electricity
    generation (by third party suppliers) as well as other
    activities. Finally, our business could be negatively affected
    by climate change related physical changes or changes in weather
    patterns, which could result in damages to or loss of our
    physical assets, impacts to our ability to conduct operations

and/or

disruption of our customers’ operations.

Legislation may be introduced in the United States Congress that
    would authorize the EPA to regulate hydraulic fracturing. In
    addition, a number of states are evaluating the adoption of
    legislation or regulations governing hydraulic fracturing. Such
    legislation or regulations could reduce demand for pressure
    pumping services. If federal

and/or

state
    legislation or regulations were enacted, it could adversely
    affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flows. We are unable to predict whether the proposed
    legislation, regulations, or any other proposals will ultimately
    be enacted.

Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.

The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking
    statements, including, without limitation, statements relating
    to our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions
    and resources. Such forward-looking statements should be read in
    conjunction with our disclosures under “Item 1A. Risk
    Factors” of this Report.

Executive
    Overview

After two consecutive years of falling oil demand in 2008 and
    2009 induced by the global economic recession, a strong recovery
    occurred in 2010. Consumption averaged 87.7 million barrels
    per day, including an all-time peak of over 89 million
    barrels per day in December, and made the

year-on-year

increase the second largest in three decades. Oil prices
    remained in the range of $65-$85 per barrel for much of 2010,
    but recorded a spike above $90 at the end of the year. The major
    demand forecasts released during 2010 have continued to increase
    as a result of the improving economic outlook –
    particularly in the developing economies. On the supply side,
    the adherence to production quota by the OPEC countries helped
    keep the market balanced, although such adherence diminished
    slightly as the year progressed. Strength in non-OPEC
    production, improvement in new project developments following
    the investment cuts in 2009, and lower production costs helped
    provide additional assurance to the markets.

Natural gas markets behaved differently. Decreasing gas demand
    during the recession, increasing unconventional gas production
    in North America, and the commissioning of a number of new large
    liquefied natural gas export facilities around the world led to
    an over-supplied market with consequent pressure on spot prices.
    Within the United States – the world’s largest
    natural gas market – natural gas storage levels have
    remained significantly above the five-year range since March
    2010 despite lower volumes of Canadian gas imports and some
    power generation fuel switching from coal to gas. With natural
    gas price forecasts from the Energy Information Agency for 2011
    slipping by nearly a third compared to initial projections made
    at the beginning of the year, an increasing portion of the
    drilling and completion activity in shale reservoirs has shifted
    to liquid and condensate-rich plays in North America.

Within this market, Schlumberger Oilfield Services full-year
    revenue in 2010 of $22.08 billion grew 8% versus 2009,
    driven by recovery in the North America natural gas market
    through increasing demand and stronger pricing for pressure
    pumping services. The North America Area also benefited from
    greater activity in liquids-rich plays in a number of basins.
    Offshore, the tragic Macondo accident in the US Gulf of Mexico
    led to a shutdown in deepwater operations that severely impacted
    US offshore activity and led to slowdowns in other parts of the
    world, although these were being absorbed as the fourth quarter
    developed. The Middle East and Asia Area revenue climbed 7% from
    a number of factors including increasing wireline logging and
    expanded IPM work. Latin America revenue grew by 2%, with rapid
    growth in Brazil overcoming weaker activity in Mexico as poor
    weather, increasing security concerns and reduced client budgets
    impacted operations. Europe/CIS/Africa revenue decreased 4%
    versus 2009. Among the Technologies, growth was primarily seen
    in Well Services activities, both in volume and in price
    although the acquisition of Geoservices also contributed to the
    increase.

In addition to growing activity, results were underpinned
    through continuing market penetration of new-technology services
    such as Scope* advanced logging-while-drilling measurements,
    Scanner* wireline technologies, and ACTive* coiled-tubing
    services. Scanner services were boosted by the commercial
    introduction of the latest family member, the Dielectric
    Scanner* tool, which was unveiled during the year. As a unique
    industry service capable of measuring saturation in a variety of
    reservoir applications, the service completed a two-year pilot
    project in Saudi Arabia targeted at reservoir monitoring, where
    35 logs were recorded in various fields, both on land and
    offshore, to assess water flooding sweep efficiency as an aid to
    field development planning.

In reservoir production, ACTive real-time coiled tubing services
    saw growth, particularly with ACTive conveyance of Wireline Flow
    Scanner* production logging technology, and with fiber-optic
    continuous measurements of temperature and pressure along the
    well bore. Growing deployment of integrated technologies such as
    these confirms exciting growth possibilities across the
    Schlumberger technology portfolio particularly in horizontal and
    extended-reach wells.

It was however drilling services that displayed early evidence
    of the opportunities provided by the acquisitions of Geoservices
    and Smith International that were announced during the first
    quarter. These successes included the completion of a remote
    three-well exploration project offshore Greenland that used
    Schlumberger technologies combined with Smith and M-I SWACO
    products and services as well as Geoservices mud logging. In
    Brazil, a similar combination of services helped one well record
    substantial increases in rates of penetration, while meeting all



Part II, Item 7

directional drilling goals. In this particular case the
    integrated nature of the bottomhole assembly demonstrated how
    technology optimization can impact performance in the high-cost
    deepwater drilling environment. A third such operation offshore
    Indonesia further displayed the value of integrated bottomhole
    assemblies.

WesternGeco revenue of $1.99 billion in 2010 was 6% lower
    than 2009 primarily as a result of lower Marine activity and
    weaker pricing. While Land activity was also weaker, strong
    Multiclient sales, particularly in the fourth quarter, were able
    to offset some of these effects. New seismic technology scored
    some significant successes with penetration of marine
    single-vessel, full-azimuth coil shooting surveys into a number
    of the major offshore basins around the world. Coil shooting,
    unique to Schlumberger, brings better illumination of complex
    pre-salt,

sub-salt

and

sub-basalt

formations in a variety of environments.

The integration of Geoservices and Smith International proceeded
    smoothly during the year. The complementary nature of many of
    the product and service lines concerned helped the process while
    a network of integration teams and Area coordinators rapidly
    identified revenue and cost-synergy opportunities that
    contributed to results in 2010 and that augur well for 2011.
    Total Schlumberger 2010 results reflect four months activity
    from the acquired Smith businesses, which contributed revenue of
    $3.30 billion.

In a related move, Schlumberger signed a letter of intent with
    Eurasia to swap certain assets in Russia to build critical mass
    in drilling services. Under the terms of this agreement, Eurasia
    will acquire a number of Schlumberger-owned drilling rigs, while
    Schlumberger will acquire a range of Eurasia service assets
    including directional drilling, measurement-while-drilling, well
    cementing and drilling fluids. Further, both companies agreed to
    enter a strategic alliance upon completion of the transaction
    whereby Schlumberger will become the preferred supplier of
    drilling services to Eurasia Drilling for up to 200 rigs for a

5-year

period. This agreement not only increases the market for our
    services across the rig fleet of the largest Russian drilling
    company, it also encourages the development of

fit-for-purpose

bottom-hole assembly technology development as drilling
    intensity increases in Russia in order to sustain hydrocarbon
    production.

Two years ago we began a program called “Excellence in
    Execution”. This was designed to create a step change in
    our service quality and efficiency and, in deepwater, was aimed
    at enabling clients to reduce the risk and cost of their
    deepwater operations. The program, in addition to equipment and
    procedural improvements, provides for competency certification
    of all personnel involved in deepwater operations. We have been
    encouraged by the initial results of this multiyear initiative,
    as well as by our customers’ acceptance of it. While
    additional control and oversight will undoubtedly add cost, this
    will be offset in the long run by improvements in operating
    procedures and technology. We therefore welcome current efforts
    to better understand and control the risks associated with
    deepwater operations.

For 2011, economic projections for world real GDP growth are
    converging towards a median estimate of 4.2%, slightly lower
    than the 2010 level, and still with a significant level of
    uncertainty. A large gap exists between GDP growth rates of
    Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and
    non-OECD countries – particularly in China and in
    other developing Asian economies. However there is remarkable
    agreement on various oil demand forecasts for 2011, which all
    lie within 1.4 million barrels per day of each other.

As we look forward to 2011 it is therefore important to remember
    that the primary driver of our business has always been, and
    will remain, the demand for oil and gas. Oil prices have moved
    into a range that will encourage increased investment,
    particularly in exploration, which remains the swing factor in
    operators’ budgets. While we do not anticipate any
    substantial recovery in deepwater US Gulf of Mexico, we do
    expect a marked increase in deepwater activity in the rest of
    the world. These factors, coupled with increases in development
    activity and production enhancement in many other areas, promise
    stronger growth rates as the year unfolds.

For natural gas, activity in the United States is likely to
    remain strong – at least through the first half of the
    year – due to the commitments necessary to retain
    leases, the backlog of wells to be completed, and the
    contribution of natural gas liquids to overall project
    economics. Increased service capacity, however, will negatively
    affect pricing at some stage during the year.

Overseas, the governing factor on gas activity, particularly in
    the Middle East, will be the ability of many nations to use gas
    as a substitute for oil to meet increased local energy demand,
    thus freeing up more liquids for export. Elsewhere the long lead
    time necessary to execute large gas projects for LNG exports
    will ensure that a certain level of activity is maintained.

Unconventional gas resources will continue to attract
    considerable interest outside North America. The leading
    activity will continue to be in conventional gas in tight, or
    low permeability, reservoirs, and in coal-bed methane



Part II, Item 7

developments. There will be exploration activity around the
    potential that shale gas offers in many other parts of the world.

Increased activity coupled with the greater technology needs of
    higher exploration, deepwater, and tight gas
    activity – particularly outside North
    America – will make 2011 a stronger year for
    Schlumberger. The importance of risk reduction and the
    minimization of drilling cost make the acquisitions of
    Geoservices and Smith major contributors to our future growth in
    this scenario.

Fourth-quarter revenue of $6.01 billion increased 9%
    sequentially. Sequentially, North America Area revenue increased
    27% on strong activity on land in the US and Canada as well as
    from the early payout of an IPM gain share project. In the
    Middle East & Asia Area, revenue grew on year-end
    equipment, Schlumberger Information Solutions (SIS) software
    sales, and on higher activity in the Iraq, East Asia and
    Indonesia GeoMarkets. Europe/CIS/Africa Area revenue increased
    from stronger activity in the North Sea, West & South
    Africa, Caspian and Continental Europe GeoMarkets, as well as
    from year-end SIS software sales. These increases were partially
    offset by a decrease in Latin America Area revenue primarily due
    to continuing weakness in the Mexico/Central America GeoMarket.

All Technologies recorded sequential growth, most notably Well
    Services due to continuing strong activity in North America, and
    SIS and Artificial Lift from year-end sales. IPM revenue also
    increased as a result of the early payout on the IPM project in
    North America.



Part II, Item 7

Fourth-quarter pretax operating income of $1.33 billion
    increased 21% sequentially. Pretax operating margin increased
    224 bps sequentially to 22.1% primarily driven by the
    robust performance in North America and strong contributions
    from the year-end equipment and software sales.

North
    America

Fourth-quarter revenue of $1.60 billion increased 27%
    sequentially and pretax operating income of $385 million
    was 75% higher.

Sequentially, revenue in US land grew 24% versus a 4% increase
    in rig count due to a combination of additional service
    capacity, improved utilization, and high service intensity that
    mostly benefited Well Services technologies. Canada revenue grew
    from higher land activity for Well Services, although this was
    partially offset by a slowdown in offshore activity that
    impacted Drilling & Measurements services. The US Gulf
    of Mexico revenue increased through a modest improvement in
    shelf activity and from Completion Systems equipment sales. An
    $87 million early payout relating to services on an IPM
    gain share project – triggered by the customer’s
    sale of the field – also contributed to Area growth.

Pretax operating margin for the Area increased 658 bps
    sequentially to 24.0%. This increase was largely driven by US
    land through stronger activity and increased efficiency for Well
    Services operations. The IPM gain share payout contributed
    approximately $55 million to Area pretax operating income.

Latin
    America

Fourth-quarter revenue of $1.05 billion decreased 2% versus
    the prior quarter. Pretax operating income of $174 million
    increased 9% compared to the third quarter of 2010.

Sequentially, the Brazil GeoMarket achieved record high revenue
    on strong deepwater activity, while revenue in the
    Peru/Colombia/Ecuador GeoMarket grew from higher gain share on
    IPM activity in Colombia and from Testing Services equipment
    sales in Peru. These increases, however, were insufficient to
    offset a significant revenue drop in the Mexico/Central America
    GeoMarket where continuing security issues and client budgetary
    constraints further reduced IPM activity levels.

Pretax operating margin improved 171 bps sequentially to
    16.6% primarily due to a more favorable revenue mix in the
    Peru/Colombia/Ecuador and Venezuela/Trinidad & Tobago
    GeoMarkets.

Europe/CIS/Africa

Fourth-quarter revenue of $1.78 billion increased 3%
    compared to the third quarter of 2010. Pretax operating income
    of $339 million increased 7% sequentially.

Sequentially, revenue in the North Sea GeoMarket increased
    primarily from higher activity in Norway and from year-end SIS
    software sales. In the West & South Africa GeoMarket,
    revenue grew on stronger activity that benefited Wireline and
    Drilling & Measurements services and on higher
    Completion Systems equipment sales. Caspian GeoMarket revenue
    increased from the startup of several projects that resulted in
    higher demand for Drilling & Measurements, Testing
    Services and Wireline technologies as well as from a Well
    Services equipment sale. Continental Europe revenue grew on
    higher activity for Well Services and Testing Services
    technologies and on year-end SIS software sales. These
    increases, however, were partially offset by a decrease in
    Nigeria & Gulf of Guinea GeoMarket revenue from lower
    Completion Systems equipment sales and from delays that reduced
    demand for Wireline services. Russia revenue was also lower with
    the onset of the winter slowdown.

Pretax operating margin improved sequentially by 74 bps to
    19.0% primarily from a stronger mix of high-margin Wireline and
    Drilling & Measurements services in the North Sea and
    West & South Africa GeoMarkets as well as from
    year-end SIS software sales across much of the Area. These
    increases were partially offset by the impact of the activity
    weakness in the Nigeria & Gulf of Guinea GeoMarket.

Middle
    East & Asia

Fourth-quarter revenue of $1.49 billion increased 6%
    sequentially. Pretax operating income of $434 million
    increased 2% sequentially.



Part II, Item 7

Sequentially, revenue growth resulted from the continued ramp up
    of IPM activity in Iraq and the start of new offshore projects
    in East Asia. Year-end sales of Artificial Lift and Completion
    Systems equipment, Well Services products, and SIS software also
    contributed to Area growth. These increases were partially
    offset by lower revenue in the Australia/Papua New Guinea
    GeoMarket resulting from offshore project completions and delays
    in land activity due to severe flooding, and by lower activity
    in the Qatar GeoMarket that reduced demand for Wireline and
    Drilling & Measurements services.

Pretax operating margin decreased 119 bps sequentially to
    29.1% as the positive contribution from the year-end sales and a
    more favorable revenue mix in the Arabian GeoMarket were
    insufficient to offset the impact of the lower activity in the
    Australia/Papua New Guinea GeoMarket and startup costs in Iraq.

WesternGeco

Fourth-quarter revenue of $560 million increased 17%
    sequentially. Pretax operating income of $113 million
    increased 183% sequentially.

Sequentially, revenue growth was driven by Multiclient, which
    recorded strong year-end sales from the US Gulf of Mexico. This
    increase was partially offset by a decrease in Marine revenue
    due to the seasonal slow-down in activity. Land and Data
    Processing revenues were flat sequentially.

Pretax operating margin increased 11.8 percentage points
    sequentially to 20.2% as the result of the high Multiclient
    sales partially offset by the impact of the lower Marine
    activity.

Full-year 2010 revenue of $22.08 billion was 8% higher than
    2009. Revenue growth was strongest in the North America Area
    mostly as a result of higher activity and pricing for Well
    Services technologies in US Land but partially offset by



Part II, Item 7

reduced activity in the US Gulf of Mexico. Latin America revenue
    increased on strong activity in the Brazil and
    Peru/Ecuador/Colombia GeoMarkets partially offset by reduced IPM
    activity in Mexico/Central America due to client budgetary
    constraints. Middle East & Asia Area revenue grew from
    higher drilling activity in the Australia/Papua New Guinea,
    China/Japan/Korea and East Asia GeoMarkets as well as from
    increased IPM activity and strong demand for Well Services
    technologies in the Middle Eastern GeoMarkets. The addition of
    Geoservices also contributed to the increased revenue. These
    increases were partially offset by a decrease in
    Europe/CIS/Africa revenue as reduced activity in the North
    Africa, Libya, Caspian and Continental GeoMarkets and generally
    lower pricing across the Area offset higher activity in Russia.

Year-on-year,

pretax operating margin declined 82 bps to 20.3% as a
    significant improvement in North America Area performance was
    insufficient to offset the reduced activity and weaker pricing
    in the Europe/CIS/Africa Area and lower IPM activity in Latin
    America.

North
    America

Revenue of $5.01 billion was 35% higher than last year
    primarily due to strong activity in unconventional oil and gas
    reservoirs, improved pricing in US Land for Well Services
    technologies and improved activity levels in oil basins in
    Canada. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in
    the US Gulf of Mexico revenue as a six-month moratorium on
    drilling and lingering uncertainty about rules for operating
    resulted in the stoppage of deepwater drilling activity.

Year-on-year,

pretax operating margin increased 10 percentage points to
    16.0% mostly due to the stronger activity and improved pricing
    in the US land, partially offset by the impact of the activity
    slow-down in the US Gulf of Mexico.

Latin
    America

Revenue of $4.32 billion was 2% higher than the previous
    year. Growth was strongest in the Brazil GeoMarket where higher
    offshore activity increased demand for Wireline and
    Drilling & Measurements services technologies. Revenue
    also increased significantly in the Peru/Ecuador/Colombia
    GeoMarket due to strong IPM activity and higher Artificial Lift
    systems sales. The addition of Geoservices also contributed to
    the growth. These increases were partially offset by a decrease
    in the Mexico/Central America GeoMarket revenue as client
    budgetary constraints reduced IPM activity.

Year-on-year,

pretax operating margin decreased 110 bps to 16.7%
    primarily due to the reduced activity levels in Mexico/Central
    America partially offset by the impact of lower costs in
    Venezuela/Trinidad & Tobago.

Europe/CIS/Africa

Revenue of $6.88 billion was 4% lower

year-on-year.

This decrease was largely attributable to lower pricing across
    much of the Area and reduced activity in the North Africa,
    Libya, Caspian and Continental Europe GeoMarkets. These
    decreases were partially offset by increases in Russia due to
    higher IPM activity. The addition of Geoservices also
    contributed to Area revenue.

Year-on-year,

pretax operating margin decreased 543 bps to 18.4%
    primarily due to the lower overall activity levels and reduced
    pricing.

Middle
    East & Asia

Revenue of $5.59 billion was 7% higher than the previous
    year primarily due to strong drilling activity in Asia,
    particularly in the Australia/Papua New Guinea,
    China/Japan/Korea and East Asia GeoMarkets, and to increased IPM
    activity and strong demand for Well Services technologies in the
    Middle Eastern GeoMarkets. The addition of Geoservices also
    increased Area revenue.

Year-on-year,

pretax operating margin decreased 199 bps to 30.4%
    primarily due the impact of lower pricing across the Area.

WesternGeco

Full-year 2010 revenue of $1.99 billion was 6% lower than
    the prior year primarily due to reduced activity and pricing in
    Marine. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in
    Multiclient revenue as the result of increased acquisition and
    sales of wide-azimuth surveys in the US Gulf of Mexico.



Part II, Item 7

Year-on-year,

pretax operating margin decreased 194 bps to 13.4% as the
    result of the lower pricing and activity in Marine and reduced
    profitability in Land and Data Processing. These decreases were
    partially offset by an improvement in Multiclient margins on the
    increased activity.

Full-year 2009 revenue of $20.52 billion declined 16%
    versus 2008. Lower natural gas prices and unfavorable market
    fundamentals resulted in a 37% decline in North America revenue,
    primarily in the US Land and Canada GeoMarkets.
    Europe/CIS/Africa revenue decreased 13% mainly due to the
    weakening of local currencies against the US dollar and reduced
    activity in the Russia, North Sea, West & South Africa
    and Caspian GeoMarkets as well as in Framo, which was partially
    offset by increased activity in the North Africa GeoMarket.
    Middle East & Asia revenue also fell by 9% primarily
    due to decreases in the East Asia, East Mediterranean, Arabian
    and Australia/Papua New Guinea GeoMarkets. Latin America revenue
    was only marginally lower than last year as the impact of the
    weakening of local currencies against the US dollar and much
    lower activity in Venezuela/Trinidad & Tobago and
    Peru/Colombia/Ecuador were nearly offset by stronger activity in
    Mexico/Central America and Brazil. Weakening of local currencies
    against the US dollar reduced 2009 revenue by approximately 4%.
    Across the Areas, all of the Technologies recorded revenue
    declines except Testing Services. IPM recorded revenue growth
    compared to the same period last year.

Full-year 2009 pretax operating margin decreased
    5.7 percentage points to 21.1%, on the significant drop in
    activity and pricing pressure experienced across all the Areas,
    but most notably in North America.

North
    America

Revenue of $3.71 billion was 37% lower than last year with
    reductions across the entire Area. The decreases were highest in
    US Land and Canada, where lower natural gas prices resulted in a
    steep drop in activity and consequent pressure on pricing.
    Canada revenue was also lower as the result of the weakening of
    the Canadian dollar against the US dollar. Revenue in the
    US Gulf of Mexico GeoMarket was severely impacted by weaker
    shelf drilling activity and strong pricing pressure.

Pretax operating margin fell 17.3 percentage points to 5.8%
    due to the significant decline in activity levels across the
    Area, combined with the severe pricing erosion.



Part II, Item 7

Latin
    America

Revenue of $4.22 billion was marginally lower compared to
    2008. The weakening of local currencies against the
    US dollar reduced 2009 revenue by approximately 3%. In
    addition, Venezuela/Trinidad & Tobago revenue fell due
    to significantly reduced customer spending while
    Peru/Colombia/Ecuador revenue was lower due to reduced gain
    share in IPM projects. These decreases were mostly offset by
    higher IPM activity in Mexico/Central America and increased
    offshore activity in Brazil.

Pretax operating margin decreased 245 bps to 17.8%
    primarily as the result of the sharp activity decline in
    Venezuela/Trinidad & Tobago and the lower gain share
    in Peru/Colombia/Ecuador.

Europe/CIS/Africa

Revenue of $7.15 billion was 13% lower than last year
    largely due to the weakening of local currencies against the
    US dollar, which reduced revenue by approximately 7%. In
    addition, revenue was negatively impacted by reduced customer
    spending that resulted in significantly lower activity and
    pricing erosion in Russia and the North Sea. Revenue in the
    West & South Africa and Caspian GeoMarkets and in
    Framo was also negatively impacted by lower activity levels.
    These decreases were partially offset by a revenue increase in
    the North Africa GeoMarket due to strong Testing Services
    product sales.

Pretax operating margins declined 357 bps to 23.9% on a
    combination of the overall lower activity and heavy pricing
    pressure across the Area.

Middle
    East & Asia

Revenue of $5.23 billion was 9% below 2008. Revenue was
    down across much of the Middle East, especially in the East
    Mediterranean and Arabian GeoMarkets, due to reduced demand for
    Drilling & Measurements, Wireline and Testing Services
    technologies. Revenue in Asia also fell, primarily due to a
    decrease in offshore exploration activity, which was most
    significant in the East Asia and Australia/Papua New Guinea
    GeoMarkets, resulting in lower demand for Testing Services and
    Wireline technologies as well as Completion Systems products.

Pretax operating margin decreased 268 bps to 32.4%
    primarily as a result of the lower overall activity and a less
    favorable revenue mix across the Area.

WesternGeco

Full-year revenue of $2.12 billion was 25% lower than 2008.
    Revenue decreased across all product lines, with the largest
    declines experienced in Marine and Multiclient. Marine revenue
    declined due to lower activity combined with reduced pricing as
    the result of weak market conditions. Multiclient revenue
    decreased primarily in North America, as customers continued to
    reduce discretionary spending. Land revenue fell on lower crew
    utilization, while Data Processing revenue was down reflecting
    lower activity primarily in Europe/Africa and in North America.

Pretax margin decreased 14.1 percentage points to 15.4%
    primarily due to the weaker Marine activity and pricing as well
    as lower Multiclient sales.

Equity in
    Net Earnings of Affiliated Companies

Equity income from the M-I SWACO joint venture in 2010
    represents eight months of equity income through the closing of
    the Smith transaction. The decrease in equity income relating to
    this joint venture from 2008 to 2009 was attributable to a
    significant decline in M-I SWACO activity levels, primarily in
    its United States and Europe/Africa regions, as well as
    increased pricing pressures.

Interest
    Expense

Interest expense of $207 million in 2010 decreased by
    $14 million compared to 2009 due to a decline in the
    weighted average borrowing rates, from 3.9% to 3.2%. The
    weighted average debt balance of $6.4 billion in 2010
    increased $0.8 billion compared to 2009.

Interest expense of $221 million in 2009 decreased by
    $26 million compared to 2008 primarily due to a decline in

Gross margin was 21.7%, 24.0% and 30.2% in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

The decline in gross margin in 2010 compared to 2009 was
    primarily attributable to the inclusion of the acquired Smith
    businesses as well as pricing pressure for Oilfield Services,
    particularly in the Europe/CIS/Africa Area, partially offset by
    improved activity levels and pricing in the North America Area.

The decline in gross margin in 2009 compared to 2008 was
    primarily attributable to lower activity coupled with the impact
    of a significant reduction in pricing across all of Oilfield
    Services, most notably in North America and Europe/CIS/Africa.
    Weaker Marine activity and pricing and reduced Multiclient sales
    in WesternGeco also contributed to the margin decline.

Income
    Taxes

The Schlumberger effective tax rate was 17.3% in 2010, 19.6% in
    2009, and 20.9% in 2008.

The Schlumberger effective tax rate is sensitive to the
    geographic mix of earnings. When the percentage of pretax
    earnings generated outside of North America increases, the
    Schlumberger effective tax rate will generally decrease.
    Conversely, when the percentage of pretax earnings generated
    outside of North America decreases, the Schlumberger effective
    tax rate will generally increase.



Part II, Item 7

The effective tax rate for 2010 was significantly impacted by
    the charges and credits described in Note 3 to the

Consolidated Financial Statements

. The effective tax rate
    for 2009 was also impacted by charges, but to a much lesser
    extent. Excluding charges and credits, the effective tax rate in
    2010 was approximately 20.6% compared to 19.2% in 2009. This
    increase is largely attributable to the geographic mix of
    earnings as well as the inclusion of four months results from
    the merger with Smith. Smith, which as a US company has a US tax
    rate applicable to its worldwide operations and as such, will
    serve to increase Schlumberger’s overall effective tax rate.

The decrease in the Schlumberger effective tax rate in 2009 as
    compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to the geographic
    mix of earnings. Schlumberger generated a lower proportion of
    its pretax earnings in North America in 2009 as compared to
    2008. In addition, outside North America, various GeoMarkets
    with lower tax rates contributed a greater percentage to pretax
    earnings in 2009 as compared to 2008.

Charges and
    Credits

Schlumberger recorded significant charges and credits in
    continuing operations during 2010, 2009 and 2008. These charges
    and credits, which are summarized below, are more fully
    described in Note 3 to the

Key liquidity events during 2010, 2009 and 2008 included:

•

As a result of the Smith merger, Schlumberger assumed net debt
    of $1.8 billion. This amount consisted of $2.2 billion
    of debt (including a $0.4 billion adjustment to increase
    Smith’s long-term fixed rate debt to its estimated fair
    value) and $0.4 billion of cash.

•

During the second quarter of 2010, Schlumberger completed the
    acquisition of Geoservices for cash of $0.9 billion.
    Schlumberger assumed net debt of $0.1 billion in connection
    with this transaction.



Part II, Item 7

The premium paid in excess of the carrying value to repurchase
    the $1.275 billion of debt was approximately
    $67 million.

•

During the first quarter of 2009, Schlumberger entered into a
    €3.0 billion Euro Medium Term Note program. This
    program provides for the issuance of various types of debt
    instruments such as fixed or floating rate notes in Euro, US
    dollar or other currencies.

Schlumberger issued €1.0 billion 2.75% Guaranteed
    Notes due 2015 in the fourth quarter of 2010 under this program.
    Schlumberger entered into agreements to swap these euro notes
    for US dollars on the date of issue until maturity, effectively
    making this a US denominated debt on which Schlumberger will pay
    interest in US dollars at a rate of 2.56%. The proceeds from
    these notes will be used for general corporate purposes.

During the first quarter of 2009, Schlumberger issued
    €1.0 billion 4.50% Guaranteed Notes due 2014 under
    this program. Schlumberger entered into agreements to swap these
    euro notes for US dollars on the date of issue until maturity,
    effectively making this a US dollar denominated debt on which
    Schlumberger will pay interest in US dollars at a rate of 4.95%.
    The proceeds from these notes were used to refinance existing
    debt obligations and for general corporate purposes.

•

During the third quarter of 2009, Schlumberger issued
    $450 million of 3.00% Guaranteed Notes due 2013. The
    proceeds from these notes were used to refinance existing debt
    obligations.

•

In September 2008, Schlumberger issued €500 million
    5.25% Guaranteed Notes due 2013. Schlumberger entered into
    agreements to swap these Euro notes for US dollars on the date
    of issue until maturity, effectively making this a US dollar
    denominated debt on which Schlumberger will pay interest in US
    dollars at a rate of 4.74%. The proceeds from these notes were
    used to repay commercial paper borrowings.

•

On April 20, 2006, the Schlumberger Board of Directors
    approved a share repurchase program of up to 40 million
    shares of common stock to be acquired in the open market before
    April 2010, subject to market conditions. This program was
    completed during the second quarter of 2008.

On April 17, 2008, the Schlumberger Board of Directors
    approved an $8 billion share repurchase program for shares
    of Schlumberger common stock, to be acquired in the open market
    before December 31, 2011, of which $3.15 billion had
    been repurchased as of December 31, 2010.

Cash flow provided by operations was $5.5 billion in 2010,
    $5.3 billion in 2009 and $6.9 billion in 2008. The
    decline in cash flow from operations in 2009 as compared to 2008
    was primarily driven by the decrease in net



Part II, Item 7

income experienced in 2009 and the significant pension plan
    contributions made during 2009, offset by an improvement in
    working capital requirements.

At times in recent periods, Schlumberger has experienced delays
    in payments from certain of its customers. Schlumberger operates
    in approximately 80 countries. At December 31, 2010, only
    three of those countries individually accounted for greater than
    5% of Schlumberger’s accounts receivable balance of which
    only one, the United States, represented greater than 10%.

•

Dividends paid during 2010, 2009 and 2008 were
    $1.04 billion, $1.01 billion and $0.96 billion,
    respectively.

In January 2011, Schlumberger announced that its Board of
    Directors had approved an increase in the quarterly dividend of
    19%, to $0.25.

•

Capital expenditures were $2.9 billion in 2010,
    $2.4 billion in 2009 and $3.7 billion in 2008. Capital
    expenditures in 2008 reflected the record activity levels
    experienced in that year. The decrease in capital expenditures
    in 2009 as compared to 2008 is primarily due to the significant
    activity decline during 2009. Capital expenditures are expected
    to approach $4.0 billion for the full year 2011.

•

During 2010, 2009 and 2008 Schlumberger made contributions of
    $868 million, $1.1 billion and $290 million,
    respectively, to its postretirement benefit plans. The US
    pension plans were 95% funded at December 31, 2010 based on
    the projected benefit obligation. This compares to 92% funded at
    December 31, 2009.

Schlumberger’s international defined benefit pension plans
    are a combined 92% funded at December 31, 2010 based on the
    projected benefit obligation. This compares to 85% funded at
    December 31, 2009.

Schlumberger currently anticipates contributing approximately
    $600 million to $650 million to its postretirement
    benefit plans in 2011, subject to market and business conditions.

•

During 2010 and 2008, certain holders of Schlumberger Limited
    1.5% Series A Convertible Debentures due June 1, 2023
    and 2.125% Series B Convertible Debentures due June 1,
    2023 converted their debentures into Schlumberger common stock.

    outstanding Series B debentures at December 31, 2009.
    During 2010, $320 million of the 2.125% Series B
    Convertible Debentures due June 1, 2023 were converted by
    holders into 8.0 million shares of Schlumberger common
    stock and the remaining $1 million of outstanding
    Series B debentures were redeemed for cash.

As of December 31, 2010, Schlumberger had approximately
    $5.0 billion of cash and short-term investments on hand.
    Schlumberger had separate committed debt facility agreements
    aggregating $6.0 billion with commercial banks, of which
    $3.7 billion was available and unused as of
    December 31, 2010. This included $4.9 billion of
    committed facilities which support commercial paper borrowings
    in the United States and Europe. Schlumberger believes that
    these amounts are sufficient to meet future business
    requirements for at least the next twelve months.

Schlumberger’s total outstanding debt at December 31,
    2010 was $8.1 billion and included approximately
    $1.9 billion of commercial paper borrowings. The total
    outstanding debt increased approximately $2.6 billion
    compared to December 31, 2009.

On January 10, 2011, Schlumberger issued $1.1 billion
    of 4.200% Senior Notes due 2021 and $500 million of
    2.650% Senior Notes due 2016.

Refer to Note 18 of the

Consolidated Financial
    Statements

for details regarding Schlumberger’s pension
    and other postretirement benefit obligations.

As discussed in Note 14 of the

Consolidated Financial
    Statements

, included in the Schlumberger

Consolidated
    Balance Sheet

at December 31, 2010 is approximately
    $1.17 billion of liabilities associated with uncertain tax
    positions in the over 100 jurisdictions in which Schlumberger
    conducts business. Due to the uncertain and complex application
    of tax regulations, combined with the difficulty in predicting
    when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded,
    Schlumberger cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of
    cash outflows relating to these liabilities.

Schlumberger has outstanding letters of credit/guarantees which
    relate to business performance bonds, custom/excise tax
    commitments, facility lease/rental obligations, etc. These were
    entered into in the ordinary course of business and are
    customary practices in the various countries where Schlumberger
    operates.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures
    in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
    the United States requires Schlumberger to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
    and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The following
    accounting policies involve “critical accounting
    estimates” because they are particularly dependent on
    estimates and assumptions made by Schlumberger about matters
    that are inherently uncertain. A summary of all of
    Schlumberger’s significant accounting policies is included
    in Note 2 to the

Consolidated Financial Statements

.

Schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on
    various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
    circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
    judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
    that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
    may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
    conditions.

Multiclient
    Seismic Data

The WesternGeco segment capitalizes the costs associated with
    obtaining multiclient seismic data. The carrying value of the
    multiclient seismic data library at December 31, 2010 and
    2009 was $394 million and $288 million, respectively.
    Such costs are charged to

Cost of revenue

based on the
    percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue
    that Schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such
    data. However, under no circumstances will an individual survey
    carry a net book value greater than a

4-year

straight-line amortized value.

The carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment
    annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance
    indicates an impairment may have occurred. Adjustments to the
    carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated
    future revenues, which involve significant judgment on the part
    of Schlumberger, would not be sufficient to recover the carrying
    value of the surveys. Significant adverse changes in
    Schlumberger’s estimated future cash flows could result in
    impairment charges in a future period. For purposes of
    performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient
    library, future cash flows are analyzed primarily based on two
    pools of surveys: United States and

non-United

States. The United States and

non-United

States pools were determined to be the most appropriate level at
    which to perform the impairment review based upon a number of
    factors including (i) various macroeconomic factors that



Part II, Item 7

influence the ability to successfully market surveys and
    (ii) the focus of the sales force and related costs.
    Certain larger surveys, which are typically prefunded by
    customers, are analyzed for impairment on a survey by survey
    basis.

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

Schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in
    order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable
    value. Judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments
    to this reserve. Allowances have been recorded for receivables
    believed to be uncollectible, including amounts for the
    resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such
    as disputed invoices. Depending on how such potential issues are
    resolved, or if the financial condition of Schlumberger
    customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of
    their ability to make payments, adjustments to the allowance may
    be required.

Inventory
    Reserves

Inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable
    value. Schlumberger maintains a reserve for excess and obsolete
    inventory. This requires management to make assumptions about
    future demand and market conditions. If actual future demand or
    market conditions are less favorable than those projected by
    management, additional provisions for excess or obsolete
    inventory may be required.

Goodwill,
    Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets

Schlumberger records the excess of purchase price over the fair
    value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets
    acquired as goodwill. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually
    as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an
    impairment may have occurred. Goodwill is tested for impairment
    by comparing the fair value of Schlumberger’s individual
    reporting units to their carrying amount to determine if there
    is a potential goodwill impairment. If the fair value of the
    reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment
    loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of
    the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying
    value.

For purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill,
    Schlumberger’s reporting units are primarily the geographic
    areas comprising the Oilfield Services segment in addition to
    the WesternGeco, M-I SWACO, Smith Oilfield and Distribution
    segments. Schlumberger estimates the fair value of these
    reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis

and/or

applying various market multiples. Determining the fair value of
    a reporting unit is a matter of judgment and often involves the
    use of significant estimates and assumptions.
    Schlumberger’s estimate of the fair value of each of its
    reporting units comprising Oilfield Services as well as its
    WesternGeco reporting unit were substantially in excess of their
    respective carrying values at the time of their annual goodwill
    impairment tests for 2010. Due to the fact that the M-I SWACO,
    Smith Oilfield and Distribution reporting units were acquired on
    August 27, 2010, just prior to their annual goodwill
    impairment tests, the fair value of these reporting units
    approximated their carrying value.

Long-lived assets, including fixed assets and intangible assets,
    are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. In reviewing for impairment, the carrying value of
    such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future
    cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their
    eventual disposition. If such cash flows are not sufficient to
    support the asset’s recorded value, an impairment charge is
    recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long-lived asset
    to its estimated fair value. The determination of future cash
    flows as well as the estimated fair value of long-lived assets
    involves significant estimates on the part of management. If
    there is a material change in economic conditions or other
    circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or
    fair value, Schlumberger could be required to recognize
    impairment charges in the future. Schlumberger evaluates the
    remaining useful life of its intangible assets on a periodic
    basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a
    revision to the remaining estimated amortization period.

Income
    Taxes

Schlumberger’s tax filings are subject to regular audit by
    the tax authorities in most of the over 100 jurisdictions in
    which it conducts business. These audits may result in
    assessments for additional taxes which are resolved with the
    authorities or, potentially, through the courts. Tax liabilities
    are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will
    be due upon the conclusion of these audits. Estimates of these
    tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience



Part II, Item 7

and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances.
    However, due to the uncertain and complex application of tax
    regulations, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of
    audits may result in liabilities which could be materially
    different from these estimates. In such an event, Schlumberger
    will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period
    in which such resolution occurs.

Pension
    and Postretirement Benefits

Schlumberger’s pension and postretirement benefit
    obligations are described in detail in Note 18 to the

Consolidated Financial Statements

. The obligations and
    related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts, which
    include critical assumptions related to the discount rate,
    expected return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates.
    These assumptions are important elements of expense

and/or

liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis, or
    upon the occurrence of significant events.

The discount rate Schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing
    market rate of a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments with
    maturities matching the expected timing of the payment of the
    benefit obligations. The following summarizes the discount rates
    utilized by Schlumberger for its various pension and
    postretirement benefit plans:

•

The discount rate utilized to determine the liability for
    Schlumberger’s United States pension plans and
    postretirement medical plans was 5.50% at December 31, 2010
    and 6.00% at December 31, 2009.

•

The weighted-average discount rate utilized to determine the
    liability for Schlumberger’s international pension plans
    was 5.47% at December 31, 2010 and 5.89% at
    December 31, 2009.

•

The weighted-average discount rate utilized to determine expense
    for Schlumberger’s United States pension plans and
    postretirement medical plans decreased from 6.94% in 2009 to
    6.00% in 2010.

•

The weighted-average discount rate utilized to determine expense
    for Schlumberger’s international pension plans was
    decreased from 6.81% in 2009 to 5.89% in 2010.

A higher discount rate decreases the present value of benefit
    obligations and decreases expense.

The expected rate of return for our retirement benefit plans
    represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on
    plan assets over the period that benefits included in the
    benefit obligation are expected to be paid. The expected rate of
    return for Schlumberger’s United States pension plans has
    been determined based upon expectations regarding future rates
    of return for the investment portfolio, with consideration given
    to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical
    rates of return for each individual asset class. The expected
    rate of return on plan assets for the United States pension
    plans was 8.50% in both 2010 and 2009. The weighted average
    expected rate of return on plan assets for the international
    plans was 8.00% in 2010 and 8.35% in 2009. A lower expected rate
    of return would increase pension expense.

Schlumberger’s medical cost trend rate assumptions are
    developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook
    and an assessment of likely long-term trends. The overall
    medical cost trend rate assumption utilized to determine both
    the 2010 postretirement medical expense as well as the
    postretirement medical liability as of December 31, 2010
    was 8% graded to 5% over the next six years.

    assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, for the

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Schlumberger is subject to market risks primarily associated
    with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity
    prices and interest rates.

As a multinational company, Schlumberger conducts business in
    approximately 80 countries. Schlumberger’s functional
    currency is primarily the US dollar, which is consistent with
    the oil and gas industry. Approximately 80% of
    Schlumberger’s revenue in 2010 was denominated in US
    dollars. However, outside the United States, a significant
    portion of Schlumberger’s expenses is incurred in foreign
    currencies. Therefore, when the US dollar weakens in relation to
    the foreign currencies of the countries in which Schlumberger
    conducts business, the US dollar-reported expenses will increase.

A 5% increase or decrease in the average exchange rates of all
    the foreign currencies in 2010 would have changed revenue by
    approximately 1%. If the 2010 average exchange rates of the US
    dollar against all foreign currencies had strengthened by 5%,
    Schlumberger’s income from continuing operations would have
    increased by approximately 2%. Conversely, a 5% weakening of the
    US dollar average exchange rates would have decreased income
    from continuing operations by approximately 3%.

Although the functional currency of Schlumberger’s
    operations in Venezuela is the US dollar, a portion of the
    transactions are denominated in local currency. For financial
    reporting purposes, such transactions are remeasured into US
    dollars at the official exchange rate, which until January 2010
    was fixed at 2.15 Venezuela bolivares fuertes per US dollar,
    despite significant inflation in recent periods. In January
    2010, Venezuela’s currency was devalued and a new exchange
    rate system was announced. During the first quarter of 2010,
    Schlumberger began to apply an exchange rate of 4.3 Venezuelan
    bolivares fuertes per US dollar to its local currency
    denominated transactions in Venezuela. The devaluation did not
    have an immediate significant impact to Schlumberger. Further,
    although this devaluation does result in a reduction in the US
    dollar reported amount of local currency denominated revenues
    and expenses, the impact is not material to Schlumberger’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Schlumberger maintains a foreign-currency risk management
    strategy that uses derivative instruments to protect its
    interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash
    flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates. Foreign
    currency forward contracts and foreign currency options provide
    a hedge against currency fluctuations either on monetary
    assets/liabilities denominated in other than a functional
    currency or on expenses.

At December 31, 2010, contracts were outstanding for the US
    dollar equivalent of $7.3 billion in various foreign
    currencies.

Schlumberger is subject to the risk of market price fluctuations
    of certain commodities, such as metals and fuel. Schlumberger
    utilizes forward contracts to manage a small percentage of the
    price risk associated with forecasted metal purchases. As of
    December 31, 2010, $12 million of commodity forward
    contracts were outstanding.

Schlumberger is subject to interest rate risk on its debt and
    its investment portfolio. Schlumberger maintains an interest
    rate risk management strategy that uses a mix of variable and
    fixed rate debt combined with its investment portfolio and
    interest rate swaps to mitigate the exposure to changes in
    interest rates. At December 31, 2010, Schlumberger had
    fixed rate debt aggregating approximately $5.4 billion and
    variable rate debt aggregating approximately $2.8 billion.
    Schlumberger has entered into interest rate swaps relating to
    $0.5 billion of its fixed rate debt as of December 31,
    2010 whereby Schlumberger will receive interest at a fixed rate
    and pay interest at a variable rate.

Schlumberger’s exposure to interest rate risk associated
    with its debt is also partially mitigated by its investment
    portfolio. Both

Short-term investments

and

Fixed
    income investments

,

held to maturity

, which totaled
    approximately $3.7 billion at December 31, 2010, are
    comprised primarily of money market funds, eurodollar time
    deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, euro notes
    and Eurobonds and are substantially all denominated in US
    dollars. The average return on investment was 1.1% in 2010.

    purposes.

Forward-looking
    Statements

This

Form 10-K

and other statements we make contain “forward-looking
    statements” within the meaning of the federal securities
    laws, which include any statements that are not historical
    facts, such as our forecasts or expectations regarding business
    outlook; growth for Schlumberger as a whole and for each of
    Oilfield Services and WesternGeco (and for specified products or
    geographic areas within each segment); the integration of both
    Smith and Geoservices into our business; the anticipated
    benefits of those transactions; oil and natural gas demand and
    production growth; oil and natural gas prices; improvements in
    operating procedures and technology; capital expenditures by
    Schlumberger and the oil and gas industry; the business
    strategies of Schlumberger’s customers; future global
    economic conditions; and future results of operations. These
    statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including,
    but not limited to, the current global economic downturn;
    changes in exploration and production spending by
    Schlumberger’s customers and changes in the level of oil
    and natural gas exploration and development; general economic
    and business conditions in key regions of the world; pricing
    erosion; seasonal factors; changes in government regulations and
    regulatory requirements, including those related to offshore oil
    and gas exploration, radioactive sources, explosives, chemicals,
    hydraulic fracturing services and climate-related initiatives;
    continuing operational delays or program reductions as of result
    of the lifted drilling moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico; the
    inability to successfully integrate the merged Smith and
    Geoservices businesses and to realize expected synergies, the
    inability to retain key employees; and other risks and
    uncertainties detailed in the Risk Factors section of this

Form 10-K

and other filings that we make with the Securities and Exchange
    Commission. If one or more of these or other risks or
    uncertainties materialize (or the consequences of such a
    development changes), or should our underlying assumptions prove
    incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from those
    reflected in our forward-looking statements. Schlumberger
    disclaims any intention or obligation to update publicly or
    revise such statements, whether as a result of new information,
    future events or otherwise.

Business
    Description

Schlumberger Limited (Schlumberger N.V., incorporated in
    Curaçao) and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively,
    “Schlumberger”) form the world’s leading supplier
    of technology, integrated project management, and information
    solutions to customers in the oil and gas industry worldwide,
    providing the industry’s widest range of oilfield services
    from exploration to production.

2.

Summary of
    Accounting Policies

The

Consolidated Financial Statements

of Schlumberger
    have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America.

Principles of
    Consolidation

The accompanying

Consolidated Financial Statements

include the accounts of Schlumberger, its wholly-owned
    subsidiaries, and subsidiaries over which it exercises a
    controlling financial interest. All significant intercompany
    transactions and balances have been eliminated. Investments in
    entities in which Schlumberger does not have a controlling
    financial interest, but over which it has significant influence
    are accounted for using the equity method. Schlumberger’s
    share of the after-tax earnings of equity method investees is
    included in

Interest and other income, net

. Investments
    in which Schlumberger does not have the ability to exercise
    significant influence are accounted for using the cost method.
    Both equity and cost method investments are classified in

Investments in Affiliated Companies

.

Reclassifications

Certain prior year items have been reclassified to conform to
    the current year presentation.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
    of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities
    at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
    of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an
    on-going basis, Schlumberger evaluates its estimates, including
    those related to collectibility of accounts receivable;
    valuation of inventories and investments; recoverability of
    goodwill, intangible assets and investments in affiliates;
    income taxes; multiclient seismic data; contingencies and
    actuarial assumptions for employee benefit plans. Schlumberger
    bases its estimates on historical experience and on various
    other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
    circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
    judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
    that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
    may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
    conditions.

Revenue
    Recognition

Schlumberger recognizes revenue based upon purchase orders,
    contracts or other persuasive evidence of an arrangement with
    the customer that include fixed or determinable prices provided
    that collectibility is reasonably assured. Revenue is recognized
    for services when they are rendered. Revenue is recognized for
    products upon delivery, when the customer assumes the risks and
    rewards of ownership. Certain products may be provided on a
    consigned basis in which case revenue is recognized when the
    products are consumed provided that all other revenue
    recognition criteria have been met.

Revenue from seismic contract services performed on a dayrate
    basis is recognized as the service is performed. Revenue from
    other contract services, including pre-funded multiclient
    surveys, is recognized as the seismic data is acquired

and/or

processed on a proportionate basis as work is performed. This
    method requires revenue to be recognized based upon quantifiable
    measures of progress, such as square kilometers acquired.
    Multiclient data surveys are licensed or sold to customers on a
    non-transferable basis. Revenue on completed multiclient data
    surveys is recognized upon obtaining a signed licensing
    agreement and providing customers with access to such data.



Part II, Item 8

Revenue is occasionally generated from contractual arrangements
    that include multiple deliverables. Revenue from these
    arrangements is recognized as each item is delivered based on
    their relative fair value and when the delivered items have
    stand-alone value to the customer.

Revenue derived from the sale of licenses of Schlumberger
    software may include installation, maintenance, consulting and
    training services. If services are not essential to the
    functionality of the software, the revenue for each element of
    the contract is recognized separately based on its respective
    vendor specific objective evidence of fair value when all of the
    following conditions are met: a signed contract is obtained,
    delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and
    collectibility is probable.

Translation of

Non-United

States Currencies

The functional currency of Schlumberger is primarily the US
    dollar. Assets and liabilities recorded in functional currencies
    other than US dollars are translated at period end exchange
    rates. The resulting adjustments are charged or credited
    directly to the

Equity

section of the

Consolidated
    Balance Sheet

. Revenue and expenses are translated at the
    weighted-average exchange rates for the period. Realized and
    unrealized transaction gains and losses are included in income
    in the period in which they occur. Transaction losses of
    $27 million net of hedging activities, were recognized in
    2010. In 2009 and 2008, transaction gains net of hedging
    activities of $73 million and $8 million,
    respectively, were recognized.

Investments

The

Consolidated Balance Sheet

reflects the Schlumberger
    investment portfolio separated between current and long term,
    based on maturity. Both

Short-term investments

and

Fixed Income Investments, held to maturity

are comprised
    primarily of money market funds, eurodollar time deposits,
    certificates of deposit, commercial paper, euro notes and
    Eurobonds, and are substantially denominated in US dollars.
    Under normal circumstances it is the intent of Schlumberger to
    hold the investments until maturity, with the exception of
    investments that are considered trading (December 31,
    2010 – $189 million; December 31,
    2009 – $184 million). Short-term investments that
    are designated as trading are stated at fair value, which is
    estimated using quoted market prices for those or similar
    investments. All other investments are stated at cost plus
    accrued interest, which approximates market. The unrealized
    gains/losses on investments designated as trading were not
    significant at both December 31, 2010 and 2009.

For purposes of the

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows

,
    Schlumberger does not consider short-term investments to be cash
    equivalents as a significant portion have original maturities in
    excess of three months.

Fixed Income Investments, held to maturity

at
    December 31, 2010 of $484 million mature as follows:
    $289 million in 2012, $80 million in 2013 and
    $115 million in 2014.

Inventories

Inventories

are stated at average cost or at market,
    whichever is lower. Costs included in

Inventories

consist
    of materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead.

Fixed Assets
    and Depreciation

Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation,
    which is provided for by charges to income over the estimated
    useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method. Fixed
    assets include the manufacturing cost of oilfield technical
    equipment manufactured or assembled by subsidiaries of
    Schlumberger. Expenditures for replacements and improvements are
    capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operating
    expenses as incurred. Upon sale or other disposition, the
    applicable amounts of asset cost and accumulated depreciation
    are removed from the balance sheet and the net amount, less
    proceeds from disposal, is charged or credited to income.

Multiclient
    Seismic Data

The multiclient library consists of completed and in-process
    seismic surveys that are licensed on a nonexclusive basis.
    Multiclient surveys are primarily generated utilizing
    Schlumberger resources. Schlumberger capitalizes costs directly



Part II, Item 8

incurred in acquiring and processing the multiclient seismic
    data. Such costs are charged to

Cost of revenue

based on
    the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue
    that Schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such
    data. However, under no circumstance will an individual survey
    carry a net book value greater than a 4- year straight-line
    amortized value.

The carrying value of the multiclient library is reviewed for
    impairment annually as well as when an event or change in
    circumstance indicating impairment may have occurred.
    Adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is
    determined that estimated future cash flows, which involves
    significant judgment on the part of Schlumberger, would not be
    sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys.
    Significant adverse changes in Schlumberger’s estimated
    future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future
    period.

Goodwill,
    Other Intangibles and Long-lived Assets

Schlumberger records the excess of purchase price over the fair
    value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets
    acquired as goodwill. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually
    as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an
    impairment may have occurred. Goodwill is tested for impairment
    by comparing the fair value of Schlumberger’s individual
    reporting units to their carrying amount to determine if there
    is a potential goodwill impairment. If the fair value of the
    reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment
    loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of
    the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying
    value.

Long-lived assets, including fixed assets and intangible assets,
    are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. In reviewing for impairment, the carrying value of
    such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future
    cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their
    eventual disposition. If such cash flows are not sufficient to
    support the asset’s recorded value, an impairment charge is
    recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long-lived asset
    to its estimated fair value. The determination of future cash
    flows as well as the estimated fair value of long-lived assets
    involve significant estimates on the part of management. If
    there is a material change in economic conditions or other
    circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or
    fair value, Schlumberger could be required to recognize
    impairment charges in the future.

Intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships,
    technology/technical know-how and tradenames acquired in
    business combinations. Customer relationships are generally
    amortized over periods ranging from 7 to 28 years, acquired
    technology/technical know-how are generally amortized over
    periods ranging from 5 to 18 years and tradenames are
    generally amortized over periods ranging from 5 years to
    30 years.

Taxes on
    Income

Schlumberger computes taxes on income in accordance with the tax
    rules and regulations of the many taxing authorities where the
    income is earned. The income tax rates imposed by these taxing
    authorities vary substantially. Taxable income may differ from
    pretax income for financial accounting purposes. To the extent
    that differences are due to revenue or expense items reported in
    one period for tax purposes and in another period for financial
    accounting purposes, an appropriate provision for deferred
    income taxes is made. Any effect of changes in income tax rates
    or tax laws are included in the provision for income taxes in
    the period of enactment. When it is more likely than not that a
    portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in
    the future, Schlumberger provides a corresponding valuation
    allowance against deferred tax assets.

Schlumberger’s tax filings are subject to regular audit by
    the tax authorities in most of the jurisdictions in which it
    conducts business. These audits may result in assessments for
    additional taxes which are resolved with the authorities or,
    potentially, through the courts. Schlumberger recognizes the
    impact of a tax position in its financial statements if that
    position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit,
    based on the technical merits of the position. Tax liabilities
    are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will
    be due upon the conclusion of these audits. Estimates of these
    tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are
    updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances. However,
    due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations,
    it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result
    in liabilities which could be materially different from these
    estimates. In such an event, Schlumberger will record additional
    tax expense or tax benefit in the year in which such resolution
    occurs.



Part II, Item 8

Schlumberger generally does not provide income taxes relating to
    undistributed earnings, as the earnings either would not be
    taxable when remitted or are considered to be indefinitely
    reinvested.

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

Schlumberger’s assets that are exposed to concentrations of
    credit risk consist primarily of cash, short-term investments,
    fixed income investments held to maturity, receivables from
    clients and derivative financial instruments. Schlumberger
    places its cash, short-term investments and fixed income
    investments held to maturity with financial institutions and
    corporations, and limits the amount of credit exposure with any
    one of them. Schlumberger regularly evaluates the
    creditworthiness of the issuers in which it invests. The
    receivables from clients are spread over many countries and
    customers. Schlumberger maintains an allowance for uncollectible
    accounts receivable based on expected collectibility and
    performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’
    financial condition. By using derivative financial instruments
    to hedge exposure to changes in exchange rates and commodity
    prices, Schlumberger exposes itself to some credit risk.
    Schlumberger minimizes this credit risk by entering into
    transactions with high-quality counterparties, limiting the
    exposure to each counterparty and monitoring the financial
    condition of its counterparties.

Research &
    Engineering

All research and engineering expenditures are expensed as
    incurred.

Earnings per
    Share

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by
    the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
    the year. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by first
    adding back to net income the interest expense on any
    outstanding convertible debentures and then dividing this
    adjusted net income attributable to Schlumberger by the sum of
    (i) unvested restricted stock units; and (ii) the
    weighted average number of common shares outstanding assuming
    dilution. The weighted average number of common shares
    outstanding assuming dilution assumes (a) that all stock
    options which are in the money are exercised at the beginning of
    the period and that the proceeds are used by Schlumberger to
    purchase shares at the average market price for the period, and
    (b) the conversion of any outstanding convertible
    debentures.

    respectively, were outstanding but were not included in the

Acquisitions

Merger with Smith
    International, Inc.

On August 27, 2010, Schlumberger acquired all of the
    outstanding shares of Smith, a leading supplier of premium
    products and services to the oil and gas exploration and
    production industry. The merger brings together the
    complementary drilling and measurements technologies and
    expertise of Schlumberger and Smith in order to facilitate the
    engineering of complete drilling systems which optimize all of
    the components of the drill string. Such systems will enable
    Schlumberger’s customers to achieve improved drilling
    efficiency, better well placement and increased wellbore
    assurance as they face increasingly more challenging
    environments. In addition, Schlumberger’s geographic
    footprint will facilitate the extension of joint offerings on a
    worldwide basis.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, Smith became a
    wholly-owned subsidiary of Schlumberger. Each share of Smith
    common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
    effective time of the merger was converted into the right to
    receive 0.6966 shares of Schlumberger common stock, with
    cash paid in lieu of fractional shares.

At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding option to
    purchase Smith common stock was converted pursuant to the merger
    agreement into a stock option to acquire shares of Schlumberger
    common stock on the same terms and conditions as were in effect
    immediately prior to the completion of the merger. The number of
    shares of Schlumberger common stock underlying each converted
    Smith stock option was determined by multiplying the number of
    Smith stock options by the 0.6966 exchange ratio, and rounding
    down to the nearest whole share. The exercise price per share of
    each converted Smith stock option was determined by dividing the
    per share exercise price of such stock option by the 0.6966
    exchange ratio, and rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Smith
    stock options, whether or not then vested and exercisable,
    became fully vested and exercisable and assumed by Schlumberger
    at the effective date of the merger in accordance with
    preexisting

change-in-control

provisions. Smith stock options were converted into
    0.6 million of Schlumberger stock options.

At the effective time of the merger, Smith restricted stock
    units, whether or not then vested, became fully vested (except
    for grants between the date of the merger agreement and closing,
    which were not significant and did not automatically vest) and
    were converted into shares of Schlumberger common stock in
    connection with the merger, determined by multiplying the number
    of shares of Smith common stock subject to each award by the
    0.6966 exchange ratio, rounded to the nearest whole share
    (assuming, in the case of performance-based Smith restricted
    stock unit awards, the deemed attainment of the performance
    goals under the award at the target level).

The long-term debt was repaid at the time of closing.

Intangible assets recorded in connection with this transaction,
    which primarily relate to customer relationships, will be
    amortized over a weighted average period of approximately
    17 years. The amount allocated to goodwill represents the
    excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net
    assets acquired and is not tax deductible for income tax
    purposes.

Other
    Acquisitions

Schlumberger has made other acquisitions and minority
    investments, none of which were significant on an individual
    basis, for cash payments, net of cash acquired, of
    $212 million during 2010, $514 million during 2009,
    and $345 million during 2008.

Supplemental Pro
    Forma Data

Smith’s results of operations have been included in
    Schlumberger’s financial statements for periods subsequent
    to the effective date of the merger. Smith contributed revenues
    of $3.3 billion and net income of $160 million
    (including the recurring effects of purchase accounting) to
    Schlumberger for the period from the closing of the merger
    through December 31, 2010. The following unaudited
    supplemental pro forma data (“pro forma data”)
    presents consolidated information as if the merger with Smith
    and the acquisition of Geoservices had been completed on
    January 1, 2009:

Part II, Item 8

The pro forma data was prepared based on the historical
    financial information of Schlumberger, Smith and Geoservices and
    has been adjusted to give effect to pro forma adjustments that
    are (i) directly attributable to the transactions,
    (ii) factually supportable and (iii) expected to have
    a continuing impact on the combined results. The pro forma data
    is not necessarily indicative of what Schlumberger’s
    results of operations actually would have been had the
    transactions been completed on January 1, 2009.
    Additionally, the pro forma data does not purport to project the
    future results of operations of the combined company nor do they
    reflect the expected realization of synergies associated with
    the transactions. The pro forma data reflects the application of
    the following adjustments:

•

Elimination of the gain resulting from Schlumberger’s
    remeasurement of its previously held 40% equity interest in M-I
    SWACO, which is considered non-recurring.

•

Additional depreciation and amortization expense associated with
    fair value adjustments to acquired identifiable intangible
    assets and property, plant and equipment.

•

Elimination of charges incurred in 2010 related to the fair
    value adjustments to Smith’s inventory that has been sold
    as they will not have a long-term continuing impact.

•

Reductions in interest expense as a result of increasing the
    carrying value of acquired debt obligations to its estimated
    fair value.

•

Elimination of transaction costs incurred in 2010 that are
    directly related to the transactions, and do not have a
    continuing impact on the combined company’s operating
    results.

•

The issuance of 176 million of shares of Schlumberger
    common stock.

Included in the 2010 and 2009 pro forma net income attributable

    transaction.

The fair value adjustment presented above represents changes in
    the fair value of the portion of Schlumberger’s fixed rate
    debt that is hedged through the use of interest rate swaps.

During the third and fourth quarters of 2010, Schlumberger
    repurchased all of its $650 million 6.50% Notes due
    2012.

During the first quarter of 2009, Schlumberger entered into a
    €3.0 billion Euro Medium Term Note program. This
    program provides for the issuance of various types of debt
    instruments such as fixed or floating rate notes in euro, US
    dollar or other currencies.

Schlumberger issued €1.0 billion 2.75% Guaranteed
    Notes due 2015 in the fourth quarter of 2010 under this program.
    Schlumberger entered into agreements to swap these euro notes
    for US dollars on the date of issue until maturity, effectively
    making this a US dollar denominated debt on which Schlumberger
    will pay interest in US dollars at a rate of 2.56%. Schlumberger
    also issued €1.0 billion 4.50% Guaranteed Notes due
    2014 in the first quarter of 2009 under this program.
    Schlumberger entered into agreements to swap these euro notes
    for US dollars on the date of issue until maturity, effectively
    making this a US dollar denominated debt on which Schlumberger
    will pay interest in US dollars at a rate of 4.95%.

During the third quarter of 2009, Schlumberger issued
    $450 million of 3.00% Guaranteed Notes due 2013.



Part II, Item 8

In September 2008, Schlumberger issued €500 million
    5.25% Guaranteed Notes due 2013. Schlumberger entered into
    agreements to swap these euro notes for US dollars on the date
    of issue until maturity, effectively making this a US dollar
    denominated debt on which Schlumberger will pay interest in US
    dollars at a rate of 4.74%.

Commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31,
    2010 and 2009 include certain notes issued in currencies other
    than the US dollar which were swapped for US dollars and pounds
    sterling on the date of issue until maturity. Commercial paper
    borrowings are classified as long-term debt to the extent of
    their backup by available and unused committed credit facilities
    maturing in more than one year and to the extent it is
    Schlumberger’s intent to maintain these obligations for
    longer than one year.

At December 31, 2010, Schlumberger had separate committed
    debt facility agreements aggregating $6.0 billion with
    commercial banks, of which $3.7 billion was available and
    unused. This included $4.9 billion of committed facilities
    which support commercial paper programs in the United States and
    Europe, of which $2.5 billion mature in December 2011 and
    $2.4 billion mature in April 2012. Interest rates and other
    terms of borrowing under these lines of credit vary from country
    to country. Borrowings under the commercial paper programs at
    December 31, 2010 were $1.9 billion ($0.4 billion
    at December 31, 2009). At December 31, 2010,
    $1.5 billion of the commercial paper borrowings were
    classified within

Long-term debt – current portion

in the

Consolidated Balance Sheet

.

On January 10, 2011, Schlumberger issued $1.1 billion
    of 4.200% Senior Notes due 2021 and $500 million of
    2.650% Senior Notes due 2016.

    $994 million after 2015.

The fair value of Schlumberger’s

Long-term Debt

at
    December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 was
    $5.6 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively, and was
    estimated based on quoted market prices.

Convertible
    Debentures

During 2003, Schlumberger Limited issued $975 million
    aggregate principal amount of 1.5% Series A Convertible
    Debentures due June 1, 2023 and $450 million aggregate
    principal amount of 2.125% Series B Convertible Debentures
    due June 1, 2023. The Series A debentures were
    convertible, at the holders’ option, into shares of common
    stock of Schlumberger Limited at a conversion rate of
    27.651 shares for each $1,000 of principal amount
    (equivalent to an initial conversion price of $36.165 per share)
    while the Series B debentures were convertible into common
    stock at a conversion rate of 25.000 shares for each $1,000
    of principal (equivalent to an initial conversion price of
    $40.00 per share).

During 2008, all of the remaining $353 million of
    outstanding Series A debentures were converted into
    9.8 million shares of Schlumberger common stock.

During 2008, $95 million of the Series B debentures
    were converted into 2.4 million shares of Schlumberger
    common stock. At December 31, 2009, there were
    $321 million of the Series B debentures outstanding.
    During 2010, $320 million of these debentures were
    converted by holders into 8.0 million shares of
    Schlumberger common stock and the remaining



Part II, Item 8

$1 million of outstanding Series B convertible
    debentures were redeemed for cash. Consequently, there are no
    convertible debentures outstanding at December 31, 2010.

Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities

Schlumberger is exposed to market risks related to fluctuations
    in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and
    interest rates. To mitigate these risks, Schlumberger utilizes
    derivative instruments. Schlumberger does not enter into
    derivatives for speculative purposes.

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Rate Risk

As a multinational company, Schlumberger conducts its business
    in approximately 80 countries. Schlumberger’s functional
    currency is primarily the US dollar, which is consistent with
    the oil and gas industry. Approximately 80% of
    Schlumberger’s revenue in 2010 was denominated in US
    dollars. However, outside the United States, a significant
    portion of Schlumberger’s expenses is incurred in foreign
    currencies. Therefore, when the US dollar weakens (strengthens)
    in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which
    Schlumberger conducts business, the US dollar –
    reported expenses will increase (decrease).

Schlumberger is exposed to risks on future cash flows to the
    extent that local currency expenses exceed revenues denominated
    in local currency that are other than the functional currency.
    Schlumberger uses foreign currency forward contracts and foreign
    currency options to provide a hedge against a portion of these
    cash flow risks. These contracts are accounted for as cash flow
    hedges, with the effective portion of changes in the fair value
    of the hedge recorded on the

Consolidated Balance Sheet

and in

Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).

Amounts
    recorded in

Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

are
    reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods that
    the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective
    portion of changes in the fair value of hedging instruments, if
    any, is recorded directly to earnings.

At December 31, 2010, Schlumberger recognized a cumulative
    net $45 million gain in

Accumulated other comprehensive
    loss

relating to revaluation of foreign currency forward
    contracts and foreign currency options designated as cash flow
    hedges, the majority of which is expected to be reclassified
    into earnings within the next twelve months.

Schlumberger is also exposed to changes in the fair value of
    assets and liabilities, including certain of its long-term debt,
    which are denominated in currencies other than the functional
    currency. Schlumberger uses foreign currency forward contracts
    and foreign currency options to hedge this exposure as it
    relates to certain currencies. These contracts are accounted for
    as fair value hedges with the fair value of the contracts
    recorded on the

Consolidated Balance Sheet

and changes in
    the fair value recognized in the

Consolidated Statement of
    Income

along with the change in fair value of the hedged
    item.

At December 31, 2010, contracts were outstanding for the US
    dollar equivalent of $7.3 billion in various foreign
    currencies.

Commodity
    Price Risk

Schlumberger is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in
    the price of certain commodities, such as metals and fuel.
    Schlumberger utilizes forward contracts to manage a small
    percentage of the price risk associated with forecasted metal
    purchases. The objective of these contracts is to reduce the
    variability of cash flows associated with the forecasted
    purchase of those commodities. These contracts do not qualify
    for hedge accounting treatment and therefore, changes in the
    fair value of the forward contracts are recorded directly to
    earnings.

At December 31, 2010, $12 million of commodity forward
    contracts were outstanding.

Interest
    Rate Risk

Schlumberger is subject to interest rate risk on its debt and
    its investment portfolio. Schlumberger maintains an interest
    rate risk management strategy that uses a mix of variable and
    fixed rate debt combined with its investment portfolio and
    interest rate swaps to mitigate the exposure to changes in
    interest rates.

During the third quarter of 2009, Schlumberger entered into
    interest rate swaps relating to two of its debt instruments. The
    first swap was for a notional amount of $450 million in
    order to hedge changes in the fair value of



Part II, Item 8

Schlumberger’s $450 million 3.00% Notes due 2013.
    Under the terms of this swap, Schlumberger receives interest at
    a fixed rate of 3.0% annually and will pay interest quarterly at
    a floating rate of three-month LIBOR plus a spread of 0.765%.
    This interest rate swap is designated as a fair value hedge of
    the underlying debt. This derivative instrument is marked to
    market with gains and losses recognized currently in income to
    offset the respective losses and gains recognized on changes in
    the fair value of the hedged debt. This results in no net gain
    or loss being recognized in the

Consolidated Statement of
    Income

.

The second swap was for a notional amount of $600 million
    in order to hedge a portion of the changes in fair value of
    Schlumberger’s $650 million 6.50% Notes due 2012.
    Under the terms of this swap agreement, Schlumberger received
    interest at a fixed rate of 6.50% semi-annually and paid
    interest semi-annually at a floating rate of one-month LIBOR
    plus a spread of 4.84%. During the third and fourth quarters of
    2010, Schlumberger repurchased all of the outstanding
    $650 million 6.50% Notes due 2012. Accordingly, this
    interest rate swap, which had previously been designated as a
    fair value hedge of the underlying debt, was settled during the
    fourth quarter and resulted in Schlumberger receiving proceeds
    of approximately $10 million.

At December 31, 2010, Schlumberger had fixed rate debt
    aggregating approximately $4.9 billion and variable rate
    debt aggregating approximately $3.2 billion, after taking
    into account the effects of the interest rate swaps.

Stock
    Compensation Plans

Schlumberger has three types of stock-based compensation
    programs: stock options, a restricted stock and restricted stock
    unit program (collectively referred to as “restricted
    stock”) and a discounted stock purchase plan
    (“DSPP”).

Stock
    Options

Key employees are granted stock options under Schlumberger stock
    option plans. For all of the stock options granted, the exercise
    price equals the average of the high and low sales prices of
    Schlumberger stock on the date of grant; an option’s
    maximum term is ten years, and options generally vest in
    increments over four or five years.

The fair value of each stock option grant was estimated on the
    date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with
    the following weighted-average assumptions and resulting
    weighted-average fair value per share:

Discounted
    Stock Purchase Plan

Under the terms of the DSPP, employees can choose to have a
    portion of their earnings withheld, subject to certain
    restrictions, to purchase Schlumberger common stock. The
    purchase price of the stock is 92.5% of the lower of the stock
    price at the beginning or end of the plan period at six-month
    intervals.

The fair value of the employees’ purchase rights under the

Schlumberger conducts business in more than 100 jurisdictions, a
    number of which have tax laws that are not fully defined and are
    evolving. Due to the geographic breadth of the Schlumberger
    operations, numerous tax audits may be ongoing throughout the
    world at any point in time. Tax liabilities are recorded based
    on estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the
    conclusion of these audits. Estimates of these tax liabilities
    are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of
    changes in facts and circumstances. However, due to the
    uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, it is
    possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in
    liabilities which could be materially different from these
    estimates. In such an event, Schlumberger will record additional
    tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such
    resolution occurs.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of
    liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions for the
    years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 is as follows:

Part II, Item 8

The amounts above exclude accrued interest and penalties of
    $210 million, $168 million and $136 million at
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 respectively. All of the
    unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact the
    Schlumberger effective tax rate.

Schlumberger classifies interest and penalties relating to
    uncertain tax positions within

Taxes on income

in the

Consolidated Statement of Income

. During 2010, 2009 and
    2008, Schlumberger recognized approximately $42 million,
    $32 million and $25 million in interest and penalties,
    respectively.

The following table summarizes the tax years that are either
    currently under audit or remain open and subject to examination
    by the tax authorities in the most significant jurisdictions in
    which Schlumberger operates:

Brazil

2004 – 2010

Canada

2003 – 2010

Mexico

2005 – 2010

2005 – 2010

In certain of the jurisdictions noted above, Schlumberger
    operates through more than one legal entity, each of which has
    different open years subject to examination. The table above
    presents the open years subject to examination for the most
    material of the legal entities in each jurisdiction.
    Additionally, it is important to note that tax years are
    technically not closed until the statute of limitations in each
    jurisdiction expires. In the jurisdictions noted above, the
    statute of limitations can extend beyond the open years subject
    to examination.

Contingencies

In 2007, Schlumberger received an inquiry from the United States
    Department of Justice (“DOJ”) related to the
    DOJ’s investigation of whether certain freight forwarding
    and customs clearance services of Panalpina, Inc., and other
    companies provided to oil and oilfield service companies,
    including Schlumberger, violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices
    Act. Schlumberger is cooperating with the DOJ. Schlumberger is
    cooperating with the governmental authorities and is currently
    unable to predict the outcome of this matter.

In 2009, Schlumberger learned that United States officials began
    a grand jury investigation and an associated regulatory inquiry,
    both related to certain Schlumberger operations in specified
    countries that are subject to United States trade and economic
    sanctions. Also in 2009, Smith received an administrative
    subpoena with respect to its historical business practices in
    certain countries that are subject to United States trade and
    economic sanctions. Schlumberger is cooperating with the
    governmental authorities and is currently unable to predict the
    outcome of these matters.

On April 20, 2010, a fire and explosion occurred onboard
    the semisubmersible drilling rig

Deepwater Horizon

, owned
    by Transocean Ltd. and under contract to a subsidiary of BP plc.
    Pursuant to a contract between M-I SWACO and BP, M-I SWACO
    provided certain services under the direction of BP. A number of
    legal actions, certain of which name an M-I SWACO entity as a
    defendant, have been filed in connection with the

Deepwater
    Horizon

incident, and additional legal



Part II, Item 8

actions may be filed in the future. Based on information
    currently known, the amount of any potential loss attributable
    to M-I SWACO with respect to potential liabilities related to
    the incident would not be material to Schlumberger’s
    consolidated financial position.

Schlumberger and its subsidiaries are party to various other
    legal proceedings from time to time. A liability is accrued when
    a loss is both probable and can be reasonably estimated.
    Management believes that the probability of a material loss is
    remote and, as such, that any liability that might ensue would
    not be material in relation to Schlumberger’s consolidated
    financial position. However, litigation is inherently uncertain
    and it is not possible to predict the ultimate disposition of
    these proceedings.

17.

Segment
    Information

Schlumberger operates five business segments as of
    December 31, 2010: Oilfield Services, WesternGeco, M-I
    SWACO, Smith Oilfield and Distribution.

The Oilfield Services segment falls into four clearly defined
    economic and geographical areas and is evaluated on the
    following basis: North America, Latin America, Europe including
    the CIS and Africa, and Middle East & Asia. The
    Oilfield Services segment provides virtually all exploration and
    production services required during the life of an oil and gas
    reservoir.

During each of the three years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008, no single customer exceeded 10% of consolidated
    revenue.

Schlumberger did not have revenue from third-party customers in
    its country of domicile during the last three years. Revenue in
    the United States in 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $6.5 billion,
    $3.7 billion and $5.9 billion, respectively.

18.

Pension and
    Other Benefit Plans

Pension
    Plans

Schlumberger sponsors several defined benefit pension plans that
    cover substantially all US employees hired prior to
    October 1, 2004. The benefits are based on years of service
    and compensation, on a career-average pay basis.

In addition to the United States defined benefit pension plans,
    Schlumberger sponsors several other international defined
    benefit pension plans. The most significant of these
    international plans are the International Staff Pension Plan,
    which was converted from a defined contribution plan to a
    defined benefit pension plan during the fourth quarter of 2008,
    and the UK pension plan (collectively, the “International
    plans”). The International Staff Pension Plan covers
    certain international employees and is based on years of service
    and compensation on a career-average pay basis. The UK plan
    covers employees hired prior to April 1, 1999, and is based
    on years of service and compensation, on a final salary basis.

During 2009, due to the actions taken by Schlumberger to reduce
    its global workforce (See Note 3 –

Charges and
    Credits

), Schlumberger experienced a significant reduction
    in the expected aggregate years of future service of its
    employees in certain of its pension plans and its postretirement
    medical plan. Accordingly, Schlumberger recorded a curtailment
    charge of $136 million during the second quarter of 2009
    ($130 million relating to the pension plans and
    $6 million relating to the postretirement medical plan).
    The curtailment charge includes recognition of the change in
    benefit obligations as well as a portion of the previously
    unrecognized prior service costs, reflecting the reduction in
    expected future service for the impacted plans. As a result of
    the curtailment, Schlumberger performed a remeasurement of the
    impacted plans using a discount rate of 7.25% (as compared to
    6.50% at December 31, 2008). All other significant
    assumptions were unchanged from December 31, 2008
    measurement date.

As the International Staff Pension Plan was converted to a
    defined benefit pension plan during the fourth quarter of 2008,
    the net pension cost for this plan was not significant in 2008.

The weighted-average assumed discount rate and compensation
    increases used to determine the projected benefit obligations

The funded status position represents the difference between the
    plan assets and the projected benefit obligation
    (“PBO”). The PBO represents the actuarial present
    value of benefits based on employee service and compensation and
    includes an assumption about future compensation levels. The
    accumulated benefit obligation represents the actuarial present
    value of benefits based on employee service and compensation,

    levels.

Schlumberger’s investment policy includes various
    guidelines and procedures designed to ensure that assets are
    prudently invested in a manner necessary to meet the future
    benefit obligation of the pension plans. The policy does not
    permit the direct investment of plan assets in any Schlumberger
    security. Schlumberger’s investment horizon is long-term
    and accordingly the target asset allocations encompass a
    strategic, long-term perspective of capital markets, expected
    risk and return behavior and perceived future economic
    conditions. The key investment principles of



Part II, Item 8

diversification, assessment of risk and targeting the optimal
    expected returns for given levels of risk are applied. The
    target asset allocation is reviewed periodically and is
    determined based on a long-term projection of capital market
    outcomes, inflation rates, fixed income yields, returns,
    volatilities and correlation relationships. The inclusion of any
    given asset class in the target asset allocation is considered
    in relation to its impact on the overall risk/return
    characteristics as well as its impact on the overall investment
    return. As part of its strategy, Schlumberger may utilize
    certain derivative instruments, such as options, futures, swaps
    and forwards, within the plans to manage risks (currency,
    interest rate, etc.) or as a substitute for physical securities
    or to obtain exposure to different markets.

Asset performance is monitored frequently with an overall
    expectation that plan assets will meet or exceed the weighted
    index of its target asset allocation and component benchmark
    over rolling five year periods.

The expected long-term rate of return on assets assumptions
    reflect the average rate of earnings expected on funds invested
    or to be invested. The assumptions have been determined by
    reflecting expectations regarding future rates of return for the
    portfolio considering the asset allocation and related
    historical rates of return. The appropriateness of the
    assumptions is reviewed annually.

The fair value of Schlumberger’s pension plan assets at
    December 31, 2010, by asset category, was as follows:

The fair values presented below were determined based on
    valuation techniques categorized as follows:

•

Level one: The use of quoted prices in active markets for
    identical instruments.

•

Level two: The use of quoted prices for similar instruments in
    active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar
    instruments in markets that are not active or other inputs that
    are observable in the market or can be corroborated by
    observable market data.

•

Level three: The use of significantly unobservable inputs that
    typically require the use of management’s estimates of
    assumptions that market participants would use in pricing.

The funding policy is to annually contribute amounts that are
    based upon a number of factors including the actuarial accrued
    liability, amounts that are deductible for income tax purposes,
    legal funding requirements and available cash flow. Schlumberger
    currently anticipates contributing approximately
    $600 million to $650 million to its postretirement
    benefit plans in 2011, subject to market and business conditions.

Part II, Item 8

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of Schlumberger Limited is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a –
    15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
    Schlumberger Limited’s internal control over financial
    reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
    regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
    preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Schlumberger Limited management assessed the effectiveness of
    its internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010. In making this assessment, it used the
    criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
    of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
    Control – Integrated Framework.

Based on this
    assessment Schlumberger Limited management has concluded that,
    as of December 31, 2010, its internal control over
    financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

The effectiveness of Schlumberger Limited’s internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010,
    has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent
    registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report
    which appears herein.



Part II, Item 8

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders

of Schlumberger Limited

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
    the related consolidated statements of income, of
    stockholders’ equity and of cash flows present fairly, in
    all material respects, the financial position of Schlumberger
    Limited and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
    each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
    2010 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
    in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the
    Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010,
    based on criteria established in

Internal Control –
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions
    on these financial statements and on the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
    We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
    control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Controls

Schlumberger has carried out an evaluation under the supervision
    and with the participation of Schlumberger’s management,
    including the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and the
    Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), of the effectiveness
    of the design and operation of Schlumberger’s disclosure
    controls and procedures. Based upon Schlumberger’s
    evaluation, the CEO and the CFO have concluded that, as of
    December 31, 2010, the disclosure controls and procedures
    were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information
    required to be disclosed in the reports Schlumberger files and
    submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded,
    processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
    specified in SEC rules and forms.

There has been no change in Schlumberger’s internal control
    over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended
    December 31, 2010 that has materially affected, or is
    reasonably likely to materially affect, Schlumberger’s
    internal control over financial reporting.
