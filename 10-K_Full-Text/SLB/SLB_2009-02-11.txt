Part 1, Item 1

PART I

Item 1.    Business.

All references in this report to “Registrant”, “Company”,
“Schlumberger”, “we” or “our” are to Schlumberger Limited and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Founded in 1926,
Schlumberger is the world’s leading supplier of technology, integrated project management and information solutions to customers working in the oil and gas industry worldwide. As of December 31, 2008, the Company employed approximately
87,000 people of over 140 nationalities operating in approximately 80 countries. Schlumberger has principal executive offices in Paris, Houston, and The Hague and consists of two business segments – Schlumberger Oilfield Services and
WesternGeco. Schlumberger Oilfield Services provides the industry’s widest range of products and services from exploration to production, while WesternGeco is the world’s most technologically advanced surface seismic company.

Schlumberger Oilfield Services

is the world’s leading provider of technology,
integrated project management and information solutions to the international oil and gas exploration and production industry. Schlumberger Oilfield Services manages its business through GeoMarket* regions, which are grouped into four geographic
areas: North America, Latin America, Europe/CIS/Africa and Middle East & Asia. The GeoMarket structure offers customers a single point of contact at the local level for field operations and brings together geographically focused teams to
meet local needs and deliver customized solutions.

Schlumberger invented wireline logging as a technique for obtaining downhole data in oil
and gas wells. Today, Schlumberger Oilfield Services operates in each of the major oilfield service markets, providing services that cover the entire life cycle of the reservoir. These services, in which Schlumberger holds a number of market leading
positions, are organized into a number of technology-based product and service lines, or Technologies, to capitalize on technical synergies and introduce innovative solutions within the GeoMarket regions. The Technologies are also responsible for
overseeing operational processes, resource allocation, personnel and quality, health, safety and environmental matters in the GeoMarket.

The Technologies are:

·

Wireline – provides the information necessary to evaluate the subsurface formation rocks and fluids to plan and monitor well construction, and to monitor and
evaluate well production. Wireline offers both open-hole and cased-hole services.

·

Drilling & Measurements – supplies directional-drilling, measurement-while-drilling and logging-while-drilling services for all well profiles.

·

Well Testing – provides exploration and production pressure and flow-rate measurement services both at the surface and downhole. The Technology also provides
tubing-conveyed perforating services.

·

Well Services – provides services used during oil and gas well drilling and completion as well as those used to maintain optimal production throughout the life
of a well. The services include pressure pumping, well cementing and stimulation operations as well as intervention activities. The Technology also develops coiled-tubing equipment and services.

·

Completions – supplies well completion services and equipment that include gas-lift and safety valves as well as a range of intelligent well completions
technology and equipment.

·

Artificial Lift – provides production optimization services using electrical submersible pumps and associated equipment.



Part 1, Item 1

·

Data & Consulting Services – supplies interpretation and integration of all exploration and production data types, as well as expert consulting
services for reservoir characterization, production enhancement, field development planning and multi-disciplinary reservoir and production solutions.

·

Schlumberger Information Solutions (SIS) – provides consulting, software, information management and IT infrastructure products and services that support core
oil and gas industry operational processes.

Supporting the Technologies are 20 research and engineering centers. Through this organization, Schlumberger is committed to advanced technology programs that enhance oilfield efficiency, lower finding and producing costs, improve
productivity, maximize reserve recovery and increase asset value while accomplishing these goals in a safe and environmentally sound manner.

Schlumberger Oilfield Services also offers customers its services through a business model known as Integrated Project Management (IPM). IPM combines the required products and services of the Schlumberger Technologies with drilling rig
management expertise and project management skills to provide a complete solution to well construction and production improvement. IPM projects are typically of multi-year duration and include start-up costs and significant third-party components
that cover services that Schlumberger does not provide directly. Some projects may be fixed price in nature and may contain penalties for non-performance.

Schlumberger Oilfield Services uses its own personnel to market its products and services. The customer base, business risks and opportunities for growth are essentially uniform across all services. There is a sharing
of manufacturing and engineering facilities as well as research centers, and the labor force is interchangeable. Technological innovation, quality of service, and price differentiation are the principal methods of competition, which varies
geographically with respect to the different services offered. While there are numerous competitors, both large and small, Schlumberger believes that it is an industry leader in providing wireline logging, well testing, measurement-while-drilling,
logging-while-drilling and directional-drilling services, as well as fully computerized logging and geoscience software and computing services. A large proportion of Schlumberger offerings are non-rig related; consequently, revenue does not
necessarily correlate to rig count fluctuations.

Schlumberger is a 40% owner in M-I SWACO – a joint venture with Smith International
– which offers the drilling and completion fluids used to stabilize subsurface rock strata during the drilling process and minimize formation damage during completion and workover operations.

WesternGeco,

the world’s most technologically advanced seismic company, provides
comprehensive reservoir imaging, monitoring and development services with the most extensive seismic crews and data processing centers in the industry as well as a leading multiclient seismic library. Services range from 3D and time-lapse
(4D) seismic surveys to multi-component surveys for delineating prospects and reservoir management. WesternGeco benefits from full access to the Schlumberger research, development and technology organization and shares similar business risks,
opportunities for growth, principal methods of competition and means of marketing as Schlumberger Oilfield Services. Seismic solutions include proprietary Q* technology for enhanced reservoir description, characterization and monitoring throughout
the life of the field—from exploration through enhanced recovery. Other WesternGeco solutions include development of controlled-source electromagnetic and magneto-telluric surveys and their integration with seismic data.

Positioned for meeting a full range of customer needs in land, marine and shallow-water transition-zone services, WesternGeco offers a wide scope of
technologies and services:

·

Land Seismic – provides comprehensive resources for seismic data acquisition on land and across shallow-water transition zones.



Part 1, Item 1

·

Marine Seismic – provides industry-standard marine seismic acquisition and processing systems as well as a unique industry-leading, fully calibrated
single-sensor marine seismic system that delivers the seismic technology needed for new-generation reservoir management.

·

GENERAL

Research Centers

Research to support the engineering and development efforts of Schlumberger activities is principally conducted at Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States; Cambridge,
England; Stavanger, Norway; Moscow, Russia; and Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.

Patents

While Schlumberger seeks and holds numerous patents covering various
products and processes, no particular patent or group of patents is considered material to Schlumberger’s business.

Seasonality

Item 1A.    Risk Factors.

The following discussion of risk factors contains “forward-looking statements,” as discussed immediately following Item 7A. of this Report. These risk factors may be important to understanding any
statement in this Report or elsewhere. The following information should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis, and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Report.

We urge you to carefully consider the risks described below, as well as in other reports
and materials that we file with the SEC and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Report. If any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this Report were to materialize, our business, financial condition, results
of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently
known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business and operations.

Demand for the majority of our services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by the oil and gas industry. Current global economic conditions have resulted in a significant decline in oil and gas
prices. If current global economic conditions and the availability of credit worsen or continue for an extended period, this could reduce our customers’ levels of expenditures and have a significant adverse effect on our revenue and operating
results.



Part 1, Item 1A

The current global credit and economic environment has reduced worldwide demand for energy
and resulted in significantly lower crude oil and natural gas prices. A substantial or extended decline in oil and natural gas prices can reduce our customers’ activities and their spending on our services and products. Demand for the majority
of our services substantially depends on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas reserves. These expenditures are sensitive to oil and natural gas prices and
generally dependent on the industry’s view of future oil and gas prices. As the worldwide deterioration in the financial and credit markets has deepened in recent months, demand for oil and gas has reduced dramatically and oil and gas prices
have fallen sharply, causing some of our customers to start to reduce or delay their oil and gas exploration and production spending. This has started to reduce the demand for our services and has begun to exert downward pressure on the prices that
we charge. If economic conditions continue to deteriorate or do not improve, it could result in further reductions of exploration and production expenditures by our customers, causing further declines in the demand for our services and products.
This could result in a significant adverse effect on our operating results. Furthermore, it is difficult to predict how long the economic downturn will continue, to what extent it will worsen, and to what extent this will continue to affect us.

The reduction in cash flows being experienced by our customers resulting from declines in commodity prices, together with the reduced
availability of credit and increased costs of borrowing due to the tightening of the credit markets, could have significant adverse effects on the financial condition of some of our customers. This could result in project modifications, delays or
cancellations, general business disruptions, and delay in, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us, which could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, our suppliers could be negatively
impacted by current global economic conditions. If certain of our suppliers were to experience significant cash flow issues or become insolvent as a result of such conditions, it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies or a
significant increase in the price of supplies, and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.

The prices for oil and
natural gas are subject to a variety of additional factors, including:

·

demand for energy, which is affected by worldwide population growth, economic development and general economic and business conditions;

·

the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries(“OPEC”) to set and maintain production levels for oil;

·

oil and gas production by non-OPEC countries;

·

political and economic uncertainty and socio-political unrest;

·

the level of worldwide oil exploration and production activity;

·

the cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas;

·

technological advances affecting energy consumption; and

·

weather conditions.

A significant portion of our revenue is derived from our non-United States operations, which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the
approximately 80 countries in which we operate.

Our non-United States
operations accounted for approximately 78% of our consolidated revenue in 2008, 76% in 2007 and 73% in 2006. Operations in countries other than the United States are subject to various risks, including:

·

unsettled political and economic conditions in certain areas;



Part 1, Item 1A

·

exposure to possible expropriation or other governmental actions;

·

social unrest, acts of terrorism, war or other armed conflict;

·

confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies;

·

deprivation of contract rights;

·

trade restrictions or embargoes imposed by the United States or other countries;

·

restrictions on the repatriation of income or capital;

·

exchange controls;

·

inflation; and

·

currency fluctuations and devaluations.

In addition, we are subject to risks associated with our operations in countries, including Iran, Syria, Sudan and Cuba, which are subject to trade and
economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the United States or other governments or organizations.

If any of the risks described
above materialize, it could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations.

We are also subject to risks related to investment
in our common stock in connection with certain US state divestment or investment limitation legislation applicable to companies with operations in these countries, and similar actions by some private investors, which could adversely affect the
market for our common stock.

Environmental compliance costs and liabilities
could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations.

We are
subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to importation and use of hazardous materials, radioactive materials and explosives, environmental protection, including laws and regulations governing air emissions, water discharges
and waste management. We incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations. The technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly expensive, complex and
stringent. These laws may provide for “strict liability” for damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety. Strict liability can render a party liable for damages without regard to negligence or fault on the part of
the party. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances.

We use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations. In addition, many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we could become subject to potentially material
liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties, and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to, or releases of, hazardous substances. In addition, stricter enforcement of
existing laws and regulations, new laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis of new or increased liabilities that
could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations. We believe we are currently in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations.

We could be subject to substantial liability claims, which would adversely affect our results and financial condition.

Certain equipment used in the delivery of oilfield services, such as
directional drilling equipment, perforating systems, subsea completion equipment, radioactive materials and explosives and well completion



Part 1, Item 1A

systems, are used in hostile environments, such as exploration, development and production applications. An accident or a failure of a product could cause
personal injury, loss of life, damage to property, equipment or the environment, and suspension of operations. Our insurance may not adequately protect us against liability for some kinds of events, including events involving pollution, or against
losses resulting from business interruption. Moreover, in the future we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate. Substantial claims made under our policies could cause our premiums to
increase. Any future damages caused by our products that are not covered by insurance, or are in excess of policy limits or are subject to substantial deductibles, could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations.

If we are unable to maintain technology leadership in the form of services and products,
this could affect any competitive advantage we hold.

If we are unable to
develop and produce competitive technology or deliver them to our clients in the form of services and products in a timely and cost-competitive manner in the various markets we serve, it could materially reduce our operating revenue and net income.

Limitations on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights,
including our trade secrets, could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold.

Some of our products or services, and the processes we use to produce or provide them, have been granted United States patent protection, have patent applications pending or are trade secrets. Our business may be
adversely affected if our patents are unenforceable, the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology, our patent applications are denied, or our trade secrets are not adequately protected. Our competitors may be
able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets.

We may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights.

The tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our services
may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. Infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business. Royalty payments under licenses from third parties,
if available, would increase our costs. If a license were not available we might not be able to continue providing a particular product or service, which would reduce our operating revenue. Additionally, developing non-infringing technologies would
increase our costs.

Failure to obtain and retain skilled technical
personnel could impede our operations.

We require highly skilled personnel
to operate and provide technical services and support for our business. Competition for the personnel required for our businesses intensifies as activity increases. In periods of high utilization it may become more difficult to find and
retain qualified individuals. This could increase our costs or have other adverse effects on our operations.

Severe weather conditions may affect our operations.

Our business may be materially affected by severe weather conditions in areas where we operate. This may entail the evacuation of personnel and stoppage of services. In
addition, if particularly severe weather affects platforms or structures, this may result in a suspension of activities until the platforms or structures have been repaired. Any of these events may have a material adverse effect on our operating
revenue.

Executive Overview

As 2008 progressed, early optimism of
continuing growth in oil and natural gas exploration and production activity was dampened by growing evidence of weakening economic conditions that began to significantly weigh upon the energy markets in early October. While such weakening did not
prevent oil prices from ramping up steeply to $147-per-barrel in July, the velocity of the subsequent reversal to under $40-per-barrel by the end of the year was supported by economic reports and forecasts that confirmed the majority of the OECD
(Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries to be in recession by the end of the third quarter. Consequently, global oil demand forecasts for 2008 dropped from quarter to quarter and it became apparent that moderating oil
demand growth in the non-OECD economies would no longer be sufficient to offset a continuing three-year demand decline within the OECD countries. As a result, 2008 saw the first global oil demand decrease in 25 years. In the fourth quarter OPEC
elected to cut production by a total of 3.7 million barrels per day to remove supply and support prices, however, the time taken for these cuts to be felt in the market, and for the resultant increased spare capacity to be reabsorbed by future
growth, was large enough for E&P customers to cut investment. This translated to lower demand and weaker prices for oilfield services in an increasing number of areas late in the fourth quarter.

The natural gas markets presented a similar picture. While activity was initially maintained in the first part of the year, the developing recession in
the latter part of 2008 led to lower industrial demand in the developed economies although commercial and residential demand was maintained. In North America, supply increased by 6% in 2008 largely as a result of industry deployment of advanced
drilling, production and completion technologies leading to higher gas production and consequently greater storage levels in spite of lower Canadian imports and decreased LNG (Liquified Natural Gas) supplies. Consequently, more LNG has become
available for other international importers and, as a result, the majority of the developed economies are well supplied for their needs. Within the United States, the world’s largest natural gas market, this translated to reduced gas
exploration and production investment with lower demand for oilfield services and consequent pressure on service pricing in a number of areas by the fourth quarter as the market price of natural gas fell. In international markets however, increasing
demand for natural gas in the developing economies led to sustained drilling activity with drilling rigs previously deployed on oil exploration and development moving to natural gas activity in some regions.

Within this volatile market, Schlumberger Oilfield Services revenue in 2008 grew by 20% versus 2007, with demand strongest in international markets.
Year-on-year growth rates reached 28% in Latin America, 24% in Europe/CIS/Africa, 18% in Middle East & Asia and 11% in North America. All Technologies experienced double-digit growth, most notably in Well Services, Drilling &
Measurements and Wireline. These results mask, however, a rapid reversal that occurred late in the year in response to the worsening economic climate, and, after three quarters of overall growth, revenues in the fourth quarter declined sequentially
through weakening local currencies and reduced customer spending, in addition to seasonal factors.

A variety of new Schlumberger products
and services contributed to growth in 2008. These included further penetration of Scanner Family* advanced wireline logging services and Scope* imaging-while-drilling technologies into new markets as customers sought to increase their understanding
of complex reservoirs. Growth through measurement integration also extended into the production domain with offerings such as the StimMAP* LIVE real-time fracture monitoring service that combines the measurement capability of Wireline with the
pressure pumping expertise of Well Services to track the progress of fracture stimulation in real time



Part II, Item 7

to be able to control the operation for maximum effect. Other new production-related services included ACTive* coiled-tubing services that combine a downhole
sensor package with a fiber-optic communications system to monitor coiled-tubing-enabled operations in real time.

Acquisitions in 2008 also
served to increase Schlumberger capabilities or added specific new technologies to the portfolio. In Canada, Schlumberger and First Reserve Corporation acquired Saxon Energy Services Inc., a land drilling contractor with major activity in North and
South America. Schlumberger had already enjoyed a long association with Saxon, including operation of joint ventures in Mexico and Colombia for the supply of drilling services that support integrated project management activities. Also in Canada,
Schlumberger acquired the business of Extreme Engineering Limited, a leading supplier of unmanned measurement-while-drilling systems to land markets in the United States and Canada. Other technology acquisitions included Integrated Exploration
Systems, a Germany-based technology leader in petroleum systems modeling, and Staag Imaging, a Houston-based provider of leading-edge depth imaging technologies for seismic data processing.

The performance of WesternGeco, where full-year 2008 revenue fell by 4% versus 2007, was limited by a combination of lower Multiclient sales, reduced Land
activity, and cost inflation that affected Marine operations. Among these factors, Multiclient sales were particularly weak with the sharp decrease reported in the first quarter not being reversed later in the year as a clear indication of customers
restricting discretionary spending for seismic data. Contract awards remained strong, however, and WesternGeco reported a record backlog of $1.8 billion at the end of the year, up $700 million from the end of the third quarter.

In spite of this weaker-than-expected performance, WesternGeco made significant progress in the introduction of new technology during the year. These
included a new proprietary full-azimuth marine acquisition technique, known as coil shooting, that leverages the signal fidelity and streamer-steering capability of Q* technology to provide resolution in sub-salt applications where wide-azimuth
techniques mobilize too many resources. Coil shooting provides the same quality survey but uses only one vessel to do so. In other new technology developments, the UniQ* latest-generation land acquisition system was unveiled. This substantially
increases the number of acquisition channels available and in combination with proprietary vibrator source technology delivers a sharper image and wider coverage.

The sharp drop in oil and gas prices in the latter part of 2008 that resulted in lower activity, higher inventories, and the belief that demand will erode further in 2009 as a result of the economic slowdown, has led
to rapid and substantial reductions in exploration and production expenditure. At current prices most of the new categories of hydrocarbon resources such as heavy oil, tar sands, coal-to-liquids, or gas-to-liquids are not economic to develop. In
addition, it will take time for inflation to be removed from the E&P supply chain to bring finding and development costs more in line with lower oil and gas prices.

Schlumberger therefore expects 2009 activity to weaken across the board, with the most significant declines occurring in North American gas drilling, Russian oil production enhancement, and in mature offshore basins.
Exploration offshore will also be somewhat curtailed but commitments already planned are likely to be honored. Seismic expenditures, particularly for multiclient data, are likely to decrease from the levels of 2008. Furthermore, pricing erosion will
compound these effects on revenue. In this market we are taking the necessary actions early in 2009 to adjust our operating cost base while preserving our long-term commitments to technology development, key skill sets and service and product
quality.

The most important indicator of a future recovery in oilfield services activity will be a stabilization and recovery in the demand
for oil. The recent years of increased exploration and production spending, however, have not been sufficient to substantially improve the supply situation. The age of the production base, accelerating decline rates and the smaller size of recently
developed fields will mean that any prolonged reduction in investment will lead to a strong rebound in activity in the future.

Oilfield Services

Fourth Quarter 2008 Results

Fourth-quarter revenue of $6.26 billion was 2% lower sequentially but was 15% higher year-on-year. Sequentially, Europe/CIS/Africa revenue declined primarily due to a weakening of the local currencies against the US
dollar and from lower activity in Russia as the result of reduced customer spending and seasonal slowdowns. In Latin America, revenue fell due to weaker local currencies and lower activity in the Venezuela/Trinidad & Tobago and
Mexico/Central America GeoMarkets. Middle East & Asia declined on lower activity in the Australia/Papua New Guinea/New Zealand and Qatar GeoMarkets. These decreases, however, were partially offset by an increase in North America as the
result of strong activity in the US Gulf of Mexico and US land West GeoMarkets. Local currency changes reduced Oilfield Services fourth-quarter revenue by approximately 3%.

Fourth-quarter pretax operating income of $1.60 billion was 6% lower sequentially but 4% higher year-on-year. Sequentially, pretax operating margin
decreased from 26.7% to 25.6% primarily as a result of reduced activity levels in the Europe/CIS/Africa, Latin America and Middle East & Asia Areas, partially offset by the improvement in overall activity and a more favorable revenue mix in
North America.

North America

Revenue of $1.56 billion increased 4% sequentially and 17% year-on-year. Pretax operating
income of $346 million increased 9% sequentially and 2% year-on-year.



Part II, Item 7

Sequentially, the US Gulf of Mexico GeoMarket activity recovered from the
slowdown experienced during the hurricane season of the third quarter and realized further growth on a higher ultra deep-water rig count that led to strong demand for Wireline, Well Testing and Well Services technologies. The US land West GeoMarket
revenue increased on strong demand for Well Services and Drilling & Measurements services and Artificial Lift products while the Alaska GeoMarket experienced a seasonal increase in activity that resulted in robust demand for Well Services
and Drilling & Measurements technologies. SIS experienced growth from strong year-end software and hardware sales. These increases were partially offset by decreased revenue in the US land Central and North GeoMarkets on reducing rig count
that accelerated at quarter end. Canada GeoMarket revenue was also lower primarily as the result of the weakening of the Canadian dollar.

Pretax operating margin improved sequentially from 21.1% to 22.3% mainly as a result of stronger activity levels and increased high-margin services in the US Gulf of Mexico, US land West and Alaska GeoMarkets. These increases were partially
offset by pricing pressure in the US land Central and North GeoMarkets.

Latin America

Revenue of $1.11 billion was 3% lower sequentially but increased 18%
year-on-year. Pretax operating income of $200 million decreased 13% sequentially and 4% year-on-year.

Sequentially, revenue in the
Venezuela/Trinidad & Tobago GeoMarket declined as a result of lower demand for Wireline and Well Services technologies and Completions products, while the Mexico/Central America GeoMarket experienced lower activity in Integrated Project
Management (IPM) projects. These decreases were partially offset by higher offshore exploration-related activity in the Brazil GeoMarket that led to robust demand for Wireline, Well Testing and Drilling & Measurements services, while
activity in the Peru/Colombia/Ecuador GeoMarket increased due to strong demand for Artificial Lift and SIS products. Area revenue was also reduced by approximately 4% due to the weakening of local currencies against the US dollar.

Pretax operating margin declined sequentially from 20.1% to 18.0% from lower activity and a less favorable revenue mix in the
Venezuela/Trinidad & Tobago GeoMarket, reduced gain share from IPM projects in the Peru/Colombia/Ecuador GeoMarket, and cost inflation and a less favorable revenue mix in the Mexico/Central America GeoMarket.

Europe/CIS/Africa

Revenue of $2.05 billion decreased 5% sequentially but increased 16% year-on-year. Pretax operating income of $533 million decreased 15% sequentially but
was 8% higher year-on-year.

Sequentially, Area revenue was 5% lower due to the weakening of local currencies against the US dollar
particularly in the North Sea, Continental Europe and Russia. Additionally, Russia experienced significant reductions in activity from lower customer spending and the seasonal slowdown in Sakhalin. Lower Framo revenue also contributed to the
decline. These decreases were partially offset by significantly increased activity in the Libya GeoMarket from strong demand for Artificial Lift products and for Drilling & Measurements, Well Testing and Wireline services, as well as in the
Continental Europe GeoMarket from higher demand for Wireline and Drilling & Measurements technologies.

Pretax operating margin
decreased sequentially from 29.0% to 26.1% primarily due to lower activity and a less favorable revenue mix in the North Sea and Nigeria & Gulf of Guinea GeoMarkets and Russia. The decrease in Framo revenue also contributed to this result.

Middle East & Asia

Revenue of $1.47 billion was 2% lower sequentially but 9% higher year-on-year. Pretax
operating income of $491 million decreased 7% sequentially but increased 4% year-on-year.

Sequentially, Area revenue declined mainly as a
result of weather-related effects in the Australia/Papua New Guinea/New Zealand and China/Japan/Korea GeoMarkets, lower activity in Qatar, a less favorable activity



Part II, Item 7

mix in Brunei/Malaysia/Philippines and reduced customer spending in the China/Japan/Korea and Arabian GeoMarkets. These declines primarily affected demand
for Wireline, Drilling & Measurements and Well Services technologies, but were partially offset by the positive impact of retroactive price adjustments for a Wireline contract in addition to growth in the Gulf GeoMarket for Artificial Lift
products and Well Services and Drilling & Measurements technologies.

Pretax operating margin declined sequentially from 35.5% to
33.5% primarily due to the overall lower level of activity in the Area as well as a less favorable revenue mix in the Arabian and India GeoMarkets.

Total Year 2008 Results

Full-year 2008 revenue of $24.28 billion increased 20% versus 2007 driven by Area growth of 28% in Latin America, 24% in Europe/CIS/Africa, 18% in Middle East & Asia and 11% in North America.

All Technologies experienced double-digit growth most notably in Well Services, Drilling & Measurements and Wireline.

Pretax operating income of $6.50 billion in 2008 was 9% higher than 2007. However, pretax operating margin declined 256 basis points (bps) to 26.8%
primarily due to reduced pricing for well stimulation services in the US land GeoMarkets, a higher mix of low-margin third-party managed services in the Mexico/Central America GeoMarket and cost inflation across all Areas.

North America

Revenue of $5.91 billion grew 11% versus 2007. Growth was led by the US land West GeoMarket mostly due to increased gas shale activity that resulted in
robust demand for Well Services and Drilling & Measurements technologies and by the US land Central GeoMarket on higher rig activity and strong Artificial Lift product sales. The Canada GeoMarket revenue was higher from demand for Well
Services and Drilling & Measurements technologies while the US Gulf of Mexico GeoMarket grew on increased deepwater activity the resulted in strong demand for Drilling & Measurements and Wireline services in addition to Completion
Systems products.

Pretax operating margin decreased 557 bps to 23.2% primarily as the result of lower pricing for well stimulation services
in the US land GeoMarkets and cost inflation across the Area.

Latin America

Revenue of $4.23 billion was 28% higher than 2007 on double-digit growth
across all GeoMarkets. The Mexico/Central America GeoMarket increased on significantly higher IPM activity while the Peru/Colombia/Ecuador GeoMarket also experienced increased IPM activity in addition to robust demand for Wireline services and for
Artificial Lift and SIS products. The Brazil GeoMarket grew on higher offshore activity that resulted in stronger demand for Well Testing, Wireline and Well Services technologies. The Venezuela/Trinidad and Tobago GeoMarket experienced increased
demand for Wireline, Drilling & Measurements and Well Services activities.

Pretax operating margin of 20.3% declined 262 bps
versus 2007 as a result of an increased mix of low-margin third-party managed services in the Mexico/Central America GeoMarket and cost inflation across the Area.

Europe/CIS/Africa

Revenue of $8.18 billion increased 24% versus the same period last year. Growth was led by Russia which experienced strong demand for Wireline, Well Services and
Drilling & Measurements technologies. The West & South Africa, North Sea and Caspian GeoMarkets grew on increased exploration-related services as well as strong demand for Well Services technologies. The Continental Europe
GeoMarket was higher due to strong drilling-related activities and demand for SIS products. The consolidation of Framo also contributed to the increase.



Part II, Item 7

Pretax operating margin decreased 112 bps to 27.4% primarily as a result of
reduced pricing in the Libya GeoMarket and a less favorable revenue mix in the Nigeria & Gulf of Guinea GeoMarket and Russia. The consolidation of Framo also reduced total Area margin.

Middle East & Asia

Revenue of $5.72 billion was 18% higher than the prior year. All GeoMarkets experienced growth, most notably in the Arabian, Australia/Papua
New Guinea/New Zealand, Gulf, and East Mediterranean GeoMarkets. Among the Technologies, growth was strongest in Wireline, Drilling & Measurements, Well Services and Well Testing.

Pretax operating margin was nearly flat at 35.0% as the positive impact of the higher overall activity level was offset by cost inflation.

Total Year 2007 Results

Full-year 2007 revenue of $20.31 billion increased 21% versus 2006, led by Area growths of 31% in both the Middle East & Asia, and
in Europe/CIS/Africa and 29% in Latin America, while North America remained essentially flat. Pretax operating income of $5.96 billion in 2007 was 28% higher than 2006.

Pretax operating margins of 29.3% improved 164 bps in 2007 versus 2006. Higher activity and expansion of higher-margin new technology deployment across Europe/CIS/Africa, Middle East & Asia and Latin America
Areas were the principal contributors to this performance. In North America, pricing erosion in pressure-pumping well-stimulation activities moderated year-on-year margin growth within the Area.

Among the GeoMarkets, the greatest increases in revenue were recorded in the North Sea, followed by Mexico/Central America, Arabian, West & South
Africa, and Venezuela/Trinidad & Tobago.

Significant demand was seen for all Technologies led by Drilling & Measurements,
Wireline, Well Testing, and Completions Systems as customers continued to improve exploration and production performance in the search for new hydrocarbon reserves and in the need to increase production and boost recovery from existing fields.

North America

Revenue of $5.34 billion increased marginally over 2006 primarily due to higher demand for Drilling & Measurements, Well Testing
and Wireline activities in the US Land Central, US Land North and the US Gulf Coast GeoMarkets. However, this performance was offset by pricing erosion in well stimulation activities across the Area.

Activity across US Land continued to grow driven by the increase in rig count and higher service intensity in unconventional natural gas reservoirs.
However, weakness in natural gas prices and excess well stimulation related pressure pumping capacity led to a year-on-year decline in pricing in stimulation related activities. The US Gulf Coast GeoMarket continued to grow driven by demand for
exploration related activities.

In Canada year-on-year revenue declined sharply due to operator slowdown driven by weakness in natural gas
prices and uncertainty over the fiscal regime.

Pretax operating margin declined by 167 bps to 28.8% primarily due to lower pricing in well
stimulation related activities across the Area together with lower activity in Canada.

Latin America

Revenue of $3.30 billion in 2007 increased 29%
over 2006, led by a surge in IPM-related activity in Mexico following the budget-related slowdowns in the previous year, followed by the growth in exploration-related activities in the Peru/Columbia/Ecuador and Latin America South GeoMarkets. The
Venezuela/Trinidad & Tobago GeoMarket also grew with higher rig count-driven activity in addition to finalization of the contracts related to drilling barges.



Part II, Item 7

The Mexico/Central America GeoMarket recorded robust growth with the start of
several integrated projects. Peru/Columbia/Ecuador and Latin America South witnessed strong growth in exploration-related activities. Demand was strong for all Technologies led by IPM, followed by Drilling & Measurements, Wireline and Well
Testing services.

Pretax operating margin increased strongly by 358 bps to reach 22.9%. This increase resulted mainly from a favorable
activity mix and improved pricing.

Europe/CIS/Africa

Revenue of $6.60 billion in 2007 increased 31% over 2006 with the highest growth recorded in
the North Sea, West & South Africa and North Africa GeoMarkets.

Strong revenue increases were recorded in the North Sea,
West & South Africa and North Africa driven by the expansion of exploration-related activities. GeoMarkets in Russia continued to grow strongly due to a combination of organic growth and the completion of the acquisition of
Tyumenpromgeofizika during the second quarter of the year.

Pretax operating margins increased by 301 bps to reach 28.6%. This performance
was due to a combination of increased activity, improved pricing and accelerated new technology deployment across most GeoMarkets partially offset by a pricing decline in well stimulation activities in the East Russia and subdued activity in
Nigeria.

Middle East & Asia

Revenue of $4.87 billion in 2007 increased 31% over 2006 with the largest increases recorded
in the Arabian GeoMarket, followed by East Mediterranean, Australia/Papua New Guinea, Qatar, Gulf and India.

The Australia/Papua New Guinea
GeoMarket recorded the highest growth rate in the Area driven by higher exploration related activity. Growth in East Mediterranean, Qatar, Gulf and India resulted from higher exploration and development activity while the Arabian GeoMarket continued
to grow, albeit at a lower rate than the previous year, as new rig additions slowed down in Saudi Arabia.

Pretax operating margin increased
by 296 bps to an impressive 35.1%. This performance was driven by continued increase in activity and pricing increases together with deployment of higher-margin Wireline and Drilling & Measurements new technologies.

WesternGeco

Fourth Quarter 2008 Results

Fourth-quarter revenue of $599 million decreased 33% sequentially and 25% year-on-year. Pretax operating income of $88 million was 75% lower sequentially and 68% lower
year-on-year.

Sequentially, Marine revenue decreased significantly due to seasonal vessel transits, dry docks and project startups.
Multiclient revenue was also down markedly as customers reduced discretionary spending. Land revenue, however, increased due to higher utilization and the start of new projects in Latin America and Africa while Data Processing recorded modest
growth.

Pretax operating margin decreased sequentially from 39.8% to 14.7% due to lower Marine vessel utilization, higher transits and the
slowdown in Multiclient sales, the effects of which were only partially offset by the higher Land crew utilization.

Total Year 2008 Results

Full-year 2008 revenue of $2.84 billion was 4% lower than 2007. Multiclient revenue was down 18%, primarily as the result of significantly lower client discretionary spending in the fourth quarter of 2008, while Land



Part II, Item 7

decreased 15% on lower crew utilization. These decreases were partially offset by a 4% revenue increase in Marine, as a result of additional vessel capacity
and higher pricing, and a 19% increase in Data Processing, which experienced a growth in activity in all geographic areas.

Pretax operating
margin of 29.5% decreased 634 basis points due to significantly lower Multiclient sales, reduced Land activity and cost inflation that affected Marine operations.

Revenue backlog was $1.8 billion at the end of 2008, compared to $1.2 billion at the end of 2007, of which an estimated $1.3 billion is expected to be realized in 2009.

Total Year 2007 Results

Full-year 2007 revenue of $2.96 billion increased 20% versus 2006. Pretax operating income of $1.06 billion in 2007 was 31% higher than
2006. Pretax operating margin reached 35.8% – an increase of 299 bps in 2007 versus 2006 – demonstrating continued high vessel utilization, pricing increases in Marine and accelerating demand for exploration-driven seismic services.
Q-Technology revenue reached $1.14 billion, representing 38% of 2007 full-year revenue.

Marine revenue grew 17% due mainly to strong
activity in Asia, Middle East, India, Europe and North America as operators continued to focus on new exploration horizons. High vessel utilization, continued adoption of Q-Technology and improved pricing contributed to this performance. Multiclient
revenue increased 30% driven by higher sales in North America as the demand for E-Dog and E-Cat surveys remained strong during the first half of the year augmented by strong demand for E-Octopus surveys during the second half. Data Processing
revenue increased 26%, reflecting higher acquisition volumes, higher levels of Q processing, and higher activity in India, Asia, North Africa, Europe and the Caspian. Land revenue increased 6% with the continued adoption of Q-Land* technology in
Africa and in the Middle East.

During the second quarter of 2007, the seventh Q-Technology equipped vessel – the Western Spirit –
was launched.

Revenue backlog was $1.2 billion at the end of 2007 compared to $1.1 billion at the end of 2006.

Interest and Other Income

Interest and other income consisted of the following:

Refer to Note 3 to the

Consolidated Financial Statements

for details.

Interest Income

The average return on investments decreased to 3.5% in 2008 from 5.2% in 2007 and the weighted average investment balance of $3.4 billion in 2008 increased $286 million compared to 2007.

The average return on investments increased to 5.2% in 2007 from 4.5% in 2006 and the weighted average investment balance of $3.1 billion in 2007
increased $531 million compared to 2006.

Equity in Net Earnings of Affiliated
Companies

The equity in net earnings of affiliated companies
primarily represents Schlumberger’s share of the results of its 40% interest in the M-I SWACO drilling fluids joint venture with Smith International Inc.



Part II, Item 7

Interest Expense

Interest expense of $247 million in 2008 decreased by $27 million compared to 2007 due to a decline in the weighted average borrowing rates,
from 5.0% to 4.5%. The weighted average debt balance of $5.5 billion in 2008 was essentially flat compared to 2007

.

Interest expense
of $275 million in 2007 increased by $40 million compared to 2006. The weighted average borrowing rates of 5.0% in 2007 increased from 4.6% in 2006. The weighted average debt balance of $5.5 billion in 2007 increased by $420 million compared to
2006, primarily due to the funding, in the second quarter of 2006, of the WesternGeco transaction described in Note 4 to the

Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other

Gross margin was 30.2%, 33.5% and 31.4% in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The decline in gross margin percentage in 2008, compared to 2007, was primarily attributable to the following factors: reduced pricing for well stimulation services in the US Land GeoMarkets, a higher mix of
low-margin third-party managed services in the Mexico/Central America GeoMarket, significantly lower Multiclient sales in WesternGeco and the impact of cost inflation across all Areas within Oilfield Services as well as the Marine operations of
WesternGeco.

The increase in gross margin percentage in 2007, compared to 2006, was primarily due to increased pricing, stronger demand for
higher-margin technologies, and operating efficiency improvements.

Income Taxes

The effective tax rate was 20.9% in 2008, 21.9% in 2007 and 24.0% in 2006.

The Schlumberger effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings. When the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of North
America increases, the Schlumberger effective tax rate will generally decrease. Conversely, when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of North America decreases, the Schlumberger effective tax rate will generally increase.



Part II, Item 7

The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2008, as compared to 2007, was
primarily attributable to the geographic mix of earnings. Oilfield Services had a lower proportion of pretax earnings in North America. Also, outside North America, various GeoMarkets with lower tax rates contributed a greater percentage to pretax
earnings.

The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2007, as compared to 2006, was primarily attributable to the geographic mix of
earnings. Both Oilfield Services and WesternGeco had a lower proportion of pretax earnings in North America. Outside North America, various GeoMarkets with lower tax rates contributed a greater percentage to pretax earnings.

Charges and Credits

Schlumberger recorded significant charges and credits during 2008, 2007 and 2006. These charges and credits, which are summarized below, are

Cash Flow

Net Debt represents gross debt less cash, short-term investments and fixed
income investments, held to maturity. Management believes that Net Debt provides useful information regarding the level of Schlumberger’s indebtedness by reflecting cash and investments that could be used to repay debt.



Part II, Item 7

Details of Net Debt follow:

1.

Includes Multiclient seismic data costs.

Key liquidity events during 2008, 2007
and 2006 included:

·

In September 2008, Schlumberger Finance B.V. issued €500 million 5.25% Guaranteed Notes due 2013. Schlumberger entered into agreements to swap these Euro
notes for US dollars on the date of issue until maturity, effectively making this a US dollar denominated debt on which Schlumberger Finance B.V. will pay interest in US dollars at a rate of 4.74%. The proceeds from these notes were used to repay
commercial paper borrowings.

·

On July 22, 2004, the Board of Directors of Schlumberger approved a share repurchase program of up to 30 million shares of common stock to be acquired in
the open market before December 2006, subject to market conditions. This program was completed during the first quarter of 2006.

On April 20, 2006, the Board of Directors of Schlumberger approved a share repurchase program of up to 40 million shares of common stock to be
acquired in the open market before April 2010, subject to market conditions. This program was completed during the second quarter of 2008.

On April 17, 2008, the Board of Directors of Schlumberger approved an $8 billion share repurchase program for shares of Schlumberger common stock to
be acquired in the open market before December 31, 2011, of which $934 million has been repurchased as of December 31, 2008.



Part II, Item 7

The following table summarizes the activity under these share repurchase
programs during 2008, 2007 and 2006:

Given the current credit and economic
environment, Schlumberger anticipates that the total dollar amount of stock repurchases in 2009 may be significantly less than the $1.8 billion spent during 2008. This anticipated reduction will serve to increase Schlumberger’s financial
flexibility during these uncertain times. Stock buy-back activity during 2009 will continue to be targeted to offset any dilution caused by the Schlumberger stock-based compensation programs.

·

Cash flow provided by operations was $6.9 billion in 2008, $6.3 billion in 2007 and $4.7 billion in 2006. These improvements were driven by the revenue and net
income increases experienced in 2008 and 2007 offset by required investments in working capital.

·

During 2008, 2007 and 2006, Schlumberger announced that its Board of Directors had approved increases in the quarterly dividend of 20%, 40% and 19%, respectively.
Total dividends paid during 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $964 million, $771 million and $568 million, respectively.

·

Capital expenditures were $3.7 billion in 2008, $2.9 billion in 2007 and $2.5 billion in 2006. These increases were a result of the increased activity levels
experienced in recent years. Capital expenditures are expected to approach $3.0 billion in 2009, including $385 million relating to the construction of seismic vessels.

·

During 2008, 2007 and 2006 Schlumberger made $290 million, $250 million and $251 million, respectively, of contributions to its defined benefit pension plans. The
US qualified pension plan was 71% funded at December 31, 2008 based on the projected benefit obligation. This compares to 109% funded at December 31, 2007.

Outside of the US, Schlumberger’s International Staff Pension Plan, which was converted to a defined benefit pension
plan during the fourth quarter of 2008 (and therefore accounts for approximately half of the increase in the Postretirement Benefits liability on the

Consolidated Balance Sheet

at December 31, 2008), and UK pension plan are a combined
69% funded at December 31, 2008 based on the projected benefit obligation. The UK pension plan was 92% funded at December 31, 2007.

Schlumberger currently anticipates contributing approximately $400 million to $500 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2009, subject to market
and business conditions.

During 2008 and 2007, certain holders of Schlumberger Limited 1.5% Series A Convertible Debentures due June 1, 2023 and 2.125% Series B Convertible Debentures
due June 1, 2023 converted their debentures into Schlumberger common stock. The following table summarizes these conversions:



Part II, Item 7

At December 31, 2008, there were no outstanding Series A debentures and
there were $321 million outstanding Series B debentures.

·

On December 10, 2007, Schlumberger completed the acquisition of Eastern Echo for $838 million in cash. Net assets acquired included $320 million of cash and
investments and $182 million of long-term debt.

·

On April 28, 2006, Schlumberger acquired the remaining 30% minority interest in WesternGeco from Baker Hughes Incorporated for $2.4 billion in cash.
Approximately 50% of the purchase price was funded from Schlumberger’s cash and investments. The remaining 50% was financed through existing Schlumberger credit facilities.

·

In September 2006, Schlumberger Finance B.V. issued €400 million Guaranteed Floating Rate Notes due 2009. Interest is payable quarterly at the rate of 10
basis points over 3-month Euribor. Schlumberger entered into an agreement to swap these Euro notes for US dollars on the date of issue until maturity, effectively making this US dollar denominated debt on which Schlumberger Finance B.V. will pay
interest in US dollars at the rate of 3-month LIBOR plus 0.0875%. The proceeds from these notes were used to repay commercial paper borrowings.

As of December 31, 2008, Schlumberger had approximately $3.7 billion of cash and short-term investments on hand. Wholly-owned
subsidiaries of Schlumberger had separate committed debt facility agreements aggregating $3.9 billion with commercial banks, of which $1.8 billion was available and unused as of December 31, 2008. Schlumberger believes that these amounts are
sufficient to meet future business requirements for at least the next twelve months.

The current portion of long-term debt at
December 31, 2008 has increased by $0.5 billion to $1.1 billion, as compared to December 31, 2007. This increase is primarily attributable to the outstanding €400 million Guaranteed Floating Rate Notes due 2009 being reclassified
from long-term debt at December 21, 2008 to current at December 31, 2008 due to their maturity in the next twelve months.

Schlumberger’s total outstanding debt at December 31, 2008 was $5.3 billion and included approximately $1.1 billion of commercial paper borrowings. The total outstanding debt decreased approximately $0.2 billion compared to
December 31, 2007.

Part II, Item 7

As discussed in Note 15 of the

Consolidated Financial Statements

,
included in the Schlumberger

Consolidated Balance Sheet

at December 31, 2008 is approximately $877 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in the over 100 jurisdictions in which Schlumberger conducts business. Due
to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded, Schlumberger cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash outflows relating to
these liabilities.

Schlumberger has outstanding letters of credit/guarantees which relate to business performance bonds, custom/excise tax
commitments, facility lease/rental obligations, etc. These were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are customary practices in the various countries where Schlumberger operates.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires Schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of
revenue and expenses. The following accounting policies involve “critical accounting estimates” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by Schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain. A
summary of all of Schlumberger’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the

Consolidated Financial Statements

.

Schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Multiclient Seismic Data

The WesternGeco segment capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data. The carrying value of the multiclient seismic data library at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $287 million and $182
million, respectively. Such costs are charged to

Cost of goods sold and services

based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that Schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data. However, under no
circumstances will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4-year straight-line amortized value.

The carrying value of
surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred. Adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues, which
involve significant judgment on the part of Schlumberger, would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys. Significant adverse changes in Schlumberger’s estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a
future period. For purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library, future cash flows are analyzed primarily based on two pools of surveys: United States and non-United States. The United States and non-United States
pools were determined to be the most appropriate level at which to perform the impairment review based upon a number of factors including (i) various macroeconomic factors that influence the ability to successfully market surveys and
(ii) the focus of the sales force and related costs. Certain larger surveys are analyzed for impairment on a survey by survey basis. These surveys are typically significantly prefunded by customers and accordingly, management has determined
that it is not appropriate to include them within the United States and non-United States pools for impairment review purposes.



Part II, Item 7

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts
receivable at their net realizable value. A significant amount of judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve. Allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible, including amounts for
the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices. Depending on how such potential issues are resolved, or if the financial condition of Schlumberger customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of
their ability to make payments, adjustments to the allowance may be required.

Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets

Schlumberger
records as goodwill the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (SFAS 142),
requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of Schlumberger’s individual
reporting units to their carrying amount to determine if there is a potential goodwill impairment. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of
the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value.

For purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill as required
by SFAS 142, Schlumberger’s reporting units are primarily the geographic areas comprising the Oilfield Services segment in addition to the WesternGeco segment. Schlumberger estimates the fair value of these reporting units using a discounted
cash flow analysis and/or applying various market multiples. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is a matter of judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Schlumberger’s estimates of the fair value
of each of its reporting units were significantly in excess of their respective carrying values at the time of the annual goodwill impairment tests for 2008, 2007 and 2006.

Long-lived assets, including fixed assets and intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value may not be recoverable. In reviewing for impairment, the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If such cash flows
are not sufficient to support the asset’s recorded value, an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long-lived asset to its estimated fair value. The determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair
value of long-lived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management. If there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value, Schlumberger could be
required to recognize impairment charges in the future. Schlumberger evaluates the remaining useful life of its intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated
amortization period.

Income Taxes

Schlumberger’s tax filings are subject to regular audit by the tax authorities in most
of the over 100 jurisdictions in which it conducts business. These audits may result in assessments for additional taxes which are resolved with the authorities or, potentially, through the courts. Tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of
additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits. Estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances. However, due to the uncertain and complex
application of tax regulations, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different from these estimates. In such an event, Schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax
benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs.



Part II, Item 7

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

Schlumberger’s pension and postretirement benefit obligations are described in detail in
Note 19 to the

Consolidated Financial Statements

. The obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts, which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and medical cost
trend rates. These assumptions are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis, or upon the occurrence of significant events.

The discount rate Schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments with maturities matching the
expected timing of the payment of the benefit obligations. The following summarizes the discount rates utilized by Schlumberger for its various pension and postretirement benefit plans:

·

The discount rate utilized to determine the liability for Schlumberger’s United States pension plans and postretirement medical plans was 6.50% at both
December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007.

·

The weighted-average discount rate utilized to determine the liability for Schlumberger’s international pension plans was 6.48% at December 31, 2008 and
5.80% at December 31, 2007.

·

The discount rate utilized to determine expense for Schlumberger’s United States pension plans and postretirement medical plans was increased from 6.00% in
2007 to 6.50% in 2008.

·

The weighted-average discount rate utilized to determine expense for Schlumberger’s international pension plans was increased from 5.20% in 2007 to 5.80% in
2008.

A higher discount rate decreases the
present value of benefit obligations and decreases expense.

The expected rate of return for our retirement benefit plans represents the
average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation, are expected to be paid. The expected rate of return for Schlumberger’s United States pension plans has been
determined based upon expectations regarding future rates of return for the investment portfolio, with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class. The expected
rate of return on plan assets for the United States pension plans was 8.50% in 2008 and 2007. The expected rate of return on plan assets for the international plans was 8.00% in 2008 and 2007. A lower expected rate of return would increase pension
expense.

Schlumberger’s medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an
assessment of likely long-term trends. The overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized in both 2008 and 2007 was 9% graded to 6% over the next four years and 5% thereafter.

The following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, for the United States and
international pension plans:



Part II, Item 7, 7A

The following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions,
holding all other assumptions constant, for Schlumberger’s United States postretirement medical plans:

Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Schlumberger is subject to market risks primarily associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates.

As a multinational company, Schlumberger conducts business in approximately 80 countries. Schlumberger’s functional currency is primarily the US
dollar, which is consistent with the oil and gas industry. Approximately 80% of Schlumberger’s revenue in 2008 was denominated in US dollars. However, outside the United States, a significant portion of Schlumberger’s expenses is incurred
in foreign currencies. Therefore, when the US dollar weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which Schlumberger conducts business, the US dollar-reported expenses will increase.

A 5% change in the average exchange rates of all the foreign currencies in 2008 would have changed revenue by approximately 1%. If the 2008 average
exchange rates of the US dollar against all foreign currencies had strengthened by 5%, Schlumberger’s income from continuing operations would have increased by approximately 2%. Conversely, a 5% weakening of the US dollar average exchange rates
would have decreased income from continuing operations by approximately 3%.

Schlumberger maintains a foreign-currency risk management
strategy that uses derivative instruments to protect its interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates. Foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options to provide
a hedge against currency fluctuations either on monetary assets/liabilities denominated in other than a functional currency or on expenses.

At December 31, 2008, contracts were outstanding for the US dollar equivalent of $2.9 billion in various foreign currencies. These contracts mature on various dates in 2009.

Schlumberger is subject to interest rate risk on its debt and its investment portfolio. Schlumberger maintains an interest rate risk management strategy
that generally does not involve derivatives and instead primarily uses a mix of variable and fixed rate debt combined with its investment portfolio to mitigate the exposure to changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2008, Schlumberger had
fixed rate debt aggregating approximately $2.2 billion and variable rate debt aggregating approximately $3.1 billion.

Schlumberger’s
exposure to interest rate risk associated with its debt is also partially mitigated by its investment portfolio. Both

Short-term investments

and

Fixed income investments

,

held to maturity

, which totaled approximately $4.0
billion at December 31, 2008, are comprised primarily of money market funds, eurodollar time deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, euro notes and Eurobonds and are substantially all denominated in US dollars. The average return
on investment was 3.5% in 2008.



Part II, Item 7A

The following table represents principal amounts of Schlumberger’s debt
at December 31, 2008 by year of maturity:

The fair market value
of the outstanding fixed rate debt was approximately $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2008. The weighted average interest rate on the variable rate debt as of December 31, 2008 was approximately 4.5%.

Schlumberger does not enter into foreign currency or interest rate derivatives for speculative purposes.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1.    Business Description

Schlumberger Limited (Schlumberger N.V., incorporated in the Netherlands Antilles) and its
subsidiaries form the world’s leading supplier of technology, integrated project management, and information solutions to customers in the oil and gas industry worldwide. Schlumberger consists of two business segments: Oilfield Services
(“OFS”) and WesternGeco. The Oilfield Services segment provides the industry’s widest range of exploration and production services required during the life of an oil and gas reservoir. WesternGeco provides comprehensive worldwide
reservoir imaging, monitoring, and development services, with extensive seismic crews and data processing centers as well as a large multiclient seismic library. Services range from 3D and time-lapse (4D) seismic surveys to multi-component
surveys for delineating prospects and reservoir management.

2.    Summary of Accounting Policies

The

Consolidated Financial Statements

of Schlumberger Limited (“Schlumberger”) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying

Consolidated Financial Statements

include the accounts of
Schlumberger, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and subsidiaries over which it exercises a controlling financial interest. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Investments in entities in which Schlumberger does
not have a controlling financial interest, but over which it has significant influence are accounted for using the equity method. Schlumberger’s share of the after-tax earnings of equity method investees is included in

Interest and other
income

. Investments in which Schlumberger does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for using the cost method. Both equity and cost method investments are classified in

Investments in Affiliated Companies

.

Reclassifications

Certain items from prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue
and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, Schlumberger evaluates its estimates, including those related to collectibility of accounts receivable; valuation of inventories and investments; recoverability of goodwill, intangible
assets and investments in affiliates; income taxes; multiclient seismic data; contingencies and actuarial assumptions for employee benefit plans. Schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions.



Part II, Item 8

Revenue Recognition

Oilfield Services

Services and Products Revenue

Schlumberger recognizes revenue for services and products based upon purchase orders, contracts or other persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the customer that include fixed or determinable prices. Revenue is
recognized for services when they are rendered and collectibility is reasonably assured. Revenue is recognized for products upon delivery, customer acceptance and when collectibility is reasonably assured.

Software Revenue

Revenue derived from the sale of licenses of Schlumberger software may include installation, maintenance, consulting and training services.

If services are not essential to the functionality of the software, the revenue for each element of the contract is recognized separately based on its
respective vendor specific objective evidence of fair value when all of the following conditions are met: a signed contract is obtained, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable.

If an ongoing vendor obligation exists under the license arrangement, or if any uncertainties with regard to customer acceptance are significant, revenue
for the related element is deferred based on its vendor specific objective evidence of fair value. Vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is determined as being the price for the element when sold separately. If vendor specific objective
evidence of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements, all revenue is deferred until sufficient evidence exists or all elements have been delivered.

The percentage of completion method of accounting is applied to contracts whereby software is being customized to a customer’s specifications.

WesternGeco

Revenue from all services is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured.
Revenue from contract services performed on a dayrate basis is recognized as the service is performed. Revenue from other contract services, including pre-funded multiclient surveys, is recognized as the seismic data is acquired and/or processed on
a proportionate basis as work is performed. This method requires revenue to be recognized based upon quantifiable measures of progress, such as square kilometers acquired. Multiclient data surveys are licensed or sold to customers on a
non-transferable basis. Revenue on completed multiclient data surveys is recognized upon obtaining a signed licensing agreement and providing customers with access to such data.

Multiple Deliverable Arrangements

Revenue in both segments may be generated from contractual arrangements that include multiple deliverables. Revenue from these arrangements is recognized as each item is
delivered based on their relative fair value and when the delivered items have stand-alone value to the customer.

Other

Taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed concurrently on specific revenue-producing transaction, such as sales and value added taxes, are excluded from revenue in the

Consolidated Statement of Income.



Part II, Item 8

Translation of Non-United States Currencies

The functional currency of Schlumberger is primarily the US dollar. All assets and
liabilities recorded in functional currencies other than US dollars are translated at current exchange rates. The resulting adjustments are charged or credited directly to the

Stockholders’ Equity

section of the

Consolidated Balance
Sheet

. Revenue and expenses are translated at the weighted-average exchange rates for the period. All realized and unrealized transaction gains and losses are included in income in the period in which they occur. Transaction gains, net of
hedging activities, of $41 million were recognized in 2008. In 2007 and 2006, the transaction losses net of hedging activities were $17 million and $20 million, respectively.

Investments

The

Consolidated Balance Sheet

reflects the Schlumberger investment portfolio separated between current and long term, based on maturity. Under normal
circumstances it is the intent of Schlumberger to hold the investments until maturity, with the exception of investments that are considered trading (December 31, 2008—$194 million; December 31, 2007—$201 million). Both

Short-term
investments

and

Fixed Income Investments, held to maturity

are comprised primarily of money market funds, eurodollar time deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, euro notes and Eurobonds, and are substantially denominated in
US dollars. They are stated at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates market. Short-term investments that are designated as trading are stated at market. The unrealized gains/losses on investments designated as trading were not significant
at both December 31, 2008 and 2007.

For purposes of the

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows

, Schlumberger does not consider
short-term investments to be cash equivalents as a significant portion of them have original maturities in excess of three months.

Long-term fixed income investments of $470 million mature as follows: $140 million in 2010, $202 million in 2011 and $128 million in 2012.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at average cost or at market, whichever is lower. Inventory consists of materials, supplies and finished goods. Costs included in inventories consist of materials, direct labor and manufacturing
overhead.

Fixed Assets and Depreciation

Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, which is provided for by
charges to income over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method. Fixed assets include the manufacturing cost of oilfield technical equipment manufactured or assembled by subsidiaries of Schlumberger. Expenditures for
replacements and improvements are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expenses as incurred. Upon sale or other disposition, the applicable amounts of asset cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and
the net amount, less proceeds from disposal, is charged or credited to income.

Multiclient Seismic Data

The multiclient library
consists of completed and in-process seismic surveys that are licensed on a nonexclusive basis. This data may be acquired and/or processed by Schlumberger or subcontractors. Multiclient surveys are primarily generated utilizing Schlumberger
resources. Schlumberger capitalizes costs directly incurred in acquiring and processing the multiclient seismic data. Such costs are charged to

Cost of goods sold and services

based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total
revenue that



Part II, Item 8

Schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data. However, under no circumstance will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a
4- year straight-line amortized value.

The carrying value of the multiclient library is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an
event or change in circumstance indicating impairment may have occurred. Adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future cash flows, which involves significant judgment on the part of Schlumberger, would
not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys. Significant adverse changes in Schlumberger’s estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period.

Goodwill, Other Intangibles and Long-lived Assets

Schlumberger records as goodwill the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the
tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

(SFAS 142), requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually as well as when an event or change
in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of Schlumberger’s individual reporting units to their carrying amount to determine if there is a potential goodwill
impairment. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value.

For purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill as required by SFAS 142, the
Schlumberger reporting units are primarily the geographic areas comprising the Oilfield Services segment in addition to the WesternGeco segment. Schlumberger estimates the fair value of these reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis
and/or applying various market multiples. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is a matter of judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Schlumberger’s estimates of the fair value of each of its reporting
units were significantly in excess of their respective carrying values for 2008, 2007 and 2006. Schlumberger performs the annual goodwill impairment test of its WesternGeco reporting unit on October 1

st

of every year while the reporting units comprising the Oilfield Services segment are tested as of December 31

st

.

Long-lived assets, including fixed assets and intangible assets, are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In reviewing for impairment, the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows
expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset’s recorded value, an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long-lived asset to its
estimated fair value. The determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of long-lived assets involve significant estimates on the part of management. If there is a material change in economic conditions or other
circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value, Schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future.

Schlumberger capitalizes certain costs of internally developed software. Capitalized costs include purchased materials and services, payroll and payroll related costs. The costs of internally developed software are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, which is principally 5 to 7 years. Other intangible assets consist primarily of technology and customer relationships acquired in business combinations. Acquired technology is
generally amortized over periods ranging from 5 to 15 years and acquired customer relationships are generally amortized over periods ranging from 7 years to 20 years.

Taxes on Income

Schlumberger and its subsidiaries compute taxes on income in accordance with the tax rules and regulations of the many taxing authorities where the income is earned. The
income tax rates imposed by these taxing authorities vary substantially. Taxable income may differ from pretax income for financial accounting purposes. To the extent that differences are due to revenue or expense items reported in one period for
tax



Part II, Item 8

purposes and in another period for financial accounting purposes, an appropriate provision for deferred income taxes is made. Any effect of changes in income
tax rates or tax laws are included in the provision for income taxes in the period of enactment. When it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future, Schlumberger provides a
corresponding valuation allowance against deferred tax assets.

Schlumberger’s tax filings are subject to regular audit by the tax
authorities in most of the jurisdictions in which it conducts business. These audits may result in assessments for additional taxes which are resolved with the authorities or, potentially, through the courts. Tax liabilities are recorded based on
estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits. Estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances. However, due to the
uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different from these estimates. In such an event, Schlumberger will record additional tax
expense or tax benefit in the year in which such resolution occurs.

Approximately $16 billion of consolidated income retained for use in
the business on December 31, 2008 represented undistributed earnings of consolidated subsidiaries and Schlumberger’s share of equity method investees. No provision is made for deferred income taxes on those earnings considered to be
indefinitely reinvested or earnings that would not be taxed when remitted.

Postretirement Benefits

Effective December 31,
2006, Schlumberger adopted the provisions of SFAS 158,

Employer’s Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (“

SFAS 158

”)

. SFAS 158
required Schlumberger to recognize the funded status (i.e., the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation) of its postretirement benefit plans in its

Consolidated Balance Sheet

, with a corresponding
adjustment to

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), net of tax.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Schlumberger’s
assets that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, short-term investments, fixed income investments held to maturity, receivables from clients and derivative financial instruments. Schlumberger places its cash,
short-term investments and fixed income investments held to maturity with financial institutions and corporations, and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one of them. Schlumberger regularly evaluates the creditworthiness of the issuers in
which it invests. The receivables from clients are spread over many countries and customers. Schlumberger maintains an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable based on expected collectibility and performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
customers’ financial condition. By using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposure to changes in exchange rates and, commodity prices, Schlumberger exposes itself to credit risk. Schlumberger minimizes this credit risk by entering into
transactions with high-quality counterparties, limiting the exposure to each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of its counterparties.

Research & Engineering

All research and engineering expenditures are expensed as incurred, including costs relating to patents or rights that may result from such expenditures.

Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by first adding back to net income



Part II, Item 8

the interest expense on the convertible debentures and then dividing this adjusted net income by the sum of (i) unvested restricted stock units; and
(ii) the weighted average number of common shares outstanding assuming dilution. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding assuming dilution assumes (a) that all stock options which are in the money are exercised at the
beginning of the period and that the proceeds are used by Schlumberger to purchase shares at the average market price for the period, and (b) the conversion of the convertible debentures.

The following is a reconciliation from basic earnings per share to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for each of the last three years:

Employee stock options to purchase
approximately 5.8 million, 0.8 million and 0.6 million shares of common stock at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the
option exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common stock, and therefore, the effect on diluted earnings per share would have been anti-dilutive.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS 141 (revised 2007),

Business Combinations

(“SFAS 141(R)”). SFAS
141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest (previously referred to as minority interest) in the
acquiree. The provisions of SFAS 141(R) are effective for business combinations occurring on or after January 1, 2009.

In December
2007, the FASB issued SFAS 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements

,

an Amendment of ARB No. 51

(“SFAS 160”)

.

This statement amends ARB 51 to establish accounting and reporting
standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the loss of control of



Part II, Item 8

a subsidiary. Upon its adoption on January 1, 2009, noncontrolling interests will be classified as equity in the Schlumberger financial statements.

SFAS 160 also changes the way the consolidated income statement is presented by requiring net income to include the net income for both the
parent and the noncontrolling interest, with disclosure of both amounts on the consolidated statement of income. The calculation of earnings per share will continue to be based on income amounts attributable to the parent. The provisions of this
standard must be applied retrospectively upon adoption.

3.    Charges and Credits

Schlumberger
recorded the following Charges and Credits in 2008, 2007 and 2006:


Fourth quarter 2008:

·

Due to the continuing slowdown in oil and gas exploration and production spending and its effect on activity in the oilfield services sector, Schlumberger is taking
actions to reduce its global workforce. As a result of these actions, Schlumberger recorded a pretax charge of $74 million ($65 million after-tax), which is classified in

Cost of goods sold and services

in the

Consolidated Statement of
Income

. Depending on how the market situation evolves, further actions may be necessary, which could result in additional charges in future periods.

·

Schlumberger wrote off certain assets, primarily accounts receivable relating to one client with liquidity issues. Accordingly, Schlumberger recorded a pretax
charge of $42 million ($28 million after-tax and minority interest). $32 million of the pretax charge is classified in

Cost of goods sold and services

in the

Consolidated Statement of Income

, with the remaining $10 million classified
in

Interest and other income, net

.

The following is a
summary of 2008 Charges and Credits:


Fourth quarter of 2007:

·

Schlumberger sold certain workover rigs for $32 million, resulting in a pretax gain of $25 million ($17 million after-tax) which is classified in

Interest and
other income, net

in the

Second quarter of 2006:

·

As discussed in further detail in Note 4

Acquisitions

, Schlumberger acquired the remaining 30% minority interest in WesternGeco held by Baker Hughes
Incorporated for $2.4 billion in cash during



Part II, Item 8

the second quarter of 2006. In connection with this transaction, a pretax and after-tax charge of $21 million was recorded, representing the portion of the
purchase price that was allocated to in-process research and development. Schlumberger recorded an additional $6 million of in-process research and development charges, primarily related to a small acquisition which was also completed in the second
quarter of 2006. These amounts were determined by identifying research and development projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility at the time of the acquisition. These charges are classified in

Research & engineering

in the

Consolidated Statement of Income.

·

Schlumberger recorded a pretax and after-tax loss of $9 million relating to the liquidation of certain investments in connection with the funding of the previously
mentioned WesternGeco transaction. These losses are classified in

Interest and other income, net

in the

Consolidated Statement of Income.

·

In connection with the settlement of a visa matter, a pretax charge of $10 million ($7 million after-tax and minority interest) was recorded in the second quarter
of 2006 and is classified in

Cost of goods sold and services

in the

Consolidated Statement of Income

.

The following is a summary of 2006 Charges and Credits:

4.    Acquisitions

Acquisition of Eastern Echo Holding Plc

On December 10, 2007, Schlumberger completed the acquisition of Eastern Echo Holding
Plc (“Eastern Echo”) for $838 million in cash. Eastern Echo was a Dubai-based marine seismic company that did not have any operations at the time of acquisition, but had signed contracts for the construction of six seismic vessels.

The purchase price has been allocated to the net assets acquired based upon their estimated fair values as follows:



Part II, Item 8

Acquisition of WesternGeco Minority Interest

On April 28, 2006, Schlumberger acquired the remaining 30% minority interest in
WesternGeco from Baker Hughes Incorporated for $2.4 billion in cash. Schlumberger also incurred direct acquisition costs of $6 million in connection with this transaction. As a result of this transaction, Schlumberger owns 100% of WesternGeco.

The purchase price has been allocated to the proportionate share of net assets acquired based upon their estimated fair values as follows:

The amount allocated to goodwill
represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Approximately $0.8 billion of the $1.3 billion of goodwill is tax deductible. In addition, approximately $650 million of the goodwill created as a result of
this transaction has been allocated to the Oilfield Services business segment in recognition of the estimated present value of future synergies paid for in this transaction that will directly benefit that segment.

Acquisition of PetroAlliance Minority Interest

On December 9, 2003, Schlumberger announced that it had signed an agreement to acquire
PetroAlliance Services Company Limited (“PetroAlliance Services”) over a 3-year period based on a formula determined at that time. During the second quarter of 2006, Schlumberger acquired the remaining 49% of PetroAlliance Services that it
did not own for $165 million in cash and 4,730,960 shares of Schlumberger common stock valued at approximately $330 million. This brought the aggregate purchase price paid for PetroAlliance Services over the 3-year period to $650 million.

The $495 million purchase price paid in the second quarter of 2006 has been allocated to the proportionate share of net assets acquired
based upon their estimated fair values as follows:

The amount allocated to goodwill
represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired. The goodwill is not tax deductible.



Part II, Item 8

Other Acquisitions

Schlumberger has made other acquisitions and minority interest investments, none of which were significant on an individual basis, for cash
payments of $345 million during 2008, $306 million during 2007, and $356 million during 2006.

Under the terms of certain acquisitions,
Schlumberger has obligations to pay additional consideration if specific conditions were met. Schlumberger made cash payments of $63 million during 2006 with respect to certain transactions that were consummated in prior years, which were recorded
as additional goodwill.

Pro forma results pertaining to the above acquisitions, including the WesternGeco and PetroAlliance Services
transactions, are not presented as the impact was not significant.

5.    Investments in Affiliated Companies

The MI-SWACO drilling fluids joint venture is owned 40% by Schlumberger and 60% by Smith International, Inc. Schlumberger records income relating to this venture using the equity method of accounting. Schlumberger’s investment in the
joint venture on December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. Schlumberger’s equity income from this joint venture in 2008 was $210 million, $174 million in 2007 and $135 million in 2006. Schlumberger
received cash distributions from the joint venture of $57 million in 2008 and $40 million in 2007. There were no such distributions in 2006.

Schlumberger’s joint venture agreement with Smith International, Inc. contains a provision under which either party to the joint venture may offer to sell its entire interest in the venture to the other party at a cash purchase price
per percentage interest specified in an offer notice. If the offer to sell is not accepted, the offering party will be obligated to purchase the entire interest of the other party at the same price per percentage interest as the prices
specified in the offer notice.

11.    Long-term Debt and Debt Facility Agreements

Series A Convertible Debentures

During 2003, Schlumberger
Limited issued $975 million aggregate principal amount of 1.5% Series A Convertible Debentures due June 1, 2023. The Series A debentures were convertible, at the holders’ option, into shares of common stock of Schlumberger Limited at a
conversion rate of 27.651 shares for each $1,000 of principal amount (equivalent to an initial conversion price of $36.165 per share).

During 2007, $622 million of the Series A debentures were converted into 17.2 million shares of Schlumberger common stock. During 2008, all of the remaining $353 million of outstanding Series A debentures were converted into
9.8 million shares of Schlumberger common stock.

Series B Convertible Debentures

During 2003, Schlumberger Limited issued $450 million aggregate principal
amount of 2.125% Series B Convertible Debentures due June 1, 2023. The Series B debentures are convertible, at the holders’ option, into shares of common stock of Schlumberger Limited. Holders of the Series B debentures may convert their
debentures into common stock at a conversion rate of 25.000 shares for each $1,000 of principal (equivalent to an initial conversion price of $40.00 per share). The conversion rate may be adjusted for certain events, but it will not be adjusted for
accrued interest.

On or after June 6, 2010, Schlumberger may redeem for cash all or part of the debentures, upon notice to the
holders, at the redemption prices of 100% of the principal amount of the debentures, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. On June 1, 2010, June 1, 2013 and June 1, 2018, holders may require Schlumberger to
repurchase their Series B debentures. The repurchase price will be 100% of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date. The repurchase price for repurchases on June 1, 2010 will be paid in
cash. On the other repurchase dates, Schlumberger may choose to pay the repurchase price in cash or common stock or any combination of cash and common stock. In addition, upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change (defined as a change in control or
a termination of trading of Schlumberger’s common stock), holders may require Schlumberger to repurchase all or a portion of their debentures for an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest
to the repurchase date. The repurchase price may be paid in cash, Schlumberger common stock (or if Schlumberger is not the surviving entity in a merger, the securities of the surviving entity) or a combination of cash and the applicable
securities, at Schlumberger’s option. The applicable securities will be valued at 99% of their market price.

Schlumberger’s
option to pay the repurchase price with securities is subject to certain conditions. The debentures will mature on June 1, 2023 unless earlier redeemed or repurchased.

During 2008 and 2007, $95 million and $34 million of the Series B debentures were converted into 2.4 million and 0.9 million shares of
Schlumberger common stock, respectively.

At December 31, 2008, there were $321 million of the Series B debentures outstanding. The
fair value of the Series B debentures at December 31, 2008 was $398 million.



Part II, Item 8

Other Long-Term Debt

A summary of other long-term debt by currency, analyzed by Bonds and Notes, Commercial Paper (CP) and Other, at December 31 follows. As
described in further detail below, the currencies are presented after taking into account currency swaps entered into on the date of issuance until maturity.

Bonds and Notes
consist of the following at December 31,

The fair value of the
$647 million of Schlumberger Technology Corporation 6.5% Notes due 2012 was $651 million at December 31, 2008.

In September 2008,
Schlumberger Finance B.V. issued €500 million 5.25% Guaranteed Notes due 2013. Schlumberger entered into agreements to swap these Euro notes for US dollars on the date of issue until maturity, effectively making this a US dollar

The fair value of the $355 million of Schlumberger SA euro denominated 5.875% Guaranteed Bonds due 2011 was $390 million at December 31, 2008.

The fair value of the $203 million of Schlumberger Canada Limited 5.14% Guaranteed Notes due 2010, which are Canadian dollar denominated,
was $209 million at December 31, 2008.

In September 2006, Schlumberger Finance B.V. issued €400 million Guaranteed Floating
Rate Notes due 2009. At December 31, 2008 these Notes are classified within

Long-term debt – current portion

in the

Consolidated Balance Sheet

.

In connection with the Eastern Echo acquisition (see Note 4,

Acquisitions

), Schlumberger assumed 10.875% Senior Secured Bonds due May 2012 with par value of $160 million. The fair value of these bonds at the
time of the acquisition was approximately $182 million. These bonds were redeemed by Schlumberger during the second quarter of 2008.

Commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2008 and 2007 include certain notes issued in currencies other than the US dollar which were swapped for US dollars and pounds sterling on the date of issue until maturity.
Commercial paper borrowings are classified as long-term debt to the extent of their backup by available and unused committed credit facilities maturing in more than one year and to the extent it is Schlumberger’s intent to maintain these
obligations for longer than one year.



Part II, Item 8

On December 31, 2008, wholly-owned subsidiaries of Schlumberger had
separate committed debt facility agreements aggregating $3.9 billion with commercial banks, of which $1.8 billion was available and unused. This included $2.5 billion of committed facilities which support commercial paper programs in the United
States and Europe, and mature in April 2012. Interest rates and other terms of borrowing under these lines of credit vary from country to country. Borrowings under the commercial paper programs at December 31, 2008 were $1.1 billion, of which
$0.4 billion was classified within

Long-term debt – current portion

in the

Consolidated Balance Sheet

due to Schlumberger’s current intent to repay such amount in 2009.

The weighted average interest rate on variable rate debt as of December 31, 2008 was 4.5%.

Other Long-term Debt

as of December 31, 2008, which excludes the Series B debentures, is due as follows: $447 million in 2010, $777 million in
2011, $1.418 billion in 2012 and $730 million in 2013.

12.    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

Schlumberger is subject to market risks primarily associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. To mitigate these risks, Schlumberger utilizes derivative instruments.
Schlumberger does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

As a multinational
company, Schlumberger conducts its business in approximately 80 countries. Schlumberger’s functional currency is primarily the US dollar, which is consistent with the oil and gas industry. Approximately 80% of Schlumberger’s revenue in
2008 was denominated in US dollars. However, outside the United States, a significant portion of Schlumberger’s expenses is incurred in foreign currencies. Therefore, when the US dollar weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the
countries in which Schlumberger conducts business, the US dollar – reported expenses will increase.

Schlumberger is exposed to risks
on future cash flows to the extent that local currency expenses exceed revenues denominated in local currency that are other than the functional currency. Schlumberger uses foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options to provide a
hedge against a portion of these cash flow risks. These contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges under the provisions of SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

(SFAS No. 133), with the
effective portion of changes in the fair value of the hedge recorded on the

Consolidated Balance Sheet

and in

Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).

Amounts recorded in

Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

are reclassified into
earnings in the same period or periods that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the hedged item is recorded directly to earnings.

At December 31, 2008, Schlumberger recognized a cumulative net $104 million loss in

Stockholders’ Equity

relating to revaluation of
foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options designated as cash flow hedges at December 31, 2008.

Schlumberger is
also exposed to changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities which are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. Schlumberger uses foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options to hedge this exposure as
it relates to certain currencies. These contracts are accounted for as fair value hedges under the provisions of SFAS No. 133, with the fair value of the contracts recorded on the

Consolidated Balance Sheet

and changes in the fair value
recognized in the

Consolidated Statement of Income

along with the change in fair value of the hedged item.

At December 31,
2008, contracts were outstanding for the US dollar equivalent of $4.3 billion in various foreign currencies, the majority of which expire on various dates in 2009.

Commodity Price Risk

Schlumberger is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price of commodities, such as copper and lead. Schlumberger has entered into forward contracts on
these commodities to manage the price risk



Part II, Item 8

associated with forecasted purchases. The objective of these contracts is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with the forecasted purchase of
those commodities These contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under the provisions of SFAS No. 133 and therefore, changes in the fair value of the forward contracts are recorded directly to earnings.

Interest Rate Risk

Schlumberger is subject to interest rate risk on its debt and its investment portfolio. Schlumberger maintains an interest rate risk
management strategy that generally does not involve derivatives and instead primarily uses a mix of variable and fixed rate debt combined with its investment portfolio to mitigate the exposure to changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2008,
Schlumberger had fixed rate debt aggregating approximately $2.2 billion and variable rate debt aggregating approximately $3.1 billion.

Schlumberger’s exposure to interest rate risk associated with its debt is also partially mitigated by its investment portfolio. Both

Short-term investments

and

Fixed income investments

,

held to maturity

, which
totaled approximately $4.0 billion at December 31, 2008, are comprised primarily of money market funds, eurodollar time deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, euro notes and Eurobonds and are substantially all denominated in US
dollars.

The following tables detail the effect of derivatives on the financial position and performance of Schlumberger:

Fair Values of Derivative Instruments

The fair value of all
outstanding derivatives are determined using a model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived from or corroborated by observable data, and are included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet.

Income



Part II, Item 8

13.    Capital Stock

Schlumberger is authorized to issue 3,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of which 1,194,100,845 and 1,195,616,324 shares were outstanding on December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Schlumberger is also authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share,
which may be issued in series with terms and conditions determined by the Board of Directors. No shares of preferred stock have been issued. Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share of stock held.

14.    Stock Compensation Plans

Schlumberger has three types of stock-based compensation programs: stock options, a
restricted stock and restricted stock unit program (collectively referred to as “restricted stock”) and a discounted stock purchase plan (“DSPP”).

Stock Options

Key employees are granted stock options under Schlumberger stock option plans. For all of the stock options granted, the exercise price of each option equals the average
of the high and low sales prices of Schlumberger stock on the date of grant; an option’s maximum term is generally ten years, and options generally vest in increments over four or five years. The gain on the awards granted during the period
from July 2003 to January 2006 is capped at 125% of the exercise price. Awards granted subsequent to January 2006 do not have a cap on any potential gain and generally vest in increments over five years.

The fair value of each stock option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
weighted-average assumptions and resulting weighted-average fair value per share:



Part II, Item 8

The following table summarizes information concerning outstanding and
exercisable options by five ranges of exercise prices as of December 31, 2008:

The weighted average
remaining contractual life of stock options exercisable as of December 31, 2008 was 4.32 years.

The following table summarizes stock
option activity during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006:

The aggregate
intrinsic value of stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2008 was approximately $175 million. The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercisable as of December 31, 2008 was approximately $161 million.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, was approximately $119 million, $607 million
and $366 million, respectively.

Restricted Stock

Schlumberger began granting restricted stock in 2006. Executive officers of Schlumberger may
not receive grants of restricted stock unless the grants are subject to performance-based vesting. Restricted stock awards generally vest at the end of three years, with the exception of certain grants which vest over a two-year period with a
two-year holding period. There have not been any grants to date that are subject to performance-based vesting.



Part II, Item 8

The following table summarizes information about restricted stock
transactions:

Discounted Stock Purchase Plan

Under the terms of the DSPP, employees can choose to have a portion of their
earnings withheld, subject to certain restrictions, to purchase Schlumberger common stock. The purchase price of the stock is 92.5% of the lower of the stock price at the beginning or end of the plan period at six-month intervals.

The fair value of the employees’ purchase rights under the DSPP was estimated using the Black-Scholes model with the following assumptions and
resulting weighted average fair value per share:

Total Stock-based Compensation Expense

The following summarizes stock-based
compensation expense recognized in income:

As of
December 31, 2008, there was $305 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock-based compensation arrangements. Approximately $128 million is expected to be recognized in 2009, $80 million is expected to be
recognized in 2010, $62 million in 2011, $32 million in 2012 and $3 million in 2013.

15.    Income Tax Expense

Schlumberger
and its subsidiaries operate in more than 100 taxing jurisdictions where statutory tax rates generally vary from 0% to 50%.



Part II, Item 8

Pretax book income subject to United States and non-United States income
taxes for each of the three years ended December 31, was as follows:

The components of net
deferred tax assets were as follows:

The above deferred
tax assets at December 31, 2008 and 2007 are net of valuation allowances relating to net operating losses in certain countries of $197 million and $214 million, respectively. The deferred tax assets are also net of valuation allowances relating
to a capital loss carryforward of $140 million at December 31, 2008 ($144 million at December 31, 2007) which $124 million expires in 2009 and $16 million expires in 2010, and a foreign tax credit carryforward of $49 million at
December 31, 2008 ($55 million at December 31, 2007) of which $2 million expires in 2009, and $47 million expires in years 2010 through 2012.

The components of consolidated income tax expense were as follows:

A reconciliation of
the United States statutory federal tax rate (35%) to the consolidated effective tax rate is:



Part II, Item 8

Schlumberger adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(“FIN 48”) on January 1, 2007. This interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertain tax positions and requires companies
to recognize the impact of a tax position in their financial statements, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. The adoption of FIN 48 did not have any impact on the total
liabilities or stockholders’ equity of Schlumberger.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of liabilities associated
with uncertain tax positions for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 is as follows:

Included in the
Schlumberger

Consolidated Balance Sheet

at December 31, 2008 is approximately $877 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in the over 100 jurisdictions in which Schlumberger conducts business, a number of which
have tax laws that are not fully defined and are evolving. This amount excludes $136 million of accrued interest and penalties. All of the unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact the Schlumberger effective tax rate.

Schlumberger classifies interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions within

Taxes on income

in the

Consolidated Statement of
Income

. During 2008 and 2007, Schlumberger recognized approximately $25 million and $36 million in interest and penalties, respectively.

The following table summarizes the tax years that are either currently under audit or remain open and subject to examination by the tax authorities in the most significant jurisdictions in which Schlumberger operates:

In certain of the
jurisdictions noted above, Schlumberger operates through more than one legal entity, each of which has different open years subject to examination. The table above presents the open years subject to examination for the most material of the legal
entities in each jurisdiction. Additionally, it is important to note that tax years are technically not closed until the statute of limitations in each jurisdiction expires. In the jurisdictions noted above, the statute of limitations can extend
beyond the open years subject to examination.

Due to the geographic breadth of the Schlumberger operations, numerous tax audits may be
ongoing throughout the world at any point in time. Tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits. Estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and
are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances. However, due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different
from these estimates. In such an event, Schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs.



Part II, Item 8

16.    Leases and Lease Commitments

Total rental expense was $1.1 billion in 2008, $913 million in 2007, and $686 million in
2006. Future minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases for each of the next five years are as follows:

17.    Contingencies

In July 2007, Schlumberger received an inquiry from the United States
Department of Justice (“DOJ”) related to the DOJ’s investigation of whether certain freight forwarding and customs clearance services of Panalpina, Inc., and other companies provided to oil and oilfield service companies, including
Schlumberger, violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Schlumberger is cooperating with the DOJ and is conducting its own investigation with respect to these services.

Schlumberger and its subsidiaries are party to various legal proceedings from time to time. A liability is accrued when a loss is both probable and can be reasonably estimated. At this time the ultimate disposition of
these proceedings is not determinable and therefore, it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or range of possible losses that might result from an adverse judgment or settlement in any of these matters. However, in the opinion of
management, any liability that might ensue would not be material in relation to Schlumberger’s consolidated liquidity, financial position or future results of operations.

18.    Segment Information

Schlumberger operates two business segments: Oilfield Services and WesternGeco.

The Oilfield Services segment falls into four clearly defined economic and geographical areas and is evaluated on the following basis: North America is a
major self-contained market; Latin America comprises regional markets that share a common dependence on the oil and gas industry; Europe is a major self-contained market that includes the CIS and Africa, whose economy is increasingly linked to that
of Europe; Middle East & Asia includes the remainder of the Eastern Hemisphere, which consists of many countries at different stages of economic development that share a common dependence on the oil and gas industry. The Oilfield Services
segment provides virtually all exploration and production services required during the life of an oil and gas reservoir.

The WesternGeco
segment provides comprehensive worldwide reservoir imaging, monitoring, and development services, with extensive seismic crews and data processing centers, as well as a large multiclient seismic library. Services range from 3D and time-lapse
(4D) seismic surveys to multi-component surveys for delineating prospects and reservoir management.



Part II, Item 8

Financial information for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and
2006, by segment, is as follows:



Part II, Item 8

Oilfield Services
Elims/Other include certain headquarters administrative costs which are not allocated geographically, manufacturing and certain other operations, and costs maintained at the Oilfield Services level.

Corporate items, which are not included in the segments’ income, principally comprise nonoperating expenses, such as interest on postretirement
medical benefits, stock-based compensation costs and corporate expenses. Corporate assets largely comprise short-term investments and fixed income investments, held to maturity.

During the three years ended December 31, 2008, no single customer exceeded 10% of consolidated revenue.

Schlumberger did not have revenue from third-party customers in its country of domicile during the last three years. Revenue in the United States in 2008,
2007 and 2006 was $5.9 billion, $5.6 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively.

Interest income excludes amounts which are included in the
segments’ income (2008 – $7 million: 2007 – $2 million; 2006 – $2 million).

Interest expense excludes amounts which are
included in the segments’ income (2008 – $30 million; 2007 – $7 million; 2006 – $6 million).

Depreciation &
Amortization includes Multiclient seismic data costs.

Effective January 1, 2008, a component of the Middle East & Asia Area
was reallocated to the Europe/CIS/Africa Area. Prior period data has been reclassified to conform to the current organizational structure.

19.    Pension and Other Benefit Plans

Pension Plans

Schlumberger and its United States subsidiary sponsor several defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all U.S. employees hired prior to October 1, 2004. The benefits are based on years of service
and compensation, on a career-average pay basis.



Part II, Item 8

In addition to the United States defined benefit pension plans, Schlumberger
sponsors several other international defined benefit pension plans. The most significant of these international plans are the International Staff Pension Plan, which was converted from a defined contribution plan to a defined benefit pension plan
during the fourth quarter of 2008, and the UK pension plan (collectively, the “International plans”). The International Staff Pension Plan covers certain international employees and is based on years of service and compensation on a
career-average pay basis. The UK plan covers employees hired prior to April 1, 1999, and is based on years of service and compensation, on a final salary basis.

The weighted-average assumed discount rate, compensation increases and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used to determine the net pension cost for the US and International (“Int’l”)
plans were as follows:

Net pension cost for
2008, 2007 and 2006 included the following components:

As the International
Staff Pension Plan was converted to a defined benefit pension plan during the fourth quarter of 2008, the net pension cost included above for this pension plan was not significant in 2008.

The weighted-average assumed discount rate and compensation increases used to determine the projected benefit obligations for the US and International
plans were as follows:



Part II, Item 8

The changes in the projected benefit obligation, plan assets and funded
status of the plans were as follows:

The
underfunded/overfunded position represents the difference between the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation (“PBO”). The PBO represents the actuarial present value of benefits based on employee service and compensation and
includes an assumption about future compensation levels.

The amounts recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for the Schlumberger
defined benefit pension plans are as follows:

The following is a
weighted-average breakdown of the plans assets:



Part II, Item 8

The following is the weighted-average target allocation of the defined
benefit pension plans’ assets:

The asset allocation
objectives are to diversify the portfolio among several asset classes to reduce volatility while maintaining an asset mix that provides the highest expected rate of return consistent with an acceptable level of risk. There is no investment of any
plan assets in Schlumberger common stock. Schlumberger’s asset allocation strategy is reviewed at least annually. Other investments above consist primarily of alternative investments such as real estate and private equity.

The expected long-term rate of return on assets assumptions reflect the average rate of earnings expected on funds invested or to be invested. The
assumptions have been determined by reflecting expectations regarding future rates of return for the portfolio considering the asset distribution and related historical rates of return. The appropriateness of the assumptions is reviewed annually.

The funding policy is to annually contribute amounts that are based upon a number of factors including the actuarial accrued liability,
amounts that are deductible for income tax purposes, legal funding requirements and available cash flow. Schlumberger currently anticipates contributing approximately $400 million to $500 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2009, subject
to market and business conditions.

Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions

Schlumberger and its United States subsidiary provide certain health
care benefits to former US employees who have retired.

The actuarial assumptions used to measure net periodic benefit costs were a discount
rate of 6.50% in 2008, 6.00% in 2007 and 5.75% in 2006. The overall medical cost trend rate assumption is 9% graded to 6% over the next four years and 5% thereafter.

The net periodic benefit cost for the US postretirement medical plan included the following components:



Part II, Item 8

The changes in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation, plan assets
and funded status were as follows:

The underfunded
position is included in

Postretirement Benefits

in the

Consolidated Balance Sheet

.

The assumed discount rate used to
determine the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 6.50% for 2008 and 6.50% for 2007.

The overall medical cost trend rate
assumption used to determine the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for both 2008 and 2007 was 9% graded to 6% over the next four years and 5% thereafter.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the U.S. postretirement medical plan. A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the
following effects:

Other Information

The expected benefits to be paid under the US and International pension plans as well as the
postretirement medical plan (which is disclosed net of the annual Medicare Part D subsidy, which ranges from $3 million to $6 million per year) were as follows:

Included in

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

at December 31, 2008 are the following non-cash pretax charges which have not yet been recognized in net periodic pension cost. Also presented is the estimated portion of each component of

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

which is expected to be recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost during the year-ending December 31, 2009.



Part II, Item 8

In addition to
providing defined pension benefits and a postretirement medical plan, Schlumberger and its subsidiaries have other deferred benefit programs, primarily profit sharing and defined contribution pension plans. Expenses for these programs were $482
million, $408 million and $351 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

20.    Supplementary Information

Part II, Item 8

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of Schlumberger Limited is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a–15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Schlumberger Limited’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Schlumberger Limited management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008. In making this
assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

. Based on our assessment we have concluded that, as of December 31,
2008, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

The effectiveness of Schlumberger Limited’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.



Part II, Item 8

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders

of Schlumberger Limited

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related consolidated statements of income, of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Schlumberger Limited and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing on page 68 of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for uncertainty in income taxes on January 1, 2007. Additionally, as discussed in Note 2 to the
consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on December 31, 2006.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.



Part II, Item 8

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
