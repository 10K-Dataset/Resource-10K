Form 10-K


Part 1, Item 1

PART I

Item 1    Business

All
references herein to “Registrant”, “Company” and “Schlumberger” refer to Schlumberger Limited and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Founded in 1927, Schlumberger is the world’s leading oilfield services company, supplying technology, project management and information solutions that optimize performance in the oil and gas industry. As of
December 31, 2005, the Company employed more than 60,000 people of over 140 nationalities operating in more than 80 countries. Schlumberger has principal executive offices in New York, Paris, and The Hague. Schlumberger consists of two business
segments: Schlumberger Oilfield Services and WesternGeco. Schlumberger Oilfield Services is the world’s premier oilfield services company supplying a wide range of technology services and solutions to the international oil and gas industry.
WesternGeco, 70% owned by Schlumberger and 30% owned by Baker Hughes, is the world’s largest and most advanced surface seismic company.

Schlumberger Oilfield Services

is the world’s leading provider of technology, project management and information solutions to the international petroleum
industry. With more than 60,000 employees, Schlumberger Oilfield Services manages its business through 27 Oilfield Services GeoMarket* regions, which are grouped into four geographic areas: North America, Latin America, Europe/CIS/Africa and Middle
East & Asia. The GeoMarket structure offers customers a single point of contact at the local level for field operations and brings together geographically focused teams to meet local needs and deliver customized solutions.

Schlumberger invented wireline logging in 1927 as a technique for obtaining downhole data in oil and gas wells. Today, Schlumberger Oilfield Services
operates in each of the major oilfield service markets covering the entire life cycle of the reservoir. These services, in which Schlumberger holds a number of market leading positions, are organized into six Technology groups to capitalize on
technical synergies and introduce innovative solutions within the GeoMarket regions.

·

Wireline – provides the information necessary to evaluate the formation, plan and monitor well construction, and monitor and evaluate production. Wireline offers both open-hole
and cased-hole services.

·

Drilling & Measurements – supplies directional drilling, measurements-while-drilling, and logging-while-drilling services.

·

Well Services – provides services to construct oil and gas wells, as well as maintain optimal production through the life of an oil and gas field. These include pressure
pumping, well stimulation services, coiled tubing, cementing and engineering services.

·

Well Completions & Productivity – provides testing, completion, and oil- and gas- production optimization services. Services range from well testing and perforating,
to intelligent completions and artificial lift systems.

·

Data & Consulting Services – supplies measurement, interpretation and integration of all exploration and production data types, as well as expert consulting services
for reservoir characterization, production enhancement, field development planning, and multi-disciplinary reservoir and production solutions.

·

Schlumberger Information Solutions – provides consulting, software, information management, and IT infrastructure services that support oil and gas industry core operational
processes.



Part 1, Item 1

One other service, Integrated Project Management (IPM), provides consulting,
project management and engineering services leveraging the expertise from the other six Technologies.

The Technologies are also responsible
for overseeing operational processes, resource allocation, personnel and quality, health, safety, and environmental matters in the GeoMarket.

Supporting the six Technologies are 23 research and development (R&D) centers. Through its R&D, Schlumberger is committed to advanced technology programs that will enhance oilfield efficiency, lower finding and producing costs,
improve productivity, maximize reserve recovery, increase asset value and accomplish all of these goals in a safe, environmentally sound manner.

Schlumberger Oilfield Services uses its own personnel to market its products and services. The customer base, business risks, and opportunities for growth are essentially uniform across all services. There is a sharing of manufacturing and
engineering facilities as well as research centers; the labor force is interchangeable. Technological innovation, quality of service, and price are the principal methods of competition. Competition varies geographically with respect to the different
services offered. While there are numerous competitors, both large and small, Schlumberger believes that it is an industry leader in providing wireline logging, production testing, measurements-while-drilling, logging-while-drilling, directional
drilling services, and fully computerized logging and geoscience software and computing services. A large proportion of Schlumberger’s offering is non-rig related; consequently, revenue does not necessarily correlate to rig count fluctuations.

Schlumberger is a 40% owner in M-I Drilling Fluids, a joint venture with Smith International that offers drilling and completion fluids
utilized to stabilize rock strata during the drilling process and minimize formation damage during completion and workover operations.

WesternGeco

, which is 70% owned by Schlumberger and 30% owned by Baker Hughes, provides comprehensive worldwide reservoir imaging, monitoring, and development
services, with the most extensive seismic crews and data processing centers in the industry, as well as a leading multiclient seismic library. Services range from 3D and time-lapse (4D) seismic surveys to multi-component surveys for delineating
prospects and reservoir management. Seismic solutions include proprietary Q* technology for enhanced reservoir description, characterization, and monitoring throughout the life of the field—from exploration through enhanced recovery.

Positioned for meeting a full range of customer needs in land, marine and shallow-water transition-zone services, WesternGeco offers a wide
scope of technologies and services:

·

Land Seismic – provides comprehensive resources for seismic data acquisition on land and across shallow-water transition zones.

·

Marine Seismic – delivers a fully calibrated single-sensor marine seismic acquisition and processing system, delivering the seismic technology breakthrough needed for
new-generation reservoir management.

·

Multiclient Services – supplies high-quality seismic data from the most prospective hydrocarbon basins with a leading multiclient data library.

·

Reservoir Services – provides the people, tools and technology to help customers capture the benefits of a completely integrated approach to locating, defining and monitoring
the reservoir.

·

Seismic Data Processing – offers extensive seismic data processing centers for complex processing projects.



Part 1, Item 1

Acquisitions

Information on acquisitions made by Schlumberger or its subsidiaries appears under the heading “Acquisitions” on page 50 of this
Report in Note 5 of the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

.

GENERAL

Research & Development

Research to support the engineering and development efforts of Schlumberger activities is
conducted at Schlumberger Doll Research, Ridgefield, Connecticut and Boston, Massachusetts, United States; Schlumberger Cambridge Research, Cambridge, England; and at Stavanger, Norway; Moscow, Russia and Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.

Patents

While Schlumberger seeks and holds numerous patents, no particular patent or group of patents is considered material to Schlumberger’s
business.

Seasonality

Although weather and natural phenomena can temporarily affect delivery of oilfield services,
the widespread geographic location of such services precludes the overall business from being characterized as seasonal. However, because oilfield services are provided predominantly in the Northern Hemisphere, severe weather can temporarily affect
the delivery of such services and products.

Customers and Backlog of Orders

No single customer exceeded 10% of consolidated revenue. Oilfield
Services has no backlog due to the nature of their business. The WesternGeco backlog at December 31, 2005, was $790 million (2004: $670 million), the majority of which is expected to be realized in 2006.

Government Contracts

No material portion of Schlumberger’s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts by the United States
or other governments.

Employees

As of December 31, 2005, Schlumberger had
approximately 60,000 employees.

Item 1A    Risk Factors

We
urge you to carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this Report. If any of the matters described below or elsewhere in this Report were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows
or prospects could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we
currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business and operations.

Demand for the majority of our oilfield services is substantially dependent on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry. A substantial or an extended decline in oil or gas prices could result in lower expenditures by the oil
and gas industry and reduce our revenue.

Demand for the majority of our
oilfield services is substantially dependent on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas reserves, which are sensitive to oil and natural gas prices and
generally dependent on the industry’s view of future oil and gas prices. Oil and gas prices have historically been volatile and are affected by numerous factors, including:

·

demand for energy, which is affected by worldwide population growth and general economic and business conditions;

·

the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, to set and maintain production levels for oil;

·

oil and gas production by non-OPEC countries;

·

political and economic uncertainty and socio-political unrest;

·

the level of worldwide oil exploration and production activity;

·

the cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas;

·

technological advances affecting energy consumption; and

·

weather conditions.



Part 1, Item 1A

The oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns,
which have been characterized by diminished demand for our oilfield services and downward pressure on the prices we charge. A significant downturn in the oil and gas industry could result in a reduction in demand for oilfield services and could harm
our operating results.

A significant portion of our revenue is derived from
our non-United States operations, which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the more than 80 countries in which we operate.

Our non-United States operations accounted for approximately 75% of our consolidated revenue in 2005 and 74% in both 2004 and 2003. Operations in countries other than the
United States are subject to various risks, including:

·

unsettled political and economic conditions in certain areas;

·

exposure to possible expropriation or other governmental actions;

·

social unrest, acts of terrorism, war or other armed conflict;

·

confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies;

·

deprivation of contract rights;

·

trade restrictions or embargoes imposed by the United States or other countries;

·

restrictions on the repatriation of income or capital;

·

exchange controls;

·

inflation; and

·

currency fluctuations and devaluations.

In addition, we are subject to risks associated with our operations in countries, including Iran, Syria, Sudan, Libya and Cuba, which are subject to
trade, economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the United States government.

The occurrence of any of the risks described above
could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations.

Environmental compliance costs and liabilities could reduce our earnings and cash available for operations.

We are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including laws and regulations governing air emissions, water
discharges and waste management. We incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations. The technical requirements of environmental laws and regulations are becoming increasingly
expensive, complex and stringent. These laws may provide for “strict liability” for damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety. Strict liability can render a party liable for environmental damage without regard to
negligence or fault on the part of the party. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances.



Part 1, Item 1A

We use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations. In
addition, many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we could become subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties, and to
claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to, or releases of, hazardous substances. In addition, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, new laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown
contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis of new or increased liabilities that could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations. We believe we are currently in
substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations.

We could be
subject to substantial liability claims, which would adversely affect our results and financial condition.

Certain equipment used in the delivery of oilfield services, such as directional drilling equipment, perforating systems, subsea completion equipment and well completion systems, are used in hostile environments, such
as exploration, development and production applications. An accident or a failure of a product can cause personal injury, loss of life, damage to property, equipment or the environment, and suspension of operations. Our insurance may not adequately
protect us against liability for some kinds of events, including events involving pollution, or against losses resulting from business interruption. Moreover, in the future we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or
policy limits that we deem adequate. Substantial claims made under our policies could cause our premiums to increase. Any future damages caused by our products that are not covered by insurance, or are in excess of policy limits or are subject to
substantial deductibles, could reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations.

Limitations on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, including our trade secrets, could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold.

Some of our products or services, and the processes we use to produce or provide them, have
been granted United States patent protection, have patent applications pending or are trade secrets. Our business may be adversely affected if our patents are unenforceable, the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our
technology, our patent applications are denied, or our trade secrets are not adequately protected. Our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our
trade secrets.

We may be subject to litigation if another party claims that
we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights.

The tools,
techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. Infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management
from running our core business. Royalty payments under licenses from third parties, if available, would increase our costs. If a license were not available we might not be able to continue providing a particular product or service, which would
reduce our revenue. Additionally, developing non-infringing technologies would increase our costs.



Part I, Item 1A,1B,2, 3,4

Failure to obtain and retain skilled technical personnel could impede our operations.

We require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical
services and support for our business. Competition for the personnel required for our oilfield service businesses intensifies as activity increases. In periods of high utilization it may become more difficult to find and retain qualified
individuals. This could increase our costs or have other adverse effects on our operations.

Item 1B    Unresolved Staff Comments

None

Item 2    Properties

Schlumberger owns or leases manufacturing facilities, administrative offices, service centers, research centers, sales offices and warehouses in North and South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. Some facilities are owned and some
are held through long-term leases. No significant lease is scheduled to terminate in the near future, and Schlumberger believes comparable space is readily obtainable should any lease expire without renewal. Schlumberger believes all of its
properties are generally well maintained and adequate for the intended use.

The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements including, without limitation, statements relating to our plans, strategies, objectives,
expectations, intentions and resources. Such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” beginning on page 6 of this Report.

Executive Overview

Schlumberger consists of two business segments: Oilfield Services and WesternGeco.

Oilfield Services experienced strong growth in 2005 with a sharp rise in operating margins due to increasing activity, strong pricing momentum and
accelerated technology introduction. Oil prices ended the year 41% higher than at the beginning of the year, while natural gas prices surged 82% over the same period.

In the United States, the absence of a meaningful increase in natural gas production supported strong natural gas prices in 2005, which averaged more than $9 per MMBtu in 2005. Additionally, the devastating hurricane
season resulted in a severe disruption of the already stretched United States oil industry. Eastern Hemisphere activity grew significantly but is still at a fairly early stage with the supply response only now translating into increased exploration,
development and production maintenance operations in key international areas such as Russia and the Middle East. Internationally, projects ramped up throughout the year, supporting a steady growth in 2005. Growing levels of activity and increasing
preparations for new projects in the Eastern Hemisphere indicate a trend that is expected to continue in 2006.

WesternGeco delivered
excellent results. Demand for seismic acquisition, principally marine, as well as multiclient data indicate a strong renewed interest in exploration. The continued acceptance of Q technology resulted in impressive growth, which is expected to
continue in 2006.

In Russia, the cooperation and confidence established during the initial period of our minority holding of PetroAlliance
Services Company Limited, Russia’s largest independent oilfield services company, has confirmed our belief that the company will play a major role in our continued expansion. Schlumberger acquired an additional 25% equity stake in PetroAlliance
in 2005, bringing Schlumberger’s total ownership to 51%. Schlumberger initially acquired 26% in the second quarter of 2004. The acquisition of the remaining 49% of the company is expected to be completed in 2006, subject to performance
requirements, regulatory approval, and other customary provisions.

Recent seismic, logging and well testing contracts show a renewed
interest in exploration in both new and existing areas. This shift, together with increasing customer spending, tightening service industry resources, and faster deployment of new technologies creates an environment in which Schlumberger is well
positioned.

Ongoing supply constraints and resilient demand growth support high-energy prices with OPEC giving the market strong signals
that it considers the $50 to $70 range per barrel for WTI (West Texas Intermediate) to be appropriate. Limited spare production capacity combined with geopolitical tensions that threaten supply availability provide upside potential for oil prices.
Supply problems may prove even more severe for natural gas as accelerated production decline rates, and limited ability to increase drilling activity, continue to challenge United States and Canadian gas producers.

IEA (International Energy Agency) projections show oil demand growth continuing at an annual rate of about 1.8 million barrels per day to
2 million barrels per day through to 2010 to reach a total of approximately 92.5 million barrels per day. This represents an increase of nearly 9 million barrels per day over demand in 2005. The IEA also show supply capacity growth
just matching demand growth in 2007, 2008 and 2010, with capacity growth managing to increase slightly faster than demand in 2006 and 2009. In short, based on the IEA numbers, the degree of spare upstream capacity is not expected to increase
significantly before the end of the decade.



Part II, Item 7

Several trends will define activity in 2006. First, rig count increases will
be largely limited to onshore work as the global offshore rig market will remain constrained until new builds are mobilized beyond 2006. Second, shortages of people and equipment across the industry are likely to result in cost inflation and project
delays, placing a high premium on reliable suppliers of both technology and skilled personnel. Third, the technology that can improve the productivity of the limited base of skilled personnel will be in high demand. This is clearly demonstrated both
by the success of Schlumberger Petrel* seismic-to-simulation software tools, and by growing acceptance of the remote monitoring of job execution to achieve superior performance from technology. Fourth, exploration activity, where Schlumberger has an
unmatched portfolio of services, is expected to show a large increase in 2006 and to continue for a number of years.

The industry has
already recognized the need for an unprecedented effort to increase secure hydrocarbon supply. Plans are being put in place to achieve this, but it will take several years of sustained activity to develop the new production that can reliably replace
today’s supply, much of which was developed during the up-cycle of the 1970s and 1980s. In addition, this new supply will generally come from smaller reservoirs and more hostile environments where Schlumberger is uniquely placed to meet the
challenge.

The following discussion and analysis of results of operations should be read in conjunction with the

Oilfield Services

2005 Results

Revenue of $12.65 billion increased 24% in 2005 versus 2004. Both Latin America and Europe/CIS/Africa increased 27%, Middle East & Asia increased 22% and North America increased 21%. The strong activity
levels around the world reflected the growing response to the current narrow margin of excess production capacity.

Pretax operating income
of $2.81 billion in 2005 was 56% higher than in 2004 demonstrating high demand for oilfield services and accelerating technology delivery. Both higher activity and stronger pricing contributed to the sharp increase in pretax operating margins that
strengthened across all Oilfield Services geographical areas.

Pricing showed strong improvement in North America and continued to make
excellent progress internationally. Customer concern over the availability of certain services and products coupled with recognition of elements of cost inflation has led to inclusion of price-escalation clauses in longer-term contracts.

Activity increased universally, with the largest growth recorded in the GeoMarkets in Canada; US Land; Peru/Colombia/Ecuador; Russia; Nigeria;
Australasia; Saudi Arabia; and the Arabian Gulf. Both organic growth and acquisitions contributed to the more than 50% revenue growth in Russia in 2005 versus 2004.



Part II, Item 7

Demand for all Technologies increased sharply, but particularly for Well
Services and Well Completions & Productivity services. Technology introduction accelerated during the year. The Scope* family of Drilling & Measurements services for improved drilling performance and enhanced formation evaluation,
met growing acceptance as customers realized step changes in well-placement accuracy in several geographical areas. During the year Schlumberger also launched the Scanner Family* of wireline logging services, a revolutionary suite of downhole rock
and fluid characterization measurements.

Revenue of $3.76 billion increased 21% over 2004 mainly driven by Canada and US Land, which
benefited from strong Well Services and Drilling & Measurements activity coupled with strong pricing improvements.

The Canada
GeoMarket experienced strong equipment and personnel utilization, higher pricing and increased demand for high-tier services.

The robust
growth in US Land resulted from the combination of positive trends in activity and favorable pricing.

During the third quarter, activity
was severely disrupted in the Gulf of Mexico with more than 25 days of operating time lost due to the disastrous hurricane season. Damage sustained by production platforms and mobile offshore drilling units led to reduced activity throughout the
third quarter with some lingering effect in the fourth quarter.

Pretax operating income of $933 million was 80% higher than in 2004 led by
US Land and Canada. The steep growth was primarily due to double-digit price increases, particularly for Well Services, Wireline and Drilling & Measurements technologies. New technology introduction and continuing activity growth also
contributed to these results. The severe hurricane season in the Gulf of Mexico had an estimated impact of approximately $70 million in lost revenue, and $52 million in lost pretax operating income.

Latin America

Revenue of $2.21 billion in 2005 increased 27% over 2004 with the highest growth recorded in the Peru/Colombia/Ecuador and Latin America
South GeoMarkets.

Mexico recorded significant revenue growth, mainly due to a high number of wells being completed on the Burgos project,
coupled with an overall rise in third-party managed services revenue.

Activity in Venezuela increased primarily from IPM and Well Services
operations. During the year, continued progress was highlighted with the signing of a short-term renewable agreement with PDVSA in early 2005 for operations on the PRISA project. Discussions regarding the settlement of certain outstanding
receivables were still on going at year-end.

The Peru/Colombia/Ecuador GeoMarket contributed significantly to the revenue growth due to the
start of several new Drilling & Measurements contracts for the expanding customer base.

The growth in the Latin America South
GeoMarket was primarily driven by increased IPM activity, although Brazil experienced strong activity from the deployment of Drilling & Measurements and Wireline technologies.

Pretax operating income of $330 million in 2005 increased 49% versus 2004. This strong increase in operating income resulted mainly from an improved
drilling environment in Venezuela coupled with stronger operating efficiencies in Well Services and Drilling & Measurements services and across all GeoMarkets, particularly in the Peru/Colombia/Ecuador GeoMarket.

Europe/CIS/Africa

Revenue of $3.53 billion in 2005 increased 27% over 2004 with the highest growth recorded in the Russia and Nigeria GeoMarkets.



Part II, Item 7

Strong revenue increases were recorded offshore Nigeria and in deepwater West
Africa GeoMarket operations mainly benefiting Well Completions & Productivity, Wireline, and Drilling & Measurements with the rapid market acceptance of Scope technology.

The CIS reached a new revenue record at $1.17 billion, an increase of 42% over 2004. The significant increase in revenue in Russia was due to a
combination of organic growth, and the impact of the acquisitions of PetroAlliance and the Siberian Geophysical Company. Organic growth in Russia was driven by a recovery in activity for Yuganskneftegaz during the first quarter, increased demand for
stimulation and cementing services, strengthening of IPM operations, and robust uptake of new technology.

Pretax operating income of $704
million in 2005 increased 57% compared to 2004. Nigeria and West Africa contributed significantly due to increased activity, pricing improvements, and accelerated technology deployment. Operating income in the North Africa GeoMarket also increased
markedly due to the growing presence of international oil companies in the region. The North Sea GeoMarket was a strong contributor to operating income through increased drilling activity and strong demand for production technologies from Well
Services and Wireline.

Middle East & Asia

Revenue of $3.03 billion in 2005 increased 22% over 2004 with the highest growth recorded in
the Australasia, Brunei/Malaysia/Philippines, Saudi Arabia and Gulf GeoMarkets.

The importance of the Middle East in responding to the
current lack of spare production capacity is reflected in the strong activity plans that were implemented in the region in 2005. The marked revenue growth seen in the Saudi Arabia GeoMarket was principally due to the increase in rig count as Saudi
Aramco continued to increase activity in line with their announced spending plans.

East Africa & East Mediterranean GeoMarket
growth was mainly due to the expanded market for Drilling & Measurements and the start of a new Wireline campaign. In the Gulf GeoMarket, the start-up of Wireline services for Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) and burgeoning gas activity in
Qatar also contributed to the revenue growth. The Arabian, the Gulf and East Africa & East Mediterranean GeoMarkets recorded revenue increases of more than 30% and operating income growth of more than 40%.

The solid contribution from the Brunei/Malaysia/Philippines GeoMarket was mainly due to higher customer expenditures, improved pricing, and a move by
several operators into increased deepwater exploration uniquely benefiting Schlumberger technologies.

Activity in China strengthened
throughout the year as a result of accelerated adoption of advanced Drilling & Measurements and Wireline technologies.

Australasia
experienced a robust revenue growth rate mainly due to rising development activity in offshore Australia combined with growing land-based activity in New Zealand.

Pretax operating income of $871 million in 2005 increased 34% compared to 2004. The steady increase in operating income and operating margins throughout the year was due to activity improvement across all GeoMarkets
and significant price increases—principally in Drilling & Measurements, Well Completions & Productivity, and Wireline Technologies—coupled with the start up of new projects throughout the Area. Improved results of the
Bokor integrated project in the Brunei/Malaysia/Philippines GeoMarket also contributed to the operating income growth.

2004 Results

Revenue of $10.24 billion increased 16% in 2004 versus 2003. North America increased 18%, Middle East & Asia increased 19%, and Latin America increased 21%. Europe/CIS/Africa was up by 4%. Pretax operating
income of $1.80 billion in 2004 was 17% higher than in 2003.



Part II, Item 7

Activity increased in almost all regions with the largest growth recorded in
the GeoMarkets in India; Mexico; Russia; East Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean; and the Caspian. Russia continued to make impressive progress with growth exceeding our expectations despite the absence of any activity for Yuganskneftegaz at the
end of the year.

Demand for all Technologies increased, particularly for Drilling & Measurements technologies including the
PowerDrive* and newly introduced PowerV* rotary-steerable systems as well as Wireline ABC* Analysis Behind Casing and PressureXpress* services. Increased demand for Well Services production technologies also contributed significantly to the growth.
These technologies included the successful launch of the PowerCLEAN* system, an integrated solution for optimizing production through wellbore fill removal using coiled tubing. Well Completions & Productivity technologies also showed strong
growth for production-based technology services, while IPM activity continued its expansion. The rate of new technology introductions is expected to accelerate over the coming two-year period.

Offshore and deepwater activity in India utilizing Wireline, Drilling & Measurements and Well Completions & Productivity technologies
continued to drive significant year-on-year growth. Growth in India was supported by the award of a completion sales tender for subsurface safety valves and a three-year contract for wireline logging on onshore fields for ONGC valued at more than
$125 million.

During the year Schlumberger opened a Technology Hub on the campus of the Gubkin Russian State University of Oil and Gas,
Russia’s leading oil and gas educational establishment. The Hub complements other Schlumberger research and engineering activities in Russia.

Shell International Exploration and Production BV and Schlumberger Information Solutions formed an alliance for the research and development of next-generation Smart Fields™ hydrocarbon development solutions.

North America

Revenue of $3.11 billion increased 18% over 2003 led principally by Canada and US Land, which benefited from the strong performance of most
Technologies, coupled with pricing improvements particularly for Well Services.

Growth in Canada was due to increased activity and
substantially higher pricing.

US Land delivered robust revenue growth primarily due to continued favorable oil and gas industry dynamics,
the expansion of the unconventional gas market, an improved pricing environment as a result of tighter resource availability, and strong overall market demand combined with increasing demand for ABC technologies, and Drilling & Measurements
PowerDrive rotary-steerable systems. These technology advances are demonstrating value and are helping drive activity while enabling price increases and efficiency gains.

Pretax operating income of $519 million was 42% higher than in 2003 due mainly to increased operating leverage in US Land, with double-digit price improvements in Well Services and Wireline Technologies over 2003
averages. In Canada, increased activity coupled with sustained pricing improvements, and the favorable exchange rate effect led to a notable improvement in operating income.

At the end of the year, the technology component of turnkey service revenue in the Gulf of Mexico was evaluated against our objectives but proved
insufficient to outweigh the risk associated with the turnkey drilling business model. As a result, the decision was made to exit the activity.

Latin America

Revenue of $1.75 billion grew 21% over 2003 as all the GeoMarkets, except Venezuela, posted revenue increases. Record revenue in Mexico was mainly due to PEMEX drilling activity coupled with higher levels of IPM
activity.



Part II, Item 7

Increasing demand for IPM services in Argentina, an increase in Wireline
activity associated with the Peruvian jungle operations, and growing demand for rotary steerable systems in Brazil also contributed to the revenue growth.

In Venezuela, revenue decreased slightly on lower activity with PDVSA due to ongoing contract negotiation on certain integrated projects.

Pretax operating income of $221 million was flat over 2003. The substantial revenue growth did not materialize into higher operating income mainly because of a larger contribution of Schlumberger-managed third-party
services on IPM projects in Mexico as well as an unfavorable revenue mix in Mexico. Additionally, throughout the year, certain barges in West Venezuela were partially idled while contractual negotiations continued with PDVSA.

Europe/CIS/Africa

Revenue of $2.79 billion increased 7% over 2003 mainly due to Russia, the Caspian and West Africa with gains recorded in all Technologies
led by Drilling & Measurements and Well Services.

CIS revenue reached $825 million, a 33% increase over 2003. Activity was
particularly sustained in Russia mainly due to the continued expansion of the customer base and the deployment of new production-related technologies. The revenue growth was tempered by the halt of activities for Yuganskneftegaz in Russia in the
fourth quarter. However, successful redeployment of the equipment previously working for Yuganskneftegaz was completed by the end of the year.

West Africa continued to deliver robust performance achieving record activity levels mainly due to the development of deepwater projects combined with price increases through the introduction of new services and increasing demand for Well
Services and Well Completions & Productivity technologies.

Pretax operating income of $447 million declined 3% over 2003 mainly
due to persistent union strikes in Norway, redeployment costs and associated decreased operating efficiency in Russia, weak results in North Africa, and the appreciation of local currencies against the US dollar. These were partially offset by the
continued strengthening of activity in Continental Europe and the Caspian.

Middle
East & Asia

Revenue in 2004 reached $2.48 billion, increasing
19% over 2003. The GeoMarkets in the Middle East, Malaysia and India primarily drove the growth. Activity in Saudi Arabia was focused on increasing production capacity, which resulted in higher levels of drilling activity throughout the year. This
trend is expected to continue in 2005. India reached record revenue with the ramp-up in deepwater activity for ONGC and deepwater exploration activity for Reliance Industries Ltd. Activity in Qatar continued to increase due to ongoing gas
development projects in the North Field. Also contributing to the record revenue level was the start of a new fracturing campaign in Oman. Demand for Well Completions & Productivity technologies was particularly strong, mainly in the Gulf
from projects with RasGas, in Saudi Arabia from the commissioning of the Abu Safah project, and in Malaysia from higher testing activities and artificial lift sales.

Pretax operating income of $649 million increased 27% over 2003 primarily driven by India, due to a substantial increase in deepwater activity combined with strong technology deployment, the ramp up of favorable
projects in the Gulf, improved pricing on contract renewals, and new technology introductions.

Key technology solutions that were deployed
included the CHDT* Cased Hole Dynamic Tester tool, part of the suite of ABC technology services, was used to identify a high-pressured zone in a depleted reservoir in China; to acquire pressures and fluid samples in Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi; and
to acquire samples and pressure readings in Malaysia.



Part II, Item 7

In the Gulf, demonstrated service quality and the introduction of new
technology services led to the award of major contracts in Qatar and Oman. These included a $320 million, multi-year wireline and tubing conveyed perforating contract by PDO for their North and South operations.

WesternGeco

2005 Results

Operating revenue for 2005 was $1.66 billion versus $1.24 billion in 2004. This strong performance was mainly attributable to the continued market acceptance of
Q-Technology*, a higher level of Multiclient sales and improved operating leverage in Marine acquisition.

Backlog reached an all-time high
of $790 million at the end of 2005 compared to $670 million at the end of last year, reflecting increasing exploration and production budgets for 2006.

Q-Technology revenues reached $399 million in 2005, representing 24% of total revenue in 2005, more than doubling the $162 million achieved in 2004. Utilization of the five Q-equipped vessels reached 93% in the fourth
quarter of 2005. Q-Technology revenue is expected to grow by another 80% in 2006.

Multiclient sales increased 17%, to $509 million, mainly
in North America due to an especially strong Central Gulf of Mexico lease sale, higher sales in Asia, the Caspian, South America and West Africa—reflecting an improved exploration-spending environment. Approximately 64% of the multiclient
surveys sold in 2005 had no net book value due to prior amortization of capitalized costs, compared to approximately 52% in 2004 and only 7.7% of the revenue related to surveys that were impaired in 2003 and 2002.

Marine activity grew 63% mainly from strong activity in the North Sea, Asia, India and the Gulf of Mexico, combined with higher vessel utilization, steady
price increases and more favorable contractual terms regarding risk sharing with customers for downtime.

Land activity increased 31% mainly
in the Middle East reflecting higher activity in Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Kuwait. The Land seismic crew count increased from 18 at the end of 2004 to 24 at the end of 2005.

Data Processing increased 14% reflecting higher acquisition volumes, higher levels of Q-processing, and higher activity in South America and Russia.

Pretax operating income reached $317 million in 2005 compared to $124 million in 2004 due to accelerating demand for Q-Marine* coupled with
improved pricing and increased vessel utilization, together with strong Multiclient sales.

Driven by Q-Marine demand, WesternGeco announced
plans to convert two more vessels to Q-Technology standards. The first, the

Western Regent

, was completed and began operations in June of 2005, while the second,

Western Monarch

, is expected to enter service in the second quarter of
2006.

2004 Results

The revenue increase of 5% to $1.24 billion in 2004 from $1.18 billion in 2003 was mainly attributable to the successful expansion of
Q-Technology together with strong Multiclient sales. Q revenues grew from $79 million in 2003 to $162 million in 2004.

Multiclient sales
increased 24%, to $436 million, mainly in the Gulf of Mexico driven by the renewed interest in the library resulting from a higher oil price environment and an increasing number of blocks in the Gulf of Mexico coming up for renewal. Approximately
52% of the multiclient surveys sold in 2004 had no net book value due to prior amortization of capitalized costs and only 5% of the revenue related to surveys that were impaired in 2003 and 2002.

Land activity decreased 8% reflecting the completion of some projects in Malaysia and the Middle East, and the shutdown of several crews active in the
previous year in Alaska, Mexico and West Africa.



Part II, Item 7

Marine activity declined 3% mainly as a result of the decision to reduce the
number of vessels in the WesternGeco fleet, coupled with adverse weather in Latin America, lower activity in the Caspian and a high number of vessel transits at the end of the year. Marine activity in the first half of 2005 is expected to recover
with higher vessel utilization and improved pricing.

Data Processing increased 6% reflecting higher acquisition volumes, higher levels of Q
processing, and robust third-party work, coupled with improved operational efficiencies.

Pretax operating income reached $124 million in
2004 compared to a loss of $20 million in 2003 due to lower amortization cost following the impairments of the Multiclient library in 2003 and 2002 coupled with savings related to restructuring measures taken in 2003, accelerating demand for
reservoir-focused Q-Marine activity together with strong Multiclient sales. Data Processing also contributed to this improvement due to better operating efficiency.

The WesternGeco backlog at the end of the year reached $670 million, increasing 64% over 2003, of which 86% is committed over the next year.

Interest and Other Income

Interest and other income consisted of the following:

1.

Refer to Note 4 to the

Consolidated Financial Statements

for details regarding these items.

Interest Income

The average return on investment increased from 2% in 2004 to 3.3% in 2005 and the average investment balance of $3.0 billion in 2005 increased $297 million compared to
2004.

The average return on investment in 2004 was 2%; a reduction of 0.4% compared to 2003, due to lower interest rates. The average
investment balance in 2004 was $2.7 billion, an increase of $567 million over 2003.

Equity in Net Earnings of Affiliated Companies

The
equity in net earnings of affiliated companies primarily represents Schlumberger’s share of the results of its 40% interest in a drilling fluids joint venture that it operates with Smith International Inc.

Interest Expense

Excluding the impact of the net $64 million charge in 2004 related to the United States interest rate swaps (see Charges and Credits),
interest expense decreased $11 million in 2005 to $197 million. The weighted average borrowing rates increased from 3.9% in 2004 to 4.4% in 2005 while the average debt balance of $4.5 billion in 2005 decreased by $865 million compared to 2004.



Part II, Item 7

Interest expense in 2004 of $272 million included a net charge of $64 million
related to the United States interest rate swaps; excluding the net charge, interest expense decreased $126 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 due to a $2 billion decrease in average debt balances and a decrease in the weighted average borrowing
rates from 4.6% to 3.9%.

Other

Gross margin was 25.8%, 21.2% and 15.9% in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Charges
and Credits noted on page 24 of this Report adversely impacted the gross margin by 0.4% and 4.7% in 2004 and 2003. Charges and Credits had an insignificant impact on the 2005 gross margin. Gross margin increased from 21.2% in 2004 to 25.8% in 2005
primarily due to a combination of record activity levels in Oilfield Services, with operations at capacity in a number of regions and continued pricing improvements in both Oilfield Services and WesternGeco.

As a percentage of revenue, research & engineering, marketing and general & administrative expenses are as follows:

Income Taxes

The reported effective tax rate, including Charges and Credits

,

was 22.9% in 2005,
20.9% in 2004 and 46.0% in 2003. The Charges and Credits noted on page 24 of this Report decreased the effective rate by 1.5% in 2005 and increased the effective tax rate by 0.4% in 2004 and 21.2% in 2003.

The increase in the reported effective tax from 2004 to 2005 is primarily attributable to the country mix of results in Oilfield Services, which
experienced a higher proportion of pretax profitability in higher-tax jurisdictions in 2005. This increase was mitigated primarily by the impact of the $163 million gain on the sale of the Montrouge facility. This transaction allowed for the
utilization of a deferred tax asset that was previously offset by a valuation allowance.

The decrease in the reported effective tax rate
from 2003 to 2004 was primarily the result of a significant amount of non-tax effective charges in 2003, including $168 million of charges related to the extinguishment of European debt, as well as changes in the country mix of earnings in
WesternGeco.



Part II, Item 7

Charges and Credits

During each of 2005, 2004 and 2003, Schlumberger recorded significant charges and credits in continuing operations. These charges and
credits, which are summarized below, are more fully described in Note 4 to the

Consolidated Financial Statements

.

The following is a
summary of the 2005 Charges and Credits:

The following is a
summary of the 2004 Charges and Credits:

The following is a
summary of the 2003 Charges and Credits:

Business Divestitures – Discontinued
Operations

During 2003, Schlumberger began an active program to
divest of all of its non-oilfield services businesses, which was completed in 2005. These divestitures, which were accounted for as

Discontinued Operations

, are more fully described in Note 3 to the

Consolidated Financial Statements

.
As a result of these transactions, Schlumberger generated cash, including proceeds from the sale of securities received, of approximately $28 million in 2005, $2.93 billion in 2004 and $299 million in 2003. These proceeds have been primarily used to
further Schlumberger’s deleveraging efforts.



Part II, Item 7

The following table summarizes the results of these discontinued operations:

Stock-based Compensation and Other

Stock-based compensation expense was approximately $40 million in
2005 and is currently estimated to be approximately $110 million in 2006. This increase will be principally due to (i) the adoption of FAS 123R, as discussed in Note 16 to the

Consolidated Financial Statements

, which requires companies
to expense the unamortized portion of stock options granted prior to 2003 when Schlumberger adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, (ii) 2006 will be the first year that the full 4-year impact of the adoption of the fair
value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 (adopted by Schlumberger in January 2003), will be reflected in Schlumberger’s results and (iii) valuations of 2006 stock-based compensation awards are expected to increase due to the recent upward
movement in Schlumberger’s stock price.

During 2006, Schlumberger will relocate its United States corporate office from New York to
Houston. Schlumberger will also relocate its United States research center from Ridgefield to Boston in 2006. Schlumberger currently estimates that it will incur approximately $25 million to $30 million in incremental expenses in connection with
these moves in 2006.

Cash Flow

In 2005, cash provided by operations was $3.0 billion as net income plus
depreciation & amortization were partly offset by increases in customer receivables and inventories, due to higher operating revenues.

Cash used in investing activities was $2.04 billion and included investments in fixed assets ($1.59 billion) and multiclient seismic data ($60 million), the purchase of short-term investments ($707 million), proceeds from the sale of the
Montrouge facility ($230 million) and the sale of the investment in Hanover Compressor ($110 million).

Cash used in financing activities
was $994 million with the proceeds from employee stock plans ($345 million) offset by the payment of dividends to shareholders ($482 million), the repurchase of 7.64 million shares of Schlumberger stock ($612 million) and an overall reduction
in debt of $216 million.



Part II, Item 7

“Net Debt” is gross debt less cash, short-term investments and
fixed income investments held to maturity. Management believes that Net Debt provides useful information regarding the level of Schlumberger’s indebtedness by reflecting cash and investments that could be used to repay debt, and that the level
of net debt provides useful information as to the results of Schlumberger’s deleveraging efforts. Details of the change in Net Debt follows:

1.

Includes Multiclient seismic data costs.

At December 31,
2005, cash and short-term investments of $3.5 billion and the remaining credit facilities of $4.4 billion are sufficient to meet future business requirements for at least the next twelve months.



Part II, Item 7

Summary of Major Contractual Commitments

Refer to Note 5 of the

Consolidated Financial Statement

for details regarding potential commitments associated with Schlumberger’s prior business acquisitions.

Schlumberger has outstanding letters of credit/guarantees which relate to business performance bonds, custom/excise tax commitments, facility lease/rental obligations, etc. These were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are
customary practices in the various countries where Schlumberger operates.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial
statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires Schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The following accounting policies involve “critical accounting estimates” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by
Schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain. A summary of all of Schlumberger’s significant accounting policies are included in Note 2 to the

Consolidated Financial Statements

.

Schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Multiclient Seismic Data

The WesternGeco segment capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic
data. Such costs are charged to

Cost of goods sold and services

based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that Schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data. However, under no circumstance will an
individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4-year straight-lined amortized value.

The carrying value of surveys is reviewed
for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred. Adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues, which involve significant
judgment on the part of Schlumberger, would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys. Significant adverse changes in Schlumberger’s estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period. For
purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library, future cash flows are analyzed based on two pools of surveys: United States and non-United States. The United States and non-United States pools were determined to be the
most appropriate level at which to perform the impairment review based upon a number of factors including (i) various macroeconomic factors that influence the ability to successfully market surveys and (ii) the focus of the sales force and
related costs.

Schlumberger recorded an impairment charge relating to the multiclient library of $398 million in 2003. The carrying value
of the library at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $222 million, $347 million and $506 million, respectively. Following the 2003 impairment charge, Schlumberger will not generally commence a multiclient project unless the project is
significantly pre-funded by one or more customers. The reduction in the carrying value of the library over recent years is primarily attributable to a cautious approach to new investment combined with the significant pre-funding requirement.



Part II, Item 7

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts
receivable at their net realizable value. A significant amount of judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve. Allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible, including amounts for
the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices, customer satisfaction claims and pricing discrepancies. Depending on how such potential issues are resolved, or if the financial condition of
Schlumberger’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, adjustments to the allowance may be required.

Inventory Reserves

Schlumberger writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future
demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.

Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets

Schlumberger records as goodwill the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets
acquired. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (SFAS 142), requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an
impairment may have occurred. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of Schlumberger’s individual reporting units to their carrying amount to determine if there is a potential goodwill impairment. If the fair value of the
reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value.

For purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill as required by SFAS 142, Schlumberger’s reporting units are primarily the geographic
areas comprising the Oilfield Services segment in addition to the WesternGeco segment. Schlumberger estimates the fair value of these reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis and/or applying various market multiples. From time to time a
third party valuation expert may be utilized to assist in the determination of fair value. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Schlumberger’s
estimates of the fair value of each of its reporting units was significantly in excess of their respective carrying values at the time of the annual goodwill impairment tests for 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Long-lived assets, including fixed assets and intangible assets, are reviewed
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In reviewing for impairment, the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected
from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset’s recorded value, an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long-lived asset to its estimated
fair value. The determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of long-lived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management. In order to estimate the fair value of a long-lived asset, Schlumberger may engage
a third-party to assist with the valuation. If there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value, Schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in
the future. Schlumberger evaluates the remaining useful life of its intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated amortization period.



Part II, Item 7

Investments

Schlumberger and Smith International Inc. operate a drilling fluids joint venture of which Schlumberger owns a 40% interest and records
income using the equity method of accounting. Schlumberger’s investment at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $802 million and $716 million, respectively. The carrying value of this joint venture is evaluated for impairment annually as well as
when an event or change in circumstance indicates that a decline in the fair value of this investment that is other than temporary has occurred. Fair value is generally estimated by comparing the significance of this joint venture to Smith
International Inc., a publicly traded company, and then referencing the market capitalization of Smith International Inc. To date, Schlumberger has not recorded any impairment charges relating to this investment as this analysis has indicated that
the fair value of this investment is significantly in excess of its carrying value.

Income Taxes

Schlumberger’s tax filings are subject to
regular audit by the tax authorities in most of the jurisdictions in which it conducts business. These audits may result in assessments for additional taxes which are resolved with the authorities or, potentially, through the courts. Tax liabilities
are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits. Estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances.
However, due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different from these estimates. In such an event, Schlumberger will
record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the year in which such resolution occurs.

Schlumberger had net deferred tax assets of $564
million at December 31, 2005, which excluded $213 million relating to net operating losses in certain countries for which there is a valuation allowance. In assessing the need for valuation allowances, Schlumberger considers the likelihood of
future taxable income and available tax planning strategies.

Contingencies

The

Consolidated Balance Sheet

includes accruals for the estimated
future costs associated with certain environmental remediation activities related to the past use or disposal of hazardous material where it is probable that Schlumberger has incurred a liability and such amount can be reasonably estimated.
Substantially all such costs relate to divested operations and to facilities or locations that are no longer in operation. Due to a number of uncertainties, including uncertainty of timing, the scope of remediation, future technology, regulatory
changes, natural resource or property damage claims and other factors, it is possible that the ultimate remediation costs may exceed the amounts estimated. However, in the opinion of management, any such additional costs are not expected to be
material relative to consolidated liquidity, financial position or future results of operations.

The

Consolidated Balance Sheet

includes accruals for estimated future expenditures, relating to potential contractual obligations, associated with business divestitures which have been completed. It is possible that the ultimate expenditures may differ from the amounts recorded.
In the opinion of management, such differences are not expected to be material relative to consolidated liquidity, financial position or future results of operations.

In December 2004, WesternGeco and Schlumberger received grand jury subpoenas from the United States Attorney’s office in the Southern District of Texas seeking documents relating to possible fraud in obtaining
visas for non-United States citizens working as crewmembers on vessels operating in the Gulf of Mexico. We are in the process of responding to the investigation, including providing information sought by the subpoenas. Schlumberger is currently
unable to predict the outcome of this matter and the related impact it might have on Schlumberger’s financial position and results of operations.



Part II, Item 7

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

Schlumberger’s pension benefit and postretirement medical benefit obligations and
related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts, which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates. These assumptions are important elements of expense and/or liability
measurement and are updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each fiscal year, or more frequently upon the occurrence of significant events.

The discount rate we use reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the payment of the benefit obligations. The discount rate utilized to determine
both the accumulated benefit obligation (“ABO”) for Schlumberger’s United States pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (“APBO”) for Schlumberger’s United States postretirement medical plans
was reduced from 6.00% at December 31, 2004 to 5.75% at December 31, 2005. The discount rate utilized to determine expense for Schlumberger’s United States pension plans and postretirement medical plans was reduced from 6.25% in 2004
to 6.00% in 2005. The change in the discount rate was made to reflect market interest rate conditions. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases expense.

The expected rate of return for our retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period
that benefits included in the benefit obligation, are expected to be paid. The expected rate of return for Schlumberger’s United States pension plans has been determined based upon expectations regarding future rates of return for the
investment portfolio, with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class. The expected rate of return on plan assets was 8.50% in both 2005 and 2004. A lower
expected rate of return would increase pension expense.

Schlumberger’s medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on
historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. The overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized in 2005 was 10% graded to 6% over the next six years and 5% thereafter. The overall medical cost trend
rate assumption utilized in 2004 was 10% graded to 5% over the next five years and 5% thereafter.

The following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, for the United States pension plans:

Part II, Item 7A

Item 7A    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Schlumberger is subject to market risk primarily associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.

As a multinational company, Schlumberger conducts its business in over 80 countries. Schlumberger’s functional currency is primarily the US dollar,
which is consistent with the oil and gas industry. Approximately 80% of Schlumberger’s operating revenue in 2005 was denominated in US dollars. However, outside the United States, a significant portion of Schlumberger’s expenses are
incurred in foreign currencies. Therefore, when the US dollar strengthens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which Schlumberger conducts business, the US dollar-reported expenses will decrease.

A 5% change in the average exchange rates of all the foreign currencies in 2005 would have changed operating revenue by approximately 1%. If the 2005
average exchange rates of the US dollar against all foreign currencies had increased by 5%, Schlumberger’s income from continuing operations would have increased by 4%. Conversely, a 5% weakening of the US dollar average exchange rates would
have decreased income from continuing operations by 4%.

Schlumberger maintains a foreign-currency risk management strategy that uses
derivative instruments to protect its interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates. Foreign currency forward contracts provide a hedge against currency fluctuations either on
assets/liabilities denominated in other than a functional currency or on expenses. Option contracts are usually entered into as a hedge against currency variations on firm commitments generally involving the construction of long-lived assets.

On December 31, 2005, contracts were outstanding for the US dollar equivalent of $1.9 billion in various foreign currencies. These
contracts mature on various dates in 2006.

Schlumberger does not enter into foreign currency or interest rate derivatives for speculative
purposes.

Schlumberger is subject to interest rate risk on its debt. Schlumberger maintains an interest rate risk management strategy that
uses a mix of variable- and fixed-rate debt together with interest rate swaps, where appropriate, to fix or lower borrowing costs.

At
December 31, 2005, Schlumberger had fixed rate debt aggregating approximately $2.8 billion and variable rate debt aggregating $1.6 billion.

Schlumberger’s exposure to interest rate risk associated with its debt is also somewhat mitigated by its investment portfolio. Both

Short-term investments

and

Fixed income investments, held to maturity

, which totaled
approximately $3.7 billion at December 31, 2005, are comprised primarily of eurodollar time deposits, certificates of deposit and commercial paper, euronotes and eurobonds, and are substantially all denominated in US dollars. The average return
on investment was 3.3% in 2005.



Part II, Item 7A

The following table represents principal amounts of Schlumberger’s debt
at December 31, 2005 by year of maturity:

On or after
June 6, 2008 (in the case of the Series A Convertible Debentures) or June 6, 2010 (in the case of the Series B Convertible Debentures), Schlumberger may redeem for cash all or part of the applicable series of debentures, upon notice to the
holders, at the redemption prices of 100% of the principal amount of the debentures, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. On June 1, 2008, June 1, 2013, and June 1, 2018, holders of Series A debentures may
require Schlumberger to repurchase their Series A debentures. On June 1, 2010, June 1, 2013 and June 1, 2018, holders of Series B debentures may require Schlumberger to repurchase their Series B debentures. The repurchase price
will be 100% of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date. The repurchase price for repurchases on June 1, 2008 (in the case of the Series A debentures) and June 1, 2010 (in the case of
the Series B debentures) will be paid in cash. On the other repurchase dates, Schlumberger may choose to pay the repurchase price in cash or common stock or any combination of cash and common stock. In addition, upon the occurrence of a Fundamental
Change (defined as a change in control or a termination of trading of Schlumberger’s common stock), holders may require Schlumberger to repurchase all or a portion of their debentures, in cash or, at Schlumberger’s election, common stock
valued at 99% of its market price or any combination of cash and common stock, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The debentures will mature on
June 1, 2023 unless earlier redeemed or repurchased.

The fair market value of the outstanding fixed rate debt was approximately $3.4
billion as of December 31, 2005. The weighted average interest rate on the variable rate debt as of December 31, 2005 was approximately 4.8%.

On December 31, 2005, interest rate swap arrangements outstanding were pay floating/receive fixed on US dollar debt of $93 million. These arrangements mature at various dates to December 2009. Interest rate swap
arrangements decreased consolidated interest expense in 2005 by $3 million.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1.    Business Description

Founded in
1927, Schlumberger Limited (Schlumberger) is the world’s leading oilfield services company, supplying technology, project management, and information solutions that optimize performance in the oil and gas industry. Schlumberger consists of two
business segments: Oilfield Services and WesternGeco. Oilfield Services is the world’s premier oilfield service company supplying a wide range of technology services and solutions to the international petroleum industry. The Oilfield Services
segment provides virtually all exploration and production services required during the life of an oil and gas reservoir. WesternGeco provides comprehensive worldwide reservoir imaging, monitoring, and development services, with extensive seismic
crews and data processing centers as well as a large multiclient seismic library. Services range from 3D and time-lapse (4D) seismic surveys to multi-component surveys for delineating prospects and reservoir management. WesternGeco is 70% owned by
Schlumberger and 30% owned by Baker Hughes.

2.    Summary of
Accounting Policies

The

Consolidated Financial Statements

of
Schlumberger Limited have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying

Consolidated Financial Statements

include the accounts of Schlumberger, its wholly owned subsidiaries, and subsidiaries over which it exercises a
controlling financial interest. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Investments in entities in which Schlumberger does not have a controlling financial interest, but over which it has significant influence
are accounted for using the equity method. Schlumberger’s share of the after-tax earnings of equity method investees is included in

Interest and other income

. Investments in which Schlumberger does not have the ability to exercise
significant influence are accounted for using the cost method. Both equity and cost method investments are classified in

Investments in Affiliated Companies

.

Reclassifications

Certain items from prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, Schlumberger
evaluates its estimates, including those related to collectability of accounts receivable, valuation of inventories and investments, recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes, multiclient seismic data, contingencies and
actuarial assumptions for employee benefit plans. Schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.



Part II, Item 8

Revenue Recognition

Oilfield Services

Products and Services Revenue

Schlumberger recognizes revenue for products and services based upon purchase orders, contracts or other persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the customer that include fixed or determinable prices and that do
not include right of return or other similar provisions or other significant post delivery obligations. Revenue is recognized for products upon delivery, customer acceptance and when collectibility is reasonably assured. Revenue is recognized when
services are rendered and collectibility is reasonably assured.

Software Revenue

Revenue derived from the sale of licenses of Schlumberger software
includes installation, maintenance, consulting and training services.

If services are not essential to the functionality of the software,
the revenue for each element of the contract is recognized separately based on its respective vendor specific objective evidence of fair value when all of the following conditions are met: a signed contract is obtained, delivery has occurred, the
fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable.

If an ongoing vendor obligation exists under the license arrangement, or if
any uncertainties with regard to customer acceptance are significant, revenue for the related element is deferred based on its vendor specific objective evidence of fair value. Vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is determined as being
the price for the element when sold separately. If vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements, all revenue is deferred until sufficient evidence exists or all elements have been delivered.

The percentage of completion method of accounting is applied to contracts whereby software is being customized to a customer’s
specifications.

WesternGeco

Revenues from all services are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Revenues from contract services performed on a dayrate basis are recognized as the service is performed. Revenues from other contract services, including pre-funded
multiclient surveys, are recognized as the seismic data is acquired and/or processed on a proportionate basis as work is performed. This method requires revenue to be recognized based upon quantifiable measures of progress, such as square kilometers
acquired. Multiclient data surveys are licensed or sold to customers on a non-transferable basis. Revenues on completed multiclient data surveys are recognized upon obtaining a signed licensing agreement and providing customers access to such data.

Multiple Deliverable Arrangements

Sales in both segments may be generated from contractual arrangements that include multiple
deliverables. Revenues from these arrangements are recognized as each item is delivered based on their relative fair value and when the delivered items have stand-alone value to the customer.

Translation of Non-United States Currencies

Schlumberger’s functional currency is primarily the US dollar. All assets and
liabilities recorded in functional currencies other than US dollars are translated at current exchange rates. The resulting adjustments are charged or credited directly to the

Stockholders’ Equity

section of the

Consolidated Balance
Sheet

. Revenue and expenses are translated at the weighted-average exchange rates for the period. All realized and unrealized transaction gains and losses are included in income in the period in which they occur. Schlumberger’s policy is to
hedge against unrealized gains and losses on a monthly basis. Transaction losses of $13 million and $9 million were recognized in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Included in the 2003 results were transaction gains of $1 million.



Part II, Item 8

Investments

The

Consolidated Balance Sheet

reflects the Schlumberger investment portfolio separated between current and long term, based on
maturity. Under normal circumstances it is the intent of Schlumberger to hold the investments until maturity, with the exception of investments that are considered trading (December 31, 2005 – $157 million; December 31, 2004 – $153
million). Both

Short-term investments

and

Fixed income investments, held to maturity

are comprised primarily of money market funds, eurodollar time deposits, certificates of deposit and commercial paper, euronotes and eurobonds, and
are substantially denominated in US dollars. They are stated at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates market. Short-term investments that are designated as trading are stated at market. The unrealized gains/losses on such securities at both
December 31, 2005 and 2004 were not significant.

Long-term fixed income investments of $360 million mature as follows: $109 million in
2007, $136 million in 2008, $95 million in 2009 and $20 million in 2010.

For purposes of the

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows

,
Schlumberger does not consider short-term investments to be cash equivalents as a significant portion of them have original maturities in excess of three months.

At December 31, 2004, Schlumberger had an investment in Hanover Compressor Company which was classified as an available-for-sale security. Accordingly, it was stated at fair value with unrealized gains and losses
reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. The fair market value of Schlumberger’s investment in Hanover Compressor was $123 million at December 31, 2004 and it was included in

Other Assets

in the

Consolidated
Balance Sheet

. As further described in Note 4, Schlumberger sold this investment in 2005.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at average cost or
at market, whichever is lower. Inventory consists of materials, supplies and finished goods. Costs included in inventories consist of materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead.

Fixed Assets and Depreciation

Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, which is provided for by
charges to income over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method. Fixed assets include the manufacturing cost of oilfield technical equipment manufactured or assembled by subsidiaries of Schlumberger. Expenditures for
replacements and improvements are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expenses as incurred. Upon sale or other disposition, the applicable amounts of asset cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and
the net amount, less proceeds from disposal, is charged or credited to income.

Multiclient Seismic Data

The multiclient library
consists of completed and in-process seismic surveys that are licensed on a nonexclusive basis. This data may be acquired and/or processed by Schlumberger or subcontractors. Multiclient surveys are primarily generated utilizing Schlumberger
resources. Schlumberger capitalizes costs directly incurred in acquiring and processing the multiclient seismic data. Such costs are charged to

Cost of goods sold and services

based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total
revenue that Schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data. However, under no circumstance will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4-year straight-lined amortized value.

The carrying value of the multiclient library is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicating impairment
may have occurred. Adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future cash flows estimation of which involves significant judgment on the part of Schlumberger, would not be sufficient to recover the carrying
value of the surveys. Significant adverse changes in Schlumberger’s estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period.



Part II, Item 8

Goodwill, Other Intangibles and Long-lived Assets

Schlumberger records as goodwill the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the
tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (SFAS 142), requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually as well as when an event or
change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of Schlumberger’s individual reporting units to their carrying amount to determine if there is a potential goodwill
impairment. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value.

For purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill as required by SFAS 142, Schlumberger’s reporting units are primarily the geographic
areas comprising the Oilfield Services segment in addition to the WesternGeco segment. Schlumberger estimates the fair value of these reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis and/or applying various market multiples. From time to time a
third party valuation expert may be utilized to assist in the determination of fair value. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Schlumberger’s
estimates of the fair value of each of its reporting units was significantly in excess of their respective carrying values for 2005, 2004 and 2003. Schlumberger performs the annual goodwill impairment test of its WesternGeco reporting unit on
October 1st of every year while the reporting units comprising the Oilfield Services segment are tested as of December 31st.

Long-lived
assets, including fixed assets and intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In reviewing for impairment, the carrying value of such assets is
compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset’s recorded value, an impairment charge is recognized to
reduce the carrying value of the long-lived asset to its estimated fair value. The determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of long-lived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management. In order to
estimate the fair value of a long-lived asset, Schlumberger may engage a third-party to assist with the valuation. If there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair
value, Schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future.

Schlumberger evaluates the remaining useful life of
its intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated amortization period.

Schlumberger capitalizes certain costs of internally developed software. Capitalized costs include purchased materials and services, payroll and payroll related costs. The costs of internally developed software are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, which is principally 5 to 7 years.

Taxes on Income

Schlumberger and its
subsidiaries compute taxes on income in accordance with the tax rules and regulations of the many taxing authorities where the income is earned. The income tax rates imposed by these taxing authorities vary substantially. Taxable income may differ
from pretax income for financial accounting purposes. To the extent that differences are due to revenue or expense items reported in one period for tax purposes and in another period for financial accounting purposes, an appropriate provision for
deferred income taxes is made. Any effect of changes in income tax rates or tax laws are included in the provision for income taxes in the period of enactment. When it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not
be realized in the future, Schlumberger provides a corresponding valuation allowance against deferred tax assets.



Part II, Item 8

Schlumberger’s tax filings are subject to regular audit by the tax
authorities in most of the jurisdictions in which it conducts business. These audits may result in assessments for additional taxes which are resolved with the authorities or, potentially, through the courts. Tax liabilities are recorded based on
estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits. Estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances. However, due to the
uncertain and complex application of tax regulation, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different from these estimates. In such an event, Schlumberger will record additional tax
expense or tax benefit in the year in which such resolution occurs.

Approximately $4.5 billion of consolidated income retained for use in
the business on December 31, 2005 represented undistributed earnings of consolidated subsidiaries and Schlumberger’s share of equity method investees. No provision is made for deferred income taxes on those earnings considered to be
indefinitely reinvested or earnings that would not be taxed when remitted.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Schlumberger’s
assets that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, short-term investments, fixed income investments held to maturity, and receivables from clients. Schlumberger places its cash, short-term investments and fixed
income investments held to maturity with financial institutions and corporations, and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one of them. Schlumberger regularly evaluates the creditworthiness of the issuers in which it invests. The
receivables from clients are spread over many countries and customers. Schlumberger maintains an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable based on expected collectibility and performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’
financial condition.

Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income, as adjusted for the interest on convertible debentures unless the adjustment is anti-dilutive, by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding assuming dilution, the calculation of which assumes (i) that all stock options which are in the money are exercised at the beginning of the period and the proceeds used by Schlumberger to purchase shares at the average market
price for the period, and (ii) the convertible debentures have been converted unless the effect is anti-dilutive.



Part II, Item 8

The following is a reconciliation from basic earnings per share to diluted
earnings per share from continuing operations for each of the last three years:

Employee stock options to purchase
approximately 8.7 million and 24.8 million shares of common stock at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the option exercise price was greater than the
average market price of the common stock, and therefore, the effect on diluted earnings per share would have been anti-dilutive. In addition, computation of diluted earnings per share at December 31, 2003 also excludes the effects of approximately
19.1 million common shares issuable upon conversion of the 1.5% Series A Convertible Debentures and the 2.125% Series B Convertible Debentures as their inclusion would have also had an anti-dilutive effect.

Research & Engineering

All research and engineering expenditures are expensed as incurred, including costs relating to patents or rights that may result from such
expenditures.

3.    Discontinued Operations

During the second quarter of 2005, Credence Systems Corporation, the current owners of
Schlumberger’s former NPTest semiconductor testing business, agreed to settle an outstanding contingent liability by paying Schlumberger $4 million in cash and 615,157 shares of common stock valued at approximately $5 million, resulting in a $9
million gain. Schlumberger sold its NPTest semiconductor testing business in July 2003 and reported it as a discontinued operation. This $9 million pretax and after-tax gain is reported as

Income from

Discontinued Operations

in the

Consolidated Statement of Income

in the second quarter of 2005.



Part II, Item 8

During the first quarter of 2005, Schlumberger completed the sales of its
Global Tel*Link, Public Phones and Essentis activities for $18 million in cash. The results of these businesses were reported as

Discontinued Operations

in the

Consolidated Statement of Income

and, in the fourth quarter of 2004 include
accruals of approximately $15 million relating to the net losses on the sale of Public Phones and Essentis and a $17 million impairment charge relating to goodwill and intangible assets associated with the Essentis business.

The assets and liabilities of the Public Phones, Essentis and Global Tel*Link businesses which were subsequently eliminated from the Schlumberger

Consolidated Balance Sheet

in the first quarter of 2005 were aggregated and presented on the

Consolidated Balance Sheet

at December 31, 2004 as

Assets held for sale

($65 million) and

Liabilities held for sale

($35
million).

An analysis of the Assets and Liabilities held for sale at December 31, 2004 is as follows:

The results of the following
businesses are reported as

Discontinued Operations

in the

Consolidated Statement of Income

. All gains and losses disclosed below are presented net of related income taxes, where applicable.


·

The sale of the SchlumbergerSema business was completed in January 2004. Schlumberger received €393 million after adjustments ($495 million) in cash and 19.3 million shares of
common stock of Atos Origin with a value of €1.02 billion ($1.27 billion), which represented approximately 29% of the outstanding common shares of Atos Origin after the transaction was completed. The results of SchlumbergerSema include, in the
first quarter of 2004, a gain of $26 million on the sale and in the second quarter of 2004, a credit of $15 million related to adjustments to several accruals. The net assets were approximately $2.2 billion, including $1.3 billion of goodwill.

On February 2, 2004, Schlumberger sold 9.6
million of the Atos Origin shares for a net consideration of €500 million ($625 million). As a result of this sale, Schlumberger’s investment was reduced to approximately 15% of the outstanding common shares of Atos Origin. The equity in
earnings representing Schlumberger’s interest in Atos Origin for the four days ending February 2, 2004 was not material. This investment was accounted for using the cost method as of February 2, 2004. On April 30, 2004 Schlumberger sold its
remaining holding of 9.7 million Atos Origin shares for consideration of €465 million ($551 million) net of expenses. The losses on the sales of the Atos Origin shares of $21 million are classified in

Interest and other income

Part II, Item 8

The following is a summary of the 2003 Charges & Credits:

5.    Acquisitions

On December 9, 2003, Schlumberger announced that it had signed an
agreement to acquire PetroAlliance Services Company Limited (“PetroAlliance Services”) over a 3-year period. Schlumberger acquired 26% of PetroAlliance Services in the second quarter of 2004 for $12 million in cash and 421,870 shares of
Schlumberger common stock valued at $24 million. During the second quarter of 2005, Schlumberger acquired an additional 25% of PetroAlliance Services for $40 million in cash and 1,150,323 shares of Schlumberger common stock valued at $79 million
bringing its total ownership interest to 51%.

Under the terms of the agreement, the remaining 49% interest is expected to be acquired in
the second quarter of 2006, subject to performance requirements and other customary conditions. The acquisition price will continue to be determined by a performance-based formula, and paid one-third in cash and two-thirds in Schlumberger stock.

Schlumberger began consolidating the results of PetroAlliance Services in the second quarter of 2005. This investment had previously been
accounted under the equity method.

The $119 million purchase price paid in the second quarter of 2005 has been allocated to the assets
acquired and the liabilities assumed according to their fair value at the date of the transaction as follows:

Approximately $106
million has been allocated to goodwill, which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired. This goodwill is not tax deductible. The amounts allocated to other intangible assets primarily relate to
customer relationships, which will be amortized on a straight line basis over a 12 year period.



Part II, Item 8

During 2005, Schlumberger made certain other acquisitions and minority
interest investments, none of which were significant on an individual basis, for $56 million in cash. Under the terms of one of the transactions, Schlumberger may acquire the remaining interest based upon a performance-based formula, payable in
Schlumberger common stock, subject to performance requirements, regulatory approval and other customary conditions.

During 2004,
Schlumberger made certain acquisitions, none of which were significant on an individual basis, for $31 million in cash.

Under the terms of
certain past acquisitions, Schlumberger has obligations to pay additional consideration if specific conditions are met. Schlumberger made payments of $21 million during 2005 and expects to make payments of approximately $56 million in the first
quarter of 2006 with respect to certain transactions that were consummated in prior years.

Pro forma results pertaining to the above
acquisitions are not presented as the impact was not significant.

6.    Investments in Affiliated Companies

Schlumberger and Smith International Inc. operate a drilling fluids joint venture of which Schlumberger owns a 40% interest and records income using the equity method of accounting. Schlumberger’s investment on December 31, 2005 and
2004 was $802 million and $716 million, respectively. Schlumberger’s equity income from this joint venture in 2005 was $84 million, $68 million in 2004 and $52 million in 2003. Schlumberger received cash distributions from the joint venture of
$28 million in 2005, $28 million in 2004 and $4 million in 2003.

The carrying value of this joint venture is evaluated for impairment
annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates that a decline in the fair value of this investment that is other than temporary has occurred. Fair value is generally estimated by comparing the significance of this joint
venture to Smith International Inc., a publicly traded company, and then referencing the market capitalization of Smith International Inc. To date, Schlumberger has not recorded any impairment charges relating to this investment as this analysis has
indicated that the fair value of this investment is significantly in excess of its carrying value.

7.    Securitization

A
wholly owned subsidiary of Schlumberger has an agreement to borrow up to $250 million and sell, on an ongoing basis, an undivided interest in its accounts receivable. The amount of receivables sold under this agreement totaled $470 million at
December 31, 2005 (of which $34 million was drawn) as compared to $367 million at December 31, 2004 (of which $236 million was drawn). The previous agreement was extended in September 2005 for a further twelve months. Schlumberger expects to
terminate this agreement in the first quarter of 2006. Schlumberger does not have any retained interest in the accounts receivable sold under this agreement.

SSA 5.875% Guaranteed Bonds due 2011. See Note 4

Charges and Credits

. The fair market value of the outstanding euro denominated bonds at December 31, 2005 was $633 million.

On June 9, 2003, Schlumberger Limited issued $850 million aggregate principal amount of 1.5% Series A Convertible Debentures due June 1, 2023
and $450 million aggregate principal amount of 2.125% Series B Convertible Debentures due June 1, 2023. On July 2, 2003, Schlumberger Limited issued an additional $125 million aggregate principal amount of the Series A debentures pursuant
to an option granted to the initial purchasers.

The debentures were sold to the initial purchasers pursuant to an exemption from
registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and were resold, with registration rights, by the initial purchasers in transactions exempt from registration under Rule 144A of the Securities Act. The aggregate offering price of
the debentures was $1.425 billion, the initial purchasers’ discount was $25.4 million and the net proceeds to Schlumberger Limited were $1.4 billion.

The Series A debentures and the Series B debentures are convertible, at the holders’ option, into shares of common stock of Schlumberger Limited. Holders of the Series A debentures may convert their debentures
into common stock at a conversion rate of 13.8255 shares for each $1,000 principal amount of Series A debentures (equivalent to an initial conversion price of $72.33 per share). Holders of the Series B debentures may convert their debentures into
common stock at a conversion rate of 12.5 shares for each $1,000 principal amount of Series B debentures (equivalent to an initial conversion price of $80.00 per share). Each conversion rate may be adjusted for certain events, but it will not be
adjusted for accrued interest.

On or after June 6, 2008 (in the case of the Series A debentures) or June 6, 2010 (in the case of
the Series B debentures), Schlumberger may redeem for cash all or part of the applicable series of debentures, upon notice to the holders, at the redemption prices of 100% of the principal amount of the debentures, plus accrued and unpaid interest
to the date of redemption. On June 1, 2008, June 1, 2013, and June 1, 2018, holders of Series A debentures may require Schlumberger to repurchase their Series A debentures. On June 1, 2010, June 1, 2013 and
June 1, 2018, holders of Series B debentures may require Schlumberger to repurchase their Series B debentures. The repurchase price will be 100% of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date.
The repurchase price for repurchases on June 1, 2008 (in the case of the Series A debentures) and June 1, 2010 (in the case of the Series B debentures) will be paid in cash. On the other repurchase dates, Schlumberger may choose to pay the
repurchase price in cash or common stock or any combination of cash and common stock. In addition, upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change (defined as a change in control or a termination of trading of Schlumberger’s common stock), holders
may require Schlumberger to repurchase all or a portion of their debentures, in cash or, at Schlumberger’s election, common stock valued at 99% of its market price or any combination of cash and common stock, at a repurchase price equal to 100%
of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The debentures will mature on June 1, 2023 unless earlier redeemed or repurchased. The fair market value of the Series A and Series B debentures
at December 31, 2005 was $1.3 billion and $584 million, respectively.

Commercial paper borrowings are classified as long-term debt to
the extent of their backup by available and unused committed facilities maturing in more than one-year and the intent to maintain these obligations for longer than one year.

Commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2005 and 2004 include notes issued in currencies other than the US dollar which were swapped
for US dollars on the date of issue until maturing.

Long-term debt on December 31, 2005, is due as follows $1.300 billion in 2008,
$103 million in 2009, $1.242 billion in 2010 and $946 million thereafter.



Part II, Item 8

On December 31, 2005, interest rate swap arrangements outstanding were
pay floating/receive fixed on US dollar debt of $93 million. These arrangements mature at various dates to December 2009. Interest rate swap arrangements decreased consolidated interest expense in 2005 by $3 million.

On December 31, 2005, wholly owned subsidiaries of Schlumberger had separate debt facility agreements aggregating $4.4 billion with commercial banks,
of which $3.6 billion was committed and $2.8 billion was available and unused. It included $2.5 billion of committed facilities which support commercial paper programs in the United States and Europe, and mature in April 2010. Interest rates and
other terms of borrowing under these lines of credit vary from country to country.

14.    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

Schlumberger uses derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps, currency swaps, forward currency contracts and foreign currency options.

Schlumberger maintains a foreign-currency risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to protect its interests from unanticipated
fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates. Forward currency contracts provide a hedge against currency fluctuations either on assets/liabilities denominated in other than a functional currency or on
expenses. Options are usually entered into as a hedge against currency variations on firm commitments generally involving the construction of long-lived assets. Schlumberger also maintains an interest rate risk management strategy that uses a mix of
variable- and fixed-rate debt together with interest rate swaps, where appropriate, to fix or lower borrowing costs.

Schlumberger does not
enter into foreign currency or interest rate derivatives for speculative purposes.

By using derivative financial instruments to hedge
exposure to changes in exchange rates and interest rates, Schlumberger exposes itself to credit risk. Schlumberger minimizes the credit risk by entering into transactions with high-quality counterparties, limiting the exposure to each counterparty
and monitoring the financial condition of its counterparties.

As a result of Schlumberger Technology Corporation paying off its commercial
paper program in the United States in the first quarter of 2004, $500 million United States interest-rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges became ineffective. Schlumberger recorded a pretax non-cash charge of $73 million ($46 million
after-tax) in March 2004 to recognize unrealized losses previously recorded in

Other Comprehensive Income

. See Note 4

Charges and Credits

. These interest rate swaps were settled in April 2004.

Currency exchange contracts are entered into as a hedge against the effect of future settlement of assets and liabilities denominated in other than the
functional currency of the individual businesses. Gains or losses on the contracts are recognized when the currency exchange rates fluctuate, and the resulting charge or credit partially offsets the unrealized currency gains or losses on those
assets and liabilities. On December 31, 2005, contracts were outstanding for the US dollar equivalent of $1.9 billion in various foreign currencies. These contracts mature on various dates in 2006.

At December 31, 2005, Schlumberger recognized a cumulative net $17 million loss in Stockholders’ Equity relating to derivative instruments and
hedging activities. This loss was primarily due to the revaluation of foreign currency forward contracts at December 31, 2005.

15.    Capital Stock

Schlumberger is authorized to issue 1,500,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share of which 588,802,109 and 588,501,663 shares were outstanding on
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Schlumberger is also authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of cumulative preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, which may be issued in series with terms and conditions determined by the Board of
Directors. No shares of preferred stock have been issued. Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share of stock held.

See Note 23

Subsequent Event

.



Part II, Item 8

16.    Stock Compensation Plans

Schlumberger has two types of stock-based compensation plans, which are described below.
Effective January 1, 2003, Schlumberger adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS Nos. 123 and 148. Schlumberger began recording stock option and discounted stock purchase plan (DSPP) expense in the

Consolidated Statement of
Income

in the third quarter of 2003 on a prospective basis for grants after January 1, 2003.

Schlumberger applies the intrinsic
value method of APB Opinion 25 for grants prior to January 1, 2003. Had compensation cost for stock-based awards granted prior to January 1, 2003 been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates, consistent with the method of
SFAS 123, Schlumberger net income and earnings per share would have been the pro forma amounts indicated below:

In December 2004, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 123R

(Share-Based Payment).

The standard amends SFAS 123 (

Accounting for Stock Based Compensation

) and concludes that services received from employees in exchange for stock-based
compensation results in a cost to the employer that must be recognized in the financial statements. The cost of such awards should be measured at fair value at the date of grant. SFAS 123R provides public companies with a choice of transition
methods to implement the standard. Schlumberger will apply the modified prospective method whereby compensation cost will be recognized for the unamortized portion of vested awards outstanding at January 1, 2006, the effective date of SFAS
123R, and granted after January 1, 1995. Such cost will be recognized in Schlumberger’s financial statements over the remaining vesting periods. As described above, in 2003 Schlumberger adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS
Nos. 123 and 148 on a prospective basis for grants after January 1, 2003. Therefore, effective January 1, 2006, Schlumberger will have to apply the provisions of SFAS 123R to the unvested portion of awards granted during the period of
January 1, 1995 to December 31, 2002; the adoption of this standard will result in Schlumberger recording additional stock-based compensation charges of approximately $20 million in 2006 and $5 million in 2007.



Part II, Item 8

Stock Option Plans

Officers and key employees are granted stock options under Schlumberger stock option plans. For all of the stock options granted, the
exercise price of each option equals the market price of Schlumberger stock on the date of grant; an option’s maximum term is generally ten years, and options generally vest in increments over four or five years. The gain on the awards granted
subsequent to January 2003 is capped at 125% of the exercise price. Schlumberger recorded stock-based compensation expense relating to stock options of $28 million, $13 million and $5 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

As required by SFAS 123, the fair value of each grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
weighted-average assumptions used for 2005, 2004 and 2003:

A summary of the
status of the Schlumberger stock option plans as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, and changes during the years ending on those dates is presented below:

Part II, Item 8

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Under the Schlumberger Discounted Stock Purchase Plan, Schlumberger is authorized to issue
up to 22,012,245 shares of common stock to its employees. Under the terms of the plan, employees can choose to have up to 10% of their annual earnings withheld to purchase Schlumberger common stock. Effective July 1, 2003 the purchase price of
the stock was 92.5% of the lower of its beginning or end of the plan year market price at six month intervals. Prior to July 1, 2003, the purchase price was 85% at one year intervals. Under the Plan, Schlumberger sold 1,308,749, 1,654,879 and
2,464,088 shares to employees in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Schlumberger recorded stock-based compensation expense relating to the DSPP of $12 million, $13 million and $8 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The fair value of the
employees’ purchase rights was estimated using the Black-Scholes model with the following assumptions and resulting weighted average fair value per share:

17.    Income Tax Expense

Schlumberger and its subsidiaries operate in more than 100 taxing
jurisdictions where statutory tax rates generally vary from 0% to 50%.

As more fully described in Note 4

Charges and Credits

,
Schlumberger reported net pretax credits in continuing operations in 2005 of $172 million ($19 million of net credits in the United States; $153 million of credits outside the United States), and net pretax charges of $243 million ($119 million of
net charges in the United States; $124 million of net charges outside of the United States) and $638 million ($316 million of net charges in the United States; $323 million of net charges outside of the United States) in 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Pretax book income from continuing operations subject to United States and non-United States income taxes for each of the three years ended
December 31, was a follows:

The components of net
deferred tax assets were as follows:

The deferred tax
assets relating to net operating losses at December 31, 2005 and 2004 are net of valuation allowances in certain countries of $213 million and $303 million, respectively.

As described in Note 4, Schlumberger sold its facility in Montrouge, France during 2005. This transaction allowed for the utilization of a $57 million
deferred tax asset relating to certain net operating losses that were previously offset by a valuation allowance. The remaining decrease in the valuation allowance from 2004 to 2005 is primarily due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.



Part II, Item 8

The United States and Canadian operations of the WesternGeco joint venture
are structured as limited liability companies (LLC) and are treated as partnerships for income tax purposes. The net income of the WesternGeco business segment, as presented in Note 21

Segment Information

, reflects tax expense as if the LLC
was subject to income taxes as this is how management evaluates the results of this segment. However, the tax expense on the

Consolidated Statement of Income

only includes Schlumberger’s share of the tax expense associated with the LLC.

Minority Interest

on the

Consolidated Statement of Income

primarily represents the minority partner’s share of the pretax results of the LLCs as well as their share of the after-tax results of the non-United States and Canadian
operations of the venture.

The components of consolidated income tax expense from continuing operations were as follows:

A reconciliation of
the United States statutory federal tax rate (35%) to the consolidated effective tax rate is:

The Charges and
Credits described in Note 4

Charges and Credits

lowered Schlumberger’s effective tax rate by two percentage points in 2005 and increased the effective tax rate by twenty-one percentage points in 2003. Charges and credits did not have a
significant impact on the effective tax rate in 2004.

18.    Leases and Lease Commitments

Total
rental expense relating to continuing operations was $532 million in 2005, $464 million in 2004 and $345 million in 2003. Future minimum rental commitments under noncancelable leases for each of the next five years are as follows:



Part II, Item 8

19.    Contingencies

The

Consolidated Balance Sheet

includes accruals for the estimated future costs
associated with certain environmental remediation activities related to the past use or disposal of hazardous materials where it is probable that Schlumberger has incurred a liability and such amount can be reasonably estimated. Substantially all
such costs relate to divested operations and to facilities or locations that are no longer in operation. Due to a number of uncertainties, including uncertainty of timing, the scope of remediation, future technology, regulatory changes, natural
resource or property damage claims and other factors, it is possible that the ultimate remediation costs may exceed the amounts estimated. However, in the opinion of management, any such additional costs are not expected to be material relative to
consolidated liquidity, financial position or future results of operations.

The

Consolidated Balance Sheet

included accruals for
estimated future expenditures, relating to potential contractual obligations, associated with business divestitures which have been completed. It is possible that the ultimate expenditures may differ from the amounts recorded. In the opinion of
management, such differences are not expected to be material relative to consolidated liquidity, financial position or future results of operations.

In December 2004 WesternGeco and Schlumberger received grand jury subpoenas from the United States Attorney’s office in the Southern District of Texas seeking documents relating to possible fraud in obtaining visas for non-United
States citizens working as crewmembers on vessels operating in the Gulf of Mexico. We are in the process of responding to the investigation, including providing information sought by the subpoenas. Schlumberger is unable to determine the outcome of
this matter and the related impact it might have on Schlumberger’s financial condition and results of operations.

In addition,
Schlumberger and its subsidiaries are party to various other legal proceedings. A liability is accrued when a loss is both probable and can be reasonably estimable. At this time the ultimate disposition of these proceedings is not presently
determinable and therefore, it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or range of possible losses that might result from an adverse judgment or settlement in these matters. However, in the opinion of Schlumberger any liability that might
ensue would not be material in relation to the consolidated liquidity, financial position or future results of operations.

Schlumberger’s joint venture agreements with Baker Hughes, with respect to WesternGeco, and Smith International, Inc., with respect to the drilling fluids joint venture, both contain provisions under which either party to the
respective joint ventures may offer to sell their entire interest in the venture to the other party at a cash purchase price per percentage interest specified in an offer notice. If the offer to sell is not accepted, the offering party will be
obligated to purchase the entire interest of the other party at the same price per percentage interest as the prices specified in the offer notice.

In the normal course of business, Schlumberger is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations are not material in relation to the consolidated liquidity, financial position or
future results of operations.

20.    Segment Information

Schlumberger operates two business segments: Oilfield Services (OFS) and
WesternGeco.

The Oilfield Services segment falls into four clearly defined economic and geographical areas and is evaluated on the
following basis: North America is a major self-contained market; Latin America comprises regional markets that share a common dependence on the United States; Europe is a major self-contained market that includes the CIS and West Africa, whose
economy is increasingly linked to that of Europe; Middle East & Asia includes the remainder of the Eastern Hemisphere, which consists of many countries at different stages of economic development that share a common dependence on the oil
and gas industry. The Oilfield Services segment provides virtually all exploration and production services required during the life of an oil and gas reservoir. Schlumberger believes that all the products/services are interrelated and expects
similar performance from each.



Part II, Item 8

The WesternGeco segment provides comprehensive worldwide reservoir imaging,
monitoring, and development services, with extensive seismic crews and data processing centers, as well as a large multiclient seismic library. Services range from 3D and time-lapse (4D) seismic surveys to multi-component surveys for
delineating prospects and reservoir management. WesternGeco is 70% owned by Schlumberger and 30% owned by Baker Hughes.

Financial
information for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, by segment, is as follows:



Part II, Item 8

Oilfield Services net
income eliminations include certain headquarters administrative costs which are not allocated geographically, manufacturing and certain other operations, and costs maintained at the Oilfield Services level.

Corporate income eliminations principally comprise the amortization of other intangibles, as well as nonoperating expenses, such as certain intersegment
charges, amortization of certain intangible assets, interest on postretirement benefits, stock-based compensation costs and interest expense (except as shown above), which are not included in the segments’ income. Corporate assets largely
comprise short-term investments and fixed income investments, held to maturity.

During the three years ended December 31, 2005, no single
customer exceeded 10% of consolidated revenue.

Schlumberger did not have revenue from third-party customers in its country of domicile
during the last three years. In each of the last three years, only revenue in the United States exceeded 10% of consolidated revenue. Revenue in the United States in 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $3.6 billion, $3.0 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively.

Interest expense excludes amounts which are included in the segments’ income (2005 – $10 million: 2004 –$8 million:
2003 – $5 million).

Depreciation & Amortization and Capital Expenditure include Multiclient seismic data costs.



Part II, Item 8

21.    Pension and Other Benefit Plans

United States Defined Benefit Pension Plans

Schlumberger and its United States subsidiary sponsor several defined benefit pension plans
that cover substantially all employees hired prior to October 1, 2004. The benefits are based on years of service and compensation on a career-average pay basis. These plans are funded through a trust in respect to past and current service.
Charges to expense are based upon costs computed by independent actuaries. The funding policy is to annually contribute amounts that are based upon a number of factors including the actuarial accrued liability and amounts that are allowable for
income tax purposes. These contributions are intended to provide for benefits earned to date and those expected to be earned in the future. Schlumberger’s contribution during 2005 was $172 million. The contribution in 2006 is expected to be
between $200 million and $250 million.

Schlumberger uses a December 31 measurement date to calculate its end of year benefit
obligations, fair value of plan assets and annual net periodic benefit cost.

The assumed discount rate, compensation increases and return
on plan assets used to determine pension expense were as follows:

Net pension cost in
the United States for 2005, 2004 and 2003, included the following components:



Part II, Item 8

The changes in the projected benefit obligation, plan assets and funded
status of the plans on December 31, 2005 and 2004, were as follows:

In instances in which
plan assets are less than the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO), a minimum liability equal to this difference must be recognized, partially offset by an intangible asset for unrecognized prior service cost, with the remainder charged to equity,
net of tax. In addition, any prepaid pension asset in excess of unrecognized prior service cost must be reversed through a net-of-tax charge to equity. The ABO represents the actuarial present value of benefits based on employee service and
compensation as of a certain date and does not include an assumption about future compensation levels. Changes in the amount of the unfunded ABO result from factors such as a change in the interest rate used to discount the ABO to its present
settlement amount, contributions to the pension plan and the investment return generated by pension plan assets.

Schlumberger recorded a
non-cash pretax charge to

Stockholders’ Equity

of $67 million ($42 million after-tax) in 2005 to reflect this minimum liability referred to above. At December 31, 2005, the cumulative non-cash pretax charge recorded in

Stockholders’ Equity

was $324 million ($201 million after-tax). The charge to

Stockholders’ Equity

represents a net loss not yet recognized as pension expense.

The assumed discount rate, the rate of compensation increases and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used to determine the projected
benefit obligations were as follows:

On December 31,
2005, there is no investment of the plan assets in Schlumberger common stock.



Part II, Item 8

The following is a breakdown of the plan assets:

The asset allocation
objectives are to diversify the portfolio among several asset classes to reduce volatility while maintaining an asset mix that provide the highest expected rate of return consistent with an acceptable level of risk. The investment strategies include
a rebalancing of the asset mix as necessary to the previously defined levels and reassessing funding levels and asset allocation strategy at least annually. In order to increase diversification and limit management risk, Schlumberger generally does
not allocate more than 15% of fund assets to a single investment manager.

The expected long-term rate of return on assets is 8.5%. This
assumption represents the rate of return on plan assets reflecting the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. The assumption has been
determined by reflecting expectations regarding future rates of return for the portfolio considering the asset distribution and related historical rates of return. The appropriateness of the assumption is reviewed at least annually. The pension
trust’s performance over the last 10 years has been an annualized return of 8.8%.

The expected benefits to be paid under the plan are
as follows:

Other Defined Benefit Pension Plans

In addition to the previously disclosed United States defined benefit
pension plans, Schlumberger sponsors several other defined benefit pension plans. Charges to expense for these plans were $62 million, $33 million and $28 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and are based upon costs computed by actuaries.
These plans are funded through trusts in respect to past and current service.

Based on plan assets and the projected benefit obligation,
the only significant defined benefit plan is in the UK, which covers employees hired prior to April 1, 1999.

Schlumberger uses a
December 31 measurement date to calculate its end of year benefits obligations, fair value of plan assets and annual net periodic benefit cost of the UK defined benefit plan.

The assumed discount rate, compensation increases and return on plan assets used to determine pension expense were as follows:



Part II, Item 8

Net pension cost in the UK plan for 2005, 2004 and 2003 (translated into US
dollars at the average exchange rate for the periods), included the following components:

The changes in the
projected benefit obligation, plan assets and funded status of the plan (translated into US dollars at year-end exchange rates) were as follows:

Schlumberger recorded
a non-cash pretax credit to

Stockholders’ Equity

of $4 million ($2 million after-tax) in 2005 to reflect the minimum liability referred to above. At December 31, 2005, the cumulative non-cash pretax charge recorded in

Stockholders’ Equity

was $105 million ($74 million after-tax). See page 64 for a description of how this charge is calculated.



Part II, Item 8

The assumed discount rate and rate of compensation increases used to
determine the projected benefit obligation were as follows:

The following is a
breakdown of the plan assets:

The trustees of the
UK plan determine their investment strategy with regard to the liability profile of the fund on an individual basis and have determined benchmarks which they believe provide an adequate balance between maximizing the return on the assets and
minimizing the risk of failing to meet the liabilities over the long-term.

Overall, the trustees of the plan aim to have a sufficiently
diversified portfolio of appropriate liquidity, which will generate income and capital growth to meet, together with new contributions from members and the employers, the cost of current and future liabilities which the plan provides. They achieve
this by using active investment managers who are set specific benchmarks and various restrictions to avoid undue concentration of assets. As the plan matures, the Trustees review the appropriateness of their investment strategy.

The overall expected return on assets assumption is derived as the weighted average of the expected returns from each of the main asset classes. The
expected return for each asset class reflects a combination of historical performance analysis, the forward looking views of the financial markets (as suggested by the yields available) and the views of investment organizations. Consideration is
also given to the rate of return expected to be available for reinvestment. The pension trusts’ performance over the last 10 years has been an annualized return of 6.4%; over the last 15 years it is an annualized return of 10.0%.

The expected benefits to be paid under the plan are as follows:

Contributions to the
UK plan in 2006 are expected to be between $30 million and $50 million.

Other
Deferred Benefits

In addition to providing defined pension benefits,
Schlumberger and its subsidiaries have other deferred benefit programs, primarily profit sharing and defined contribution pension plans. Expenses for these programs were $273 million, $211 million and $174 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.



Part II, Item 8

Health Care Benefits

Schlumberger and its United States subsidiary provide health care benefits for certain active employees. The costs of providing these
benefits are expensed when incurred, and aggregated $65 million, $68 million and $70 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Outside the United States, such benefits are mostly provided through government-sponsored programs.

Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions

Schlumberger and its United States subsidiary provide certain health care benefits to former
employees who have retired under the United States pension plans.

On May 19, 2004, FASB Staff Position No. 106-2
(“FSP”) was issued by FASB to provide guidance relating to the prescription drug subsidy provided by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Act”). Schlumberger currently provides
postretirement benefits to former employees who have retired under the United States pension plans. For these former employees, the prescription drug benefit provided by Schlumberger would be considered to be actuarially equivalent to the benefit
provided under the Act. As permitted by the FSP, Schlumberger prospectively adopted the provisions of the FSP effective July 1, 2004. This resulted in a reduction in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (“APBO”) for the
subsidy of approximately $82 million. The subsidy resulted in a reduction in net periodic postretirement costs of approximately $12 million (pretax), of which $6 million was recorded during the third quarter of 2004 with the remaining portion being
recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004. The components of this approximate $12 million in pretax savings are a reduction in interest costs on APBO of $5 million, a reduction of amortization of net loss of $4 million and a reduction in current period
service costs of $3 million.

Schlumberger uses a December 31 measurement date to calculate its end of year benefit obligations and
annual net periodic benefit cost.

The principal actuarial assumptions used to measure costs were a discount rate of 6.00% in 2005, 6.25% in
2004 and 6.75% in 2003. The overall medical cost trend rate assumption is 10% graded to 6% over the next six years and 5% thereafter.

Net
periodic postretirement benefit cost in the United States for 2005, 2004 and 2003, included the following components:

The change in
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and funded status on December 31, 2005 and 2004, was as follows:



Part II, Item 8

In 2004, amendments to the plan were enacted whereby Schlumberger is no
longer required to accrue for postretirement benefit obligations until employees attain the age of 40; at this time employees are now required to make an election to either participate and contribute to the plan, or not participate in the plan.
Under the previous terms of the plan, Schlumberger was required to accrue for postretirement benefit obligations from the date of employment regardless of the employee’s age.

In 2005, amendments to the plan were enacted whereby the retiree cost sharing was increased effective in 2006.

To date this plan has been unfunded. However, Schlumberger currently expects to make a contribution to this plan in 2006 of between $30 million and $40
million.

The components of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation on December 31, 2005 and 2004, were as follows:

The assumed discount
rate used to determine the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 5.75% for 2005 and 6.00% for 2004.

If the assumed medical cost
trend rate was increased by one percentage point, health care cost in 2005 would have been $85 million, and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation would have been $911 million on December 31, 2005.

If the assumed medical cost trend rate was decreased by one percentage point, health care cost in 2005 would have been $59 million, and the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation would have been $681 million on December 31, 2005.

The expected payments to be paid under the plan
are as follows and are net of the annual Medicare Part D subsidy which ranges from $3 million to $6 million per year:

23.    Subsequent Event

On January 19, 2006, Schlumberger announced that the Board of Directors had approved a
two-for-one stock split. Each stockholder of record at the close of business on March 1, 2006 will receive one additional share for every outstanding share held on the record date with a payment date on April 7, 2006. The total number of
authorized common stock shares and associated par value was unchanged by this action. Additionally, Schlumberger’s income retained for use in the business will not be affected. The stock split will require retroactive restatement of all
historical per share data in the first quarter ending March 30, 2006. All references to the number of shares outstanding in these

Consolidated Financial Statements

are presented on a pre-split basis.

Schlumberger’s historical earnings per share on a proforma basis, assuming the stock split had occurred as of January 1, 2003, would be as
follows (unaudited):

Part II, Item 8

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of Schlumberger Limited is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a – 15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Schlumberger Limited’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Schlumberger Limited management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005.
In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

. Based on our assessment we have concluded that, as of
December 31, 2005, the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

Schlumberger
Limited’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report
which appears on pages 73 and 74 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



Part II, Item 8

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders

of Schlumberger Limited

We have completed integrated audits of Schlumberger Limited’s 2005 and 2004 consolidated
financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, and an audit of its 2003 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated
financial statements

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet and the related consolidated statements of income, of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Schlumberger Limited and its subsidiaries at December 31,
2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of
financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Internal control over financial reporting

Also,
in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing on page 72 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, that the Company maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinions.



Part II, Item 8

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Item 9A    Controls and Procedures

Schlumberger has carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of Schlumberger’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer (‘CEO”) and the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of Schlumberger’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon Schlumberger’s evaluation, the CEO and the CFO have concluded that, as of December 31, 2005, the disclosure controls and
procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports Schlumberger files and submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.

There has been no change in Schlumberger’s internal
control over financial reporting during Schlumberger’s quarter ended December 31, 2005 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Schlumberger’s internal control over financial reporting.
