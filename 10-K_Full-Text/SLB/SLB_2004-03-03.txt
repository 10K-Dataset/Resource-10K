Part 1, Item 1

PART I

Item 1    Business

All
references herein to “Registrant”, “Company” and “Schlumberger” refer to Schlumberger Limited and its consolidated subsidiaries. The following discussion of results should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Founded in 1927, Schlumberger is a global oilfield and information services company with major activity in the energy
industry. As of December 31, 2003, the company employed 77,000 people, which included 25,000 employees of SchlumbergerSema, of more than 140 nationalities working in 100 countries, and has principal executive offices in New York, Paris and The
Hague. During 2003, Schlumberger comprised three primary business segments: Schlumberger Oilfield Services is the world’s premier oilfield services company supplying a wide range of technology services and solutions to the international oil and
gas industry. WesternGeco, jointly owned with Baker Hughes, is one of the world’s largest and most advanced surface seismic company. SchlumbergerSema is a leading supplier of IT consulting, systems integration, and network and infrastructure
services to the energy industry, as well as to the public sector, telecommunications and finance markets.

On September 22, 2003,
Schlumberger announced its intention to sell the SchlumbergerSema business to Atos Origin. The sale closed on January 29, 2004. Today, Schlumberger comprises two primary business segments – Oilfield Services and WesternGeco.

Active divestiture negotiations are currently ongoing for each of the remaining businesses, which are included in Other activities described below.

Schlumberger Oilfield Services

is the world’s leading provider of
technology, project management and information solutions to the international petroleum industry. With 48,000 employees, Schlumberger Oilfield Services manages its business through 27 Oilfield Services GeoMarket* regions, which are grouped into four
geographic areas: North America; Latin America; Europe/CIS/W. Africa; Middle East & Asia. The GeoMarket regions offer customers a single point of contact at the local level for field operations and bring together geographically focused teams to
meet local needs and deliver customized solutions.

Schlumberger invented wireline logging in 1927 as a technique for obtaining downhole
data in oil and gas wells. Today, Schlumberger Oilfield Services operates in each of the major oilfield service markets covering the entire life cycle of the reservoir. These services are organized into seven technology product lines, in which
Schlumberger holds a number of market leading positions, to capitalize on technical synergies and introduce innovative solutions within the GeoMarket regions.

·

Wireline – services that provide the information necessary to evaluate the formation, plan and monitor well construction, and monitor and evaluate production, divided into
open-hole and cased-hole wireline logging.

·

Drilling & Measurements – directional drilling, measurements-while-drilling and logging-while-drilling services.

·

Well Services – services to construct oil and gas wells, as well as maintain optimal production through the life of an oil and gas field. These include pressure pumping, well
stimulation services, coiled tubing, cementing and engineering services.

·

Well Completions & Productivity – services for testing and completing wells and producing oil and gas, ranging from well testing and perforating services, completions
systems, intelligent completions to a full spectrum of artificial lift services.

·

Integrated Project Management – consulting, project management and engineering services leveraging the expertise from the other technology segments for the E&P industry.

3  /  SLB

2003 FORM 10-K


Part 1, Item 1

·

Data & Consulting Services – measurements, interpretation and integration of all exploration and production data types, and expert consulting services for reservoir
characterization, production enhancement, multi-disciplinary reservoir and production solutions, and field development planning.

·

Schlumberger Information Solutions – consulting, software, information management and IT infrastructure services that support oil and gas industry core operational processes.

The technology product lines are also
responsible for overseeing operational processes, resource allocation, personnel and quality, health, safety and environmental matters in the GeoMarket.

Supporting the service technology product lines are 19 research and development (R&D) centers. Through its R&D, Schlumberger is committed to advanced technology programs that will enhance oilfield efficiency,
lower finding and producing costs, improve productivity, maximize reserve recovery, increase asset value and accomplish all of these goals in a safe, environmentally sound manner.

Schlumberger Oilfield Services uses its own personnel to market its products and services. The customer base, business risks and opportunities for growth
are essentially uniform across all services. There is a sharing of manufacturing and engineering facilities as well as research centers; labor force is interchangeable. Technological innovation, quality of service, and price are the principal
methods of competition. Competition varies geographically with respect to the different services offered. While there are numerous competitors, both large and small, Schlumberger believes that it is an industry leader in providing
measurements-while-drilling and logging-while-drilling services, and fully computerized logging and geoscience software and computing services. A large proportion of the company’s offering is non-rig related; consequently, revenue does not
necessarily correlate to rig count fluctuations.

In December 2003, Schlumberger announced a phased agreement to acquire PetroAlliance,
Russia’s largest independent oilfield services company, beginning with a minority share in 2004. PetroAlliance provides a broad range of exploration and development services, to international standards, throughout Russia and the Caspian.

Schlumberger is a minority owner in M-I Drilling Fluids, a joint venture with Smith International that offers drilling and completion
fluids utilized to stabilize rock strata during the drilling process and minimize formation damage during completion and workover operations.

WesternGeco

, which is 70% owned by Schlumberger, provides comprehensive worldwide reservoir imaging, monitoring, and development seismic services, with the most
extensive seismic crews and data processing centers in the industry, as well as the world’s largest multiclient seismic library. Services range from 3D and time-lapse (4D) seismic surveys to multi-component surveys for delineating prospects and
reservoir management. Seismic solutions include proprietary Q* technology for enhanced reservoir description, characterization, and monitoring throughout the life of the field – from exploration through enhanced recovery.

Positioned for meeting a full range of customer needs in land, marine and shallow-water transition-zone services, WesternGeco offers a wide range of
technologies and services:

·

Land Seismic – comprehensive resources for seismic data acquisition on land and across shallow-water transition zones.

·

Marine Seismic – fully calibrated single-sensor marine seismic acquisition and processing system, delivering the seismic technology breakthrough needed for new-generation
reservoir management.

·

Multiclient Services – high-quality seismic data from the most prospective hydrocarbon basins with the leading multiclient data library.

·

Reservoir Services – people, tools, and technology to help customers capture the benefits of a completely integrated approach to locating, defining, and monitoring the
reservoir.

·

Seismic Data Processing – extensive seismic data processing centers for complex processing projects.

Part 1, Item 1

Patents

While Schlumberger seeks and holds numerous patents, no particular patent or group of patents is considered material to Schlumberger’s
business.

Seasonality

Although weather and natural phenomena can temporarily affect delivery of oilfield services,
the widespread geographic location of such services precludes the overall business from being characterized as seasonal. However, because oilfield services are provided predominantly in the Northern Hemisphere, severe weather can temporarily affect
the delivery of such services and products.

Customers and Backlog of Orders

No single customer exceeded 10% of consolidated revenue. Oilfield
Services has no backlog since it is primarily service rather than product related. SchlumbergerSema backlog at December 31, 2003 was $5.2 billion of which $1.9 billion is the subsequent twelve month backlog. At December 31, 2002, the
SchlumbergerSema backlog was $4.7 billion of which $1.5 billion was the subsequent twelve month backlog. The orders are believed to be firm but there is no assurance that any of the current backlog will actually result in sales.

Government Contracts

No material portion of Schlumberger’s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts by the US or other
governments.

Employees

As of December 31, 2003, Schlumberger had approximately 77,000 employees which included
25,000 SchlumbergerSema employees.

Non-US Operations

Schlumberger’s non-US operations are subject to the usual risks which may affect such
operations. Such risks include unsettled political conditions in certain areas, exposure to possible expropriation or other governmental actions, exchange controls, and currency fluctuations. Although it is impossible to predict such occurrences or
their effect on Schlumberger, management believes these risks are acceptable.

Environmental Protection

Compliance with governmental
provisions relating to the protection of the environment does not materially affect Schlumberger’s capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Management believes that Schlumberger is currently in substantial compliance with
applicable environmental laws and regulations. For more information, see

Environmental Matters

Item 7    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

2003 Summary

The year 2003 marked a watershed for Schlumberger as we took the decision to focus on our core businesses in oilfield services. Our reasoning was simple. World energy needs for much of the next half-century will be
met mostly by carbon-based fuels produced from an aging reserves base. Substantial investment will be needed to sustain today’s production as well as to meet tomorrow’s demand, and technology will be the key to a cleaner, more
cost-effective response to this challenge. We therefore believe the future for Schlumberger is exceptionally bright.

The year’s
results for Oilfield Services were robust, with growth in all regions. Among the GeoMarket regions, activity was strongest in Mexico, Indonesia, India, the Caspian, and on land in the United States. Most technology segments registered double-digit
gains, with records achieved by Drilling & Measurements and Data & Consulting Services. Much of the technology that saw increasing market penetration was associated with boosting performance in mature fields, or “brownfields”, to
stem declining production. Rotary steerable systems to accurately place well trajectories to tap bypassed hydrocarbon pockets and a range of cased-hole wireline evaluation tools to analyze such zones were two particular successes.

A number of technical and business highlights marked the year. Integrated Project Management (IPM) continued to grow, particularly in Mexico, where our
history of successful projects led to the award of the Chicontepec contract, the most significant oil development project in Mexico in the last 20 years. In Malaysia, we signed a contract with PETRONAS Carigali Sdn. Bhd. to jointly redevelop the
Bokor field that began production in the 1980s. This field, comprising more than 165 stacked sands and over 100 producing strings, has been modeled using the latest techniques and the redevelopment plan involves multiple technology segments. Such
projects underline the value of our unique GeoMarket organization.

In December we announced a phased agreement to acquire PetroAlliance,
Russia’s largest independent oilfield service company, beginning with a minority share in 2004. PetroAlliance was formed in 1995 to provide a broad range of exploration and development services to international standards. The size and scope of
activity in Russia is huge, and this type of investment will benefit Schlumberger and the Russian oil industry as that industry seeks access to technology to be applied to its particular needs for continued growth.

Perhaps the most difficult challenge we set for ourselves early in 2003 was to return WesternGeco to sustainable profitability. Continued overcapacity in
both the land and marine and multiclient data markets made this a daunting task. Our approach has been threefold: to bring capacity and cost down to appropriate levels, to reflect a proper carrying value for the data library, and to continue the
aggressive introduction of proprietary Q* technology, for which the market has continued to grow rapidly.

Last summer we acquired the first
marine time-lapse Q survey for Statoil, 200 km from the western coast of Norway. Twenty-one months had elapsed between the two surveys. Initial results, produced only 11 days after acquisition, enabled Statoil to revise plans for a new well and
drill a shallower trajectory to remain clear of the oil/water contact. The well was a success and is producing without making water. The reliability and extremely high repeatability of Q-Marine* technology were considered critical to achieving this
result. In other applications, a Q system was commissioned in the Middle East late in the year and Q-Seabed* underwent highly successful trials in both the North Sea and Middle East.

In defining the business activities sold with SchlumbergerSema, we maintained our commitment to the growing activity in oil and gas IT solutions. The
natural fusion of the Schlumberger software and information management activities with the SchlumbergerSema oil & gas consulting and network infrastructure businesses began in October, and by year-end business managers were in place throughout
the GeoMarket organization. We have chosen to retain the Schlumberger Information Solutions name for the enlarged business, and our objective is to help customers extract more value from their core operational processes through leveraging the
combination of our domain knowledge in IT and in exploration and production (E&P).

Part II, Item 7

Early in 2003 we stated clear financial goals. By year-end we had made solid
progress. Return on capital employed had risen to 12.8% in the fourth quarter, double the corresponding figure in 2002 and well in line with our intention to reach the mid-teens longer term. After-tax return on sales for Oilfield Services reached
14.2% in the same quarter—a level much more consistent with our performance in previous cycles. Net debt fell to $4.2 billion, just shy of our $4 billion target as a result of adverse currency movements. For more information regarding the
purposes for which we use net debt, see page 29 of this Report.

In January 2004, we concluded the sale of the major part of
SchlumbergerSema to Atos Origin and reduced our holding in that company to 14.5%. Total cash proceeds from the cash and stock sale amounted to $1.1 billion. With conclusion of the sale of the North American electricity meter business and the sales
of the Business Continuity, Infodata, and Telecom software products businesses we expect to see net debt below the $3 billion level by the middle of 2004. Beyond that point, the only significant divestiture remaining will be the IPO of Axalto, the
Schlumberger smart card business, as and when market conditions permit.

In 2003, Schlumberger operated four business segments: Oilfield
Services, WesternGeco, SchlumbergerSema and Other. The following discussion and analysis of results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements.


Pretax segment income represents income before taxes and minority interest, excluding interest income, interest expense and amortization of intangibles.


2003 excludes: a net charge of $49 million for the write-down of an investment and the gain on the sale of a note; $167 million of debt extinguishment costs; a charge of $421
million for impairment and other charges/credits. 2002 excludes an aggregate $30 million charge related to the financial/economic crisis in Argentina.


2003 excludes impairment charges of $398 million for Multiclient library and $54 million for vessels. 2002 excludes an impairment charge of $184 million for Multiclient library and
charges of $117 million for severance and other costs.


Principally comprises the Axalto (Smart Cards and Point-of-Sale Terminals) and Electricity Meters activities. Also included are the Business Continuity, Infodata, Telecom Software
Products, Water Services, Essentis and Payphones activities.

Oilfield Services

World oil demand surged in 2003 due
to strong economic growth in North America and China. The increase in demand from these areas accounted for almost two thirds of overall world oil demand growth. The rise in world oil production more than matched demand growth. Non-OPEC oil
production accounted for one third of the increase, due to expanding production in the CIS. OPEC output increased despite supply disruptions in Venezuela and Nigeria and the loss of Iraqi production during and after the war. Oil prices remained high
throughout the year, with an average Western Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price almost 20% higher than in 2002.

14  /  SLB

2003 FORM 10-K


Part II, Item 7

In 2004, the rate of global oil demand growth is expected to be similar to
2003, with oil demand projected to grow strongly in developing countries and ease in OECD countries. Non-OPEC oil production is forecast to grow at roughly similar levels to 2003 although there is more uncertainty over the level of supply in the CIS
and the US. OPEC production is likely to be adjusted to maintain the price of the OPEC basket of crude in the stated target price range of $22 to $28 per barrel.

North American gas demand in 2003 showed little change compared to 2002, and is not expected to vary much in 2004. However, maintaining gas supply to meet demand is challenging, as production decline rates are already
high and expected to increase further. The average annual US natural gas price in 2003 rose considerably compared to last year and has stimulated growth in the number of active drilling rigs in North America.

Relatively high commodity prices in 2003 and increases in production have resulted in high levels of cash generation in the oil and gas industry, and a
subsequent increase in the average number of active drilling rigs. Assuming demand remains strong and that OPEC manages to maintain oil prices in its target range, exploration and production (E&P) spending is expected to increase in 2004.

2003 Results

Revenue of $8.8 billion increased 8% in 2003 versus 2002 led by North America with an increase of 14%, followed by Latin America and Middle
East & Asia, which both increased 9%, and Europe/CIS/W. Africa, which was up 4%. Pretax operating income of $1.54 billion in 2003 was 20% higher than in 2002, primarily due to strong customer demand resulting from increased E&P expenditures
and customer acceptance of new technologies, such as PowerDrive* rotary steerable systems, LiteCRETE* coalbed methane slurry system, ABC*Analysis Behind Casing suite of services, Viscoelastic Diverting Acid (VDA*) advanced acidizing system, and
ClearFRAC* polymer-free fracturing fluid. Overhead cost savings of $67 million generated from restructuring and downsizing efforts, principally in Europe/CIS/W. Africa and North & South America, also contributed to the increased profitability
during the year.

Oilfield Services began the year with relatively flat revenue in the first quarter, then achieved modest, but continuous
growth over the following three quarters due to new contracts, the introduction of new technologies, and increased demand for Integrated Project Management and Schlumberger Information Solutions (SIS) services. The results were positively impacted
by an upturn in natural gas drilling in North America, and increased activity in Mexico, Russia and the Middle East, partially offset by a nationwide strike in Venezuela and ethnic unrest in Nigeria.

All technology product lines helped drive revenue growth. Well Services and Drilling & Measurements’ record levels of revenue contributed to more
than half of the increase in Oilfield Services revenue. Data & Consulting services drew the award of several contracts for reservoir modeling, field development planning, and production optimization. SIS experienced strong demand, particularly
in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Integrated Project Management (IPM) experienced high activity levels principally fueled by Latin America.

In December, Schlumberger announced a phased agreement to acquire PetroAlliance beginning with a minority share in 2004. PetroAlliance is Russia’s largest independent oilfield services company, and provides a broad range of exploration
and development services throughout Russia and the Caspian.

North America

North America revenue of $2.6 billion increased 14% versus 2002. The
growth in revenue was mainly due to increased activity in US Land, as well as Canada, which had a 31% increase in revenue to $410 million. Both markets were driven by strong commodity prices, which, in turn, were caused by the record low gas storage
levels at the end of the 2003 drawdown season. This growth was not mirrored in the Gulf of Mexico where activity was essentially flat year-on-year. A combination of factors contributed to the sluggish performance

Part II, Item 7

offshore, including higher finding and developing cost on the shelf, lack of exploration
success in deepwater and unfavorable weather conditions hampering drilling and completion efficiency on a number of deepwater projects.

Pretax operating income of $365 million increased 33% over 2002 primarily due to a beneficial fall-through resulting from improved equipment utilization in US Land following asset rationalization and cost containment. Increased demand for
Drilling & Measurements, cased hole wireline and hydraulic fracturing solutions, related to increased complexity in developing new gas reserves in US Land, also contributed to profitability improvement.

Latin America

Latin America revenue of $1.4 billion increased 9% versus 2002 primarily due to substantial increases in Mexico, Brazil and Argentina,
partially offset by a significant decline in Venezuela. Large-scale project management contracts substantially accounted for the growth in activity in Mexico. Growth in Brazil was driven by a strong increase in Petrobras exploration activity, and
Argentina benefited from the high oil price.

The political turmoil in the early part of the year substantially impacted results in
Venezuela, however the focus on restoring production favorably drove the revenue in the latter half of the year. The increase in E&P spending in Mexico was driven by the compelling need to satisfy the domestic demand for natural gas, increase
the light oil production and ramp-up the oil production potential. Key contracts that contributed to revenue growth included project management of a four-year, $500 million integrated oilfield services project which represents the most significant
oil development project in Mexico in the last 20 years, and a two-year, $60 million information management solution.

Pretax operating
income of $221 million was up 31% year-on-year with all areas excluding Venezuela contributing to improved profitability. There were record levels of Integrated Project Management contracts in Mexico and positive fall-through on incremental revenue
in Argentina and Brazil.

Europe/CIS/West Africa

Revenue of $2.6 billion increased 4% over 2002, primarily in Russia due to growth in E&P
spending and continued expansion of the addressable market, which drove increased fracturing activity, high sales of artificial lift pumps, and the adoption of more advanced drilling technologies. CIS reached a record revenue level of $629 million,
22% higher than 2002. An increase in the number of E&P companies entering the development phase of deepwater projects in the West & South Africa GeoMarket during the second half of 2003, and an offshore gas project in the Mediterranean also
contributed to overall activity improvement in the Area, principally in Well Completions & Productivity and Well Services technologies. These results were partially offset by lower exploration activity by the major oil companies in the North Sea
and by production shutdowns in the Western Niger delta in Nigeria due to socio-political unrest.

Pretax operating income of $460 million
increased 20% over 2002 primarily due to cost savings generated at the beginning of the year, as well as increased activities in West & South Africa due to deepwater activities moving into a more lucrative development phase. This was partially
offset by appreciation of currencies against the US dollar negatively impacting the results by $4 million later in the year.

Middle East & Asia

Revenue of $2.1 billion increased 9% over 2002 with more than half the growth coming from Saudi Arabia/Kuwait, Egypt and Indonesia. Despite geopolitical uncertainty in the period leading up to the war in Iraq and
relative softness in Asia principally caused by the SARS outbreak, revenue showed marked improvement primarily due to higher demand for Drilling & Measurements, Wireline and Well Completion & Productivity technologies in Egypt, Saudi
Arabia/Kuwait and Indonesia partially offset by reduced activity in Malaysia/Brunei/Philippines due to the suspension of planned deepwater development work resulting from the

Part II, Item 7

deepwater acreage dispute between Malaysia and Brunei. Late in the year, strong year-on-year
improvements across the region were tempered by reduced rig activity in Saudi Arabia due to customers’ accelerated spending in the first three quarters.

Pretax operating income of $509 million increased 12%, primarily due to the operating leverage on increased revenue across most GeoMarkets, principally caused by increased activity in Indonesia’s East Kalimantan
and stimulation activity and artificial lift sales in East Africa.

2002 Results

Revenue for 2002 was $8.2 billion versus $8.4 billion in 2001 reflecting
reduced activity in North America and Latin America, which was partially mitigated by higher activity in Europe/CIS/W. Africa and the Middle East & Asia. Pretax operating income of $1.3 billion decreased 19% primarily from reduced margins
in Wireline and Well Services as activity declined in North America.

A sharp fall in revenue at the beginning of 2002 reflected declining
activity levels in North America, which remained depressed for the remainder of the year, together with political and economic uncertainty in Latin America. In the second and third quarters, robust activity in Europe/CIS/W. Africa, and signs of a
possible recovery in Asia, mitigated the effects of low North American drilling levels resulting in increased revenue. However, this trend was short-lived as slower activity outside North America due mainly to seasonal influences coupled with budget
cuts resulted in lower fourth quarter revenue. The Caspian, Russia and Mexico GeoMarkets posted the highest double-digit year-on-year revenue growth of 89%, 62% and 48%, respectively.

From a technology standpoint, the strongest performer was Well Completions & Productivity where acquisitions, testing, advanced completions systems
and artificial lift technology showed market share gains.

During the year, Schlumberger acquired A. Comeau & Associates Limited, a
leading provider of electrical engineering products and services for artificially lifted wells. This latest addition, combined with the successful integration of Sensa and Phoenix technologies into the Schlumberger Artificial Lift services
portfolio, contributed to higher sales in 2002, particularly in the Eastern Hemisphere. The Drilling & Measurements technology segment also recorded solid revenue growth fuelled largely by the continued penetration of the PowerDrive475*
rotary steerable system into new GeoMarkets.

Schlumberger made two further acquisitions during the year to bolster its real-time reservoir
management suite of services. In January, Schlumberger acquired Norwegian-based Inside Reality AS providing new 3D virtual reality systems that create a unique and powerful environment for interactive well planning and real-time geosteering
analysis. Schlumberger also acquired the software and services business of Technoguide AS, a leader in the reservoir modeling domain.

North America

Revenue of $2.3 billion decreased 19% versus 2001. A steep revenue decline at the outset of the year reflected a continued lackluster drilling environment and unseasonably mild weather conditions. Throughout the
remainder of the year activity levels remained depressed resulting in essentially flat revenue for 2002. Other factors contributing to reduced revenue included lower non-rig related activity resulting in lower Wireline, Well Services, and Well
Completions & Productivity revenue, the effects of the tropical storms in the third quarter and a slow pick-up in Canadian activity post spring break-up.

Pretax operating income of $274 million decreased from $637 million in 2001 due to pricing pressures across all services, particularly in Well Services and Well Completions & Productivity.

Latin America

Revenue of $1.3 billion decreased 9% versus 2001. Ongoing political and economic uncertainty in the region continued to affect business
conditions, particularly in Venezuela and Argentina. This particularly impacted results in the first half of the year. In sharp contrast, the second half of 2002 saw solid growth partly as a

Part II, Item 7

result of higher demand for Drilling & Measurements and Well Completions technologies
connected to contracts in the Burgos Basin. In addition, the completion of an IPM project that involved the sale of production facilities in Ecuador for $26.5 million in the fourth quarter contributed to end-of-year higher revenue.

Pretax operating income of $169 million declined 8% as a result of decreased activity in Venezuela and Argentina.

Europe/CIS/West Africa

Revenue of $2.5 billion increased 17% versus 2001. Strong revenue growth was recorded in the first three quarters reflecting increased
activity levels and market share gains particularly in the Caspian and Russia GeoMarkets in respect to artificial lift and drilling technologies. The Well Completions & Productivity technology segment recorded the strongest growth of 27%
followed by Drilling & Measurements, which grew 24%. This growth was partially mitigated by a steep revenue drop in the fourth quarter due to exceptionally severe winter weather conditions in the North Sea and Russia that affected all services,
particularly fracturing activities. In addition, operator budget cuts in the Nigeria GeoMarket and refocused investment decisions in the UK contributed to lower fourth quarter revenue.

Pretax operating income was $383 million compared to $385 million in 2001, with the very slight decrease due to softening in pricing towards the end of
the year and restructuring in the region to reduce support infrastructure to match slowing activity levels.

Middle East & Asia

Revenue of $1.9 billion
increased 8% versus 2001. After a decline at the beginning of the year resulting from exceptional artificial lift sales at the end of 2001, the Asian market showed signs of recovery highlighted by strong revenue growth in the second quarter. Over
the year, the India and Malaysia/Brunei/Philippines GeoMarkets recorded the strongest growth due to increased activity in these countries. In addition, the Wireline and Well Services technology segments posted the highest growth, up 14% and 10%,
respectively. This was partly offset by a slowdown in activity in the second half of 2002 due to a number of major projects nearing completion and lower equipment sales.

Pretax operating income of $453 million was up 9% versus 2001.

2001 Results

Revenue of $8.4 billion increased
22% over 2000. Increased non-rig related activity and higher pricing levels contributed to the growth. First quarter results reflected continued high activity in North America and increased demand internationally, but a softening in North American
drilling activity in the third quarter offset international growth. Market share gains, improved pricing levels, and the introduction of new technology contributed to strong growth in the Drilling & Measurements and Well Completions &
Productivity technology segments. Three key acquisitions were made during the year: Baker Jardine (software tools, IT consulting and integrated solutions that help operators increase oil and gas production), Sensa (fiber optic sensing technologies),
and Phoenix (technologies and techniques for optimizing production from artificially lifted wells). Pretax operating income of $1.59 billion increased 49% over last year.

North America

Revenue of $2.8 billion increased 17% versus 2000. The strong revenue growth in the first quarter of 2001 plateaued in the middle of the year. This was due to slower
economic conditions and declining natural gas prices, which resulted in reduced activity towards the end of the year. The Alaska and Gulf Coast GeoMarkets recorded the strongest revenue growth due to increased demand for Drilling & Measurements,
Well Services, and Wireline technologies. Pretax operating income of $637 increased 69%, primarily due to strong demand for Well Services technology.

18  /  SLB

2003 FORM 10-K


Part II, Item 7

Latin America

Revenue of $1.5 billion increased 31%, with improvements across all services contributing to double-digit growth across the GeoMarkets,
which was led by Peru/Colombia/Ecuador and Latin America South as a result of increased Drilling & Measurements, Well Services, and Well Completions activity. Pretax operating income of $183 million increased 131% principally as a result of
increases in Integrated Project Management and Wireline services.

Europe/CIS/West
Africa

Revenue of $2.1 billion increased 36%. Overall moderate growth was
led by high demand for Well Completions services in Nigeria, and strong growth in both Drilling & Measurements and Wireline services in Russia. Growth in the West & South Africa GeoMarket was partly due to an Early Production Facility
Project for IPM during the year. Pretax operating income of $385 million increased 60% due mainly to the Well Completions & Productivity segment, which recorded strong growth across most GeoMarkets.

Middle East & Asia

Revenue of $1.8 billion increased 16%. Almost all GeoMarkets in the Area recorded strong double-digit growth led by Drilling &
Measurements and Well Services activities in the Malaysia/Brunei/Philippines GeoMarket, and as a result of new contract wins in the Gulf GeoMarket. Pretax operating income of $416 grew 34% due to increases in the Drilling & Measurements and Well
Completions & Productivity technology segments.

WesternGeco

2003 Results

Revenue for 2003 was $1.2 billion versus $1.5 billion in 2002, reflecting a 20% decrease
year-on-year. This was primarily due to lower land crew activity following the exiting of the North American Land market combined with the completion of some contracts in the Middle East. The decrease in revenue was also due to declines in
Multiclient sales principally in North & South America, partially offset by increased Marine activity in Europe, Caspian and the Middle East. Q-Marine* continued to gain customer acceptance with 75% vessel utilization on third party contracts in
the third quarter, and the first Q-on-Q time lapse survey, which was performed in the North Sea with initial processing results available after 11 days. The end of the year saw a return to traditional seasonal Multiclient revenue levels partially
helped by the signing of a long-term business agreement with a major energy company that included the licensing of part of the WesternGeco data library, as well as joint R&D and training on new technology for seismic data processing.

Including Multiclient pre-commitments, the backlog at the end of 2003 reached $408 million, reflecting the award of a number of Land contracts in the
Middle East and a material Multiclient volume agreement signed in the fourth quarter. During 2003, Q-Marine continued to command significant pricing premiums as a result of the added value obtained from the delivered product, but pricing across
other business segments was flat to down for conventional marine, land and data processing activity due to continued overcapacity in the industry. The company’s decision to acquire only significantly prefunded multiclient surveys, along with
lower amortization following the impairment charge in 2003, resulted in the Multiclient product line being in a much healthier condition at the end of the year. Q-Marine penetration continued strong, reflected by the doubling of Q revenue
year-on-year.

Pretax operating loss was $20 million versus a profit of $71 million in 2002 (excluding Multiclient impairment and other
charges in both years) mainly due to significantly higher Multiclient amortization charges as a result of lower sales and a more conservative amortization policy in light of business conditions. The lower Multiclient sales were primarily due to an
overall lessening in interest in the Gulf of Mexico from

Part II, Item 7

the major oil companies coupled with an average price reduction of approximately 30% during
the year. The deterioration in the Multiclient results was partially offset by an improvement in Land and Marine following the fourth quarter 2002 restructuring program combined with better service delivery.

In the third quarter, an impairment charge of $398 million pretax was taken against the multiclient library and there was a $54 million pretax charge on
the Western Trident and Western Monarch vessels.

2002 Results

WesternGeco revenue of $1.5 billion decreased 13% compared to the prior year, primarily due
to decreased activity in North America and Europe/CIS/W. Africa, which were partially offset by increases in Latin America and the Middle East & Asia.

The seismic downturn continued throughout 2002 resulting in significantly lower activity levels, a reduction in Multiclient sales, and extreme pricing pressures on all services due to large overcapacity in the seismic
industry. Significant workforce reductions were made in the fourth quarter of 2002 as a result of the decision to stop Land acquisition activities in the US lower 48 states and Canada.

Pretax operating income of $71 million fell 68%, primarily due to significantly lower Multiclient sales and decreased activities in North America coupled
with Land seismic contract losses in Mexico and Marine seismic contract losses in India, both of which were related to production delays.

2001 Results

The WesternGeco joint venture was formed on November 30, 2000. Revenue in 2001 was $1.7 billion and pretax operating income was $221 million. The Malaysia/Brunei/Philippines, Alaska, Gulf Coast, and West & South
Africa GeoMarkets recorded the strongest results for the year. Multiclient sales of $654 million in a favorable pricing environment also contributed to the high level of activity and were the major contributor to the operating income.

SchlumbergerSema

2003 Results

On September 22, 2003, Schlumberger announced its intention to sell the SchlumbergerSema business to Atos Origin. The sale closed on January 29, 2004.

The transaction proceeds consisted of €443 million ($550 million) in cash, which included a working capital adjustment, and 19.3 million shares of
common stock of Atos Origin with a value of €1.02 billion ($1.275 billion) which represented approximately 29% of the outstanding common shares of Atos Origin. On February 2, 2004, Schlumberger sold 9.6 million shares for $630 million reducing
its investment in Atos Origin to approximately 15% of the outstanding common shares.

Revenue of $2.7 billion was 11% higher than 2002. The
increase was mainly due to the strengthening of the European currencies against the US dollar, with a positive impact of $274 million, resulting in an underlying decrease in operating revenue of $6 million.

Pretax operating income of $61 million increased $44 million versus 2002. The improvement in profitability reflected the full year benefit of indirect
cost reduction programs carried out in 2002 in North America, Asia, UK, and Sweden coupled with improvement in gross margins in Asia and South America.

North & South America

Revenue of $350 million decreased 2% mainly due to the Salt Lake City Olympic Games revenue in 2002, partially offset by new contracts for Lee County, Florida; Dallas County, Texas; Sprint; and the city of Los
Angeles, California.

20  /  SLB

2003 FORM 10-K


Part II, Item 7

Pretax operating income of $3 million increased $57 million year-on-year.
Despite the decline in revenue, operating income increased substantially mainly due to the positive impact of indirect cost reduction programs initiated in 2002, which had a full impact of $29 million in 2003.

Europe/Middle East/Africa

Revenue of $2.2 billion increased 14% mainly due to the appreciation of European currencies against the US dollar. Revenue from operations
declined due to a depressed IT market in Italy, a more than 20% average selling price drop in France, and a sharp downturn in the telecommunications industry in Germany. These declines were substantially offset by a significant increase in revenue
in the UK due to the Metropolitan Police, Department of Works and Pension, Consignia, and Department of Trade and Industry contracts, and by the award of the All Africa Games project in Nigeria.

Pretax operating income of $46 million decreased 65% year-on-year reflecting the impact of lower revenue from operations due to the major downturn in the
IT industry, especially in France and Germany. Profitability also decreased due to extra service delivery costs in Sweden, and higher pension costs in France. These decreases were partially offset by the benefit of indirect cost reduction programs
in the UK, as well as increased profitability from the revenue growth in the UK and Nigeria.

Asia

Revenue of $144 million decreased 4% mainly due to a
lower activity level in India and Taiwan.

Pretax operating income increased from break-even in 2002 to $34 million profit in 2003,
reflecting a 10% increase in gross margins, as well as lower costs following headcount reduction programs initiated in 2001 and 2002.

2002 Results

Revenue of $2.4 billion increased 31% compared to 2001 mainly due to the acquisition of Sema plc whose results were consolidated with effect from April 1, 2001.

The pretax operating income was $17 million compared to a loss of $15 million in 2001, reflecting the cost reductions initiatives implemented since the
integration of Sema plc into Schlumberger.

North & South America

Revenue of $356 million decreased 7% over 2001 primarily due a declining activity level
in the telecommunications and utility industries due primarily to the weak IT services spending environment as customers faced economic challenges and continued to revise budgets downwards and delay decisions on contract awards. At the 2002 Winter
Olympic Games, SchlumbergerSema led a consortium of 15 technology partners in a three-year long project to deliver the IT infrastructure needed to run the Games.

Pretax operating loss of $54 million improved by $4 million over 2001, mainly attributable to the cost reduction programs implemented throughout the area.

Europe/Middle East/Africa

Revenue of $1.9 billion increased 33% over 2002 mainly due to the inclusion of a full year’s revenue from the acquisition of Sema plc compared to nine months in
2001. Additionally, the main growth contributor was the Public Sector mainly in the UK where SchlumbergerSema won large outsourcing contracts with the Association of Train Operating Companies, the Department of Works and Pension, and the Vehicle
Inspectorate, and a health and welfare services project to Consignia’s 220,000 employees.

Pretax operating income of $132 million
increased 33% due mainly to the cost cutting program implemented throughout the year and higher activity level in the UK.

21  /  SLB

2003 FORM 10-K


Part II, Item 7

Asia

Revenue of $150 million increased 36% mainly due to the inclusion of a full year’s revenue from the acquisition of Sema plc compared to nine months in 2001. The
decreased activity in telecommunications, mainly in China and Taiwan, was offset by the increase in the finance segment on new outsourcing contracts in the insurance sector in Japan and delivery of payment systems in China.

Pretax operating income decreased 94% mainly attributable to pricing pressure and economic declines in the telecommunications IT services industry.

2001 Results

On April 6, 2001, Schlumberger completed the acquisition of Sema plc, an IT and technical services company with a strong European presence,
for $5.15 billion.

Revenue of $1.8 billion compared to $70 million in 2000 reflecting the acquisition of Sema plc.

Pretax operating loss of $15 million improved $69 million over the prior year due to the addition of Sema plc.

North & South America

Revenue of $381 million increased from $70 million in 2000 essentially due to the inclusion of SchlumbergerSema and the full year’s
activity of the Convergent Group, acquired in November 2000 and CellNet Data Systems, acquired in June 2000.

Pretax operating loss of $58
million improved $12 million compared to the previous year due to the inclusion of SchlumbergerSema and the new businesses acquired the previous year.

Europe/Middle East/Africa

Revenue of $1.4 billion in 2001 compared to no activity in 2000 due to the inclusion of Sema plc. Main contracts included the award of multi-million dollar contracts in France for Banque de France and in the UK for
Metropolitan Police.

Pretax operating income was $99 million due to the inclusion of Sema plc.

Asia

Revenue of $110 million compared to no activity in 2000 due to the inclusion of Sema plc.

Pretax operating income was $8 million due to the inclusion of Sema plc.

Other

The activities included in this
segment are Axalto (Smart Cards and Point-of-Sale Terminals), Electricity Meters, Business Continuity, Infodata, Telecom Software Products, Payphones, and Essentis. Active divestiture negotiations are currently ongoing for each of these activities.

2003 Results

In July 2003, Schlumberger entered into an agreement to sell the Electricity Meters activity to Itron Inc. for $255 million in cash. The
deal is expected to be completed in the first half of 2004 depending upon the successful completion of the Hart-Scott-Rodino review process and other conditions.

Revenue of $1.5 billion increased 11% over 2002. Electricity Meters had a 25% improvement on revenue of $294 million partially as a result of the transition from electro-mechanical meters to solid-state meters. Also
contributing to revenue growth, Smart Cards and Point-of-Sale Terminals revenue of $776 million increased 8% principally due to strong demand for Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) cards for the mobile communications sector, particularly in North
& South America and Eastern Europe.

22  /  SLB

2003 FORM 10-K


Part II, Item 7

Pretax operating income of $109 million increased six fold. Electricity
Meters pretax operating income of $61 million increased 132% primarily due to improved manufacturing efficiencies, changes in product mix, and cost reductions. Smart Cards pretax operating income of $58 million increased 68% due to better growth
margins as a result of increased volume and a more favorable product mix, partially offset by lower average selling prices.

2002 Results

Revenue of $1.3 billion decreased 34% reflecting the divestiture of the Resource Management Services’ North American water metering activities, non-North American electricity and water meter, and worldwide gas
meter businesses in November 2001.

Cards activity remained flat despite the continuing slump in the telecommunications industry and the
continued pricing pressure. This was partially offset by higher activity in banking and IT cards. Electricity Meters activity improved 13% on revenue of $235 million as a result of the market penetration of Automated Meter Reading (AMR)
technologies.

Pretax operating income of $18 million decreased 80% mainly due to the divestiture of most of the Resource Management
Services businesses, and significantly lower growth margins in the Cards business.

2001 Results

Revenue of $2.0 billion decreased 4% reflecting
mainly the divestiture of most of the Resource Management Services businesses, which were sold in November 2001.

Cards revenue grew by 8%
reflecting the acquisition of Bull CP8 in March 2001, partially offset by a decline in SIM card activity related to a slowdown in the telecommunications industry. Electricity Meters activity grew 29% on revenue of $208 million as a result of the
acquisition of CellNet and participation in network projects.

Pretax operating income of $88 million decreased 42% due mainly to lower
growth margins and higher operating expenses in the Smart Cards business.

from $9 million in 2002, as revenue increased 11%. In the Other segment, net income of $72
million increased $61 million as revenue increased 11% reflecting strong improvement in the Smart Cards and Electricity Meters activities.

In 2002, Oilfield Services segment net income decreased $179 million, or 15%, to $998 million as revenue declined 3%. North America registered the most significant decline as revenue decreased 19%. WesternGeco segment net income of $4
million decreased from $79 million in 2001, as revenue decreased 13% in the declining seismic market. SchlumbergerSema segment net income of $9 million improved from a loss of $5 million in 2001, reflecting the revenue increase of 31% (7% on a pro
forma basis – assuming the Sema plc acquisition took place on January 1, 2001) and the effect of the previously announced cost reduction program. In the Other segment, net income declined to $11 million, from $71 million in 2001 which included
the divested Resource Management Services businesses.

In 2001, Oilfield Services segment net income increased $387 million, or 49%, to
$1.18 billion reflecting the 22% growth in revenue. Higher pricing levels and increased non-rig related activity were the major contributing factors. WesternGeco segment net income of $79 million improved from a loss of $37 million in 2000 as
revenue increased to $1.7 billion, from $0.5 billion, attributable to the new venture with Baker Hughes Incorporated, formed in November 2000. SchlumbergerSema segment net loss of $5 million improved $44 million reflecting the incremental income
from the newly acquired Sema plc. In the Other segment, net income of $71 million declined $42 million from the prior year with declines in the semiconductor-related and Smart Cards activities.

Expenditures
by business segment were as follows:


Relating to the Bull CP8 acquisition.

Interest Expense

Interest expense decreased $34 million, to $334 million due to a decrease in average debt balances and a decrease in average borrowing rates from 4.9% to 4.6%. The decrease in 2002 of $17 million, to $368 million, was
due to a decrease in average borrowing rates from 5.8% to 4.9% which more than offset a $1 billion increase in average debt balances. The increase in 2001 of $109 million, to $385 million, reflected the significantly higher debt balances incurred,
relating to the acquisition of Sema plc, which were only partially offset by a reduction in average borrowing rate from 6.9% to 5.8%.

Hanover Compressor Company

In August 2001, Schlumberger sold its Oilfield Services worldwide gas compression activity to Hanover Compressor Company. The proceeds
included 8.7 million shares of Hanover Compressor common stock, with a value at closing of $173 million, which is restricted from marketability until August 30, 2004, and a $150 million long-term subordinated note maturing December 15, 2005.

In the fourth quarter of 2003, Schlumberger sold the subordinated note for $177 million and realized a pretax gain of $32 million ($20
million after-tax; $0.03 per share).

At December 31, 2003, the carrying value of Schlumberger’s investment in Hanover Compressor
common stock exceeded the market value. As required by generally accepted accounting principles (SFAS 115), Schlumberger wrote down its investment to the fair market value of $91.4 million at December 31, 2003 and recorded a charge of $81.2 million
(before and after-tax; $0.13 per share).

As part of the sale agreement, Hanover Compressor had an option to put its interest in the PIGAP
II joint venture in Venezuela back to Schlumberger if certain financing conditions were not met. Hanover Compressor did not exercise this option.

Schlumberger recorded the following after-tax and minority interest charges/credits for continuing operations in 2003, 2002 and 2001:

·

In December 2003, a gain of $20 million on the sale of the Hanover Compressor note.

·

In December 2003, a charge of $81 million relating to the write-down, to fair market value, of Schlumberger’s investment in Hanover Compressor common stock. The write-down was
required by SFAS 115 as the decline in the market value of the stock is “other than temporary”.

·

In September 2003, a $205 million multiclient library impairment charge following an evaluation of current and expected future business conditions in the seismic sector, a $38
million seismic vessel impairment charge and a $31 million gain on the sale of a drilling rig.

·

Between June 12 and July 22, 2003, subsidiaries of Schlumberger launched and concluded tender offers to acquire three series of outstanding European bonds; $1.3 billion of principal
was repurchased for a total cost of $1.5 billion, which included the premium, and issuing and tender costs. The total charge on the tenders was $168 million, of which $81.5 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2003, when the first tender
closed, with the balance of $86.3 million recorded in the third quarter of 2003.

·

On December 10, 2002, Schlumberger announced that the Board of Directors had approved an updated strategy for its SchlumbergerSema business segment. The new strategic plan outlook,
current business values and the reorganization of SchlumbergerSema constitute significant events that required an impairment analysis to be performed in accordance with SFAS 142. SchlumbergerSema was ‘valued’ on a stand-alone basis; each
reporting unit within SchlumbergerSema was valued using a discounted cash flow analysis based on a long-term forecast prepared by SchlumbergerSema management with the assistance of a third party valuation expert. The implied multiples yielded by the
discounted cash flow analysis were compared to observed trading multiples of comparable companies and recent transactions in the IT services industry to assess the fair value of the reporting units. The fair value was below the book value. As a
result, goodwill was written down to its estimated fair value based on Schlumberger’s valuation. The impairment of goodwill mainly reflected the prevailing difficulties of the telecommunications industry and the severely depressed market values
of the IT companies serving SchlumbergerSema’s sector. Certain intangible assets were also identified and written down as part of this process.

Part II, Item 7

Schlumberger recorded severance, facility and other costs in
an effort to reduce costs at SchlumbergerSema and WesternGeco. These costs related to expenses that offer no future benefit to the ongoing operations of these businesses. During the fourth quarter, Schlumberger also recorded an impairment charge, to
reflect a change in the business projections of the WesternGeco business, related to capitalized multiclient seismic library costs, a deferred tax valuation allowance and other costs.

The total of the above charges was $3,168 million and consisted of (1) a goodwill impairment charge of $2,638 million; (2) an intangible
assets impairment charge of $132 million; (3) SchlumbergerSema severance and other charges of $77 million in response to current business conditions; (4) WesternGeco severance and other charges of $72 million in response to current business
conditions; (5) a WesternGeco multiclient library impairment charge of $129 million following a valuation of the library; (6) environmental related charges of $26 million; and (7) a deferred tax valuation allowance charge of $94 million.

·

In December 2002, a credit of $87 million reflecting the gain on the sale of two drilling rigs.

·

In March 2002, a charge of $29 million related to the financial/economic crisis in Argentina.

·

In December 2001, a net credit of $5 million, including an after-tax gain on the sale of the former Resource Management Services North American Water division ($117 million). This
gain was partially offset by certain charges: (1) a provision of $37 million for employee termination costs, principally in Europe and the US, related to Oilfield Services and SchlumbergerSema in response to the prevailing business conditions; (2)
tax reorganization costs of $29 million; (3) a further $20 million charge related to the second quarter estimated loss on the divestiture of certain Resource Management Services businesses following the actual closing in the fourth quarter; and (4)
asset write-down of $23 million for technological impairment related to certain Land seismic assets in the newly formed WesternGeco Joint Venture.

·

In September 2001, a net credit of $3 million representing the gain on the sale of the worldwide gas compression business, partially offset by an impairment charge relating to the
expected disposition of certain activities.

·

In June 2001, a charge of $280 million for the estimated impairment charge from the disposition of certain Resource Management Services businesses.

·

In March 2001, a charge of $25 million for in-process R&D related to the Bull CP8 acquisition.

An analysis of the fourth quarter 2002 pretax severance and facility charges as of December 31, 2003 is as follows:

At December 31, 2003,
the Severance balance of $1.0 million is classified as

Accounts Payable and

Accrued Liabilities

and the Facilities balance of $11.1 million is classified in

Liabilities held for sale

on the

Consolidated Balance Sheet

.

The December 2001 charge included severance costs of $41 million (775 people), which have been paid.

Part II, Item 7

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Schlumberger’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of
operations are based upon Schlumberger’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires
Schlumberger to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.

On an on-going basis, Schlumberger evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, valuation of inventories and investments, recoverability
of long-lived assets, income tax provision and deferred taxes, profit assumptions on long-term percentage-of-completion contracts, contingencies and litigation and actuarial assumptions for employee benefit plans. Schlumberger bases its estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Schlumberger
believes the critical accounting policies described below affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.

Schlumberger recognizes revenue and profit as work progresses on long-term, fixed price contracts using the percentage-of-completion method, which relies
on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs. Schlumberger follows this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made. Recognized revenue and profit are
subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion. Revisions in profit estimates are charged or credited to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known as a change in estimate. Losses on long-term
contracts are provided for when such losses are known and reasonably estimated.

Schlumberger recognizes revenue from the sale of software
licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Whether the fee is fixed and determinable is assessed
based on the payment terms associated with the transaction. Collection is assessed based on a number of factors, including past transaction history with the customer and the credit-worthiness of the customer.

Revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements, such as those including installation and integration services, are recognized as each element
is earned based on the relative fair value of each element and when the delivered elements have stand alone value to the customers.

For
sales, either a binding purchase order, signed license agreement or a written contract is used as evidence of an arrangement.

Revenue from
maintenance services is recognized ratably over the contract term. The training and consulting services (time and materials) are billed based on hourly rates, and revenue is generally recognized as these services are performed. Revenue from
outsourcing services is generally recognized as services are performed.

The WesternGeco segment capitalizes the cost associated with
obtaining multiclient seismic data. Such costs are charged to

Cost of goods sold and services

based on a percentage of estimated total revenue that Schlumberger estimates that it will receive from the sales of such data. The carrying value of
individual surveys is reviewed at least annually and adjustments to the value are made based upon the revised estimated revenues for the surveys.

Schlumberger maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of Schlumberger’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting
in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.

27  /  SLB

2003 FORM 10-K


Part II, Item 7

Schlumberger writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or
unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by
management, additional inventory writedowns may be required.

Schlumberger assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long-lived
assets and related goodwill at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors considered important, which could trigger an impairment review, include the following:

·

significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;

·

significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business;

·

significant negative industry or economic trends;

·

significant decline in Schlumberger’s stock price and our market capitalization relative to net book value, for a sustained period.

When Schlumberger determines that the carrying value of intangibles,
long-lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, any impairment is measured based on projected net cash flows expected to result from that asset, including
eventual disposition.

Schlumberger had net deferred tax assets of $632 million at December 31, 2003 which excluded $325 million relating to
a certain European net operating loss for which there is a valuation allowance. In assessing the need for valuation allowances, Schlumberger considers the probable likelihood of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies.

With regard to pension and postretirement benefits, Schlumberger evaluates the appropriateness of assumptions used by an independent
actuary, in particular assumptions as to discount rate, return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates. The assumptions are revised at least annually as circumstances require.

Cash Flow

In 2003, cash provided by operations was $2.11 billion as net income plus depreciation/amortization and net charges including the extinguishment of European debt and
multiclient and vessel impairments, were only partially offset by increases in customer receivables, due to higher revenue, and decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Cash used in investing activities was $1.49 billion and included
investments in fixed assets ($1.03 billion) and multiclient seismic data ($150 million), the purchase of short-term investments ($1.15 billion), the net proceeds ($106 million) from the sale of Schlumberger’s investment of 9.7 million shares in
Grant Prideco Inc., the proceeds from the sales of NPTest ($220 million) and e-City ($79 million) activities and the net proceeds ($177 million) from the sale of the Hanover Compressor note. Cash used by financing activities was $558 million with
the proceeds from employee stock plans ($172 million) offset by the payment of dividends to shareholders ($437 million), the costs related to the extinguishment of certain European debt ($168 million) and an overall reduction in debt of $126
million.

Part II, Item 7

“Net Debt” is gross debt less cash, short-term investments and
fixed income investments held to maturity. Management believes that Net Debt provides useful information regarding the level of Schlumberger’s indebtedness by reflecting cash and investments that could be used to repay debt, and that the level
of net debt provides useful information as to the results of Schlumberger’s deleveraging efforts. Details of the Net Debt follows:

1.

Includes Multiclient seismic data costs.

At December 31, 2003,
the cash and short-term investments of $3.1 billion and the remaining facilities of $2.6 billion are sufficient to meet future business requirements.

Based on forecast 2004 net income, depreciation/amortization estimates, cash from the sale of SchlumbergerSema ($550 million) and Atos Origin stock ($625 million) and other possible business and asset divestitures,
and other cash flow components, Schlumberger expects to improve cash flow with an objective of reducing the net debt to $3 billion by mid-year and $2 billion by year-end 2004. This will largely be dependent upon the business segments operating
results and the successful completion of certain business divestitures.

In addition, Schlumberger is currently reviewing the feasibility
and cost of a buyback of all, or a portion of, the remaining European long-term debt and the continued appropriateness of maintaining the effectiveness of its US interest rate derivative. A buyback of the debt and the interest rate derivative
becoming ineffective would result in a charge to income from continuing operations in 2004.

Financing

On June 9, 2003, Schlumberger Limited issued $850 million aggregate principal amount of 1.5% Series A Convertible Debentures due June 1,
2023 and $450 million aggregate principal amount of 2.125% Series B Convertible Debentures due June 1, 2023. On July 2, 2003, Schlumberger Limited issued an additional $125 million aggregate principal amount of the Series A debentures pursuant to an
option granted to the initial purchasers.

The debentures were sold to Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Goldman, Sachs & Co. pursuant
to an exemption from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. The debentures were resold, with registration rights, by the initial purchasers in transactions exempt from registration under Rule 144A of the Securities Act. The
aggregate offering price of the debentures was $1.425 billion, the initial purchasers’ discount was $25.4 million and the net proceeds to Schlumberger Limited were $1.4 billion.

The Series A debentures and the Series B debentures are convertible, at the holders’ option, into shares of common stock of Schlumberger Limited.
Holders of the Series A debentures may convert their debentures into common stock at a conversion rate of 13.8255 shares for each $1,000 principal amount of Series A debentures (equivalent to an initial conversion price of $72.33 per share). Holders
of the Series B debentures may convert their debentures into common stock at a conversion rate of 12.5 shares for each $1,000 principal amount of Series B debentures (equivalent to an initial conversion price of $80.00 per share). Each conversion
rate may be adjusted for certain events, but it will not be adjusted for accrued interest.

On or after June 6, 2008 (in the case of the
Series A debentures) or June 6, 2010 (in the case of the Series B debentures), Schlumberger may redeem for cash all or part of the applicable series of debentures, upon notice to the holders, at the redemption prices of 100% of the principal amount
of the debentures, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. On June 1, 2008, June 1, 2013, and June 1, 2018, holders of Series A debentures may require Schlumberger to repurchase their Series A debentures. On June 1, 2010, June 1,
2013 and June 1, 2018, holders of Series B debentures may require Schlumberger to repurchase their Series B debentures. The repurchase price will be 100% of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase
date. The repurchase price for repurchases on June 1, 2008 (in the case of the Series A debentures) and June 1, 2010 (in the case of the Series B debentures) will be paid in cash. On the other repurchase dates, Schlumberger may choose to pay the
repurchase price in cash or common stock or any combination of cash and common stock. In addition, upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change, holders may require Schlumberger to repurchase all or a portion of their debentures, in cash or, at
Schlumberger’s election, common stock valued at 99% of its market price or any combination of cash and common stock, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest to the
redemption date. The debentures will mature on June 1, 2023 unless earlier redeemed or repurchased.

Between June 12 and July 22, 2003,
certain subsidiaries of Schlumberger launched and concluded tender offers to acquire three series of their outstanding European bonds. The companies bought back $1.3 billion of principal of these bonds for a total cost of $1.5 billion, which
includes the premium, and issuing and tender costs. The total charge on the tender was $168 million.

Sale of SchlumbergerSema to Atos Origin

On September 22, 2003, Schlumberger announced the signing of an agreement with Atos Origin for the sale of the SchlumbergerSema business.

On the January 29, 2004 the sale transaction was completed. As consideration for the transaction Schlumberger received €443 million ($550 million) in cash which included a working capital adjustment, and 19.3 million shares of common
stock of Atos Origin with a value of €1.02 billion ($1.275 billion), which represented approximately 29% of the outstanding common shares of Atos Origin after the transaction was completed. Schlumberger expects the result of the sale will be a
gain.

2003 FORM 10-K


Part II, Item 7

On February 2, 2004 Schlumberger sold 9.6 million of the Atos Origin shares
for a net consideration of €500 million ($625 million). As a result of this sale, Schlumberger’s investment was reduced to approximately 15% of the outstanding common shares of Atos Origin. Schlumberger will account for the remaining
investment in Atos Origin on the cost method.

Business
Divestitures

During 2003, Schlumberger divested the following
businesses:

·

In July, the NPTest semiconductor testing business to a partnership led by Francisco Partners and Shah Management. The proceeds were $220 million in cash. Additionally, the
partnership has a contingent obligation to make a further payment to Schlumberger upon a subsequent qualifying disposition or an initial public offering of NPTest by the partnership, under certain circumstances. The results of NPTest are reported as

Discontinued Operations

During 2002, Schlumberger divested the following businesses:

·

In December, the Reed Hycalog drillbits business. The proceeds included $259 million in cash and 9.7 million shares of Grant Prideco common stock with a value of $103 million. The
after-tax gain was $66 million. The results of Reed Hycalog are reported as

Discontinued Operations

in the

Consolidated Statement of Income.

During 2001, Schlumberger divested the following businesses:

·

In August, the Oilfield Services worldwide gas compression activity primarily consisting of the Production Operators Corp. subsidiary. The proceeds included $274 million in cash, a
$150 million long-term subordinated note and newly issued Hanover Compressor Company shares with a value of $173 million. The shares have a three year marketability restriction. The after-tax gain was $52 million.

·

In November, the Resource Management Services North American water metering activities. Cash proceeds were $304 million and the after-tax gain was $117 million.

·

In November, the Resource Management Services non-North American electricity and water meter, and worldwide gas meter businesses. The net cash proceeds were $256 million and the
after-tax loss was $300 million, of which $280 million had been recorded as an impairment charge in June (See

Charges-Continuing Operations

).

·

In November, the Yield Enhancement Systems division of Semiconductor Solutions. Cash proceeds were $62 million and the after-tax gain was $12 million.

The number of holders
of record of Schlumberger common stock at December 31, 2003, was approximately 24,770. There are no legal restrictions on the payment of dividends or ownership or voting of such shares, except as to shares held in the Schlumberger Treasury. US
stockholders are not subject to any Netherlands Antilles withholding or other Netherlands Antilles taxes attributable to ownership of such shares.

Environmental Matters

The Consolidated Balance Sheet includes accruals for the estimated future costs associated with certain environmental remediation activities related to
the past use or disposal of hazardous materials. Substantially all such costs relate to divested operations and to facilities or locations that are no longer in operation. Due to a number of uncertainties, including uncertainty of timing, the scope
of remediation, future technology, regulatory changes, the risk of personal injury, natural resource or property damage claims and other factors, it is possible that the ultimate remediation costs may exceed the amounts estimated. However, in the
opinion of management, such additional costs are not expected to be material relative to consolidated liquidity, financial position or future results of operations.

Part II, Item 7

New Accounting Standards

In July 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 146 (

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities

). The standard required companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. Examples of costs covered by the standard
include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring, discontinued operation, plant closing, or other exit or disposal activity. Previous accounting guidance was provided by EITF Issue No.
94-3, (

Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity [including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring])

. SFAS 146 replaced Issue 94-3. Schlumberger adopted SFAS 146 prospectively to
exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002.

In November 2002, FASB Interpretation No. 45 (

Guarantor’s Accounting
and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others

) was issued. It requires certain accounting and disclosures of guarantees to third parties including indebtedness. The interpretation is
effective on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The implementation of this interpretation did not have a material effect on Schlumberger’s financial position or results of operations.

In January 2003, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued No. 00-21 (

Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables

). This EITF
establishes the criteria for recognizing revenue in arrangements when several deliverables are bundled into one agreement. EITF 00-21 does not allow revenue recognition unless the fair value of the undelivered element(s) is available and the element
has stand-alone value to the customer. EITF 00-21 also provides guidance on allocating the total contract revenue to the individual elements based upon the available fair value of each deliverable. The implementation of this pronouncement did not
have a material impact on Schlumberger’s financial position or results of operations.

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, (

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of

ARB No. 51).

The primary objective of the interpretation is to provide guidance on the identification of, and
financial reporting for entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights; such entities are known as variable-interest entities (VIE’s). FIN 46 provides guidance that determines (1) whether consolidation is
required under the “controlling financial interest” model of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 (ARB 51),

Consolidated Financial Statements

, or other existing authoritative guidance, or, alternative, (2) whether the
variable-interest model under FIN 46 should be used to account for existing and new entities. Schlumberger does not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations.

In April 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 149 (

Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities

) which amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133 (

Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

). SFAS 149, which is to be applied prospectively, is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The adoption
of this new standard did not have a material impact on Schlumberger’s results of operations or financial position.

In May 2003, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 150, (Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity). The Standard specifies that instruments within its scope embody obligations of the issues
and therefore, the issuer must classify them as liabilities. The Standard was effective July 1, 2003, and had no material effect on Schlumberger’s financial position.

In January 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FSP No. FAS 106-1 (

Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of

33  /  SLB

2003 FORM 10-K


Part II, Item 7, 7A


). The statement permits the deferral of accounting related to the effects of the
legislation until the earlier of issuance of final accounting guidance by the FASB or a significant plan amendment/curtailment event requiring remeasurement, occurring after January 31, 2004. Schlumberger expects the new legislation will reduce
future postretirement medical costs.

Forward-looking Statements

This 10-K report, the fourth quarter and full year 2003 earnings
release, associated web-based publications and other statements we make contain forward looking statements, which include any statements that are not historical facts, such as our expectations regarding business outlook, economic recovery, expected
capex and depreciation and amortization charges, the capitalizing of multiclient survey costs and the acquisition of new multiclient surveys, the funding of pension plans and related pension expense, the likelihood and timing of and the benefits to
be derived from divestitures, conditions in the oilfield service business, including activity levels during 2004 and higher E&P investment, production increases in non-OPEC areas, issues affecting the seismic industry, including sales pertaining
to Q technology, continued deepwater drilling activity, benefits from contract awards, future results of operations, pricing, future effective tax rates and our expectations regarding the sale of our remaining investment in Atos Origin shares. These
statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the extent and timing of a rebound in the global economy; changes in exploration and production spending by major oil companies; recovery of activity levels, improved pricing
and realization of cost reduction and cost savings targets associated with the seismic business; market acceptance of Q seismic technology; general economic and business conditions in key regions of the world, including Argentina; political and
economic uncertainty in Venezuela and Nigeria and further socio-political unrest in the Persian Gulf and/or Asia; the market in Atos Origin shares; our ability to complete and benefits to be derived from other divestitures; our ability to achieve
growth objectives in IT solutions to upstream E&P business; continued growth in the demand for smart cards and related products; our ability to meet our identified liquidity projections, including the generation of sufficient cash flow from
oilfield operating results and the successful completion of certain business divestitures; potential contributions to pension plans; and other factors detailed in our fourth quarter and full year 2003 earnings release, this Report and other filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize (or the consequences of such a development changes), or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from
those forecasted or expected. Schlumberger disclaims any intention or obligation to update publicly or revise such statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Item 7A    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Schlumberger does not believe it has a material exposure to interest rate and currency market risks. Schlumberger manages the exposure to interest rate changes by using a
mix of debt maturities and variable- and fixed-rate debt together with interest rate swaps, where appropriate, to fix or lower borrowing costs. With regard to foreign currency fluctuations, Schlumberger enters into various contracts, which change in
value as foreign exchange rates change, to protect the value of external and intercompany transactions in foreign currencies. Schlumberger does not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes.

With respect to equity market risks, Schlumberger’s investment portfolio includes equity investments in publicly held companies that are classified
as available-for-sale, or restricted from sale, and other strategic equity holdings in privately held companies. These securities are exposed to price fluctuations. As of December 31, 2003, the carrying value of the available-for-sale and restricted
equity securities was $92 million (December 31, 2002: $283 million).

The process of determining the fair values of the privately held
equity investments inherently requires certain assumptions and subjective judgments. These valuation assumptions and judgments include

34  /  SLB

2003 FORM 10-K


Part II, Item 7A, 8

consideration of: (1) the investee’s earnings and cash flow position, cash flow
projections, and rate of cash consumption; (2) recent rounds of equity infusions; (3) the strength of the investee’s management; and (4) valuation data provided by the investee that may be compared with data for peers. Schlumberger has and may
continue to record impairment losses and write-down the carrying value of certain equity investments when the declines in fair value are other-than-temporary. Investment impairment charges recognized in 2003 and 2002 were $81 million and $0,
respectively. Schlumberger’s policy is not to hedge equity price risk.

industry; second, WesternGeco provides comprehensive worldwide reservoir imaging, monitoring, and development services, with extensive seismic crews and data processing centers as well as a large multiclient seismic library. Services range from 3D
and time-lapse (4D) seismic surveys to multi-component surveys for delineating prospects and reservoir management; WesternGeco is 70% owned by Schlumberger and 30% owned by Baker Hughes; third, SchlumbergerSema, an IT services company providing
consulting and systems integration services, and network and infrastructure solutions, primarily to the global energy sector, and other regional markets spanning the finance and public sectors and fourth, the Other business segment which principally
comprises the Axalto (Smart Cards and Point-of-Sale Terminals), Electricity Meters, Business Continuity, Infodata, Telecom Software Products, Water Services, Essentis and Payphones businesses, all of which are in active divestiture negotiations.

On September 22, 2003, Schlumberger announced the signing of an agreement with Atos Origin for the sale of the SchlumbergerSema business.
The sale closed on January 29, 2004.

2.    Summary of Accounting
Policies

The Consolidated Financial Statements of Schlumberger Limited
and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Discontinued Operations

In July 2003, Schlumberger completed the sale of its NPTest semiconductor testing business to a partnership led by Francisco Partners and Shah Management. The proceeds were $220 million in cash. Additionally, the
partnership has a contingent obligation to make a further payment to Schlumberger upon a subsequent qualifying disposition or an initial public offering of NPTest by the partnership, under certain circumstances. The results of NPTest are reported as

Discontinued Operations

in the

Consolidated Statement of Income

and include a net loss of $12 million on the sale. The net assets were $202 million.

In August 2003, Schlumberger completed the sale of its Verification Systems business by a proceed-free management buyout. The results of Verification Systems are reported as

Discontinued Operations

in the

Consolidated Statement of Income

and include a net loss of $18 million on the sale. The net assets were $17 million.

In October
2003, Schlumberger completed the sale of its e-City ‘pay & display’ parking solutions business to Apax Partners.

The proceeds were $84 million in cash. The results of e-City are reported as

Discontinued Operations

in the

Consolidated Statement of Income

and include a net loss of $56 million on the sale. The net assets were $120 million, including a $65 million allocation of goodwill.

In December, 2002, Schlumberger completed the sale of its Reed Hycalog drillbits business. The proceeds included $259 million in cash and 9.7 million
shares of Grant Prideco common stock with a value of $103 million. The results for the Reed Hycalog operations are reported as

Discontinued Operations

in the

Consolidated Statement of Income

and, in 2002, include results of operations
of $32 million and gain on sale of $66 million. The net assets were $185 million.

Part II, Item 8

Revenue and operating income (loss) from discontinued operations for 2003,
2002 and 2001 were as follows:

Principles of Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of
majority-owned subsidiaries. Significant 20% – 50% owned companies are carried on the equity method and classified in

Investments in Affiliated Companies

. The pro rata share of Schlumberger after-tax earnings is included in

Interest
and other income

. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Reclassifications

Certain items from prior years have
been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, Schlumberger evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, valuation of inventories and investments, recoverability of goodwill and intangible
assets, income tax provision and deferred taxes, profit assumptions on long-term percentage-of-completion contracts, contingencies and litigation and actuarial assumptions for employee benefit plans. Schlumberger bases its estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from
other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Revenue Recognition

Products and Services Revenue

Schlumberger’s products and services are generally sold based upon
purchase orders or contracts with the customer that include fixed or determinable prices and that do not include right of return or other similar provisions or other significant post delivery obligations. Revenue is recognized for products upon
delivery, customer acceptance and when title passes. Revenue is recognized when services are rendered and collectibility is reasonably assured.

Certain revenues are recognized on a time and materials basis, or on a percentage of completion basis, depending on the contract, as services are provided. Revenue from time and material service contracts is recognized as the services are
provided. Revenue from fixed price contracts is recognized over the contract term based on the percentage of the cost of services provided during the period compared to the total estimated cost of services to be provided over the entire contract.
Losses on contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimated.

41  /  SLB

2003 FORM 10-K


Part II, Item 8

Software Revenue

Revenue derived from the sale of licenses for its software, maintenance and related services may include installation, consulting and
training services.

If services are not essential to the functionality of the software, the revenue for each element of the contract is
recognized separately based on its respective vendor specific objective evidence of fair value when all of the following conditions are met: a signed contract is obtained, delivery has occurred, fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is
probable.

If an ongoing vendor obligation exists under the license arrangement, or if any uncertainties with regard to customer acceptance
are significant, revenue for the related element is deferred based on its vendor specific objective evidence of fair value. Vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is determined as being the price for the element when sold separately. If
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements, all revenue is deferred until sufficient evidence exists or all elements have been delivered.

Multiple Element Arrangement and Collectibility

Many sales are generated from complex contractual arrangements that require significant revenue recognition judgments, particularly in the areas of multiple element
arrangements. Revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements, such as those including installation and integration services, are recognized as each element is earned based on the relative fair value of each element and when the delivered
elements have stand alone value to the customers.

The assessment of collectibility is particularly critical in determining whether revenue
should be recognized in the current market environment. As part of the revenue recognition process, Schlumberger determines whether trade and notes receivables are reasonably assured of collection based on various factors, including the ability to
sell those receivables and whether there has been deterioration in the credit quality of customers that could result in the inability to sell the receivables. In situations where Schlumberger has the ability to sell the receivables without recourse,
revenue is recognized to the extent of the value Schlumberger could reasonably expect to realize from the sale. Schlumberger defers revenue and related costs when it is uncertain as to whether it will be able to collect or sell the receivable.
Schlumberger defers revenue but recognizes costs when it determines that the collection or sale of the receivable is unlikely.

Translation of Non-US Currencies

The Oilfield Services and WesternGeco segments functional currency is primarily the US dollar. The SchlumbergerSema segment and Other segment functional currencies are
primarily local currencies. All assets and liabilities recorded in functional currencies other than US dollars are translated at current exchange rates. The resulting adjustments are charged or credited directly to the

Stockholders’
Equity

section of the

Consolidated Balance Sheet

. Revenue and expenses are translated at the weighted-average exchange rates for the period. All realized and unrealized transaction gains and losses are included in income in the period in
which they occur. Schlumberger’s policy is to hedge against unrealized gains and losses on a monthly basis. Included in the 2003 results were transaction gains of $1 million, compared with losses of $2 million and $7 million in 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

Currency exchange contracts are entered into as a hedge against the effect of future settlement of assets and liabilities
denominated in other than the functional currency of the individual businesses. Gains or losses on the contracts are recognized when the currency exchange rates fluctuate, and the resulting charge or credit partially offsets the unrealized currency
gains or losses on those assets and liabilities. On December 31, 2003, contracts were outstanding for the US dollar equivalent of $2.2 billion in various foreign currencies. These contracts mature on various dates in 2004.

Part II, Item 8

Investments

Both short-term investments and fixed income investments, held to maturity comprise primarily eurodollar time deposits, certificates of
deposit and commercial paper, euronotes and eurobonds, substantially all denominated in US dollars. They are stated at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates market. Substantially all the investments designated as held to maturity that were
purchased and matured during the year had original maturities of less than three months. Short-term investments that are designated as trading are stated at market. The unrealized gains/losses on such securities at December 31, 2003 were not
significant.

For purposes of the

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows

, Schlumberger does not consider short-term investments to be
cash equivalents as they generally have original maturities in excess of three months.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at average cost or
at market, whichever is lower. Inventory consists of materials, supplies and finished goods.

Fixed Assets and Depreciation

Fixed
assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, which is provided for by charges to income over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method. Fixed assets include the manufacturing cost (average cost) of oilfield
technical equipment manufactured or assembled by subsidiaries of Schlumberger. Expenditures for renewals, replacements and improvements are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expenses as incurred. Upon sale or other
disposition, the applicable amounts of asset cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the net amount, less proceeds from disposal, is charged or credited to income.

Multiclient Seismic Data

Schlumberger capitalizes the cost of obtaining multiclient surveys. Such costs are charged to

Cost of

goods sold

and
services

based on a percentage of estimated total revenue that Schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data. The carrying value of individual surveys is reviewed, at least annually, and adjustments to the value are made based upon
the revised estimated revenues for the surveys.

Capitalized Software

The costs incurred for the development of computer software that will
be sold, leased or otherwise marketed are capitalized when technological feasibility has been established, generally when all of the planning, designing, coding and testing activities that are necessary in order to establish that the product can be
produced to meet its design specifications including functions, features and technical performance requirements are completed. These capitalized costs are subject to an ongoing assessment of recoverability based on anticipated future revenues and
changes in hardware and software technologies. Costs that are capitalized include direct labor and related overheads. Total capitalized internally developed software costs was $47 million at December 31, 2003 of which $33 million was deferred in
2003.

Amortization of capitalized software development costs begins when the product is available for general release. Amortization is
provided on the greater of the straight-line method or the sales ratio method over the estimated useful life. Unamortized capitalized software development costs determined to be in excess of the net realizable value of the product are expensed
immediately.

Schlumberger capitalizes certain costs of internally developed software. Capitalized costs include purchased materials and
services, payroll and payroll related costs and interest costs. The costs of internally developed software is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life which is principally 6 years.

Part II, Item 8

Impairment of Long-lived Assets

On an annual basis Schlumberger reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets,
including goodwill, intangible assets and investments. In addition, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the historical cost-carrying value of an asset may no longer be recoverable, a review is performed. Schlumberger assesses
recoverability of the carrying value of the asset by estimating the future net cash flows expected to result from the asset, including eventual disposition. If the future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment
loss is recorded equal to the difference between the asset’s carrying value and fair value.

In accordance with SFAS 142 (

Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets

), which was adopted by Schlumberger commencing January 1, 2002, goodwill ceased to be amortized.

Taxes on Income

Schlumberger and its subsidiaries compute taxes on income in accordance with the tax rules and regulations of the many taxing authorities where the income is earned. The income tax rates imposed by these taxing
authorities vary substantially. Taxable income may differ from pretax income for financial accounting purposes. To the extent that differences are due to revenue or expense items reported in one period for tax purposes and in another period for
financial accounting purposes, an appropriate provision for deferred income taxes is made. Any effect of changes in income tax rates or tax laws are included in the provision for income taxes in the period of enactment. When it is more likely than
not that a portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future, Schlumberger provides a corresponding valuation allowance against deferred tax assets.

Approximately $2.3 billion of consolidated income retained for use in the business on December 31, 2003 represented undistributed earnings of consolidated
subsidiaries and the pro rata Schlumberger share of 20% –50% owned companies. No provision is made for deferred income taxes on those earnings considered to be indefinitely reinvested or earnings that would not be taxed when remitted.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Schlumberger’s financial instruments which potentially subject the company to
concentration of credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivable. Schlumberger maintains an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable based on expected collectibility and performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’
financial condition.

Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the average number of
common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income, as adjusted for the interest on convertible debentures unless the adjustment is anti-dilutive, by the average number of common shares
outstanding assuming dilution, the calculation of which assumes (i) that all stock options which are in the money are exercised at the beginning of the period and the proceeds used, by Schlumberger, to purchase shares at the average market price for
the period, and (ii) the convertible debentures have been converted unless the effect is anti-dilutive.

Part II, Item 8

The following is a reconciliation from basic earnings per share to diluted
earnings per share from continuing operations for each of the last three years:

1.

There is no dilution of shares or earnings per share in 2002 due to the net loss.

Adjusted Net Income

The following is a reconciliation of reported net income (loss) to adjusted net income (loss) following the adoption of SFAS 142 (

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets

) on January 1, 2002.

Research & Engineering

All research and engineering expenditures are expensed as incurred,
including costs relating to patents or rights that may result from such expenditures. Included in 2001 expenditures was a charge of $25 million for in-process R&D related to the Bull CP8 acquisition.

New Accounting Standards

In July 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 146 (

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities

). The standard required companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. Examples of costs covered by the standard
include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring, discontinued operation, plant closing, or other exit or disposal activity. Previous accounting guidance was provided by EITF Issue No.
94-3, (

Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity [including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring])

. SFAS 146 replaced Issue 94-3. Schlumberger adopted SFAS 146 prospectively to
exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002.

Part II, Item 8

In November 2002, FASB Interpretation No. 45 (

Guarantor’s Accounting
and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others

) was issued. It requires certain accounting and disclosures of guarantees to third parties including indebtedness. The interpretation is
effective on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The implementation of this interpretation did not have a material effect on Schlumberger’s financial position or results of operations.

In January 2003, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued No. 00-21 (

Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables

). This EITF
establishes the criteria for recognizing revenue in arrangements when several items are bundled into one agreement. EITF 00-21 does not allow revenue recognition unless the fair value of the undelivered element(s) is available and the element has
stand-alone value to the customer. EITF 00-21 also provides guidance on allocating the total contract revenue to the individual elements based upon the available fair value of each deliverable. The implementation of this pronouncement did not have a
material impact on Schlumberger’s financial position or results of operations.

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, (

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of

ARB No. 51).

The primary objective of the interpretation is to provide guidance on the identification of, and financial
reporting for entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights; such entities are known as variable-interest entities (VIE’s). FIN 46 provides guidance that determines (1) whether consolidation is required under
the “controlling financial interest” model of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 (ARB 51),

Consolidated Financial Statements

, or other existing authoritative guidance, or, alternative, (2) whether the variable-interest model under
FIN 46 should be used to account for existing and new entities. Schlumberger does not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations.

In April 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 149 (

Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities

) which amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133 (

Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

). SFAS 149, which is to be applied prospectively, is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The adoption
of this new standard did not have a material impact on Schlumberger’s results of operations or financial position.

In May 2003, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board, issued SFAS No. 150, (Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity). The Standard specifies that instruments within its scope embody obligations of the issues
and therefore, the issuer must classify them as liabilities. The Standard was effective July 1, 2003, and had no material effect on Schlumberger’s financial position.

In January 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FSP No. FAS 106-1 (

Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003

).
The statement permits the deferral of accounting related to the effects of the legislation until the earlier of issuance of final accounting guidance by the FASB or a significant plan amendment/curtailment event requiring remeasurement, occurring
after January 31, 2004. Schlumberger expects the new legislation will significantly reduce future postretirement medical costs.

3.    Hanover Compressor Company

In August 2001, Schlumberger sold its Oilfield Services worldwide gas compression activity to Hanover Compressor Company. The proceeds included 8.7 million shares of
Hanover Compressor common stock, with a value at closing of $173 million, which is restricted from marketability until August 30, 2004, and a $150 million long-term subordinated note maturing December 15, 2005.

46  /  SLB

2003 FORM 10-K


Part II, Item 8

In the fourth quarter of 2003, Schlumberger sold the subordinated note for
$177 million and realized a pretax gain of $32 million ($20 million after-tax).

At December 31, 2003 the carrying value of
Schlumberger’s investment in Hanover Compressor common stock exceeded the market value. As required by generally accepted accounting principles (SFAS 115), Schlumberger wrote down its investment to the fair market value of $91.4 million at
December 31, 2003 and recorded a pretax and after-tax charge of $81.2 million.

As part of the sale agreement, Hanover Compressor had an
option to put its interest in the PIGAP II joint venture in Venezuela back to Schlumberger if certain financing conditions were not met. Hanover Compressor did not exercise this option.

4.    Charges – Continuing Operations

Schlumberger recorded the following charges/credits in continuing operations:

In December 2003, a pretax gain of $32 million ($20 million after-tax, $0.03 per share – diluted) resulting from the sale of the Hanover Compressor
note. The pretax gain is classified in

Interest and other income

in the

Consolidated Statement of Income

.

In December 2003, a
pretax and after-tax charge of $81 million ($0.13 per share – diluted) relating to the write-down to fair market value of Schlumberger’s investment in Hanover Compressor common stock. The write-down was required by SFAS 115 as the decline
in the market value of the stock is “other than temporary” and is classified in

Cost of goods sold and services

in the

Consolidated Statement of Income

.

In September 2003, a pretax multiclient library impairment charge of $398 million ($205 million, $0.34 per share – diluted, after a tax credit of
$106 million and a minority interest of $88 million), following an evaluation of current and expected future conditions in the seismic sector, a pretax seismic vessel impairment charge of $54 million ($38 million, $0.06 per share – diluted,
after a minority interest credit of $16 million) and a $31 million pretax and after-tax gain ($0.05 per share – diluted) on the sale of a drilling rig. The pretax amounts are classified in

Cost of goods sold and services

in the

Consolidated Statement of Income

Between June 12 and July 22, 2003 subsidiaries of Schlumberger launched and concluded tender
offers to acquire three series of outstanding European bonds; $1.3 billion of principal was repurchased for a total cost of $1.5 billion, which included the premium, and issuing and tender costs. The total charge on the tenders was $168 million, of
which $81.5 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2003, when the first tender closed, with the balance of $86.3 million recorded in the third quarter of 2003.

The total of the above 2003 charges was $440 million. A summary is as follows:

In December 2002, a
net charge of $3,081 million ($5.30 per share). On December 10, 2002, Schlumberger announced that the Board of Directors had approved an updated strategy for its SchlumbergerSema business segment. The new strategic plan outlook, current business
values and the reorganization of SchlumbergerSema constitute significant events that required an impairment analysis to be performed in accordance with FAS 142. SchlumbergerSema was ‘valued’ on a stand-alone basis; each reporting unit
within SchlumbergerSema

47  /  SLB

Part II, Item 8

was valued using a discounted cash flow analysis based on a long-term forecast prepared by
SchlumbergerSema management with the assistance of a third party valuation expert. The implied multiples yielded by the discounted cash flow analysis were compared to observed trading multiples of comparable companies and recent transactions in the
IT services industry to assess the fair value of the reporting units. The fair value was below the book value. As a result, goodwill was written down to its estimated fair value based on Schlumberger’s valuation. The impairment of goodwill
mainly reflects the current difficulties of the telecommunications industry and the severely depressed market values of the IT companies serving SchlumbergerSema’s sector. Certain intangible assets were also identified and written down as part
of this process.

Schlumberger recorded severance, facility and other costs in an effort to reduce costs at SchlumbergerSema and
WesternGeco. These costs related to expenses that offer no future benefit to the ongoing operations of these businesses. During the fourth quarter, Schlumberger also recorded an impairment charge, to reflect a change in the business projections of
the WesternGeco business, related to capitalized multiclient seismic library costs, a deferred tax valuation allowance and other costs.

The
total of the above 2002 charges was $3,168 million. A summary, including the gain on the sale of drilling rigs of $87 million, is as follows:

1.

Includes deferred tax valuation allowance of $94 million.

The above charges before tax and minority interest and the gain on sale of drilling rigs are recorded in

Cost of goods sold & services

.

In March 2002, a charge of $29 million (pretax $30 million and minority interest credit of $1 million; $0.05 per share – diluted)
related to the financial/economic crisis in Argentina where in January, the government eliminated all US dollar contracts and converted US dollar denominated accounts receivable into pesos. As a result, Schlumberger’s currency exposure
increased significantly. With currency devaluation, an exchange loss (net of hedging) on net assets, primarily customer receivables, was incurred. In addition, a provision was recorded for downsizing facilities and headcount. The small
SchlumbergerSema exposure in Argentina was also provided for. The pretax change is classified in

Cost of goods sold and services

in the

Consolidated Statement of Income

.

In December 2001, a pretax credit of $119 million (net – $5 million after-tax and minority interest, $0.01 per share – diluted), consisting
primarily of the following:

·

A credit of $223 million ($117 million after-tax) from the sale of the former Resource Management Services North American Water division.

·

A pretax charge of $43 million ($37 million after-tax) for employee termination costs, principally in Europe and the US, related to Oilfield Services and SchlumbergerSema in
response to the prevailing business conditions.

·

A tax charge for reorganization costs of $29 million.

Part II, Item 8

·

A further pretax charge of $28 million ($20 million after-tax) related to the second quarter estimated loss on the divestiture of certain Resource Management Services businesses
following the actual closing in the fourth quarter.

·

A $33 million pretax asset write-down ($23 million after-tax and minority interest) for technological impairment related to certain Land seismic assets in the newly formed joint
venture.

In September 2001, a pretax credit of
$42 million (after-tax $3 million) representing the gain on the sale of the worldwide gas compression business, partially offset by an impairment charge relating to the expected disposition of certain activities. The proceeds from the sale of the
worldwide gas compression business included $274 million in cash, a $150 million long-term subordinated note and newly issued Hanover Compressor Company shares with a value of $173 million. The shares have a three year marketability restriction. As
part of the transaction, Schlumberger agreed that the financing of a certain joint venture project (PIGAP II) would be non-recourse to the buyer and would be executed prior to December 31, 2002. Accordingly, Schlumberger was obligated with respect
to the financing to guarantee 30% (approximately $80 million) until the project was completed in late 2002. If as of December 31, 2002 refinancing had not become non-recourse to the buyer or the project has not achieved substantial completion, the
buyer has an option to put its interest in such joint venture back to Schlumberger. The gain on the sale of this joint venture was deferred and recognized in 2003.

In June 2001, a charge of $280 million ($0.48 per share – diluted) for the estimated impairment charge from the disposition of certain Resource Management Services businesses (Electricity and Water outside North
America and worldwide Gas businesses). This charge included the write-off of goodwill ($139 million) and cumulative translation adjustment ($79 million).

In March 2001, a charge of $25 million ($0.04 per share – diluted) for in-process research and development related to the Bull CP8 acquisition.

The above 2001 pretax amounts are recorded: an aggregated $119 million charge in

Cost of goods sold and services

, a $25 million charge in

Research & engineering

and a $10 million credit in

Minority interest

.

An analysis of the December 2002 pretax severance
and facility charges is as follows:

At December 31, 2003,
the Severance balance of $1.0 million is classified as

Accounts Payable and

Accrued Liabilities

and the Facilities balance of $11.1 million is classified in

Liabilities held for sale

on the

Consolidated Balance Sheet

.

The December 2001 charge included severance costs of $41 million (775 people) which have been paid.

5.    Acquisitions

Acquisition of Sema plc

On April 6, 2001, the offer for the shares of Sema plc was declared unconditional in all respects. The aggregate consideration for the
acquisition of 100% of the issued Sema shares was $5.15 billion (including expenses of the transaction) which was financed from existing cash resources and borrowings under a $3 billion credit facility.

49  /  SLB

2003 FORM 10-K


Part II, Item 8

The aggregate value of goodwill and identifiable intangibles comprised the
following:

Purchase accounting
adjustments consisted primarily of severance costs ($84 million – 1781 people), facility reductions ($33 million), pension plan adjustments ($136 million) and tax restructuring costs ($50 million). At December 31, 2001, $26 million (593 people)
of the severance costs had been paid. All remaining severance costs were paid in 2002.

For financial reporting purposes, Schlumberger
included the results of operations of Sema in its consolidated accounts commencing April 1, 2001. If Sema had been included in the consolidated financial statements of Schlumberger from January 1, consolidated revenue for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2001 would have increased by $538 million (unaudited) to $14.3 billion (unaudited) and consolidated net income would have decreased by approximately $140 million (unaudited), to $382 million (unaudited), related primarily to increased
interest expense and amortization of intangibles, and lower interest income.

Other
Acquisitions

During 2002, subsidiaries of Schlumberger acquired the
following:

·

In March, Inside Reality, a Norwegian based company specializing in virtual reality technology for the oil and gas industry. The acquisition price was $18 million in cash. Assets

6.    Sale of SchlumbergerSema to Atos Origin

On September 22, 2003, Schlumberger announced the signing of an agreement with Atos Origin
for the sale of the SchlumbergerSema business.

On January 29, 2004 the sale transaction was completed. As consideration for the
transaction, Schlumberger received €443 million ($550 million) in cash which included a working capital adjustment, and 19.3 million shares of common stock of Atos with a value of €1.02 billion ($1.275 billion), which represented
approximately 29% of the outstanding common shares of Atos Origin after the transaction was completed. Schlumberger expects the result of the sale will be a gain which will be recorded as part of

Discontinued Operations

in the first quarter
of 2004.

On February 2, 2004 Schlumberger sold 9.6 million of the Atos Origin shares for a net consideration of €500 million ($625
million). As a result of this sale, Schlumberger’s investment was reduced to approximately 15% of the outstanding common shares of Atos Origin. Schlumberger will account for the remaining investment in Atos Origin on the cost method.

16.    Long-term Debt

A summary of long-term debt by currency, analyzed by Bonds, Commercial Paper (CP) and Other,
at December 31 follows:

On June 9, 2003,
Schlumberger Limited issued $850 million aggregate principal amount of 1.5% Series A Convertible Debentures due June 1, 2023 and $450 million aggregate principal amount of 2.125% Series B Convertible Debentures due June 1, 2023. On July 2, 2003,
Schlumberger Limited issued an additional $125 million aggregate principal amount of the Series A debentures pursuant to an option granted to the initial purchasers.

The debentures were sold to Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Goldman, Sachs & Co. pursuant to an exemption from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. The debentures were resold, with
registration rights, by the initial purchasers in transactions exempt from registration under Rule 144A of the Securities Act. The aggregate offering price of the debentures was $1.425 billion, the initial purchasers’ discount was $25.4 million
and the net proceeds to Schlumberger Limited were $1.4 billion.

The Series A debentures and the Series B debentures are convertible, at the
holders’ option, into shares of common stock of Schlumberger Limited. Holders of the Series A debentures may convert their debentures into common stock at a conversion rate of 13.8255 shares for each $1,000 principal amount of Series A
debentures (equivalent to an initial conversion price of $72.33 per share). Holders of the Series B debentures may convert their debentures into common stock at a conversion rate of 12.5 shares for each $1,000 principal amount of Series B debentures
(equivalent to an initial conversion price of $80.00 per share). Each conversion rate may be adjusted for certain events, but it will not be adjusted for accrued interest.

On or after June 6, 2008 (in the case of the Series A debentures) or June 6, 2010 (in the case of the Series B debentures), Schlumberger may redeem for cash all or part of the applicable series of debentures, upon
notice to the holders, at the redemption prices of 100% of the principal amount of the debentures, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. On June 1, 2008, June 1, 2013, and June 1, 2018, holders of Series A debentures may
require Schlumberger to repurchase their Series A debentures. On June 1, 2010, June 1, 2013 and June 1, 2018, holders of Series B debentures may require Schlumberger to repurchase their Series B debentures. The repurchase price will be 100% of the
principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date. The repurchase price for repurchases on June 1, 2008 (in the case of the Series A debentures) and June 1, 2010 (in the case of the Series B debentures) will
be paid in cash. On the other repurchase dates, Schlumberger may choose to pay the repurchase price in cash or common stock or any combination of cash and common stock. In addition, upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change, holders may require
Schlumberger to repurchase all or a portion of their debentures, in cash or, at Schlumberger’s election, common stock valued at 99% of its market price or any combination of cash and common stock, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The debentures will mature on June 1, 2023 unless earlier redeemed or repurchased.

Part II, Item 8

Between June 12 and July 22, 2003, certain subsidiaries of Schlumberger
launched and concluded a tender offer on three of its outstanding European bonds. The companies bought back $1.3 billion of principal of these bonds for a total cost of $1.5 billion, which includes the premium, and issuing and tender costs. The
total charge on the tender was $168 million.

Commercial paper borrowings are classified as long-term debt to the extent of their backup by
available and unused committed facilities maturing in more than one-year and the intent to maintain these obligations for longer than one year.

Long-term debt on December 31, 2003, is due as follows $552 million in 2005, $314 million in 2006, $1,755 million in 2007, $1,394 million in 2008 and $2,082 million thereafter.

On December 31, 2003, interest rate swap arrangements outstanding were: pay fixed/receive floating on US dollar debt of $500 million; pay fixed/receive
floating on Japanese yen debt of $37 million. These arrangements mature at various dates to December 2009. Interest rate swap arrangements increased consolidated interest expense in 2003 by $30 million.

17.    Lines of Credit

On December 31, 2003, wholly owned subsidiaries of Schlumberger had separate lines of credit
agreements aggregating $6.7 billion with commercial banks, of which $6.5 billion was committed and $2.6 billion was available and unused. It included $3.7 billion of committed facilities, which support borrowings under commercial paper programs in
the United States and Europe, maturing in January 2007. On December 31, 2003 a principal subsidiary of Schlumberger in the United States canceled its $500 million 364-day backstop facility. Interest rates and other terms of borrowing under these
lines of credit vary from country to country.

18.    Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities

Schlumberger uses derivative
instruments such as interest rate swaps, currency swaps, forward currency contracts and foreign currency options. Forward currency contracts provide a hedge against currency fluctuations on assets/liabilities denominated in other than a functional
currency. Options are usually entered into as a hedge against currency variations on firm commitments generally involving the construction of long-lived assets.

Schlumberger maintains a foreign-currency risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to protect its interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency
exchange rates. Movements in foreign currency exchange rates pose a risk to Schlumberger’s operations as exchange rate changes may affect profitability and cash flow. Schlumberger uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts, swaps and
options. Schlumberger also maintains an interest rate risk management strategy that uses fixed rate debt and derivatives to minimize significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations caused by interest rate volatility.

Schlumberger’s specific goals are (1) to manage interest rate sensitivity by modifying the repricing or maturity characteristics of certain of its
debt and (2) to lower (where possible) the cost of borrowed funds.

By using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposure to changes
in exchange rates and interest rates, Schlumberger exposes itself to credit risk and market risk. Schlumberger minimizes the credit risk by entering into transactions with high-quality counterparties, limiting the exposure to each counterparty and
monitoring the financial condition of its counterparties. Market risk is managed through the setting and monitoring of parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk which are acceptable.

At December 31, 2003, Schlumberger recognized a net $23 million charge in Stockholders’ Equity relating to derivative instruments and hedging
activities. This charge was primarily due to the change in the fair market value of Schlumberger’s US interest rate swaps as a result of declining interest rates.

Schlumberger is authorized to issue 1,500,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of which 585,948,328 and 582,173,115 shares were outstanding on December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Schlumberger is also authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of cumulative preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, which may be
issued in series with terms and conditions determined by the Board of Directors. No shares of preferred stock have been issued. Holders of common stock and preferred stock are entitled to one vote for each share of stock held.

20.    Stock Compensation Plans

As of December 31, 2003, Schlumberger had two types of stock-based compensation plans, which
are described below. Effective January 1, 2003, Schlumberger adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS Nos. 123 and 148. Schlumberger recorded stock option and discounted stock purchase plan (DSPP) expenses in the

Consolidated
Statement of Income

starting in the third quarter of 2003 on a prospective basis for grants after January 1, 2003. The effect of this adoption on 2003 net income was $13 million ($0.02 per share). Schlumberger applies the intrinsic value method
of APB 25 for grants prior to January 1, 2003. Had compensation cost for the stock-based Schlumberger plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under those plans, consistent with the method of SFAS 123, Schlumberger
net income and earnings per share would have been the pro forma amounts indicated below:

Stock Option Plans

During 2003, 2002, 2001 and in prior years, officers and key employees were granted stock
options under Schlumberger stock option plans. For all of the stock options granted, the exercise price of each option equals the market price of Schlumberger stock on the date of grant; an option’s maximum term is generally ten years, and
options generally vest in increments over four or five years, and with respect to the July 2003 grant awards were capped at 125% of exercise price.

As required by SFAS 123, the fair value of each grant is estimated on the
date of grant using the multiple option Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions used for 2003, 2002 and 2001: dividend of $0.75; expected volatility of 34%-37% for 2003 grants, 32%-36% for 2002 grants and
32-35% for 2001 grants; risk-free interest rates for the 2003 grants of 2.83%-3.51% for officers and all other employees; risk-free interest rates for the 2002 grants of 4.34%-5.25% for officers and 3.04%-4.73% for the 2002 grants to all other
employees; risk-free interest rates for the 2001 grants of 4.91% for officers and 3.87%-5.01% for the 2001 grants to all other employees; and expected option lives of 4.71 years for officers and other employees for 2003 grants, expected option lives
of 6.6 years for officers and 5.07 years for other employees for 2002 grants, expected option lives of 5.51 years for officers and 5.02 years for other employees for 2001 grants.

A summary of the status of the Schlumberger stock option plans as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, and changes during the years ending on those dates
is presented below:

The following table
summarizes information concerning currently outstanding and exercisable options by five ranges of exercise prices on December 31, 2003:

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Under the Schlumberger Discounted Stock Purchase Plan, Schlumberger
is authorized to issue up to 22,012,245 shares of common stock to its employees. Under the terms of the Plan, employees can choose to have up to 10% of their annual earnings withheld to purchase Schlumberger common stock. Effective July 1, 2003 the
purchase price of the stock was 92.5% of the lower of its beginning or end of the Plan year market price at six month intervals. Prior to July 1, 2003, the purchase price was 85% at one year intervals. Under the Plan, Schlumberger sold 2,464,088,
2,677,842 and 1,752,833 shares to employees in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Pro forma compensation cost has been computed for the fair value of the employees’ purchase rights, which was estimated using the Black-Scholes model with the
following assumptions for 2003, 2002 and 2001: Dividend of $0.75; expected volatility of 28% for 2003, 34% for 2002 and 36% for 2001; and risk-free interest rates of 0.75% for 2003, 1.74% for 2002, 3.03% for 2001. The weighted-average fair value of
those purchase rights granted in 2003, 2002 and 2001, was $7.910, $13.324 and $15.540, respectively.

21.    Income Tax Expense

Schlumberger and its subsidiaries operate in more than 100 taxing jurisdictions where
statutory tax rates generally vary from 0% to 50%.

In 2003, the pretax loss in the US included the WesternGeco multiclient impairment
charge of $283 million and a net pretax charge of $32 million related to Hanover Compressor. In 2002, pretax book income in the US included gains from a business divestiture aggregating approximately $143 million. Pretax book income from continuing
operations subject to US and non-US income taxes for each of the three years ended December 31, was as follows:

Schlumberger had net
deferred tax assets at December 31, 2003 of $632 million including a valuation allowance of $325 million relating to a certain European net operating loss, and $583 million at December 31, 2002. Significant components of net deferred tax assets at
December 31, 2003 included postretirement and other long-term benefits ($213 million), current employee benefits ($183 million), fixed assets, inventory and other ($194 million) and net operating losses ($367 million less a partial valuation
allowance of $325 million). At December 31, 2002, it included postretirement and other long-term benefits ($200 million), current employee benefits ($225 million), fixed assets, inventory and other ($123 million) and net operating losses ($182
million less a valuation allowance of $147 million).

The components of consolidated income tax expense from continuing operations were as
follows:

Schlumberger reported
several charges/credits in continuing operations in each of the three years. These are more fully described in the note

22.    Leases and Lease Commitments

Total rental expense was $532 million in 2003, $458 million in 2002 and $390 million in
2001. Future minimum rental commitments under noncancelable leases for years ending December 31 are: $344 million in 2004; $281 million in 2005; $241 million in 2006; $191 million in 2007; and $175 million in 2008. For the ensuing three five-year
periods, these commitments decrease from $258 million to $3 million. The minimum rentals over the remaining terms of the leases aggregate to $24 million.

23.    Contingencies

The Consolidated Balance Sheet includes accruals for the estimated future costs associated with certain environmental remediation activities related to the past use or
disposal of hazardous materials. Substantially all such costs relate to divested operations and to facilities or locations that are no longer in operation. Due to a number of uncertainties, including uncertainty of timing, the scope of remediation,
future technology, regulatory changes, the risk of personal injury, natural resource or property damage claims and other factors, it is possible that the ultimate remediation costs may exceed the amounts estimated. However, in the opinion of
management, such additional costs are not expected to be material relative to consolidated liquidity, financial position or future results of operations.

In addition, Schlumberger and its subsidiaries are party to various other legal proceedings. Although the ultimate disposition of these proceedings is not presently determinable, in the opinion of Schlumberger any
liability that might ensue would not be material in relation to the consolidated liquidity, financial position or future results of operations.

Schlumberger’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and receivables from clients. Schlumberger places its cash and cash equivalents with financial
institutions and corporations, and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one of them. Schlumberger actively evaluates the creditworthiness of the issuers in which it invests. The receivables from clients are concentrated within a few
significant industries and geographies.

24.    Segment
Information

Schlumberger operates four reportable business segments:
Oilfield Services (OFS), WesternGeco, SchlumbergerSema (SLSEMA) and Other. The current SchlumbergerSema segment only includes operations that were sold to Atos Origin on January 29, 2004. The segment information has been reclassified to conform to
the current year presentation.

The Oilfield Services segment falls into four clearly defined economic and geographical areas and is
evaluated on the following basis: North America is a major self-contained market; Latin America comprises regional markets that share a common dependence on the United States; Europe is a major self-contained market that includes the CIS and West
Africa, whose economy is increasingly linked to that of Europe; Middle East & Asia includes the remainder of the Eastern Hemisphere, which consists of many countries at different stages of economic development that share a common dependence on
the oil and gas industry. The Oilfield Services segment provides virtually all exploration and production services required during the life of an oil and gas reservoir. Schlumberger believes that all the products/services are interrelated and
expects similar performance from each.

The WesternGeco segment provides comprehensive worldwide reservoir imaging, monitoring, and
development services, with extensive seismic crews and data processing centers, as well as a large multiclient seismic library. Services range from 3D and time-lapse (4D) seismic surveys to multi-component surveys for delineating prospects and
reservoir management. WesternGeco is 70% owned by Schlumberger and 30% owned by Baker Hughes.

The SchlumbergerSema segment falls into three
clearly defined economic and geographic areas and is evaluated on the following basis: North and South America is a major self-contained market; Europe is a major

self-contained market that includes the Middle East and Africa; Asia includes the remainder
of the Eastern Hemisphere. The SchlumbergerSema segment is a leading information technology services company providing domain expertise and global capabilities delivered on a local basis. SchlumbergerSema has proven capabilities delivering
consulting, systems integration, managed services and products serving the energy & utilities, finance, transport and public sector markets.

On September 22, 2003, Schlumberger announced the signing of an agreement with Atos Origin for the sale of the SchlumbergerSema business. The sale closed on January 29, 2004.

The Other segment comprises principally the Axalto (Cards and Point-of-Sale Terminals), Electricity Meters, Business Continuity, Infodata, Telecom
Software Products, Water Services, Essentis and Payphones activities. In 2001, also included is the divested Resource Management Services business.

Financial information for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, by segment, is as follows:

Oilfield Services net income eliminations include certain headquarters
administrative costs which are not allocated geographically, manufacturing and certain other operations, and costs maintained at the Oilfield Services level.

SchlumbergerSema net income eliminations include certain headquarters administrative costs which are not allocated geographically and other costs maintained at the SchlumbergerSema level.

Corporate income eliminations principally comprise the amortization of goodwill (in 2001) and other intangibles, as well as nonoperating expenses, such as
certain intersegment charges and interest expense (except as shown above), which are not included in the segments’ income. Corporate assets largely comprise short-term investments and fixed income investments, held to maturity.

During the three years ended December 31, 2003, no single customer exceeded 10% of consolidated revenue.

Schlumberger did not have revenue from third-party customers in its country of domicile during the last three years. In each of the three years, only
revenue in the US exceeded 10% of consolidated revenue. Revenue in the US in 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $3.8 billion, $4.0 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively.

Interest expense excludes amounts which are included in the segments’ income (2003 – $5 million: 2002 – $4 million: 2001 – $5 million).

Depreciation & Amortization and Capital Expenditure include Multiclient seismic data costs.

25.    Pension and Other Benefit Plans

US Pension Plans

Schlumberger and its US subsidiary sponsor several defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all employees. The benefits are
based on years of service and compensation on a career-average pay basis. These plans are funded through a trust in respect to past and current service. Charges to expense are based upon costs computed by independent actuaries. The funding policy is
to annually contribute amounts that are allowable for federal income tax purposes. These contributions are intended to provide for benefits earned to date and those expected to be earned in the future. The contribution in 2004 is expected to be
between $40 million and $150 million.

The assumed discount rate, compensation increases and return on plan assets used to determine pension
expense were as follows:

Part II, Item 8

The change in the projected benefit obligation, plan assets and funded status
of the plans on December 31, 2003 and 2002, was as follows:

The combined market
performance over the last three years and declining interest rates have decreased the value of assets held in the US pension plans and has correspondingly increased the amount by which the pension plans are under-funded. As a result of the decline
in the value of the pension plan assets and a decline in the interest rates, which increases the present value of the benefit obligations, Schlumberger has recorded a cumulative non-cash pretax charge to

Stockholders’ Equity

of $219
million ($136 million after-tax). A recovery in market returns in future periods would reverse a portion of the charge.

The assumed
discount rate, the rate of compensation increases and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used to determine the projected benefit obligations were as follows:

Part II, Item 8

The following is a breakdown of the plan assets:

The asset allocation
objectives are to diversify the portfolio among several asset classes to reduce volatility while maintaining an asset mix that provide the highest expected rate of return consistent with an acceptable level of risk. The investment strategies include
a rebalancing of the asset mix as necessary to the previously defined levels and reassessing funding levels and asset allocation strategy at least annually. In order to increase diversification and limit management risk, Schlumberger generally does
not allocate more than 15% of fund assets to a single investment manager.

The expected long-term rate of return on assets is 8.5%. This
assumption represents the rate of return on plan assets reflecting the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. The assumption has been
determined by reflecting expectations regarding future rates of return for the portfolio considering the asset distribution and related historical rates of return. The appropriateness of the assumption is reviewed at least annually. The pension
trust’s performance over the last 10 years has been an annualized return of 9.2%.

Non-US Pension Plans

Outside the US, subsidiaries of
Schlumberger sponsor several defined benefit and defined contribution plans that cover substantially all employees who are not covered by statutory plans. For defined benefit plans, charges to expense are based upon costs computed by independent
actuaries. These plans are funded through trusts in respect to past and current service. For all defined benefit plans, pension expense was $87 million, $58 million and $52 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Based on plan assets and the
projected benefit obligation, the only significant defined benefit plan is in the UK.

The assumed discount rate, compensation increases and
return on plan assets used to determine pension expense were as follows:

Net pension cost in
the UK plan for 2003, 2002 and 2001 (including the Sema plc plans) (translated into US dollars at the average exchange rate for the periods), included the following components:

Part II, Item 8

The change in the projected benefit obligation, plan assets and funded status
of the plan (translated into US dollars at year-end exchange rates) was as follows:

The combined market
performance over the last three years and declining interest rates have decreased the value of assets held in the UK pension plans and has correspondingly increased the amount by which the pension plans are under-funded. As a result of the decline
in the value of the pension plan assets and a decline in the interest rates, which increased the present value of the benefit obligations, Schlumberger has recorded a cumulative non-cash pretax charge to

Stockholders’ Equity

of $209
million ($147 million after-tax). A recovery in market returns in future periods would reverse a portion of the charge.

The assumed discount rate and rate of compensation increases used to determine the projected benefit obligation were as follows:

Part II, Item 8

The following is a breakdown of the plan assets:

The trustees of all
the UK plans determine their investment strategy with regard to the liability profile of each Fund on an individual basis and have determined benchmarks which they believe provides an adequate balance between maximizing the return on the assets and
minimizing the risk of failing to meet the liabilities over the long-term.

Overall, the trustees of each plan aim to have a sufficiently
diversified portfolio of appropriate liquidity, which will generate income and capital growth to meet, together with new contributions from members and the employers, the cost of current and future liabilities which each plan provides. They achieve
this by using active investment managers who are set specific benchmarks and various restrictions to avoid undue concentration of assets. As the plans mature, the Trustees review the appropriateness of their investment strategy.

The overall expected return on assets assumption is derived as the weighted average of the expected returns from each of the main asset classes. The
expected return for each asset class reflects a combination of historical performance analysis, the forward looking views of the financial markets (as suggested by the yields available) and the views of investment organizations. Consideration is
also given to the rate of return expected to be available for reinvestment. The pension trusts’ performance over the last 10 years has been an annualized return of 5.3%.

For defined contribution plans, funding and cost are generally based upon a predetermined percentage of employee compensation. Charges to expense in 2003,
2002 and 2001, were $47 million, $44 million and $32 million, respectively.

Other
Deferred Benefits

In addition to providing pension benefits,
Schlumberger and its subsidiaries have other deferred benefit programs, primarily profit sharing. Expenses for these programs were $137 million, $143 million and $192 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Health Care Benefits

Schlumberger and its US subsidiary provide health care benefits for certain active employees. The cost of providing these benefits is
recognized as expense when incurred and aggregated $70 million, $79 million and $68 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Outside the US, such benefits are mostly provided through government-sponsored programs.

Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions

Schlumberger and its US subsidiary provide certain health care benefits to former employees
who have retired under the US pension plans.

The principal actuarial assumptions used to measure costs were a discount rate of 6.75% in
2003, 7.25% in 2002 and 7.5% in 2001. The overall medical cost trend rate assumption is 10.8% graded to 5% over the next six years and 5% thereafter.

Part II, Item 8

Net periodic postretirement benefit cost in the US for 2003, 2002 and 2001,
included the following components:

The change in
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and funded status on December 31, 2003 and 2002, was as follows:

The components of the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation on December 31, 2003 and 2002, were as follows:

The assumed discount
rate used to determine the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 6.25% for 2003 and 6.75% for 2002.

If the assumed medical cost
trend rate was increased by one percentage point, health care cost in 2003 would have been $99 million, and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation would have been $1.12 billion on December 31, 2003.

If the assumed medical cost trend rate was decreased by one percentage point, health care cost in 2003 would have been $67 million, and the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation would have been $790 million on December 31, 2003.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, of stockholder’s equity and of cash flows present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Schlumberger Limited and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in 2003 the Company changed its accounting method for stock options.

As discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in 2002 the Company changed its accounting method for goodwill.

Item 9A    Controls and Procedures

At the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of Schlumberger’s management, including the Chief Executive officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial
Officer (“CFO”), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Schlumberger’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a – 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). Based on that
evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that Schlumberger’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2003 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Schlumberger in reports that it files or submits
