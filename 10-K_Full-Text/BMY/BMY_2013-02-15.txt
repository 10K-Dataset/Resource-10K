PART I

Item 1.

BUSINESS.

General

Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (which may be referred to as Bristol-Myers Squibb, BMS, the Company, we, our or us) was incorporated under
the laws of the State of Delaware in August 1933 under the name Bristol-Myers Company, as successor to a New York business started in 1887. In 1989, Bristol-Myers Company changed its name to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company as a result of a merger. We
are engaged in the discovery, development, licensing, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sale of biopharmaceutical products on a global basis.

Over the last few years, we executed our strategy to transform into a next generation biopharmaceutical company. This transformation encompassed all areas of our business and operations. As part of this
strategy, we have divested our non-pharmaceutical businesses, implemented our acquisition and licensing strategy known as the “string-of-pearls”, and executed our productivity transformation initiative (PTI). Our divestitures included
Medical Imaging in January 2008, ConvaTec in August 2008, and Mead Johnson in December 2009. Our acquisition and licensing transactions included Kosan Biosciences, Inc. in June 2008, Medarex, Inc. (Medarex) in September 2009, ZymoGenetics, Inc.
(ZymoGenetics) in October 2010, Amira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Amira) in September 2011, Inhibitex, Inc. (Inhibitex) in February 2012, and Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Amylin) in August 2012 as well as several license and other collaboration
arrangements. We continue to review our cost structure with the intent to maintain a modernized, efficient, and robust balance between building competitive advantages, securing innovative products and planning for the future.

We operate in one segment—BioPharmaceuticals. For additional information about business segments, see “Item 8. Financial
Statements—Note 2. Business Segment Information.”

We compete with other worldwide research-based drug companies,
smaller research companies and generic drug manufacturers. Our products are sold worldwide, primarily to wholesalers, retail pharmacies, hospitals, government entities and the medical profession. We manufacture products in the United States (U.S.),
Puerto Rico and in 6 foreign countries.

The percentage of total net sales by significant region were as follows:

Products

Our pharmaceutical products include chemically-synthesized drugs, or small molecules, and an increasing portion of products produced from biological processes (typically involving recombinant DNA
technology), called “biologics.” Small molecule drugs are typically administered orally, e.g., in the form of a pill or tablet, although other drug delivery mechanisms are used as well. Biologics are typically administered to patients
through injections or by infusion. Most of our revenues come from products in the following therapeutic classes: cardiovascular; virology, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; oncology; neuroscience; immunoscience; and metabolics.

In the pharmaceutical industry, the majority of an innovative product’s commercial value is usually realized during the
period in which the product has market exclusivity. Our business is focused on innovative biopharmaceutical products, and we rely on patent rights and various forms of regulatory protection to maintain the market exclusivity of our products. In the
U.S., the European Union (EU) and some other countries, when these patent rights and other forms of exclusivity expire and generic versions of a medicine are approved and marketed, there are often substantial and rapid declines in the sales of the
original innovative product. For further discussion of patent rights and regulatory forms of exclusivity, see “—Intellectual Property and Product Exclusivity” below. For further discussion of the impact of generic competition on our
business, see “—

Generic Competition

” below.

The following chart shows our key products together with
the year in which the earliest basic exclusivity loss (patent rights or data exclusivity) occurred or is currently estimated to occur in the U.S., the EU, Japan and Canada. We also sell our pharmaceutical products in other countries; however, data
is not provided on a country-by-country basis because individual country sales are not


significant outside the U.S., the EU, Japan, China and Canada. In many instances, the basic exclusivity loss date listed below is the expiration date of the patent that claims the active
ingredient of the drug or the method of using the drug for the approved indication, if there is only one approved indication. In some instances, the basic exclusivity loss date listed in the chart is the expiration date of the data exclusivity
period. In situations where there is only data exclusivity without patent protection, a competitor could seek regulatory approval by submitting its own clinical trial data to obtain marketing approval prior to the expiration of data exclusivity.

We estimate the market exclusivity period for each of our products for the purposes of business planning only. The length of
market exclusivity for any of our products is impossible to predict with certainty because of the complex interaction between patent and regulatory forms of exclusivity and the inherent uncertainties regarding patent litigation. There can be no
assurance that a particular product will enjoy market exclusivity for the full period of time that appears in the estimate or that the exclusivity will be limited to the estimate.

The following schedule presents net sales of our key products and estimated basic exclusivity loss in the U.S., EU, Japanese, Chinese and
Canadian markets:

Note: The currently estimated earliest year of basic exclusivity loss includes any
statutory extensions of exclusivity that have been granted. In some instances, we may be able to obtain an additional six months exclusivity for a product based on the pediatric extension. In certain other instances, there may be later-expiring
patents that cover particular forms or compositions of the drug, as well as methods of manufacturing or methods of using the drug. Such patents may sometimes result in a favorable market position for our products, but product exclusivity cannot be
predicted or assured. Under the U.S. healthcare law enacted in 2010, qualifying biologic products will receive 12 years of data exclusivity before a biosimilar can enter the market, as described in more detail in “—Intellectual Property
and Product Exclusivity” below.

There is uncertainty about China’s exclusivity laws which has resulted in generic competition in the China market.

(a)

References to the EU throughout this Form 10-K include all 27 member states of the European Union during the year ended December 31, 2012.
Basic patent applications have not been filed in all 27 current member states for all of the listed products. In some instances, the date of basic exclusivity loss will be different in various EU member states. For those EU countries where the basic
patent was not obtained, there may be data protection available.

(b)

Data exclusivity in the EU expired in July 2008. In most of the major markets within Europe, the product has national patents, expiring in 2013,
which specifically claim the bisulfate form of clopidogrel. However, generic and alternate salt forms of clopidogrel bisulfate are marketed and compete with

Plavix*

throughout the EU.

(c)

Our rights to commercialize

Abilify*

Exclusivity period relates to the

Sustiva

brand and does not include exclusivity related to any combination therapy. The composition of
matter patent for efavirenz in the U.S. expires in 2013, but a method of use patent for the treatment of HIV infection expires in 2014. Pediatric exclusivity has been granted, which provides an additional six month period of exclusivity added to the
term of the patents listed in the Orange Book.

(h)

Exclusivity period relates to the

Sustiva

brand and does not include exclusivity related to any combination therapy. Market exclusivity for

Sustiva

is expected to expire in 2013 in countries in the EU. Data exclusivity for

Sustiva

expired in the EU in 2009.

(i)

In February 2013, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware invalidated the composition of matter patent covering

Baraclude

, which
was scheduled to expire in 2015. We may face generic competition with this product beginning in 2013.

(j)

Biologic product approved under a Biologics License Application (BLA). Data exclusivity in the U.S. expires in 2016. There is no patent that
specifically claims the composition of matter of cetuximab, the active ingredient in

Erbitux*

. Our rights to commercialize cetuximab terminate in 2018.

(k)

Exclusivity period is based on regulatory data protection.

(l)

Data exclusivity in Canada expires in 2014.

(m)

Exclusivity period is based on method of use patent. The composition of matter patent has expired.

(n)

Exclusivity period is based on formulation patents.


Below is a summary of the indication, intellectual property position, product partner, if any, and
third-party manufacturing arrangements, if any, for each of the above products in the U.S. and, where applicable, the EU, Japan and Canada.






Research and Development

We invest heavily in research and development (R&D) because we believe it is critical to our long-term competitiveness. We have major R&D facilities in Princeton, Hopewell and New Brunswick, New
Jersey, and Wallingford, Connecticut. Pharmaceutical research and development is also carried out at various other facilities throughout the world, including in Belgium, the UK, India and other sites in the U.S. We supplement our internal drug
discovery and development programs with alliances and collaborative agreements. These agreements bring new products into the pipeline and help us remain on the cutting edge of technology in the search for novel medicines. In drug development, we
engage the services of physicians, hospitals, medical schools and other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of new products. Management continues to emphasize leadership, innovation,
productivity and quality as strategies for success in our research and development activities.

We concentrate our
biopharmaceutical research and development efforts in the following disease areas with significant unmet medical need: affective (psychiatric) disorders, Alzheimer’s/dementia, cardiovascular, diabetes, hepatitis, HIV/Acquired Immunodeficiency
Syndrome (AIDS), oncology, immunologic disorders and fibrotic disease. We also continue to analyze and may selectively pursue promising leads in other areas. In addition to discovering and developing new molecular entities, we look for ways to
expand the value of existing products through new indications and formulations that can provide additional benefits to patients.

In order for a new drug to reach the market, industry practice and government regulations in the U.S., the EU and most foreign countries provide for the determination of a drug’s effectiveness and
safety through preclinical tests and controlled clinical evaluation. The clinical development of a potential new drug includes Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials that have been designed specifically to support a new drug application for
a particular indication, assuming the trials are successful.

Phase I clinical trials involve a small number of healthy
patients or patients suffering from the indicated disease to test for safety and proper dosing. Phase II clinical trials involve a larger patient population to investigate side effects, efficacy, and optimal dosage of the drug candidate. Phase III
clinical trials are conducted to confirm Phase II results in a significantly larger patient population over a longer term and to provide reliable and conclusive data regarding the safety and efficacy of a drug candidate.

The R&D process typically takes thirteen years or longer, with nearly three years often spent in Phase III, or late-stage,
development. We consider our R&D programs in Phase III, or late-stage development, to be our significant R&D programs. These programs include both investigational compounds in Phase III development for initial indications and marketed
products that are in Phase III development for additional indications or formulations.

Drug development is time consuming,
expensive and risky. On average, only about one in 10,000 chemical compounds discovered by pharmaceutical industry researchers proves to be both medically effective and safe enough to become an approved medicine. Drug candidates can fail at any
stage of the process, and even late-stage product candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval. According to the KMR Group, based on industry success rates from 2007-2011, approximately 95% of the compounds that enter Phase I development
fail to achieve regulatory approval. The failure rate for compounds that enter Phase II development is approximately 88% and for compounds that enter Phase III development, it is approximately 46%.

Total research and development expenses include the costs of discovery research, preclinical development, early- and late-clinical
development and drug formulation, as well as post-commercialization and medical support of marketed products, proportionate allocations of enterprise-wide costs, and other appropriate costs. Research and development spending was $3.9 billion in
2012, $3.8 billion in 2011 and $3.6 billion in 2010 and includes payments under third-party collaborations and contracts. At the end of 2012, we employed approximately 8,000 people in R&D activities, including a substantial number of physicians,
scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees and higher-skilled technical personnel.

We manage our R&D programs on
a portfolio basis, investing resources in each stage of research and development from early discovery through late-stage development. We continually evaluate our portfolio of R&D assets to ensure that there is an appropriate balance of
early-stage and late-stage programs to support the future growth of the Company. Spending on our late-stage development programs represents approximately 30-40% of our annual R&D expenses. No individual investigational compound or marketed
product represented 10% or more of our R&D expenses in any of the last three years.


Listed below are several late-stage investigational compounds that we have in Phase III
clinical trials for at least one potential indication. Whether or not any of these or our other investigational compounds ultimately becomes one of our marketed products depends on the results of clinical studies, the competitive landscape of the
potential product’s market and the manufacturing processes necessary to produce the potential product on a commercial scale, among other factors. However, as noted above, there can be no assurance that we will seek regulatory approval of any of
these compounds or that, if such approval is sought, it will be obtained. There is also no assurance that a compound that is approved will be commercially successful. At this stage of development, we cannot determine all intellectual property issues
or all the patent protection that may, or may not, be available for these investigational compounds. The patent coverage highlighted below includes only patent term extensions that have been granted.

During 2012, we provided notice of the termination of our global codevelopment and cocommercialization
arrangement for necitumumab (IMC-11F8), a fully human monoclonal antibody being investigated as an anticancer treatment, which was discovered by ImClone and is part of the alliance between the Company and Lilly, with all rights returning to Lilly.
The termination is effective May 2014, though we and Lilly may terminate earlier.

During 2012, we terminated our development
program for brivanib, which was in Phase III trials as an anti-cancer treatment with potential use in hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal cancer.


The following table lists potential additional indications and/or formulations of key
marketed products that are in Phase III development or currently under regulatory review:

The following key developments are currently expected to occur during 2013 with respect to our
significant pipeline programs. The outcome and timing of these expected developments are dependent upon a number of factors including, among other things, the availability of data, the outcome of certain clinical trials, acceptance of presentations
at certain medical meetings and/or actions by health authorities. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update this information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.


Strategic Alliances and Collaborations

We enter into strategic alliances and collaborations with third parties that transfer rights to develop, manufacture, market and/or sell
pharmaceutical products that are owned by other parties. These alliances and collaborations include licensing arrangements, codevelopment and comarketing agreements, copromotion arrangements and joint ventures. Such alliances and arrangements reduce
the risk of incurring all research and development expenses for compounds that do not lead to revenue-generating products. However, profitability on alliance products are generally lower because profits from alliance products are shared with our
alliance partners. We actively pursue such arrangements and view alliances as an important complement to our own discovery and development activities.

Each of our strategic alliances and arrangements with third parties who own the rights to manufacture, market and/or sell pharmaceutical products contain customary early termination provisions typically
found in agreements of this kind and are generally based on the other party’s material breach or bankruptcy (voluntary or involuntary) and product safety concerns. The amount of notice required for early termination generally ranges from
immediately upon notice to 180 days after receipt of notice. Termination immediately upon notice is generally available where the other party files a voluntary bankruptcy petition or if a material safety issue arises with a product such that the
medical risk/benefit is incompatible with the welfare of patients to continue to develop or commercialize this product. Termination upon 30 to 90 days notice is generally available where an involuntary bankruptcy petition has been filed (and has not
been dismissed) or a material breach by the other party has occurred (and not been cured). A number of alliance agreements also permit the collaborator or us to terminate without cause, typically exercisable with substantial advance written notice
and often exercisable only after a specified period of time has elapsed after the collaboration agreement is signed. Our strategic alliances and arrangements typically do not otherwise contain provisions that provide the other party the right to
terminate the alliance on short notice.

In general, we do not retain any rights to a product brought to an alliance by
another party or to the other party’s intellectual property after an alliance terminates. The loss of rights to one or more products that are marketed and sold by us pursuant to a strategic alliance arrangement could be material to our results
of operations and cash flows, and, in the case of

Plavix*

or

Abilify*

, could be material to our financial condition and liquidity. As is customary in the pharmaceutical industry, the terms of our strategic alliances and arrangements
generally are co-extensive with the exclusivity period and may vary on a country-by-country basis.

Our most significant
current alliances and arrangements for both currently marketed products and investigational compounds are described below.

Current
Marketed Products—In-Licensed

Sanofi

In September 2012, BMS and Sanofi restructured the terms of the
codevelopment and cocommercialization agreements discussed below. Effective as of January 1, 2013, subject in certain countries to the receipt of regulatory approvals, Sanofi will assume the worldwide operations of the alliance with the
exception of

Plavix*

for the U.S. and Puerto Rico. The alliance for

Plavix*

in these two markets will continue unchanged through December 2019 under the same terms as in the original alliance arrangements. BMS will return to Sanofi its
rights and receive quarterly royalties from January 1, 2013 until December 31, 2018 and a terminal payment from Sanofi of $200 million at the end of 2018. All ongoing disputes between the companies have been resolved, including a one-time
payment of $80 million by BMS to Sanofi related to the

Avalide*

supply disruption in the U.S. in 2011 (accrued for in 2011).

Pursuant to the Master Restructuring Agreement, the Company will, through various mechanisms depending on the territory, return to Sanofi its rights for clopidogrel and irbesartan in all markets with the
exception of clopidogrel in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, where the Company will continue to act as the operating partner and own a 50.1% majority controlling interest. All currently existing local arrangements in Territory A and Territory B (with the
exception of clopidogrel in the U.S. and Puerto Rico), will be terminated by mutual agreement. No products will continue to be sold through such local country entities in these territories. In addition, Sanofi will assume all marketing
authorizations for the products, to the extent currently held by the Company or any of its affiliates. As a result, Sanofi will assume control of all activities relating to the distribution, commercialization and medical affairs of clopidogrel and
irbesartan in these regions.

Pursuant to the Master Restructuring Agreement and related alliance agreements, Sanofi will
assume the Company’s manufacturing and supply obligations of irbesartan products at the end of 2015. The Company does not manufacture bulk clopidogrel and will no longer finish clopidogrel products in its facilities. The Company will retain
rights to the intellectual property developed by the alliance necessary to fulfill its continuing obligations under the alliance arrangements.

Under the Master Restructuring Agreement and related alliance agreements, the alliance will remain in effect through December 2018 until Sanofi’s payment of the terminal fee, with the exception of
the U.S. and Puerto Rico, where the alliance will remain in effect through December 2019.

We had agreements with Sanofi for
the codevelopment and cocommercialization of

and

Plavix*

Prior to 2013, the worldwide alliance operated under the framework of two geographic
territories, one covering certain European and Asian countries, referred to as Territory A, and one covering the U.S., Puerto Rico, Canada, Australia and certain Latin American countries, referred to as Territory B. Territory B was managed by two
separate sets of agreements: one for

Plavix*

in the U.S. and Puerto Rico and both products in Australia, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia and Argentina and a separate set of agreements for

Avapro*

/

Avalide*

in the U.S. and Puerto Rico
only. Within each territory, a territory partnership existed to supply finished product to each country within the territory and to manage or contract for certain central expenses such as marketing, research and development and royalties. Countries
within Territories A and B were structured so that our local affiliate and Sanofi’s local affiliate either comarket separate brands (i.e., each affiliate operated independently and competed with the other by selling the same product under
different trademarks), or copromoted a single brand (i.e., the same product under the same trademark).

Within Territory A,
the comarketing countries include Germany, Spain, Italy (irbesartan only), Greece and China (clopidogrel bisulfate only). We sold

Iscover*

and

Karvea*

/

Karvezide*

and Sanofi sold

Plavix*

and

Aprovel*

/

Coaprovel*

in these countries, except China, where we retained the right to, but did not currently comarket

Iscover*

. The Company and Sanofi copromoted

Plavix*

and

Aprovel*

/

Coaprovel*

in France, the
UK, Belgium, Netherlands, Switzerland and Portugal. In addition, the Company and Sanofi copromoted

Plavix*

in Austria, Italy, Ireland, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong, and

Aprovel*

/

Coaprovel*

in certain French export countries. In 2010 and prior, the Company and Sanofi also copromoted

Plavix*

in Singapore. Sanofi acted as the operating partner for Territory A and owned a 50.1% financial controlling interest in this territory. Our
ownership interest in this territory was 49.9%. We accounted for the investment in partnership entities in Territory A under the equity method and recognized our share of the results in equity in net income of affiliates. Our share of net income
from these partnership entities before taxes was $201 million in 2012, $298 million in 2011 and $325 million in 2010.

Within
Territory B, the Company and Sanofi copromoted

Plavix*

and

Avapro*

/

Avalide*

in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. The other Territory B countries, Australia, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia (clopidogrel bisulfate only) and Argentina
were comarketing countries. We act as the operating partner for Territory B and owned a 50.1% majority controlling interest in this territory. As such, we consolidated all partnership results in Territory B and recognized Sanofi’s share of the
results as net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest, net of taxes, which was $531 million in 2012, $1,536 million in 2011 and $1,394 million in 2010.

We recognized net sales in Territory B and Territory A comarketing countries of $3.1 billion in 2012, $8.0 billion in 2011 and $7.8 billion in 2010.

The territory partnerships were governed by a series of committees with enumerated functions, powers and responsibilities. Each territory
had two senior committees which have final decision-making authority with respect to that territory as to the enumerated functions, powers and responsibilities within their jurisdictions.

The alliance arrangements may be terminated by Sanofi or us, either in whole or in any affected country or Territory, depending on the
circumstances, in the event of (i) voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency, which in the case of involuntary bankruptcy continues for 60 days or an order or decree approving same continues unstayed and in effect for 30 days;
(ii) a material breach of an obligation under a major alliance agreement that remains uncured for 30 days following notice of the breach except where commencement and diligent prosecution of cure has occurred within 30 days after notice;
(iii) deadlocks of one of the senior committees which render the continued commercialization of the product impossible in a given country or Territory; (iv) an increase in the combined cost of goods and royalty which exceeds a specified
percentage of the net selling price of the product; or (v) a good faith determination by the terminating party that commercialization of a product should be terminated for reasons of patient safety.

In the case of each of these termination rights, the agreements included provisions for the termination of the relevant alliance with
respect to the applicable product in the applicable country or territory or, in the case of a termination due to bankruptcy or insolvency or material breach, both products in the applicable territory. Each of these termination procedures was
slightly different; however, in all events, we could lose all rights to either or both products, as applicable, in the relevant country or territory even in the case of a bankruptcy or insolvency or material breach where we are not the defaulting
party.

For further discussion of our strategic alliance with Sanofi, see “Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 3.
Alliances and Collaborations.”

Otsuka

We maintain a worldwide commercialization agreement with Otsuka to
codevelop and copromote

Abilify*

(the

Abilify*

Agreement), excluding certain Asia Pacific countries. In April 2009, the Company and Otsuka agreed to extend the U.S. portion of the commercialization and manufacturing agreement until the
expected loss of product exclusivity in April 2015. The contractual share of

Abilify*

net sales recognized by the Company pursuant to the extension was 58% in 2010, 53.5% in 2011 and 51.5% in 2012.

In the UK, Germany, France and Spain, the Company receives 65% of third-party net sales. In these countries and the U.S., third-party
customers are invoiced by the Company on behalf of Otsuka and alliance revenue is recognized when

Abilify*

is shipped and all risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to third party customers. We also have an exclusive right to sell

Abilify*

in other countries in Europe, the Americas and a number of countries in Asia. In these countries we recognize 100% of the net sales.


Under the terms of the

Abilify*

Agreement, as amended, we purchase the product from
Otsuka and perform finish manufacturing for sale by us or Otsuka to third-party customers. Under the terms of the extension agreement, we paid Otsuka $400 million, which is amortized as a reduction of net sales through the extension period. The
unamortized balance is included in other assets. Otsuka receives a royalty based on 1.5% of total U.S. net sales, which is included in cost of products sold. Otsuka is responsible for 30% of the U.S. expenses related to the commercialization of

Abilify*

from 2010 through 2012. BMS also receives additional reimbursement from Otsuka for sales force costs incurred by BMS in excess of requirements specified in the agreement. Reimbursements are netted principally in marketing, selling
and administrative and advertising and product promotion expenses.

The

Abilify*

Agreement expires in April 2015 in the
U.S. and in June 2014 in all EU countries. In each other country where we have the exclusive right to sell

Abilify*

, the agreement expires on the later of April 20, 2015 or loss of exclusivity in any such country.

Beginning January 1, 2013, BMS will receive the following percentages of U.S. annual net sales. Net sales will be initially
recognized at 35% and adjusted to reflect the actual level of net sales in 2013:

The U.S. commercialization agreement was amended in October 2012, requiring Otsuka to assume full
responsibility for providing and funding all sales force efforts effective January 2013. In consideration BMS paid Otsuka $27 million in January 2013, and will be responsible for funding certain operating expenses up to $82 million in 2013, $56
million in 2014 and $8 million in 2015. In the EU, Otsuka will reimburse BMS for its sales force effort provided through March 31, 2013. Beginning April 1, 2013 Otsuka will assume responsibility for providing and funding sales force
effort.

The U.S. portion of the

Abilify*

Agreement and the Oncology Agreement described below include a
change-of-control provision if we are acquired. If the acquiring company does not have a competing product to

Abilify*

, then the new company will assume the

Abilify*

Agreement (as amended) and the Oncology Agreement as it currently
exists. If the acquiring company has a product that competes with

Abilify*

, Otsuka can elect to request the acquiring company to choose whether to divest

Abilify*

or the competing product. In the scenario where

Abilify*

is
divested, Otsuka would be obligated to acquire our rights under the

Abilify*

Agreement (as amended) at a price according to a predetermined schedule. The agreements also provide that in the event of a generic competitor to

Abilify*

, we
have the option of terminating the

Abilify*

April 2009 amendment (with the agreement as previously amended remaining in force). If we were to exercise such option then either (i) we would receive a payment from Otsuka according to a
pre-determined schedule and the Oncology Agreement would terminate at the same time or (ii) the Oncology Agreement would continue for a truncated period according to a pre-determined schedule.

Early termination of the

Abilify*

Agreement is immediate upon notice in the case of (i) voluntary bankruptcy, (ii) where
minimum payments are not made to Otsuka, or (iii) first commercial sale has not occurred within three months after receipt of all necessary approvals, 30 days where a material breach has occurred (and not been cured or commencement of cure has
not occurred within 90 days after notice of such material breach) and 90 days in the case where an involuntary bankruptcy petition has been filed (and has not been dismissed). In addition, termination is available to Otsuka upon 30 days notice in
the event that we were to challenge Otsuka’s patent rights or, on a market-by-market basis, in the event that we were to market a product in direct competition with

Abilify*

. Upon termination or expiration of the

Abilify*

Agreement, we do not retain any rights to

Abilify*

.

We recognized net sales for

Abilify*

of $2.8 billion in
2012 and $2.8 billion in 2011 and $2.6 billion in 2010. In addition to the $400 million extension payment in 2009, total upfront, milestone and other licensing payments made to Otsuka under the

Abilify*

Agreement through 2012 were $217
million.

Lilly

We have an EGFR commercialization agreement with Lilly through Lilly’s subsidiary ImClone for the codevelopment and
copromotion of

Erbitux*

and necitumumab (IMC-11F8) in the U.S., Canada and Japan. For more information on the agreement with respect to necitumumab, see “

—Investigational Compounds Under Development—In-Licensed

”
below. Under the EGFR agreement, with respect to

Erbitux*

sales in North America, Lilly receives a distribution fee based on a flat rate of 39% of net sales in North America, plus reimbursement of certain royalties paid by Lilly, and the
Company and Lilly share one half of the profits and losses evenly in Japan with Merck KgaA receiving the other half of the profits and losses in Japan. The parties share royalties payable to third parties pursuant to a formula set forth in the
commercialization agreement. We purchase all of our North American commercial requirements for bulk

Erbitux*

from Lilly. The agreement expires as to

Erbitux*

in North America in September 2018.


Early termination is available based on material breach and is effective 60 days after
notice of the material breach (and such material breach has not been cured or commencement of cure has not occurred), or upon six months notice from us if there exists a significant concern regarding a regulatory or patient safety issue that would
seriously impact the long-term viability of the product. Upon termination or expiration of the alliance, we do not retain any rights to

Erbitux*

.

We share codevelopment and copromotion rights to

Erbitux*

with Merck KGaA in Japan under an agreement signed in October 2007, and expiring in 2032, with Lilly, Merck KGaA and Merck Japan. Lilly has
the ability to terminate the agreement after 2018 if it determines that it is commercially unreasonable for it to continue.

Erbitux*

received marketing approval in Japan in July 2008 for the use of

Erbitux*

in treating patients with
advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer.

We recognized net sales for

Erbitux*

of $702 million in 2012, $691 million in 2011 and $662
million in 2010.

For further discussion of our strategic alliance with Lilly, see “Item 8. Financial
Statements—Note 3. Alliances and Collaborations.”

Gilead

We have a joint venture with Gilead to develop and
commercialize

Atripla*

in the U.S., Canada and Europe. The Company and Gilead share responsibility for commercializing

Atripla*

in the U.S., Canada, throughout the EU and certain other European countries, and both provide funding and
field-based sales representatives in support of promotional efforts for

Atripla*

. Gilead recognizes 100% of

Atripla*

revenues in the U.S., Canada and most countries in Europe. Our revenue for the efavirenz component is determined by
applying a percentage to

Atripla*

revenue to approximate revenue for the

Sustiva

brand. We recognized efavirenz revenues of $1.3 billion in 2012, $1.2 billion in 2011 and $1.1 billion in 2010 related to

Atripla*

net sales.

The joint venture between the Company and Gilead will continue until terminated by mutual agreement of the parties or
otherwise as described below. In the event of a material breach by one party, the non-breaching party may terminate the joint venture only if both parties agree that it is both desirable and practicable to withdraw the combination product from the
markets where it is commercialized. At such time as one or more generic versions of a party’s component product(s) appear on the market in the U.S., the other party will have the right to terminate the joint venture and thereby acquire all of
the rights to the combination product, both in the U.S. and Canada; however, for three years the terminated party will continue to receive a percentage of the net sales based on the contribution of bulk component(s) to

Atripla*

, and otherwise
retains all rights to its own product(s).

In 2011, we entered into a licensing agreement with Gilead to develop and
commercialize a fixed-dose combination containing

Reyataz

and Gilead’s cobicistat, a pharmacoenhancing or “boosting” agent currently in Phase III clinical trials that increases blood levels of certain HIV medicines to
potentially allow for one pill once daily dosing. Cobicstat is currently in the registrational process with the FDA.

further discussion of our strategic alliance with Gilead, see “Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 3. Alliances and Collaborations.”

Current Marketed Products—Internally Discovered

AstraZeneca

In January 2007, we entered into a worldwide (except for Japan) codevelopment and cocommercialization agreement with
AstraZeneca for

Onglyza

(the Saxagliptin Agreement) and dapagliflozin (the SGLT2 Agreement).

Kombiglyze

was codeveloped with AstraZeneca under the Saxagliptin Agreement. The exclusive rights to develop and sell

Onglyza

in Japan
were licensed to Otsuka in December 2006 and in June 2012 were assigned by Otsuka to Kyowa Hakko Kirin (KHK), which is described below under “—

Investigational Compounds Under Development—Internally Discovered

.”

We manufacture

Onglyza

and

Kombiglyze

and, with certain limited exceptions, recognize net sales in most key markets. We
received $300 million in upfront, milestone and other licensing payments from AstraZeneca for meeting certain development and regulatory milestones on

Onglyza

and

Kombiglyze

, and could receive up to an additional $300 million if all
sales-based milestones are met. The majority of costs under the initial development plans were paid by AstraZeneca and additional development costs are generally shared equally. We expense

Onglyza

and

Kombiglyze

development costs, net
of AstraZeneca’s share, in research and development. The two companies jointly develop the clinical and marketing strategy and share commercialization expenses and profits and losses equally on a global basis, excluding Japan.

Under the SGLT2 Agreement, we have received $250 million of upfront, milestone and other licensing payments from AstraZeneca, including
$80 million received in January 2013, and could receive up to $150 million more if all development and regulatory milestones for dapagliflozin are met and up to an additional $390 million if all sales-based milestones for dapagliflozin are met. The
majority of costs under the initial plans through 2009 were paid by AstraZeneca and any additional development costs will generally be shared equally except for Japan, where AstraZeneca bears substantially all of the development costs prior to
approval of the first indication. We expense dapagliflozin development costs, net of our alliance partner’s share, in research and development. Under the SGLT2 Agreement, like with the Saxagliptin Agreement, the two companies will jointly
develop the clinical and marketing strategy and share commercialization expenses and profits and losses for dapagliflozin equally on a global basis, and we will manufacture dapagliflozin and, with certain limited exceptions, recognize net sales in
most key markets. With respect to Japan, AstraZeneca has operational and cost responsibility for all development and regulatory activities on behalf of the collaboration, related to certain trials. All other development costs are shared by the two
companies. The two companies will jointly market the product in Japan, sharing all commercialization expenses and activities and splitting profits and losses equally like in the rest of the world. We will also manufacture dapagliflozin and recognize
net sales in Japan, like in the rest of the world. Dapagliflozin is currently being studied in Phase II clinical trials in Japan.


In August 2012, BMS and AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
AstraZeneca, entered into a collaboration regarding the worldwide development and commercialization of Amylin’s portfolio of products, including

Bydureon*

,

Byetta*

,

Symlin*

. The arrangement is based on the framework of the
existing diabetes alliance agreements for

Onglyza

and

Forxiga

discussed above, including the equal sharing of profits and losses arising from the collaboration. AstraZeneca has indicated its intent to establish equal governance rights
over certain key strategic and financial decisions regarding the collaboration pending required anti-trust approvals in certain international markets.

BMS received preliminary proceeds of $3.6 billion from AstraZeneca as consideration for entering into the collaboration during 2012, which was accounted for as deferred income and is amortized as a
reduction to cost of products sold on a pro-rata basis over the estimated useful lives of the related long-lived assets assigned in the purchase price allocation (primarily intangible assets with a weighted-average estimated useful life of 12 years
and property, plant and equipment with a weighted-average estimated useful life of 15 years). The net proceeds that BMS will receive from AstraZeneca as consideration for entering into the collaboration are subject to certain other adjustments
including the right to receive an additional $135 million when AstraZeneca exercises its option for equal governance rights.

BMS and AstraZeneca agreed to share in certain tax attributes related to the Amylin collaboration. The preliminary proceeds of $3.6
billion that BMS received from AstraZeneca included $207 million related to sharing of certain tax attributes.

For further
discussion of our strategic alliance with AstraZeneca, see “Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 3. Alliances and Collaborations” and “Investigational Compounds Under Development – Internally Discovered.”

Otsuka

Simultaneously with the extension of the

Abilify*

Agreement, in April 2009, the Company and Otsuka entered into an
Oncology Agreement for

Sprycel

and

Ixempra

(ixabepilone), which includes the U.S., Japan and the EU markets (the Oncology Territory). Beginning in 2010 through 2020, the collaboration fees that we will pay to Otsuka annually are the
following percentages of the aggregate net sales of

Sprycel

and

Ixempra

in the Oncology Territory:

During these periods, Otsuka will contribute (i) 20% of the first $175 million of certain commercial
operational expenses relating to the oncology products in the Oncology Territory, and (ii) 1% of such commercial operational expenses relating to the products in the Oncology Territory in excess of $175 million. Beginning in 2011, Otsuka
copromotes

Sprycel

in the U.S. and Japan and has exercised the right to copromote in the top five EU markets beginning in January 2012.

The Oncology Agreement expires with respect to

Sprycel

and

Ixempra

in 2020 and includes the same change-of-control provision if we were acquired as the

Abilify*

Agreement described
above.

Pfizer

The Company and Pfizer are parties to a worldwide codevelopment and cocommercialization agreement for

Eliquis

, an
anticoagulant discovered by us for the prevention and treatment of atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolic (VTE) disorders. Pfizer funds 60% of all development costs since January 2007 and we fund 40%. We have received $654 million in upfront,
milestone and other licensing payments from Pfizer to date, including $95 million received in February 2013 and could receive up to an additional $230 million from Pfizer if all development and regulatory milestones are met. The companies jointly
develop the clinical and marketing strategy of

Eliquis

, and share commercialization expenses and profits and losses equally on a global basis.

For further discussion of our strategic alliance with Pfizer, see “Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 3. Alliances and Collaborations.”


Investigational Compounds Under Development—In-Licensed

Lilly

In January 2010, the Company and Lilly restructured the EGFR commercialization agreement to provide for the codevelopment and
cocommercialization of necitumumab (IMC-11F8), a fully human antibody currently in Phase III development for non-small cell lung cancer. In November 2012, BMS provided notice of termination of the collaboration agreement with Lilly for necitumumab.
The termination is effective May 2014, though we and Lilly may terminate earlier.

AbbVie

In August 2008, we were
granted exclusive rights from Facet Biotech Corporation (now AbbVie) for the codevelopment and cocommercialization of elotuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody being investigated as treatment for multiple myeloma. Under the terms of the agreement,
we fund 80% of the development costs for elotuzumab. Upon commercialization, Abbott will share 30% of all profits and losses in the U.S., and will be paid tiered royalties outside of the U.S. We will be solely responsible for commercialization
of elotuzumab. In addition, Abbott may receive milestone payments from us based on certain regulatory events and sales thresholds, if achieved.

Investigational Compounds Under Development—Internally Discovered

Otsuka

In January 2007, we granted Otsuka exclusive rights in Japan to develop and commercialize

Onglyza

. Under that agreement, we are entitled to receive milestone payments based on certain
regulatory events, as well as sales-based payments following regulatory approval of

Onglyza

in Japan, and we retained rights to copromote

Onglyza

with Otsuka in Japan. Otsuka is responsible for all development costs in Japan. In June
2012, Otsuka assigned all rights to

Onglyza

, with the exception of specific transition services, to KHK. As part of its consent to this assignment, BMS waives its rights to co-promote

Onglyza

in Japan. BMS will supply finished
saxagliptin to KHK.

AstraZeneca

As part of the collaboration with AstraZeneca, BMS and AstraZeneca are codeveloping
metreleptin for the treatment of lipodystrophy, which is currently in the registrational process in Japan. Metreleptin was acquired by BMS as part of the Amylin acquisition. Please see the AstraZeneca description under “

Current Marketed
Products – Internally Discovered“and

“Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 3. Alliances and Collaborations” for more information regarding the collaboration.

Other Collaborations

In February 2013, BMS and Reckitt Benckiser
Group plc (RBL) agreed to enter into a license and three year collaboration regarding several over-the-counter-products sold primarily in Mexico and Brazil. The transaction is expected to close during the first or second quarter of 2013,
subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. In connection with the collaboration, RBL will be responsible for all sales, distribution, marketing and certain regulatory matters and BMS will be responsible for the exclusive
supply of the products. Upon expiration of the collaboration, RBL will have the right to purchase the remaining assets of the business held by BMS at a price determined based on a multiple of sales (plus the cost of any remaining inventory held
by BMS at that time). RBL would then assume all responsibility for the products, though RBL may extend the term of the supply agreement with BMS under certain circumstances. If the option is not exercised, all assets previously transferred to RBL
during the collaboration period revert back to BMS. BMS is expected to receive proceeds of $482 million at the start of the collaboration period which will be allocated to the license and other rights transferred to RBL and the written option.

In February 2013, BMS and The Medicines Company entered into a global license and two year collaboration for

Recothrom

, a recombinant thrombin for use as a topical hemostat to control non-arterial bleeding during surgical procedures (previously acquired by BMS in connection with its acquisition of ZymoGenetics in 2010). The Medicines Company is
responsible for all sales, distribution, marketing and regulatory matters relating to

Recothrom,

and BMS is responsible for the exclusive supply of the product. BMS received an upfront payment of $115 million. The collaboration expires
February 2015 at which time The Medicines Company has the right to purchase the remaining assets of the business held by BMS at a price determined based on a multiple of sales (plus the carrying cost of the inventory). If the option is not
exercised, all assets previously transferred to The Medicines Company, during the collaboration period revert back to BMS.

In
addition to the strategic alliances described above, we have other in-licensing and out-licensing arrangements. With respect to in-licenses, we have agreements with Novartis for

Reyataz

among others. Based on our current expectations with
respect to the expiration of market exclusivity in our significant markets, the licensing arrangements with Novartis for

Reyataz

are expected to expire in 2017 in the U.S. and the EU and 2019 in Japan. For further discussion of market
exclusivity protection, including a chart showing net sales of key products together with the year in which basic exclusivity loss occurred or is expected to occur in the U.S., the EU, Japan and Canada, see “—Products” above.

We own certain compounds out-licensed to third parties for development and commercialization, including those obtained as a
result of our acquisitions of ZymoGenetics in October 2010 and Medarex in August 2009. We are entitled to receive milestone payments as these compounds move through the regulatory process and royalties based on product sales, if and when the
products are commercialized.


Intellectual Property and Product Exclusivity

We own or license a number of patents in the U.S. and foreign countries primarily covering our products. We have also developed many brand
names and trademarks for our products. We consider the overall protection of our patents, trademarks, licenses and other intellectual property rights to be of material value and act to protect these rights from infringement.

In the pharmaceutical industry, the majority of an innovative product’s commercial value is usually realized during the period in
which the product has market exclusivity. A product’s market exclusivity is generally determined by two forms of intellectual property: patent rights held by the innovator company and any regulatory forms of exclusivity to which the innovative
drug is entitled.

Patents are a key determinant of market exclusivity for most branded pharmaceuticals. Patents provide the
innovator with the right to exclude others from practicing an invention related to the medicine. Patents may cover, among other things, the active ingredient(s), various uses of a drug product, pharmaceutical formulations, drug delivery mechanisms
and processes for (or intermediates useful in) the manufacture of products. Protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the expiration dates of patents in the various countries. The protection afforded, which
may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, its scope of coverage and the availability of meaningful legal remedies in the country.

Market exclusivity is also sometimes influenced by regulatory intellectual property rights. Many developed countries provide certain non-patent incentives for the development of medicines. For example, in
the U.S., the EU, Japan, Canada and certain other markets, regulatory intellectual property rights are offered as incentives for research on medicines for rare diseases, or orphan drugs, and on medicines useful in treating pediatric patients. These
incentives can extend the market exclusivity period on a product beyond the patent term.

The U.S., EU, Japan, China and
Canada also each provide for a minimum period of time after the approval of a new drug during which the regulatory agency may not rely upon the innovator’s data to approve a competitor’s generic copy, or data protection. In some regions
such as China, however, it is questionable whether such data protection laws are enforceable. In certain markets where patent protection and other forms of market exclusivity may have expired, data protection can be of particular importance.
However, most regulatory forms of exclusivity do not prevent a competitor from gaining regulatory approval prior to the expiration of regulatory data exclusivity on the basis of the competitor’s own safety and efficacy data on its drug, even
when that drug is identical to that marketed by the innovator.

Specific aspects of the law governing market exclusivity and
data protection for pharmaceuticals vary from country to country. The following summarizes key exclusivity rules in markets representing significant sales:

United States

In the U.S., most of our key products are protected by
patents with varying terms depending on the type of patent and the filing date. A significant portion of a product’s patent life, however, is lost during the time it takes an innovative company to develop and obtain regulatory approval of a new
drug. As compensation at least in part for the lost patent term, the innovator may, depending on a number of factors, extend the expiration date of one patent up to a maximum term of five years, provided that the extension cannot cause the patent to
be in effect for more than 14 years from the date of drug approval.

A company seeking to market an innovative pharmaceutical
in the U.S. must submit a complete set of safety and efficacy data to the FDA. If the innovative pharmaceutical is a chemical, the company files a New Drug Application (NDA). If the medicine is a biological product, a Biologics License Application
(BLA) is filed. The type of application filed affects regulatory exclusivity rights.

Chemical products

A competitor seeking to launch a generic substitute of a chemical innovative drug in the U.S. must file an abbreviated NDA (aNDA) with the
FDA. In the aNDA, the generic manufacturer needs to demonstrate only “bioequivalence” between the generic substitute and the approved NDA drug. The aNDA relies upon the safety and efficacy data previously filed by the innovator in its NDA.

An innovator company is required to list certain of its patents covering the medicine with the FDA in what is commonly known
as the Orange Book. Absent a successful patent challenge, the FDA cannot approve an aNDA until after the innovator’s listed patents expire. However, after the innovator has marketed its product for four years, a generic manufacturer may file an
aNDA and allege that one or more of the patents listed in the Orange Book under an innovator’s NDA is either invalid or not infringed. This allegation is commonly known as a Paragraph IV certification. The innovator then must decide whether to
file a patent infringement suit against the generic manufacturer. From time to time, aNDAs, including Paragraph IV certifications, are filed with respect to certain of our products. We evaluate these aNDAs on a case-by-case basis and, where
warranted, file suit against the generic manufacturer to protect our patent rights.


In addition to benefiting from patent protection, certain innovative pharmaceutical products
can receive periods of regulatory exclusivity. A NDA that is designated as an orphan drug can receive seven years of exclusivity for the orphan indication. During this time period, neither NDAs nor aNDAs for the same drug product can be approved for
the same orphan use. A company may also earn six months of additional exclusivity for a drug where specific clinical trials are conducted at the written request of the FDA to study the use of the medicine to treat pediatric patients, and submission
to the FDA is made prior to the loss of basic exclusivity.

Medicines approved under a NDA can also receive several types of
regulatory data protection. An innovative chemical pharmaceutical is entitled to five years of regulatory data protection in the U.S., during which competitors cannot file with the FDA for approval of generic substitutes. If an innovator’s
patent is challenged, as described above, a generic manufacturer may file its aNDA after the fourth year of the five-year data protection period. A pharmaceutical drug product that contains an active ingredient that has been previously approved in
an NDA, but is approved in a new formulation, but not for the drug itself, or for a new indication on the basis of new clinical trials, receives three years of data protection for that formulation or indication.

Biologic products

The U.S. healthcare legislation enacted in 2010 created an approval pathway for biosimilar versions of innovative biological products that
did not previously exist. Prior to that time, innovative biologics had essentially unlimited regulatory exclusivity. Under the new regulatory mechanism, the FDA can approve products that are similar to (but not generic copies of) innovative
biologics on the basis of less extensive data than is required by a full BLA. After an innovator has marketed its product for four years, any manufacturer may file an application for approval of a “biosimilar” version of the innovator
product. However, although an application for approval of a biosimilar may be filed four years after approval of the innovator product, qualified innovative biological products will receive 12 years of regulatory exclusivity, meaning that the FDA
may not approve a biosimilar version until 12 years after the innovative biological product was first approved by the FDA. The law also provides a mechanism for innovators to enforce the patents that protect innovative biological products and for
biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents. Such patent litigation may begin as early as four years after the innovative biological products is first approved by the FDA.

In the U.S., the increased likelihood of generic and biosimilar challenges to innovators’ intellectual property has increased the risk of loss of innovators’ market exclusivity. First, generic
companies have increasingly sought to challenge innovators’ basic patents covering major pharmaceutical products. Second, statutory and regulatory provisions in the U.S. limit the ability of an innovator company to prevent generic and
biosimilar drugs from being approved and launched while patent litigation is ongoing. As a result of all of these developments, it is not possible to predict the length of market exclusivity for a particular product with certainty based solely on
the expiration of the relevant patent(s) or the current forms of regulatory exclusivity.

European Union

Patents on pharmaceutical products are generally enforceable in the EU and, as in the U.S., may be extended to compensate for the patent
term lost during the regulatory review process. Such extensions are granted on a country-by-country basis.

The primary route
we use to obtain marketing authorization of pharmaceutical products in the EU is through the “centralized procedure.” This procedure is compulsory for certain pharmaceutical products, in particular those using biotechnological processes,
and is also available for certain new chemical compounds and products. A company seeking to market an innovative pharmaceutical product through the centralized procedure must file a complete set of safety data and efficacy data as part of a
Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) with the European Medicines Agency (EMA). After the EMA evaluates the MAA, it provides a recommendation to the European Commission (EC) and the EC then approves or denies the MAA. It is also possible for new
chemical products to obtain marketing authorization in the EU through a “mutual recognition procedure,” in which an application is made to a single member state, and if the member state approves the pharmaceutical product under a national
procedure, then the applicant may submit that approval to the mutual recognition procedure of some or all other member states.

After obtaining marketing authorization approval, a company must obtain pricing and reimbursement for the pharmaceutical product, which
is typically subject to member state law. In certain EU countries, this process can take place simultaneously while the product is marketed but in other EU countries, this process must be completed before the company can market the new product. The
pricing and reimbursement procedure can take months and sometimes years to complete.

Throughout the EU, all products for
which marketing authorizations have been filed after October/November 2005 are subject to an “8+2+1” regime. Eight years after the innovator has received its first community authorization for a medicinal product, a generic company may file
a marketing authorization application for that product with the health authorities. If the marketing authorization application is approved, the generic company may not commercialize the product until after either 10 or 11 years have elapsed from the
initial marketing authorization granted to the innovator. The possible extension to 11 years is available if the innovator, during the first eight years of the marketing authorization, obtains an additional indication that is of significant clinical
benefit in comparison with existing treatments. For products that were filed prior to October/November 2005, there is a 10-year period of data protection under the centralized procedures and a period of either six or 10 years under the mutual
recognition procedure (depending on the member state).


In contrast to the U.S., patents in the EU are not listed with regulatory authorities.
Generic versions of pharmaceutical products can be approved after data protection expires, regardless of whether the innovator holds patents covering its drug. Thus, it is possible that an innovator may be seeking to enforce its patents against a
generic competitor that is already marketing its product. Also, the European patent system has an opposition procedure in which generic manufacturers may challenge the validity of patents covering innovator products within nine months of grant.

In general, EU law treats chemically-synthesized drugs and biologically-derived drugs the same with respect to intellectual
property and data protection. In addition to the relevant legislation and annexes related to biologic medicinal products, the EMA has issued guidelines that outline the additional information to be provided for biosimilar products, also known as
generic biologics, in order to review an application for marketing approval.

Japan

In Japan, medicines of new chemical entities are generally afforded eight years of data exclusivity for approved indications and dosage.
Patents on pharmaceutical products are enforceable. Generic copies can receive regulatory approval after data exclusivity and patent expirations. As in the U.S., patents in Japan may be extended to compensate for the patent term lost during the
regulatory review process.

In general, Japanese law treats chemically-synthesized and biologically-derived drugs the same
with respect to intellectual property and market exclusivity.

China

In China, medicines of new chemical entities are generally afforded six years of data exclusivity for approved indications and dosage.
There is uncertainty about China’s exclusivity laws which has resulted in generic competition in the China market. Generic copies can receive regulatory approval after data exclusivity and patent expirations. Currently, unlike the U.S.,
China has no patent term restoration to compensate for the patent term lost during the regulatory process.

In general,
Chinese law treats chemically-synthesized and biologically-derived drugs the same with respect to intellectual property and market exclusivity.

Canada

In Canada as of
2006, medicines of new chemical entities are generally afforded eight years of data exclusivity for approved indications and dosage. Patents on pharmaceutical products are enforceable. Generic copies can receive regulatory approval after data
exclusivity and patent expirations. Currently, unlike the U.S., Canada has no patent term restoration to compensate for the patent term lost during the regulatory review process.

In Canada, biologics are generally treated the same as chemically-synthesized products with respect to patent rights and regulatory
exclusivity. Health Canada has issued draft guidance that outlines the additional information to be provided for Subsequent Entry Biologics, also known as biosimilar products or generic biologics, in order to review an application for marketing
approval.

Rest of the World

In countries outside of the U.S., the EU, Japan, China and Canada, there is a wide variety of legal systems with respect to intellectual property and market exclusivity of pharmaceuticals. Most other
developed countries utilize systems similar to either the U.S. or the EU (e.g., Switzerland). Among developing countries, some have adopted patent laws and/or regulatory exclusivity laws, while others have not. Some developing countries have
formally adopted laws in order to comply with World Trade Organization (WTO) commitments, but have not taken steps to implement these laws in a meaningful way. Enforcement of WTO actions is a long process between governments, and there is no
assurance of the outcome. Thus, in assessing the likely future market exclusivity of our innovative drugs in developing countries, we take into account not only formal legal rights but political and other factors as well.

Marketing, Distribution and Customers

We promote the appropriate use of our products directly to healthcare professionals and providers such as doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, pharmacists, technologists, hospitals,
Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) and Managed Care Organizations (MCOs). We also provide information about the appropriate use of our products to consumers in the U.S. through direct-to-consumer print, radio, television, and digital advertising and
promotion. In addition, we sponsor general advertising to educate the public about our innovative medical research and corporate mission. For a discussion of the regulation of promotion and marketing of pharmaceuticals, see “—Government
Regulation and Price Constraints” below.


Through our field sales and medical organizations, we explain the risks and benefits of the
approved uses of our products to medical professionals. We work to gain access for our products on formularies and reimbursement plans (lists of recommended or approved medicines and other products), including Medicare Part D plans by providing
information about the clinical profiles of our products. Our marketing and sales of prescription pharmaceuticals is limited to the approved uses of the particular product, but we continue to develop scientific data and other information about our
products and provide such information in response to unsolicited inquiries from doctors, other medical professionals and managed care organizations.

Our operations include several marketing and sales organizations. Each product marketing organization is supported by a sales force, which may be responsible for selling one or more products. We also have
marketing organizations that focus on certain classes of customers such as managed care entities or certain types of marketing tools, such as digital or consumer communications. Our sales forces focus on communicating information about new products
or new uses, as well as established products, and promotion to physicians is increasingly targeted at physician specialists who treat the patients in need of our medicines.

Our products are sold principally to wholesalers, and to a lesser extent, directly to distributors, retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and pharmacies. Gross sales to the three largest
pharmaceutical wholesalers in the U.S. as a percentage of our global gross sales were as follows:




McKesson Corporation

Cardinal Health, Inc.

Our U.S. business has Inventory Management Agreements (IMAs) with substantially all of our direct
wholesaler and distributor customers that allow us to monitor U.S. wholesaler inventory levels and requires those wholesalers to maintain inventory levels that are no more than one month of their demand. The IMAs for our three largest wholesalers
expire on March 31, 2013, while the other IMAs expire on December 14, 2014, all subject to certain termination provisions. We have reached agreements in principal with our three largest wholesalers, subject to negotiation and execution of
final agreements, which would extend the termination dates of those IMAs to December 14, 2014, subject to certain termination provisions.

In a number of defined markets outside of the U.S., we have established a full scale distributor model to make medically necessary drugs available to patients. We continue to own the marketing
authorization and trademarks for these products, but have contracted the services of a full-service distributor to provide distribution and logistics; regulatory and pharmacovigilance; and sales, advertising and promotion for certain products. These
contracts clearly define terms and conditions, along with the services we will provide (such as supply through a firm order period). We monitor in-market sales and forecasts to ensure that reasonable inventory levels for all products for sale are
maintained to fully and continuously meet the demand for the products within the distributor’s territory or responsibility. Sales in these distributor-based markets represented less than 1% of the Company’s net sales in 2012.

Competition

The markets
in which we compete are generally broad based and highly competitive. We compete with other worldwide research-based drug companies, many smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus and generic drug manufacturers. Important
competitive factors include product efficacy, safety and ease of use, price and demonstrated cost-effectiveness, marketing effectiveness, product labeling, customer service and research and development of new products and processes. Sales of our
products can be impacted by new studies that indicate a competitor’s product is safer or more effective for treating a disease or particular form of disease than one of our products. Our sales also can be impacted by additional labeling
requirements relating to safety or convenience that may be imposed on products by the FDA or by similar regulatory agencies in different countries. If competitors introduce new products and processes with therapeutic or cost advantages, our products
can be subject to progressive price reductions or decreased volume of sales, or both.

Generic Competition

One of the biggest competitive challenges that we face is from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers. In the U.S. and the EU, the
regulatory approval process exempts generics from costly and time-consuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy, allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy of the innovator product. As a result, generic
pharmaceutical manufacturers typically invest far less in research and development than research-based pharmaceutical companies and therefore can price their products significantly lower than branded products. Accordingly, when a branded product
loses its market exclusivity, it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product. Upon the expiration or loss of market exclusivity on a product, we can lose the major portion of sales of that product in a very short
period of time.


The rate of sales decline of a product after the expiration of exclusivity varies by
country. In general, the decline in the U.S. market is more rapid than in most other developed countries, though we have observed rapid declines in a number of EU countries as well. Also, the declines in developed countries tend to be more rapid
than in developing countries. The rate of sales decline after the expiration of exclusivity has also historically been influenced by product characteristics. For example, drugs that are used in a large patient population (e.g., those prescribed by
key primary care physicians) tend to experience more rapid declines than drugs in specialized areas of medicine (e.g., oncology). Drugs that are more complex to manufacture (e.g., sterile injectable products) usually experience a slower decline than
those that are simpler to manufacture.

In certain countries outside the U.S., patent protection is weak or nonexistent and we
must compete with generic versions shortly after we launch our innovative products. In addition, generic pharmaceutical companies may introduce a generic product before exclusivity has expired, and before the resolution of any related patent
litigation. For more information about market exclusivity, see “—Intellectual Property and Product Exclusivity” above.

We believe our long-term competitive position depends upon our success in discovering and developing innovative, cost-effective products that serve unmet medical needs, together with our ability to
manufacture products efficiently and to market them effectively in a highly competitive environment.

Managed Care Organizations

The growth of MCOs in the U.S. is also a major factor in the healthcare marketplace. Over half of the U.S. population now
participates in some version of managed care. MCOs can include medical insurance companies, medical plan administrators, health-maintenance organizations, Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, alliances of hospitals and physicians and other
physician organizations. Those organizations have been consolidating into fewer, larger entities, thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance to us.

To successfully compete for business with MCOs, we must often demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care. Most new products
that we introduce compete with other products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors. As noted above, generic drugs are exempt from costly and time-consuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy
and, as such, often have lower costs than brand-name drugs. MCOs that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics for this reason. Many governments also encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brand-name drugs in
their healthcare programs. Laws in the U.S. generally allow, and in many cases require, pharmacists to substitute generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be essentially equivalent to a brand-name drug. The substitution must
be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it.

Exclusion of a product from a formulary can lead to its
sharply reduced usage in the MCO patient population. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies compete aggressively to have their products included. Where possible, companies compete for inclusion based upon unique features of their products, such as
greater efficacy, better patient ease of use or fewer side effects. A lower overall cost of therapy is also an important factor. Products that demonstrate fewer therapeutic advantages must compete for inclusion based primarily on price. We have been
generally, although not universally, successful in having our major products included on MCO formularies.

Government Regulation and Price
Constraints

The pharmaceutical industry is subject to extensive global regulation by regional, country, state and local
agencies. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDC Act), other Federal statutes and regulations, various state statutes and regulations, and laws and regulations of foreign governments govern to varying degrees the testing, approval,
production, labeling, distribution, post-market surveillance, advertising, dissemination of information, and promotion of our products. The lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing, data analysis, manufacturing, development, and regulatory
review necessary for required governmental approvals is extremely costly and can significantly delay product introductions in a given market. Promotion, marketing, manufacturing and distribution of pharmaceutical products are extensively regulated
in all major world markets. In addition, our operations are subject to complex Federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and occupational safety laws and regulations. We anticipate that the laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and
sale of current products and the introduction of new products will continue to require substantial scientific and technical effort, time and expense as well as significant capital investments.

Of particular importance is the FDA in the U.S. It has jurisdiction over virtually all of our activities and imposes requirements
covering the testing, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, advertising and post-marketing surveillance of our products. In many cases, FDA requirements have increased the amount of time and money necessary to develop new
products and bring them to market in the U.S.


The FDA mandates that drugs be manufactured, packaged and labeled in conformity with current
Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) established by the FDA. In complying with cGMP regulations, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in production, recordkeeping and quality control to ensure that products meet applicable
specifications and other requirements to ensure product safety and efficacy. The FDA periodically inspects our drug manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with applicable cGMP requirements. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory
requirements subjects us to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product or voluntary recall of a product. Adverse experiences with the use of products must be reported to the FDA and could result in
the imposition of market restrictions through labeling changes or product removal. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy occur following approval.

The Federal government has extensive enforcement powers over the activities of pharmaceutical manufacturers, including
authority to withdraw product approvals, commence actions to seize and prohibit the sale of unapproved or non-complying products, to halt manufacturing operations that are not in compliance with cGMPs, and to impose or seek injunctions, voluntary
recalls, civil, monetary and criminal penalties. Such a restriction or prohibition on sales or withdrawal of approval of products marketed by us could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash
flows.

Marketing authorization for our products is subject to revocation by the applicable governmental agencies. In
addition, modifications or enhancements of approved products or changes in manufacturing locations are in many circumstances subject to additional FDA approvals, which may or may not be received and which may be subject to a lengthy application
process.

The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) as part of the
FDC Act, which regulates such activities at both the Federal and state level. Under the PDMA and its implementing regulations, states are permitted to require registration of manufacturers and distributors who provide pharmaceuticals even if such
manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. States are also permitted to adopt regulations limiting the distribution of product samples to licensed practitioners. The PDMA also imposes extensive licensing, personnel
recordkeeping, packaging, quantity, labeling, product handling and facility storage and security requirements intended to prevent the sale of pharmaceutical product samples or other product diversions.

The FDA Amendments Act of 2007 imposed additional obligations on pharmaceutical companies and delegated more enforcement authority to the
FDA in the area of drug safety. Key elements of this legislation give the FDA authority to (1) require that companies conduct post-marketing safety studies of drugs, (2) impose certain drug labeling changes relating to safety,
(3) mandate risk mitigation measures such as the education of healthcare providers and the restricted distribution of medicines, (4) require companies to publicly disclose data from clinical trials and (5) pre-review television
advertisements.

The marketing practices of all U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturers are subject to Federal and state healthcare
laws that are used to protect the integrity of government healthcare programs. The Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (OIG) oversees compliance with applicable Federal laws, in connection with the payment
for products by government funded programs (primarily Medicaid and Medicare). These laws include the Federal anti-kickback statute, which criminalizes the offering of something of value to induce the recommendation, order or purchase of products or
services reimbursed under a government healthcare program. The OIG has issued a series of Guidances to segments of the healthcare industry, including the 2003 Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (the OIG Guidance), which
includes a recommendation that pharmaceutical manufacturers, at a minimum, adhere to the PhRMA Code, a voluntary industry code of marketing practices. We subscribe to the PhRMA Code, and have implemented a compliance program to address the
requirements set forth in the OIG Guidance and our compliance with the healthcare laws. Failure to comply with these healthcare laws could subject us to administrative and legal proceedings, including actions by Federal and state government
agencies. Such actions could result in the imposition of civil and criminal sanctions, which may include fines, penalties and injunctive remedies, the impact of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations and cash flows.

We are also subject to the jurisdiction of various other Federal and state regulatory and
enforcement departments and agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services in the U.S. We are also licensed by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency to procure and produce
controlled substances. We are, therefore, subject to possible administrative and legal proceedings and actions by these organizations. Such actions may result in the imposition of civil and criminal sanctions, which may include fines, penalties and
injunctive or administrative remedies.

Our activities outside the U.S. are also subject to regulatory requirements governing
the testing, approval, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling and marketing of our products. These regulatory requirements vary from country to country. Whether or not FDA approval or approval of the EMA has been obtained for a product,
approval of the product by comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the U.S. or the EU, as the case may be, must be obtained prior to marketing the product in those countries. The approval process may be more or less rigorous from
country to country, and the time required for approval may be longer or shorter than that required in the U.S. Approval in one country does not assure that a product will be approved in another country.


In many markets outside the U.S., we operate in an environment of government-mandated,
cost-containment programs. Several governments have placed restrictions on physician prescription levels and patient reimbursements, emphasized greater use of generic drugs and/or enacted across-the-board price cuts as methods of cost control. In
most EU countries, for example, the government regulates pricing of a new product at launch often through direct price controls, international price comparisons, controlling profits and/or reference pricing. In other markets, such as the UK and
Germany, the government does not set pricing restrictions at launch, but pricing freedom is subsequently limited, such as by the operation of a profit and price control plan in the UK and by the operation of a reference price system in Germany.
Companies also face significant delays in market access for new products, mainly in France, Spain, Italy and Belgium, and more than two years can elapse before new medicines become available on some national markets. Additionally, member states of
the EU have regularly imposed new or additional cost containment measures for pharmaceuticals. In recent years, Italy, for example, has imposed mandatory price decreases. The existence of price differentials within the EU due to the different
national pricing and reimbursement laws leads to significant parallel trade flows.

In the U.S. the healthcare industry is
subject to various government-imposed regulations authorizing prices or price controls that have and will continue to have an impact on our net sales. We participate in state government Medicaid programs, as well as certain other qualifying Federal
and state government programs whereby discounts and rebates are provided to participating state and local government entities. We also participate in government programs that specify discounts to certain government entities, the most significant of
which are the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. These entities receive minimum discounts based off a defined “non-federal average manufacturer price” for purchases. In March 2010, the U.S. government
enacted healthcare reform legislation, signing into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (HR 3590) and a reconciliation bill containing a package of changes to the healthcare bill. The legislation makes extensive changes to the current
system of healthcare insurance and benefits intended to broaden coverage and reduce costs. These bills significantly change how Americans receive healthcare coverage and how they pay for it. They also have a significant impact on companies, in
particular those companies in the pharmaceutical industry and other healthcare related industries, including BMS. We have experienced and will continue to experience additional financial costs and certain other changes to our business as the new
healthcare law is implemented. For example, minimum rebates on our Medicaid drug sales have increased from 15.1 percent to 23.1 percent and Medicaid rebates have also been extended to drugs used in risk-based Medicaid managed care plans. In
addition, we extend discounts to certain critical access hospitals, cancer hospitals and other covered entities as required by the expansion of the 340B Drug Pricing Program under the Public Health Service Act.

In 2011, we were also required to provide a 50 percent discount on our brand-name drugs to patients who fall within the Medicare Part D
coverage gap, also referred to as the “donut hole” and we will pay an annual non-tax-deductible fee to the federal government based on an allocation of our market share of branded prior year sales to certain government programs including
Medicare, Medicaid, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense and TRICARE.

For further discussion of these
rebates and programs, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Net Sales” and “—Critical Accounting Policies.”

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials

In general, we purchase our raw materials and supplies required for the production of our products in the open market. For some products, we purchase our raw materials and supplies from one source (the
only source available to us) or a single source (the only approved source among many available to us), thereby requiring us to obtain such raw materials and supplies from that particular source. We attempt, if possible, to mitigate our raw material
supply risks, through inventory management and alternative sourcing strategies. For further discussion of sourcing, see “—Manufacturing and Quality Assurance” below and discussions of particular products.

Manufacturing and Quality Assurance

To meet all expected product demand, we operate and manage our manufacturing network, including our third-party contract manufacturers, and the inventory related thereto, in a manner that permits us to
improve efficiency while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity. Pharmaceutical production processes are complex, highly regulated and vary widely from product to product. Given that shifting or adding manufacturing capacity
can be a lengthy process requiring significant capital and other expenditures as well as regulatory approvals, we maintain and operate our flexible manufacturing network, consisting of internal and external resources that minimize unnecessary
product transfers and inefficient uses of manufacturing capacity. For further discussion of the regulatory impact on our manufacturing, see “—Government Regulation and Price Constraints” above.

Our pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities are located in the U.S., Puerto Rico, France, Italy, Ireland, Japan, Mexico and China and
require significant ongoing capital investment for both maintenance and compliance with increasing regulatory requirements. In addition, as our product line changes over the next several years, we expect to continue modification of our existing
manufacturing network to meet complex processing standards that may be required for newly introduced products, including biologics. Biologics manufacturing involves more complex processes than those of traditional pharmaceutical operations. The FDA
approved our large scale multi-product bulk biologics manufacturing facility in Devens, Massachusetts in May 2012.


We rely on third parties to manufacture or supply us with certain active ingredients
necessary for us to manufacture various products, including

Plavix*

,

Baraclude

,

Avalide*

,

Reyataz

,

Abilify*

,

Erbitux*

, the

Sustiva

Franchise,

Orencia

,

Yervoy

,

Onglyza

,

Kombiglyze

and

Forxiga

. To maintain a stable supply of these products, we take a variety of actions including inventory management and maintenance of additional quantities of materials, when possible, designed to provide for a
reasonable level of these ingredients to be held by the third-party supplier, us or both, so that our manufacturing operations are not interrupted. As an additional protection, in some cases, we take steps to maintain an approved back-up source
where available. For example, we will rely on the capacity of our Devens, Massachusetts facility and the capacity available at our third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture

Orencia

.

If we or any third-party manufacturer that we rely on for existing or future products is unable to maintain a stable supply of products,
operate at sufficient capacity to meet our order requirements, comply with government regulations for manufacturing pharmaceuticals or meet the complex processing requirements for biologics, our business performance and prospects could be negatively
impacted. Additionally, if we or any of our third-party suppliers were to experience extended plant shutdowns or substantial unplanned increases in demand or suspension of manufacturing for regulatory reasons, we could experience an interruption in
supply of certain products or product shortages until production could be resumed or expanded.

In connection with
divestitures, licensing arrangements or distribution agreements of certain of our products, or in certain other circumstances, we have entered into agreements under which we have agreed to supply such products to third parties. In addition to
liabilities that could arise from our failure to supply such products under the agreements, these arrangements could require us to invest in facilities for the production of non-strategic products, result in additional regulatory filings and
obligations or cause an interruption in the manufacturing of our own products.

Our success depends in great measure upon
customer confidence in the quality of our products and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and effectiveness. Product quality arises from a total commitment to quality in all parts of our operations, including research and
development, purchasing, facilities planning, manufacturing, and distribution. We maintain quality-assurance procedures relating to the quality and integrity of technical information and production processes.

Control of production processes involves detailed specifications for ingredients, equipment and facilities, manufacturing methods,
processes, packaging materials and labeling. We perform tests at various stages of production processes and on the final product to ensure that the product meets regulatory requirements and our standards. These tests may involve chemical and
physical chemical analyses, microbiological testing, or a combination of these along with other analyses. Quality control is provided by business unit/site quality assurance groups that monitor existing manufacturing procedures and systems used by
us, our subsidiaries and third-party suppliers.

Environmental Regulation

Our facilities and operations are subject to extensive U.S. and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and
human health and safety, including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water; the use, management and disposal of hazardous, radioactive and biological materials and wastes; and the cleanup of contamination. Pollution controls
and permits are required for many of our operations, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal or revocation by the issuing authorities.

Our environment, health and safety group monitors our operations around the world, providing us with an overview of regulatory requirements and overseeing the implementation of our standards for
compliance. We also incur operating and capital costs for such matters on an ongoing basis. We expended approximately $21 million in 2012, $16 million in 2011 and $15 million in 2010 on capital projects undertaken specifically to meet environmental
requirements. Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety requirements and the permits required for our operations, we nevertheless could incur additional costs, including civil or
criminal fines or penalties, clean-up costs, or third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, for violations or liabilities under these laws.

Many of our current and former facilities have been in operation for many years, and over time, we and other operators of those facilities have generated, used, stored or disposed of substances or wastes
that are considered hazardous under Federal, state and/or foreign environmental laws, including the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). As a result, the soil and groundwater at or under certain of
these facilities is or may be contaminated, and we may be required to make significant expenditures to investigate, control and remediate such contamination, and in some cases to provide compensation and/or restoration for damages to natural
resources. Currently, we are involved in investigation and remediation at 14 current or former facilities. We have also been identified as a “potentially responsible party” (PRP) under applicable laws for environmental conditions at
approximately 23 former waste disposal or reprocessing facilities operated by third parties at which investigation and/or remediation activities are ongoing.

We may face liability under CERCLA and other Federal, state and foreign laws for the entire cost of investigation or remediation of contaminated sites, or for natural resource damages, regardless of fault
or ownership at the time of the disposal or release. In addition, at certain sites we bear remediation responsibility pursuant to contractual obligations. Generally, at third-party operator sites involving multiple PRPs, liability has been or is
expected to be apportioned based on the nature and amount of hazardous substances disposed of by each party at the site and the number of financially viable PRPs. For additional information about these matters, see “Item 8. Financial
Statements—Note 21. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies.”


Employees

As of December 31, 2012, we employed approximately 28,000 people.

Foreign Operations

We have significant operations outside the U.S. They are conducted both through our subsidiaries and through distributors.

For a geographic breakdown of net sales, see the table captioned Geographic Areas in “Item 8. Financial
Statements—Note 2. Business Segment Information” and for further discussion of our net sales by geographic area see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Net
Sales.”

International operations are subject to certain risks, which are inherent in conducting business abroad,
including, but not limited to, currency fluctuations, possible nationalization or expropriation, price and exchange controls, counterfeit products, limitations on foreign participation in local enterprises and other restrictive governmental actions.
Our international businesses are also subject to government-imposed constraints, including laws on pricing or reimbursement for use of products.

Depending on the direction of change relative to the U.S. dollar, foreign currency values can increase or decrease the reported dollar value of our net assets and results of operations. The change in
foreign exchange rates had a net unfavorable impact on the growth rate of revenues in 2012. While we cannot predict with certainty future changes in foreign exchange rates or the effect they will have on the growth rate of revenues, we attempt to
mitigate their impact through operational means and by using various financial instruments. See the discussions under “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and “Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 9.
Financial Instruments.”

Item 1A.

RISK FACTORS.

Any of the
factors described below could significantly and negatively affect our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results, or credit ratings, which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. Additional risks and
uncertainties not presently known to us, or risks that we currently consider immaterial, may also impair our operations.

We face intense competition from other biopharmaceutical manufacturers, including for both innovative medicines and lower-priced
generic products.

Competition, including lower-priced generic versions of our products, is a major challenge both
within the U.S. and internationally. We face patent expirations and increasingly aggressive generic competition. Such competition may include (i) new products developed by competitors that have lower prices, real or perceived superior efficacy
(benefit) or safety (risk) profiles, or that are otherwise competitive with our products; (ii) technological advances and patents attained by our competitors; (iii) earlier-than-expected competition from generic companies;
(iv) clinical study results from our products or a competitor’s products; (v) business combinations among our competitors and major customers; and (vi) competing interests for external partnerships to develop and bring new
products to markets. We could also experience limited or no market access from real or perceived differences in value propositions for our products compared with competitors.

It is possible that we may lose market exclusivity of a product earlier than expected.

In the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, the majority of an innovative product’s commercial value is usually realized
during the period in which it has market exclusivity. In the U.S. and some other countries, when market exclusivity expires and generic versions of a product are approved and marketed, there are usually very substantial and rapid declines in the
product’s sales.

Market exclusivity for our products is based upon patent rights and/or certain regulatory forms
of exclusivity. The scope of our patent rights vary from country to country and may also be dependent on the availability of meaningful legal remedies in that country. The failure to obtain patent and other intellectual property rights, or
limitations on the use or loss of such rights, could be material to us. In some countries, including certain EU member states, basic patent protection for our products may not exist because certain countries did not historically offer the right to
obtain specific types of patents and/or we (or our licensors) did not file in those markets. In addition, the patent environment outside the U.S. can be unpredictable and the validity and enforceability of patents cannot be predicted with certainty.
Absent relevant patent protection for a product, once the data exclusivity period expires, generic versions of the product can be approved and marketed. In addition, prior to the expiration of data exclusivity, a competitor could seek regulatory
approval by submitting its own clinical trial data to obtain marketing approval.

Manufacturers of generic products are
also increasingly seeking to challenge patents before they expire. Key patents covering three of our key products (Atripla*, Baraclude and Sprycel) are currently the subject of patent litigation. In some cases, generic manufacturers may choose to
launch a generic product “at risk” before the expiration of the applicable patent(s) and/or before the final resolution of related patent litigation. For example, we may face generic competition for

Baraclude

beginning in
2013 following a federal court’s decision to invalidate the composition of matter patent in February 2013. There is no assurance that a particular product will enjoy market exclusivity for the full period of time that appears in the estimates
disclosed in this Form 10-K.

Increased pricing pressure and other restrictions in the U.S. and abroad from managed
care organizations, institutional purchasers, and government agencies and programs could negatively affect our net sales and profit margins.

Pharmaceutical products continue to be subject to increasing price pressures and other restrictions in the U.S., the EU and other regions around the world, including but not limited to: (i) rules
and practices of managed care organizations and institutional and governmental purchasers; (ii) judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations for Medicare, Medicaid and U.S. healthcare reform, including the 2010 Patient Protection
and Affordable Care Act and any potential additional U.S. healthcare reform measures; (iii) the potential impact of importation restrictions, legislative and/or regulatory changes, pharmaceutical reimbursement, Medicare Part D Formularies and
product pricing in general; (iv) delays in gaining reimbursement and/or reductions in reimbursement amounts in countries with government-mandated, cost-containment programs; (v) government price erosion mechanisms across Europe, resulting
in deflation for pharmaceutical product pricing; (vi) other developments in technology and/or industry practices that could directly or indirectly impact the reimbursement policies and practices of third-party payers; and (vii) limited or
no market access due to real or perceived differences in value propositions for our products compared to competing products.

We may
experience difficulties or delays in the development and commercialization of new products.

Developing and
commercializing new products includes inherent risks and uncertainties, such as (i) compounds or products that may appear promising in development but fail to reach market within the expected or optimal timeframe, or fail ever to reach market
or to be approved for product extensions or additional indications, including for efficacy or safety concerns, the delay or denial of necessary regulatory approvals, delays or difficulties with producing products at a commercial scale level or
excessive costs to manufacture products; (ii) failure to enter into or successfully implement optimal alliances for the development and/or commercialization of new products; (iii) failure to maintain a consistent scope and variety of
promising late-stage products; (iv) failure of one or more of our products to achieve or maintain commercial viability; and (v) changes in the regulatory approval processes that may cause delays or denials of new product approvals. We have
observed a recent trend by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration to delay its approval decision on a new product beyond its announced action date by as much as six months or longer.


Regulatory approval delays are especially common when the product is expected to have a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy as required by the FDA to address significant risk/benefit issues.
The inability to bring a product to market or a significant delay in the expected approval and related launch date of a new product could potentially have a negative impact on our net sales and earnings and, if the product was acquired, it could
result in a significant impairment of in-process research and development or other intangible assets. Further, if certain acquired pipeline programs are cancelled or if we believe that their commercial prospects have been reduced, we may recognize
material non-cash impairment charges for those programs. These non-cash impairment charge could be material such as the $1.8 billion impairment for BMS-986094, which we recorded in 2012. Finally, a natural or man-made disaster or sabotage of
research and development labs, our compound library and/or a loss of key molecules and intermediaries could negatively impact the product development cycle.

Failure to execute our business strategy could adversely impact our growth and profitability.

We are a biopharmaceutical company with a focus on innovative products for high unmet medical needs. To build a foundation for the future, our strategy is to grow our key marketed products, advance our
late-stage pipeline and manage our costs. We may not be able to consistently replenish our innovative pipeline, through internal research and development or transactions with third parties. The competition among major pharmaceutical companies for
acquisition and product licensing opportunities is intense, and we may not be able to locate suitable acquisition targets or licensing partners at reasonable prices, or successfully execute such transactions. We also may not be able to realize the
expected increased efficiencies and effectiveness from continuous improvement initiatives or other changes in our structure or operations, including from the recent reorganization of our commercial operations and the creation of our Enterprises
Services organization. In addition, realizing synergies and other expected benefits from acquisitions, divestitures, mergers, alliances, restructurings or other strategic initiatives, may take longer than expected to complete or may encounter other
difficulties, including the need for regulatory approval where applicable. If we are unable to support and grow our currently marketed products, successfully execute the launches of newly approved products, advance our late-stage pipeline and manage
our costs effectively, we could experience a significant or material negative impact to our operating results and financial condition. In addition, our failure to hire and retain personnel with the right expertise and experience in critical
operations could adversely impact the execution of our business strategy.

The businesses we acquire may
underperform, and we may not be able to successfully integrate them into our existing business.

We may continue to
support our pipeline with our licensing and acquisitions strategy. In August 2012, we acquired Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Amylin), a biopharmaceuticals company dedicated to the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative medicines
for patients with diabetes and other metabolic diseases. Amylin and our other acquired businesses, products and technologies may underperform relative to expectations, which may negatively impact our financial results including potential impairment
charges for acquired intangible assets, including identifiable intangible assets attributed to the Amylin acquisition of $6.5 billion at the acquisition date. Future sales, profits and cash flows of an acquired company’s products, technologies
and pipeline candidates, may not materialize due to lower product uptake, delayed or missed pipeline opportunities, the inability to capture expected synergies, increased competition, safety concerns, regulatory issues, supply chain problems, or
other factors beyond our control. Substantial difficulties, costs and delays could result from integrating our acquisitions including for (i) research & development, manufacturing, distribution, sales, marketing, promotion and
information technology activities; (ii) policies, procedures, processes, controls and compliance; (iii) company cultures; (iv) compensation structures and other human resource activities; and (v) tax considerations.

We depend on certain key products for most of our net sales, cash flows and earnings.

We have historically derived a majority of our revenue and earnings from a few key products. For example, Plavix* represented over 33%
of our revenues in 2011. While we are becoming less dependent on any single product, we still derive a significant amount of our revenues from a few key products. In 2012, Abilify* net sales of $2.8 billion represented 16% of revenues. Reyataz and
the Sustiva franchise, with combined net sales of $3.0 billion, each represented approximately 9% of revenues, Baraclude, Sprycel and Orencia net sales each exceeded $1.0 billion. A reduction in net sales of one or more of these products could
significantly negatively impact our net sales, cash flows and earnings.

Changes in U.S. or foreign laws and
regulations may negatively affect our net sales and profit margins.

We could become subject to new government laws
and regulations, such as (i) additional healthcare reform initiatives in the U.S. or in other countries, including additional mandatory discounts; (ii) changes in corporate tax regulation, including as part of the proposed U.S. budget
deficit reduction package, which could include limiting foreign tax credits, taxing certain tax havens, taxing certain excess income from transferring intellectual property, limiting or disallowing certain U.S. deductions for operating and interest
expenses, changing rules for earnings repatriations and eliminating certain tax credits, as well as changing the tax rate or phasing out currently available tax benefits in the U.S. and in certain foreign countries or other changes in tax law;
(iii) new laws, regulations and judicial or other governmental decisions affecting pricing, drug reimbursement, receivable repayment, access or marketing within or across jurisdictions; (iv) changes in intellectual property law;
(v) changes in accounting standards; (vi) increasing data privacy regulations and enforcement; (vii) emerging and new requirements regarding payments to healthcare professionals, and (viii) other matters, such as compulsory
licenses that could alter the protections afforded to one or more of our products. Any legal or regulatory changes could negatively affect our business, our operating results and the financial condition of our company. Emerging legislation to reduce
the budget deficit in the U.S. or in other countries, if enacted, will likely further reduce our operating results.


Product labeling changes for our marketed products could potentially result in
unexpected safety or efficacy concerns and have a negative impact on that product’s sales.

Regulatory
authorities can change the labeling for any pharmaceutical product at any time, including after the product has been on the market for years. These changes are often the result of additional data from post-marketing studies, head-to-head trials,
reporting of adverse events, studies that identify biomarkers (objective characteristics that can indicate a particular response to a product or therapy), or other studies that produce important additional information about a product. The new
information added to a product’s label can affect the safety and/or the efficacy profile of the product, leading to product recalls, withdrawals, or declining revenue, as well as product liability claims. Sometimes the additional information
from these studies identifies a portion of the patient population that may be non-responsive to a medicine and labeling changes based on such studies may limit the patient population, such as the changes to the labeling for Plavix* and Erbitux* a
few years ago. The studies providing such additional information may be sponsored by us, but they can also be sponsored by our competitors, insurance companies, government institutions, managed care organizations, influential scientists,
investigators, or other interested parties. While additional safety and efficacy information from these studies assist us and healthcare providers in identifying the best patient population for each of our products, it can also have a negative
impact on sales for any such product to the extent that the patient population or product labeling becomes more limited. Additionally, certain study results, especially from head-to-head trials, could affect a product’s formulary listing, which
could also adversely affect sales.

We could experience difficulties and delays in the manufacturing, distribution and sale of our
products.

Our product supply and related patient access to products could be negatively impacted by, among other
things: (i) seizure or recalls of products or forced closings of manufacturing plants; (ii) supply chain continuity including from natural or man-made disasters at one of our facilities or at a critical supplier or vendor, as well as our
failure or the failure of any of our vendors or suppliers to comply with Current Good Manufacturing Practices and other applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines that could lead to manufacturing shutdowns, product shortages and delays
in product manufacturing; (iii) manufacturing, quality assurance/quality control, supply problems or governmental approval delays; (iv) the failure of a sole source or single source supplier to provide us with necessary raw materials,
supplies or finished goods for an extended period of time; (v) the failure of a third-party manufacturer to supply us with finished product on time; (vi) construction or regulatory approval delays related to new facilities or the expansion
of existing facilities, including those intended to support future demand for our biologics products; (vii) the failure to meet new and emerging regulations requiring products to be tracked throughout the distribution channels using unique
identifiers; and (viii) other manufacturing or distribution issues including limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements; changes in the types of products produced, such as biologics; physical limitations or other business
interruptions.

Adverse outcomes in legal matters could negatively affect our business.

Current or future lawsuits, claims, proceedings and government investigations could preclude or delay commercialization of products or
could potentially adversely affect operations, profitability, liquidity or financial condition, after any possible insurance recoveries where available. Such legal matters include (i) intellectual property disputes; (ii) sales and
marketing practices in the U.S. and internationally; (iii) adverse decisions in litigation, including product liability and commercial cases; (iv) recalls or withdrawals of pharmaceutical products or forced closings of manufacturing
plants; (v) the failure to fulfill obligations under supply contracts with the government and other customers; (vi) product pricing and promotional matters; (vii) lawsuits and claims asserting, or investigations into, violations of
securities, antitrust, Federal and state pricing, consumer protection, antibribery (such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practice Act or UK Anti-Bribery Act) and other laws; (viii) environmental, health and safety matters; and (ix) tax
liabilities.

We depend on third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, and other obligations.

We rely on suppliers, vendors, outsourcing partners, alliance partners and other third parties to research,
develop, manufacture, commercialize, co-promote and sell our products; manage certain human resource, finance, information technology and other functional services; and meet their contractual, regulatory, and other obligations in relation to their
arrangements with us. Some of these third-party providers are located in markets that are subject to political risk, corruption, infrastructure problems and natural disasters in addition to country specific privacy and data security risks given
current legal and regulatory environments. The failure of any critical third party to meet its obligations; adequately deploy business continuity plans in the event of a crisis; and/or satisfactorily resolve significant disagreements with us or
address other factors, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s operations and results. In addition, if these third parties violate or are alleged to have violated any laws or regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
Practice Act, U.K. Bribery Act and other similar laws and regulations, during the performance of their obligations for us, it is possible that we could suffer financial and reputational harm or other negative outcomes, including possible legal
consequences.

We are increasingly dependent on information technology and our systems and infrastructure face
certain risks, including from cyber security and data leakage.

A significant breakdown, invasion, corruption,
destruction or interruption of critical information technology systems, or infrastructure by employees, others with authorized access to our systems, or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations. The ever-increasing use and evolution
of technology, including cloud-based computing, creates opportunities for data leakage of confidential information. We could also experience a business interruption, information theft, or reputational damage from malware or other cyber attacks,
which may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage, either internally or at our third-party providers. Although the aggregate impact on our operations and financial condition has not been material to date, we have been the
targets of events of this nature and expect them to continue. We have invested in industry appropriate protections and monitoring practices of our data and information technology to reduce these risks and continue to monitor our systems on an
ongoing basis for any current or potential threats. There can be no assurance, however, that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches to our or our third party providers’ databases or systems that could adversely affect our business.


The expansion of social media platforms presents new risks and challenges.

The inappropriate and/or unauthorized use of certain media vehicles could cause brand damage or information leakage or could lead to
legal implications, including from the improper collection and/or dissemination of personally identifiable information. In addition, negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on any social networking web site could damage our reputation,
brand image and goodwill. Further, the disclosure of non-public company sensitive information through external media channels could lead to information loss, as there might not be structured processes in place to secure and protect information.
Identifying new points of entry as social media continues to expand presents new challenges.

Adverse changes in U.S., global,
regional or local economic conditions could adversely affect our profitability.

The world’s major economies
hold historically-high debt levels while experiencing slow economic growth and high unemployment. The European sovereign debt crisis has strained government spending and created capital markets volatility. We have significant operations in Europe,
including for manufacturing. Our exposure to customer credit risks in Europe, including from government-guaranteed hospital receivables, will likely increase as our ability to factor receivables becomes more limited. In addition, future pension plan
funding requirements continue to be sensitive to global economic conditions and the related impact on equity markets. We are also exposed to other commercial risks and economic factors over which we have no control, which could pose significant
challenges to our underlying profitability.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates could have a material
adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity.

We have significant operations outside of the U.S. Net sales
from operations outside of the U.S. accounted for approximately 41% of our net sales in 2012. As such, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which can be difficult to mitigate. We are also exposed to changes in interest
rates. Our ability to access the money markets and/or capital markets could be impeded if adverse liquidity market conditions occur.

The illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit versions of our products or stolen products could have a negative impact on our
reputation and business.

Third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products,
which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing and testing standards. A patient who receives a counterfeit drug may be at risk for a number of dangerous health consequences. Our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit
drugs sold under our brand name. In addition, thefts of inventory at warehouses, plants or while in-transit, which are not properly stored and which are sold through unauthorized channels, could adversely impact patient safety, our reputation and
our business.

Item 7.        MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (which may be referred to as Bristol-Myers Squibb, BMS, the Company, we, our or us) is a global
biopharmaceutical company whose mission is to discover, develop and deliver innovative medicines that help patients prevail over serious diseases. We license, manufacture, market, distribute and sell pharmaceutical products on a global basis.

The following key events and transactions occurred during 2012 as discussed in further detail in the Strategy, Product and
Pipeline Developments and Results of Operations sections of Management’s Discussion and Analysis:

•

Our net sales and earnings declined as a result of the loss of exclusivity of

Plavix

* (clopidogrel bisulfate) and

Avapro*

/

Avalide*

(irbesartan/irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide).

•

We received significant regulatory approvals pertaining to

Eliquis

(apixaban) for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial
fibrillation (NVAF),

Forxiga

(dapagliflozin) and the

Orencia

(abatacept) subcutaneous formulation.

•

We acquired Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc (Amylin) and expanded our diabetes alliance arrangement with AstraZeneca PLC (AstraZeneca) to include
Amylin-related products.

•

We discontinued the development of BMS-986094 (formerly INX-189), a compound which we acquired as part of our acquisition of Inhibitex, Inc.
(Inhibitex) to treat hepatitis C virus infection, in the interest of patient safety, which resulted in a $1.8 billion pre-tax impairment charge.

Highlights

The following table is a summary of our financial highlights:

Our non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP earnings and related EPS information, are adjusted to
exclude specified items which represent certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other items impacting the comparability of financial results. For a detailed listing of all specified items and further information and reconciliations of non-GAAP
financial measures see “—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.

Business Environment

The pharmaceutical/biotechnology industry is highly competitive and subject to numerous government regulations. Many competitive factors
may significantly affect sales of our products, including product efficacy, safety, price, demand, competition and cost-effectiveness; marketing effectiveness; market access; product labeling; quality control and quality assurance of our
manufacturing operations; and research and development of new products. To successfully compete in the healthcare industry, we must demonstrate that our products offer medical benefits and cost advantages. Our new product introductions often compete
with other products already on the market in the same therapeutic category, in addition to potential competition of new products that competitors may introduce in the future. We manufacture branded products, which are priced higher than generic
products. Generic competition is one of our leading challenges.


In the pharmaceutical/biotechnology industry, the majority of an innovative product’s
commercial value is usually realized during its market exclusivity period. Afterwards, it is no longer protected by a patent and is subject to new competing products in the form of generic brands. Upon exclusivity loss, we can experience a
significant reduction of that product’s sales in a short period of time. Competitors seeking approval of biological products under a full Biologics License Application (BLA) must file their own safety and efficacy data and address the
challenges of biologics manufacturing, involving more complex processes and costs than those of other pharmaceutical operations. Under the U.S. healthcare legislation enacted in 2010, there is an abbreviated path for regulatory approval of generic
versions of biological products. This path for approval of biosimilar products under the U.S. healthcare legislation significantly affects the regulatory data exclusivity for biological products. The legislation provides a regulatory mechanism
allowing for regulatory approval of biologic drugs similar to (but not generic copies of) innovative drugs on the basis of less extensive data than required by a full BLA. It is not possible at this time to reasonably assess the impact of the U.S.
biosimilar legislation on the Company.

Globally, the healthcare industry is subject to various government-imposed regulations
authorizing prices or price controls that will continue to impact our net sales. In March 2010, the U.S. government enacted healthcare reform legislation, signing into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (HR 3590) and a reconciliation
bill containing a package of changes to the healthcare bill. We will continue to experience additional financial costs and certain other changes to our business as healthcare law provisions become effective.

The aggregate financial impact of U.S. healthcare reform over the next few years depends on a number of factors, including but not
limited to pending implementation guidance, potential changes in sales volume eligible for the new rebates, discounts or fees, and the impact of cost sharing arrangements with certain alliance partners. Our future net sales beginning in 2014 could
potentially be positively impacted from the expected increase in the number of people with healthcare coverage from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

In many markets outside the U.S., we operate in environments of government-mandated, cost-containment programs, or under other regulatory bodies or groups exerting downward pressure on pricing. For
example, pricing freedom is limited in the UK by the operation of a profit control plan and in Germany by the operation of a reference price system. Many European countries have continuing fiscal challenges as healthcare payers, including government
agencies, have reduced and are expected to continue to reduce the cost of healthcare through actions that directly or indirectly impose additional price restrictions. Companies also face significant delays in market access for new products as more
than two years can elapse after drug approval before new medicines are available in some countries.

The growth of Managed
Care Organizations (MCOs) in the U.S. significantly impacted competition in the healthcare industry. MCOs seek to reduce healthcare expenditures for participants through volume purchases and long-term contractual discounts with various
pharmaceutical providers. Because of the market potential created by the large pool of participants, marketing prescription drugs to MCOs is an important part of our strategy. Companies compete for inclusion in MCO formularies and we generally are
successful in having our key products included. We believe that developments in the managed care industry, including continued consolidation, continue to have a downward pressure on prices.

Pharmaceutical and biotechnology production processes are complex, highly regulated and vary widely by product. Shifting or adding
manufacturing capacity is usually a lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures and regulatory approvals. Biologics manufacturing involves more complex processes than those of traditional pharmaceutical operations. As biologics become
a larger percentage of our product portfolio, we will continue to maintain supply arrangements with third-party manufacturers and incur substantial investments to increase our internal capacity to produce biologics on a commercial scale. The FDA
approved our large scale multi-product bulk biologics manufacturing facility in Devens, Massachusetts in May 2012.

We
maintain a competitive position in the market and strive to uphold this position, depending on our success in discovering, developing and delivering innovative, cost-effective products to help patients prevail over serious diseases.

We are the subject of a number of significant pending lawsuits, claims, proceedings and investigations. It is not possible at this time
to reasonably assess the final outcomes of these investigations or litigations. For additional discussion of legal matters, see “Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 21. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies.”

Strategy

Over the past
few years, we transformed our Company into a focused biopharmaceutical company. We continue to focus on sustaining our business and building a foundation for the future by growing our newer key marketed products, advancing our pipeline portfolio and
managing our costs. We expect that our portfolio will become increasingly diversified across products and geographies over the next few years.


We experienced substantial exclusivity losses this year for

Plavix*

and

Avapro*

/

Avalide*

, which together had more than $8 billion of net sales in 2011. We had been preparing for this for a number of years. As expected, we experienced a rapid, precipitous, and material decline in

Plavix*

and

Avapro*

/

Avalide*

net sales and a reduction in net income and operating cash flow. Such events are the norm in the industry when companies experience the loss of exclusivity of a significant product. We will also face additional
exclusivity losses in the coming years. We also face significant challenges with an increasingly complex global and regulatory environment and global economic uncertainty, particularly in the European Union (EU). We believe our strategy to grow our
newer marketed products and our robust research and development (R&D) pipeline, particularly within the therapeutic areas of immuno-oncology, cardiovascular/metabolic disease and virology, position us well for the future.

We continue to expand our biologics capabilities. We still rely significantly on small molecules as our strongest, most reliable starting
point for discovering potential new medicines, but large molecules or biologics, derived from recombinant DNA technologies are becoming increasingly important. Currently, more than 40% of our pipeline compounds are biologics, as are four of our key
marketed products, including

Yervoy

(ipilimumab).

We also continue to support our pipeline with our licensing and
acquisitions strategy, referred to as our “string of pearls.” During the third quarter of 2012, we acquired Amylin, a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative medicines for
patients with diabetes and other metabolic diseases. Following the completion of our acquisition of Amylin, we entered into a collaboration with AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca, which builds upon our existing
alliance, further expanding our collaboration strategy. We are currently integrating the Amylin business into our development, manufacturing and commercial operations. We are also seeking to build relationships with academic organizations that have
innovative programs and capabilities that complement our own internal efforts.

Product and Pipeline Developments

We manage our research and development (R&D) programs on a portfolio basis, investing resources in each stage of research and
development from early discovery through late-stage development. We continually evaluate our portfolio of R&D assets to ensure that there is an appropriate balance of early-stage and late-stage programs to support future growth. We consider our
R&D programs that have entered into Phase III development to be significant, as these programs constitute our late-stage development pipeline. These Phase III development programs include both investigational compounds in Phase III development
for initial indications and marketed products that are in Phase III development for additional indications or formulations. Spending on these programs represents approximately 30-40% of our annual R&D expenses. No individual investigational
compound or marketed product represented 10% or more of our R&D expenses in any of the last three years. While we do not expect all of our late-stage development programs to make it to market, our late-stage development programs are the R&D
programs that could potentially have an impact on our revenue and earnings within the next few years. The following are the recent significant developments in our marketed products and our late-stage pipeline:

Eliquis

– an oral Factor Xa inhibitor, targeted at stroke prevention in NVAF and the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolic (VTE)
disorders.

Eliquis

is part of our strategic alliance with Pfizer, Inc. (Pfizer)

•

In December 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved

Eliquis

to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients
with NVAF.

Eliquis

also received regulatory approval for this indication in Japan and Canada in December 2012, in the EU in November 2012, and in South Korea in January 2013.

•

In December 2012, the Company announced the results of the Phase III AMPLIFY-EXT trial, which evaluated treatment with

Eliquis

compared to
placebo over a one year period for the prevention of recurrent VTE in 2,486 patients who had already completed six to 12 months of anticoagulation treatment for VTE, including deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. In the trial, extended
treatment with

Eliquis

2.5 mg and 5 mg twice daily, demonstrated superiority versus placebo in the reduction of the composite endpoint of symptomatic, recurrent VTE and death from any cause.

Eliquis

also was superior to placebo for the
predefined secondary efficacy outcome of recurrent VTE and VTE-related death. The rate of the primary safety outcome of major bleeding was comparable across treatment groups.

•

In October 2012, the Company announced in a publication in

The Lancet

that the reductions in stroke or systemic embolism, major bleeding and
mortality demonstrated with

Eliquis

compared to warfarin in the ARISTOTLE trial were consistent across a wide range of stroke and bleeding risk scores in patients with NVAF.

•

In March 2012, additional analyses from the ARISTOTLE and AVERROES clinical trials were presented at the American College of Cardiology’s 61st
Annual Scientific Session.

Forxiga

– an oral sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor
for the treatment of diabetes that is part of our alliance with AstraZeneca

•

In November 2012, the EC approved

Forxiga

for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in the EU.


•

In June 2012, at the

nd

American Diabetes Association Scientific Sessions,
the Company and AstraZeneca announced results from a Phase III clinical study that showed

Forxiga

10 mg demonstrated significant reductions in blood sugar levels (glycosylated hemoglobin levels, or HbA1c) compared with placebo at 24 weeks
when either agent was added to existing sitagliptin therapy (with or without metformin) in adult patients with type 2 diabetes. The results were maintained over a 24-week extension and similar results were observed when the data were stratified by
background therapy. The study also demonstrated significant reductions in total body weight and fasting plasma glucose levels in patients taking

Forxiga

added to sitigliptin (with or without metformin), with results maintained throughout the
duration of the study.

•

In January 2012, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) regarding the NDA for dapagliflozin. The CRL requests additional clinical data to
allow a better assessment of the benefit-risk profile for dapagliflozin. The companies will continue to work closely with the FDA to determine the appropriate next steps for the dapagliflozin application, and are in ongoing discussions with health
authorities in other countries as part of the application procedures. The Company has met with the FDA and now has a path forward for potential approval for

Forxiga

in the U.S. The Company will provide additional data from ongoing studies to
the FDA and expects to be able to resubmit the NDA for

Forxiga

in mid-2013. At this time, the Company expects that the FDA will have a six–month period in which to review the resubmission and will hold an Advisory Committee meeting.

Hepatitis C Portfolio – (Peginterferon lambda –a novel and potential first-in-class type 3
interferon in development; Daclatasvir – a NS5A replication complex inhibitor in development; Asunaprevir – a NS3 protease inhibitor in development)

•

In November 2012, the Company announced the results of the global, D-LITE Phase IIb study, in which a 24-week regimen combining the investigational
compound peginterferon lambda-1a with the investigational direct-acting antiviral (DAA) daclatasvir and ribavirin, achieved sustained virologic response 12 weeks post-treatment of treatment-naïve, genotype 1b chronic hepatitis C virus
infection patients who achieved a protocol-defined response

•

In November 2012, the Company announced Phase II data demonstrating that the 12-week Triple DAA treatment regime of daclatasvir, asunaprevir, and
BMS-791325 (an NS5B non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor) achieved sustained virologic response 12 weeks post-treatment in 94% of treatment naïve, genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C virus infection patients.

•

In November 2012, the Company announced Phase II data demonstrating that the dual regiment of daclatasvir and asunaprevir, without interferon or
ribavarin, achieved high rates of sustained virologic response 12 weeks post-treatment in patients with genotype 1b hepatitis C virus infections who were prior null responders to alfa interferon and ribavarin.

Elotuzumab – an anti-CS1 antibody under investigation for the treatment of multiple myeloma

•

In December 2012, the Company announced the results of a small, randomized Phase II study in patients with previously treated myeloma. Two doses
were tested, 10mg/kg and 20 mg/kg in combination with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone. In the 10 mg/kg arm, median progression-free survival (PFS), or the time without disease progression or death, was not reached after 20.8 months of follow
up (N=36) and the objective response rate (ORR) was 92%. Of patients who received elotuzumab at a dose of 20 mg/kg, median PFS was 18.6 months (N=37) and ORR was 76%.

Necitumumab – a novel targeted cancer therapy for non-small cell lung cancer

•

In November 2012, we provided notice of the termination of our global codevelopment and cocommercialization arrangement for necitumumab (IMC-11F8),

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net Sales

The composition of the changes in net sales was as follows:

(a)

Includes Puerto Rico.

(b)

Includes Russia and Turkey.

(c)

Includes Japan, China, Canada, Australia and Brazil, among other countries.

(d)

Includes royalty-related revenues and sales attributed to supply agreements.

**

Change in excess of 100%.

The change in U.S. net sales in 2012 attributed to volume reflects the recent exclusivity losses of

Plavix*

and

Avapro*

/

Avalide*

, partially offset by increased demand for most key
products and the addition of

Byetta*

,

Bydureon*

, and

Symlin*

following the completion of our acquisition of Amylin ($262 million). The change in U.S. net sales in 2011 attributed to volume reflects the launch of

Yervoy

and increased demand for several key products partially offset by decreased prescription demand for

Avapro*

/

Avalide*

and

Plavix*

. The change in U.S. net sales attributed to price in both periods was a result of
higher average net selling prices for

Plavix*

and

Abilify*

partially offset by the reduction in our contractual share of

Abilify*

net sales from 58% to 53.5% in 2011 and a further reduction to 51.5% in 2012, and higher rebates
and discounts resulting from U.S. healthcare reform legislation in 2011. See “—Key Products” for further discussion of sales by key product.

Net sales in Europe decreased in 2012 primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange and lower sales of certain mature brands from divestitures and generic competition as well as generic competition for

Plavix*

and

Avapro*

/

Avalide*

partially offset by sales growth of most key products. Net sales in Europe increased in 2011 as favorable foreign exchange and sales growth of most key products more than offset the previously
mentioned lower sales of certain mature brands and generic competition for

Plavix*

and

Avapro*

/

Avalide*

. Net sales in both periods were negatively impacted by continuing fiscal challenges in many European countries as healthcare
payers, including government agencies, have reduced and are expected to continue to reduce the cost of healthcare through actions that directly or indirectly impose additional price reductions. These measures include, but are not limited to,
mandatory discounts, rebates, other price reductions and other restrictive measures.

Net sales in the Rest of the World
decreased in 2012 as growth in certain key products in Japan, China, and South Korea was more than offset by generic competition for

Plavix*

and

Avapro*

/

Avalide*,

the timing of government purchases in certain countries and lower
sales of mature brands from generic competition and divestitures. Net sales in the Rest of the World increased in 2011 primarily due to growth in certain key products in Japan, China and South Korea and favorable foreign exchange, which were
partially offset by generic competition for

Avapro*

/

Avalide*

and lower sales of mature brands from generic competition and divestitures.

Other net sales increased in 2012 because of enhanced royalty-related revenues and higher sales attributed to active pharmaceutical ingredients supply agreements resulting from recent divestitures of
manufacturing facilities and restructured alliance agreements. Other net sales are expected to continue to increase in 2013 as a result of higher royalties and alliance revenue attributed to the restructured Sanofi agreement and new
mature/over-the-counter brands collaborative agreements.

No single country outside the U.S. contributed more than 10% of our
total net sales in 2012, 2011 or 2010.

In general, our business is not seasonal. For information on U.S. pharmaceutical
prescriber demand, reference is made to the table within “—Estimated End-User Demand” below, which sets forth a comparison of changes in net sales to the estimated total prescription growth (for both retail and mail order customers)
for certain of our key products. U.S. and non-U.S. net sales are categorized based upon the location of the customer.


Revenue is reduced for and presented net of gross-to-net sales adjustments that are further
described in “—Critical Accounting Policies” below.

The reconciliation of gross sales to net sales by each
significant category of gross-to-net sales adjustments was as follows:

The activities and ending balances of each significant category of gross-to-net sales reserve adjustments
were as follows:

Gross-to-net sales adjustment rates are primarily a function of changes in sales mix and contractual and
legislative discounts and rebates. Gross-to-net sales adjustments decreased in 2012 and increased in 2011 due to:

•

All gross-to-net adjustment categories other than sales returns and other adjustments decreased in 2012 as a result of lower

Plavix*

sales
following its loss of exclusivity.

•

Managed healthcare rebates and other contract discounts also decreased in 2012 due to a $67 million reduction in the estimated amount of Medicare
Part D coverage gap discounts attributable to prior period rebates after receiving actual invoices and the nonrenewal of

Plavix*

contract discounts in the Medicare Part D program as of January 1, 2012. These rebates and discounts
increased in 2011 due to the 50% discount for patients within the Medicare Part D coverage gap.

•

Medicaid rebates also decreased in 2012 due to a $37 million reduction in the estimated amount of managed Medicaid rebates attributable to prior
periods after receiving actual invoices. In 2011, Medicaid rebates increased due to the full year impact of the expansion of rebates for drugs used in risk-based Medicaid managed care plans, higher average net selling prices for

Plavix*

and
higher Medicaid channel sales.

•

The provision for sales returns increased as a result of the loss of exclusivity in the U.S. of

Plavix*

in May 2012 and

Avapro*

/

Avalide*

in March 2012. The U.S. sales return reserves for these products at December 31, 2012 were $173 million and determined after considering several factors including estimated inventory levels in the distribution
channels. In accordance with Company policy, these products are eligible to be returned between six months prior to and 12 months after product expiration. Additional adjustments to these reserves might be required in the future for revised
estimates to various assumptions including actual returns which are generally not expected to occur until 2014. In 2011, sales returns included a $29 million reduction of a $44 million U.S. return reserve established in 2010 in connection with a
recall of certain lots of

Avalide*

due to lower returns than expected.

•

Other adjustments increased in 2012 as a result of co-pay and coupon programs.

•

Although not presented as a gross-to-net adjustment in the above tables, our contractual share of

Abilify*

and

Atripla*

gross-to-net
sales adjustments were approximately $1.5 billion in 2012, $1.3 billion in 2011 and $1.0 billion in 2010. These increases were primarily attributed to additional rebates and discounts required under U.S. healthcare reform.


Key Products

Net sales of key products represented 84% of total net sales in 2012, 86% in 2011 and 84% in 2010. The following table presents U.S. and international net sales by key product, the percentage change from
the prior period and the foreign exchange impact when compared to the prior period. Commentary detailing the reasons for significant variances for key products is provided below:

Abilify

* — an antipsychotic agent for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar mania disorder
and major depressive disorder and is part of our strategic alliance with Otsuka

•

U.S. net sales increased in 2012 due to higher average net selling prices and a $62 million reduction in BMS’s share in the estimated amount of
customer rebates and discounts attributable to 2011 based on actual invoices received that were partially offset by fluctuations in retail buying patterns. U.S. net sales increased in 2011 due to higher overall demand and higher average net selling
prices. U.S. net sales in both periods were negatively impacted by the reduction in our contractual share of net sales from 58.0% in 2010 to 53.5% in 2011 to 51.5% in 2012 and are expected to continue to be negatively impacted in 2013 as a result of
a further reduction in BMS’s contractual share of

Abilify*

net sales (estimated at approximately 35%). Estimated total U.S. prescription demand increased 1% in 2012 and 5% in 2011.

•

The estimated U.S. prescription change data provided throughout this report includes information only from
the retail and mail order channels and does not reflect product demand within other channels such as hospitals, home health care, clinics, federal facilities including Veterans Administration hospitals, and long-term care, among others. The data is
provided by Wolters Kluwer Health (WK), except for

Sprycel

, and is based on the Source Prescription Audit.

Sprycel

demand is based upon information from the Next-Generation Prescription Service version 2.0 of the National Prescription
Audit provided by the IMS Health (IMS). The data is a product of each respective service providers’ own recordkeeping and projection processes and therefore subject to the inherent limitations of estimates based on sampling and may include a
margin of error.

We continuously seek to improve the quality of our estimates of prescription change amounts and ultimate
patient/consumer demand by reviewing the calculation methodologies employed and analyzing internal and third-party data. We expect to continue to review and refine our methodologies and processes for calculation of these estimates and will monitor
the quality of our own and third parties’ data used in such calculations.

We calculated the estimated total U.S.
prescription change on a weighted-average basis to reflect the fact that mail order prescriptions include a greater volume of product supplied, compared to retail prescriptions. Mail order prescriptions typically reflect a 90-day prescription
whereas retail prescriptions typically reflect a 30-day prescription. The calculation is derived by multiplying mail order prescription data by a factor that approximates three and adding to this the retail prescriptions. We believe that a
calculation of estimated total U.S. prescription change based on this weighted-average approach provides a superior estimate of total prescription demand in retail and mail order channels. We use this methodology for our internal demand reporting.


Estimated End-User Demand

The following tables set forth for each of our key products sold in the U.S. for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010: (i) change in reported U.S. net sales for each year;
(ii) estimated total U.S. prescription change for the retail and mail order channels calculated by us based on third-party data on a weighted-average basis, and (iii) months of inventory on hand in the wholesale distribution channel.

(a)

The

Sustiva

Franchise includes sales of

Sustiva

, as well as revenue of bulk efavirenz included in the combination therapy

Atripla

*. The months on hand relates only to

Sustiva

.

(b)

Erbitux

*, Yervoy and

Nulojix

are parenterally administered products and do not have prescription-level data as physicians do not write
prescriptions for these products.

(c)

Orencia

intravenous formulation is a parenterally administered product and does not have prescription-level data as physicians do not write
prescriptions for this product. The Orencia subcutaneous formulation (

Orencia SC

) is not parenterally administered and was launched in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2011.

Orencia SC

sales were $201 million in 2012 and $15 million
in 2011.

(d)

Yervoy

and

Nulojix

were launched in the U.S. in the second quarter of 2011.

(e)

Byetta

Change in excess of 100%.

Pursuant to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Consent Order described below under “—SEC Consent Order”, we monitor the level of inventory on hand in the U.S. wholesaler
distribution channel and outside of the U.S. in the direct customer distribution channel. We are obligated to disclose products with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand, subject to a de minimis exception. Estimated
levels of inventory in the distribution channel in excess of one month on hand for these products were not material as of the dates indicated above. Below are U.S. products that had estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel in excess
of one month on hand at December 31, 2012, and international products that had estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel in excess of one month on hand at September 30, 2012.

Plavix

* had 1.3 months of inventory on hand in the U.S. compared to 0.5 months of inventory on hand at
December 31, 2011 due to the loss of exclusivity in May 2012. We expect a gradual decrease in inventory on hand of

Plavix*

to occur over the next few years as product in the wholesale distribution channel continues to be worked down or
returned. Levels of inventory on hand in the wholesale and retail distribution channels were considered in assessing the sales return reserves established as of December 31, 2012.

Avapro*/Avalide*

had 1.9 months of inventory on hand in the U.S. compared to 0.6 of inventory on hand at
December 31, 2011 due to the loss of exclusivity in March 2012 and a one-time increase of $3 million of inventory in the wholesale and retail distribution channels corresponding with the transition of

Avapro*/Avalide*

manufacturing to
Sanofi pursuant to the restructured agreement. Levels of inventory on hand in the wholesale and retail distribution channels were considered in assessing the sales return reserves established as of December 31, 2012.

Dafalgan

, an analgesic product sold principally in Europe, had 1.1 months of inventory on hand at direct customers
compared to 1.0 months of inventory on hand at December 31, 2011. The level of inventory on hand was primarily due to ordering patterns of pharmacists in France.


Fervex

, a cold and flu product, had 2.9 months of inventory on hand
internationally at direct customers compared to 5.3 months of inventory on hand at December 31, 2011. The level of inventory on hand decreased following the peak of flu season, with the remaining inventory on hand primarily attributable to
ordering patterns of pharmacists in France.

Luftal

, an antacid product, had 1.5 months of inventory on
hand internationally at direct customers compared to 1.9 months of inventory on hand at December 31, 2011. The level of inventory on hand was primarily due to government purchasing patterns in Brazil.

In the U.S., for all products sold exclusively through wholesalers or through distributors, we generally determined our months on hand
estimates using inventory levels of product on hand and the amount of out-movement provided by our three largest wholesalers, which account for approximately 90% of total gross sales of U.S. products, and provided by our distributors. Factors that
may influence our estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, wholesaler purchases in light of increases in wholesaler list prices, new product launches, new warehouse openings by wholesalers and new customer stockings by
wholesalers. In addition, these estimates are calculated using third-party data, which may be impacted by their recordkeeping processes.

For our businesses outside of the U.S., we have significantly more direct customers. Limited information on direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the
reliability of third-party demand information, where available, varies widely. In cases where direct customer product level inventory, ultimate patient/consumer demand or out-movement data does not exist or is otherwise not available, we have
developed a variety of other methodologies to estimate such data, including using such factors as historical sales made to direct customers and third-party market research data related to prescription trends and end-user demand. Accordingly, we rely
on a variety of methods to estimate direct customer product level inventory and to calculate months on hand. Factors that may affect our estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, direct customer purchases in light of price
increases, new product launches, new warehouse openings by direct customers, new customer stockings by direct customers and expected direct customer purchases for governmental bidding situations. As such, all of the information required to estimate
months on hand in the direct customer distribution channel for non-U.S. business for the year ended December 31, 2012 is not available prior to the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K. We will disclose any product with levels of inventory
in excess of one month on hand or expected demand, subject to a de minimis exception, in the next quarterly report on Form 10-Q.

Expenses

**

Change is in excess of 100%.

Cost of
products sold

Cost of products sold consists of material costs, internal labor and overhead from our owned
manufacturing sites, third-party processing costs, other supply chain costs and the settlement of foreign currency forward contracts that are used to hedge forecasted intercompany inventory purchase transactions. Essentially all of these costs are
managed by our global manufacturing and supply organization. Cost of products also includes royalties and profit sharing attributed to licensed products and alliances, amortization of acquired developed technology costs from business combinations
and milestone payments that occur on or after regulatory approval.

Cost of products sold can vary between periods as a result
of product mix (particularly resulting from royalties and profit sharing expenses in connection with our alliances), price, inflation and costs attributed to the rationalization of manufacturing sites resulting in accelerated depreciation,
impairment charges and other stranded costs. In addition, changes in foreign currency may also provide volatility given a high percentage of total costs are denominated in foreign currencies. Cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales were
26.2% in 2012, 26.4% in 2011, and 27.1% in 2010.

The decrease in cost of products sold in 2012 was primarily attributed to lower sales volume following the loss of exclusivity of

Plavix*

and

Avapro*

/

Avalide*

which resulted in lower royalties in connection with our Sanofi alliance and favorable foreign exchange partially offset by impairment charges discussed below and higher amortization costs resulting
from the Amylin acquisition (net of the amortization of the Amylin collaboration proceeds).

Impairment charges of $147
million were recognized in 2012, of which $120 million was related to a partial write-down to fair value of developed technology costs related to a non-key product (

Recothrom

) acquired in the acquisition of ZymoGenetics, Inc. (ZymoGenetics).
The developed technology impairment charge resulted from continued competitive pricing pressures and a reduction


in the undiscounted projected cash flows to an amount less than the carrying value of the
intangible asset. The impairment charge was calculated as the difference between the fair value of the asset based on the discounted value of the estimated future cash flows and the carrying value of the intangible asset. The remaining $27 million
impairment charge related to the abandonment of a manufacturing facility resulting from the outsourcing of a manufacturing process.

The increase in 2011 was primarily attributable to higher sales volume resulting in additional royalties, collaboration fees, and profit sharing expense, and unfavorable foreign exchange.

Marketing, selling and administrative

Marketing, selling and administrative expenses consist of salary and benefit costs, third-party professional and marketing fees, outsourcing fees, shipping and handling costs and other expenses that are
not attributed to product manufacturing costs or research and development expenses. These expenses are managed through regional commercialization organizations or global corporate organizations such as finance, law, information technology and human
resources.

•

Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased slightly in 2012 primarily as a result of the Amylin acquisition ($125 million, including
$67 million related to the accelerated vesting of stock options and restricted stock units), partially offset by a reduction in sales-related activities for

Plavix*

and

Avapro*

/

Avalide*.

Marketing, selling and administrative
expenses were also impacted by favorable foreign exchange.

•

The increase in 2011 was attributed to the annual pharmaceutical company fee, unfavorable foreign exchange and higher marketing costs to support new
launches and key products and to a lesser extent, higher bad debt expense in the EU, charitable funding and information technology expenses.

•

The annual pharmaceutical company fee was $246 million in 2012 and $220 million in 2011. For further information regarding the annual pharmaceutical
company fee, refer to “Item 1. Business—Government Regulation and Price Constraints.”

Advertising and
product promotion

Advertising and product promotion expenses consist of related media, sample and direct to consumer programs.

•

The decrease in 2012 was primarily attributed to lower spending on the promotion of

Plavix*

,

Avapro*

/

Avalide*

,

Abilify*

,
and certain mature brands in the U.S. to coincide with their product life cycle.

Research and development

Research and development expenses consist of salary and benefit costs, third-party grants and fees paid to clinical
research organizations, supplies and facility costs. Total research and development expenses include the costs of discovery research, preclinical development, early- and late-clinical development and drug formulation, as well as clinical trials and
medical support of marketed products, proportionate allocations of enterprise-wide costs, facilities, information technology, and employee stock compensation costs, and other appropriate costs. These expenses also include third-party licensing fees
that are typically paid upfront as well as when regulatory or other contractual milestones are met. Certain expenses are shared with alliance partners based upon contractual agreements.

Most expenses are managed by our global research and development organization of which, approximately $1.9 billion of the total spend was
attributed to development activities with the remainder attributed to preclinical and research activities. These expenses can vary between periods for a number of reasons, including the timing of upfront, milestone and other licensing payments.

•

Research and development expenses increased in 2012 primarily from $60 million of expenses related to the Amylin acquisition (including $27 million
related to the accelerated vesting of Amylin stock options and restricted stock units), partially offset by favorable foreign exchange and the net impact of upfront, milestone, and other licensing payments and IPRD impairment charges. Refer to
“Specified Items” included in “—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for amounts attributed to each period. IPRD impairment charges relate to projects previously acquired in the Medarex, Inc. (Medarex) acquisition and Inhibitex
acquisition (including $45 million in 2012 related to FV-100, a nucleoside inhibitor for the reduction of shingles-associated pain) resulting from unfavorable clinical trial results and decisions to cease further development.

•

The increase in 2011 was attributed to higher upfront, milestone and other licensing payments, unfavorable foreign exchange, and additional
development costs resulting from the acquisition of ZymoGenetics. Upfront, milestone and other licensing payments were $207 million in 2011, including an $88 million payment associated with an amendment of an intellectual property license agreement
for

Yervoy

prior to its FDA approval and payments for exclusive licenses to develop and commercialize certain programs and compounds.

Impairment charge for BMS-986094 intangible asset

A $1.8 billion impairment charge was recognized when the development of BMS-986094 (formerly INX-189), a compound which we acquired as part of our acquisition of Inhibitex to treat hepatitis C virus
infection, was discontinued in the interest of patient safety. See “Item 1. Financial Statements —Note 13. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” for further information.


Other (income)/expense

Other (income)/expense include:

•

Interest expense increased due to the termination of interest rate swap contracts in 2011 and higher borrowings in 2012.

•

Investment income included a $10 million gain from the sale of auction rate securities in 2012.

•

Provision for restructuring was primarily attributable to employee termination benefits for continuous improvement initiatives. Additional employee
termination costs of approximately $300 million are expected to be incurred in 2013 as a result of workforce reductions in several European countries. The majority of the costs will not be recognized until the completion of discussions with local
workers council, subject to local regulations. The expected employee reductions are primarily attributed to sales force personnel resulting from restructuring of the Sanofi and Otsuka agreements and streamlining of the operations due to challenging
market conditions in Europe.

•

Litigation charges/(recoveries) in 2012 included $172 million for our share of the Apotex damages award concerning

Plavix*

, partially offset
by increases in reserves for product liability, pricing, sales and promotional matters.

•

Equity in net income of affiliates is primarily related to our international partnership with Sanofi which decreased in 2012 as a result of the
continued impact of generic competition on international

Plavix*

net sales, conversion of certain territories to opt-out markets and the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange.

•

Impairment and loss on sale of manufacturing operations in 2010 was primarily attributed to the disposal of our manufacturing operations in Latina,
Italy.

•

Out-licensed intangible asset impairment charges are related to assets acquired in the Medarex, Inc. (Medarex) and ZymoGenetics acquisitions and
resulted from unfavorable clinical trial results and/or abandonment of the programs. Similar charges of $15 million were included in research and development in 2011.

•

Gain on sale of product lines, businesses and assets was primarily related to the sale of a building in Mexico in 2012 and the sale of mature brands
in 2011 and 2010.

•

Other income from alliance partners includes income earned from the Sanofi partnership and amortization of certain upfront, milestone and other
licensing payments related to other alliances. The decrease in U.S.

Plavix*

net sales resulted in lower development royalties owed to Sanofi in 2012.

•

A pension settlement charge was recognized in 2012 for the primary U.S. pension plan as a result of annual lump sum payments exceeding interest and
service costs during the fourth quarter. The charge included the acceleration of a portion of unrecognized actuarial losses. Similar charges might occur in the future. See “Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 18. Pension, Postretirement and
Postemployment Liabilities” for further detail.

•

The change in Other is primarily related to higher acquisition costs and losses on debt repurchases in 2012 and sales tax reimbursements, gains on
debt repurchases, and higher upfront, milestone and licensing receipts in 2011.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Our non-GAAP financial measures, including
non-GAAP earnings and related EPS information, are adjusted to exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items that due to their significant and/or unusual nature are evaluated on an individual basis. Similar charges or
gains for some of these items have been recognized in prior periods and it is reasonably possible that they could reoccur in future periods. Non-GAAP information is intended to portray the results of our baseline performance which include the
discovery, development, licensing, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sale of pharmaceutical products on a global basis and to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future.
For example, non-GAAP earnings and EPS information is an indication of our baseline performance before items that are considered by us to not be reflective of our ongoing results. In addition, this information is among the primary indicators we use
as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets, and planning and forecasting for future periods. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings
or diluted EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP.


Specified items were as follows:

*

The 2012 specified tax benefit relates to a capital loss deduction. The 2011 specified tax benefit relates to releases of tax reserves that were
specified in prior periods. The 2010 specified tax charge relates to a tax charge from additional U.S. taxable income from earnings of foreign subsidiaries previously considered to be indefinitely reinvested offshore.

The reconciliations from GAAP to Non-GAAP were as follows:


Income Taxes

The $161 million income tax benefit in 2012 was attributable to a $392 million capital loss deduction resulting from the tax insolvency of Inhibitex. The impact of this deduction reduced the effective tax
rate by 16.7 percentage points. In addition to this impact, the effective tax rate in 2012 was substantially lower than 24.7% in 2011 and 25.7% in 2010 resulting primarily from favorable earnings mix between high and low tax jurisdictions. The
change in earnings mix was primarily attributed to lower

Plavix*

sales and a $1,830 million impairment charge for BMS-986094 intangible asset in the U.S and to a lesser extent, an internal transfer of intellectual property. The transfer of
selected intellectual property rights outside the U.S. (for existing and new products) is part of our strategy to place key assets closer to where manufacturing, distribution, and other operational decisions are made. The favorable earnings mix
between high and low tax jurisdictions is expected to continue at least through 2013 (excluding the impact of the impairment charge).

Historically, the effective income tax rate is lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35% due to our decision to indefinitely reinvest the earnings for certain of our manufacturing operations in Ireland
and Puerto Rico. We have favorable tax rates in Ireland and Puerto Rico under grants not scheduled to expire prior to 2023.

The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the Act) was signed into law on January 2, 2013. The provisions of the Act included the
retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit and look through exception for 2012 and 2013. As a result, the 2012 R&D tax credit and look through exception benefit will be recognized in the first quarter of 2013. For a more detailed
discussion of income taxes and changes in the effective tax rates, refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 7. Income Taxes.”

Noncontrolling Interest

Noncontrolling interest is primarily related to our

Plavix*

and

Avapro*

/

Avalide*

partnerships with Sanofi for the
territory covering the Americas. See “Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 3. Alliances and Collaborations.” The decrease in noncontrolling interest in 2012 resulted from the exclusivity loss in the U.S. of

Avapro*

/

Avalide*

in March 2012 and

Plavix*

in May 2012. The increase in noncontrolling interest in 2011 corresponds to increased net sales of

Plavix*

in the U.S. A summary of noncontrolling interest is as follows:

Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our net cash/(debt) position was as follows:

The current net debt position and reduction in working capital during 2012 resulted primarily from net
cash used in connection with the acquisitions of Amylin and Inhibitex. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held in the U.S. were approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2012. Most of the remaining $5.1 billion is held primarily
in low-tax jurisdictions and is attributable to earnings that are expected to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. Cash repatriations are subject to restrictions in certain jurisdictions and may be subject to withholding and additional U.S. income
taxes. We started issuing commercial paper to meet near-term domestic liquidity requirements in preparation for the Amylin acquisition during the third quarter of 2012. The average amount of commercial paper outstanding was $224 million at a
weighted-average interest rate of 0.16% during 2012. The maximum month-end amount of commercial paper outstanding was $700 million with no outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2012. We will likely continue to issue commercial paper to meet
domestic liquidity requirements as needed.


Our investment portfolio includes non-current marketable securities which are subject to
changes in fair value as a result of interest rate fluctuations and other market factors, which may impact our results of operations. Our investment policy places limits on these investments and the amount and time to maturity of investments with
any institution. The policy also requires that investments are only entered into with corporate and financial institutions that meet high credit quality standards. See “Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 9. Financial Instruments.”

We currently have two separate $1.5 billion five-year revolving credit facilities from a syndicate of lenders, including a
new facility entered into in July 2012. The facilities provide for customary terms and conditions with no financial covenants and are extendable on any anniversary date with the consent of the lenders. No borrowings were outstanding under either
revolving credit facility at December 31, 2012 or 2011.

In connection with the 2012 Amylin acquisition, BMS issued $2.0
billion of senior unsecured notes in a registered public offering consisting of $750 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.875% Notes due 2017, $750 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.000% Notes due 2022 and $500 million in aggregate
principal amount of 3.250% Notes due 2042.

BMS completed its acquisition of Amylin for an aggregate purchase price of $5.3
billion in 2012. BMS also assumed Amylin’s net debt and a contractual payment obligation to Lilly, together totaling $2.0 billion (substantially all of which was repaid during 2012). The acquisition was financed through the use of existing cash
balances, the issuance of commercial paper and long-term debt borrowings described above.

Additional regulations in the U.S.
could be passed in the future which could further reduce our results of operations, operating cash flow, liquidity and financial flexibility. We also continue to monitor the potential impact of the economic conditions in certain European countries
and the related impact on prescription trends, pricing discounts, creditworthiness of our customers, and our ability to collect outstanding receivables from our direct customers. Currently, we believe these economic conditions in the EU will not
have a material impact on our liquidity, cash flow or financial flexibility.

As a mechanism to limit our overall credit
exposures, and an additional source of liquidity, we sell trade receivables to third parties, principally from wholesalers in Japan and certain government-backed entities in Italy, Portugal, and Spain. Sales of trade receivables in Italy, Portugal
and Spain were $322 million in 2012, $484 million in 2011 and $476 million in 2010. Sales of receivables in Japan were $634 million in 2012, $593 million in 2011 and $456 million in 2010. Our sales agreements do not allow for recourse in the event
of uncollectibility and we do not retain interest to the underlying assets once sold.

We continue to manage our operating
cash flows with initiatives designed to improve working capital items that are most directly affected by changes in sales volume, such as receivables, inventories, and accounts payable. During 2012, the following changes in receivables, inventories
and accounts payable resulted primarily from the rapid reduction of

Plavix*

sales, the acquisition of Amylin and timing of expenditures in the ordinary course of business.

Credit Ratings

Moody’s Investors Service long-term and short-term credit ratings are currently A2 and Prime-1, respectively, and their long-term credit outlook remains stable. Standard & Poor’s
(S&P) long-term and short-term credit ratings are currently A+ and A-1+, respectively, and their long-term credit outlook remains stable. S&P upgraded our short-term credit rating from A-1 to A-1+ in May 2012. Fitch Ratings (Fitch) long-term
and short-term credit ratings are currently A and F1, respectively, and their long-term credit outlook remains negative. Fitch lowered our long-term credit rating from A+ to A in July 2012. Our credit ratings are considered investment grade. Our
long-term ratings designate that we have a low default risk but are somewhat susceptible to adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions. Our short-term ratings designate that we have the strongest capacity for timely
repayment.


Cash Flows

The following is a discussion of cash flow activities:

Operating Activities

Cash flow from operating activities represents the cash receipts and cash disbursements from all of our activities other than investing activities and financing activities. Operating cash flow is derived
by adjusting net earnings for noncontrolling interest, non-cash operating items, gains and losses attributed to investing and financing activities and changes in operating assets and liabilities resulting from timing differences between the receipts
and payments of cash and when the transactions are recognized in our results of operations. As a result, changes in cash from operating activities reflect the timing of cash collections from customers and alliance partners; payments to suppliers,
alliance partners and employees; pension contributions and tax payments in the ordinary course of business.

The $2.1 billion
increase in operating cash flow in 2012 was primarily attributable to preliminary proceeds of $3.6 billion received from AstraZeneca as consideration for entering into the Amylin collaboration partially offset by lower operating cash flows
attributed to

Plavix*

and

Avapro*

/

Avalide*

sales reductions following the exclusivity loss of these products.

Investing Activities

•

Cash was used to fund the acquisitions of Amylin ($5.0 billion) and Inhibitex ($2.5 billion) in 2012, Amira ($360 million, including a $50 million
contingent payment) in 2011 and ZymoGenetics ($829 million) in 2010.

•

Net sales and maturities of marketable securities of $1.3 billion in 2012 were primarily attributed to the funding of the Amylin acquisition. Net
purchases of marketable securities of $859 million in 2011 and $2.6 billion in 2010 were primarily attributed to the timing of investments in time deposits and corporate debt securities with maturities greater than 90 days.

•

Other investing activities included litigation recoveries of $102 million in 2011.

Financing Activities

•

Dividend payments were $2.3 billion in 2012, $2.3 billion in 2011 and $2.2 billion in 2010. Dividends declared per common share were $1.37 in 2012,
$1.33 in 2011 and $1.29 in 2010. In December 2012, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per common share and expect to pay a dividend for the full year of 2013 of $1.40 per share. Dividend decisions are made on a quarterly basis by our Board of
Directors.

•

Proceeds received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes and repayments of debt assumed in the Amylin acquisition were $2.0 billion each in
2012.

•

Management periodically evaluates potential opportunities to repurchase certain debt securities and terminate certain interest rate swap contracts
prior to their maturity. Cash outflows related to the repurchase of debt were $109 million in 2012, $78 million in 2011 and $855 million in 2010. Proceeds from the termination of interest rate swap contracts were $2 million in 2012, $296 million in
2011 and $146 million in 2010.

•

The Board of Directors increased its authorization for the repurchase of common stock by $3.0 billion in June 2012. The common stock repurchase
capacity remaining was $1.8 billion at December 31, 2012. Cash used to repurchase common stock was $2.4 billion in 2012, $1.2 billion in 2011 and $576 million in 2010.

•

Proceeds from stock option exercises were $463 million (including $71 million of cash retained from excess tax benefits) in 2012, $601 million
(including $47 million of cash retained from excess tax benefits) in 2011 and $252 million in 2010. The amount of proceeds vary each period based upon fluctuations in the market value of our stock relative to the exercise price of the stock options
and other factors.


Contractual Obligations

Payments due by period for our contractual obligations at December 31, 2012 were as follows:

(a)

Includes estimated future interest payments on our short-term and long-term debt securities. Also includes accrued interest payable recognized on
our consolidated balance sheets, which consists primarily of accrued interest on short-term and long-term debt as well as accrued periodic cash settlements of derivatives.

(b)

Due to the uncertainty related to the timing of the reversal of uncertain tax positions, only the short-term uncertain tax benefits have been
provided in the table above. See “Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 7. Income Taxes” for further detail.

(c)

The table above excludes future contributions by us to our pensions, postretirement and postemployment benefit plans. Required contributions are
contingent upon numerous factors including minimum regulatory funding requirements and the funded status of each plan. Due to the uncertainty of such future obligations, they are excluded from the table. Contributions for both U.S. and international
plans are expected to be $100 million in 2013. See “Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 18. Pension, Postretirement and Postemployment Liabilities” for further detail.

In addition to the above, we are committed to $6.0 billion (in the aggregate) of potential future research and development milestone
payments to third parties as part of in-licensing and development programs. Early stage milestones, defined as milestones achieved through Phase III clinical trials, comprised $1.1 billion of the total committed amount. Late stage milestones,
defined as milestones achieved post Phase III clinical trials, comprised $4.9 billion of the total committed amount. Payments under these agreements generally are due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental and regulatory
milestones, for which the specific timing cannot be predicted. In addition to certain royalty obligations that are calculated as a percentage of net sales, some of these agreements also provide for sales-based milestones aggregating $2.1 billion
that we would be obligated to pay to alliance partners upon achievement of certain sales levels. We also have certain manufacturing, development, and commercialization obligations in connection with alliance arrangements. It is not practicable to
estimate the amount of these obligations. See “Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 3. Alliances and Collaborations” for further information regarding our alliances.

For a discussion of contractual obligations, see “Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 18. Pension, Postretirement and
Postemployment Liabilities,” “—Note 9. Financial Instruments” and “—Note 20. Leases.”

SEC Consent Order

As previously disclosed, on August 4, 2004, we entered into a final settlement with the SEC, concluding an
investigation concerning certain wholesaler inventory and accounting matters. The settlement was reached through a Consent, a copy of which was attached as Exhibit 10 to our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2004.

Under the terms of the Consent, we agreed, subject to certain defined exceptions, to limit sales of all products sold to our
direct customers (including wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, retail outlets, pharmacies and government purchasers) based on expected demand or on amounts that do not exceed approximately one month of inventory on hand, without making a timely
public disclosure of any change in practice. We also agreed in the Consent to certain measures that we have implemented including: (a) establishing a formal review and certification process of our annual and quarterly reports filed with the
SEC; (b) establishing a business risk and disclosure group; (c) retaining an outside consultant to comprehensively study and help re-engineer our accounting and financial reporting processes; (d) publicly disclosing any sales
incentives offered to direct customers for the purpose of inducing them to purchase products in excess of expected demand; and (e) ensuring that our budget process gives appropriate weight to inputs that come from the bottom to the top, and not
just from the top to the bottom, and adequately documenting that process.

We have established a company-wide policy to limit
our sales to direct customers for the purpose of complying with the Consent. This policy includes the adoption of various procedures to monitor and limit sales to direct customers in accordance with the terms of the Consent. These procedures include
a governance process to escalate to appropriate management levels potential questions or concerns regarding compliance with the policy and timely resolution of such questions or concerns. In addition, compliance with the policy is monitored on a
regular basis.


We maintain inventory management agreements (IMAs) with our U.S. pharmaceutical wholesalers,
which account for nearly 100% of our gross U.S. sales. Under the current terms of the IMAs, our wholesaler customers provide us with weekly information with respect to months on hand product-level inventories and the amount of out-movement of
products. The three largest wholesalers currently account for approximately 90% of our gross U.S. sales. The inventory information received from our wholesalers, together with our internal information, is used to estimate months on hand product
level inventories at these wholesalers. We estimate months on hand product inventory levels for our U.S. business’s wholesaler customers other than the three largest wholesalers by extrapolating from the months on hand calculated for the three
largest wholesalers. In contrast, our non-U.S. business has significantly more direct customers, limited information on direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand
information, where available, varies widely. Accordingly, we rely on a variety of methods to estimate months on hand product level inventories for these business units.

We believe the above-described procedures provide a reasonable basis to ensure compliance with the Consent.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

None applicable.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our
critical accounting policies are those that significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of
matters that are inherently uncertain. Because of this uncertainty, actual results may vary from these estimates. These accounting policies were discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

Revenue Recognition

Our accounting policy for revenue recognition has a substantial impact on reported results and relies on certain estimates. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the
sales price is fixed and determinable, collectability is reasonably assured and title and substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred, which is generally at time of shipment. Revenue is also reduced for gross-to-net
sales adjustments discussed below, all of which involve significant estimates and judgment after considering legal interpretations of applicable laws and regulations, historical experience, payer channel mix (e.g. Medicare or Medicaid), current
contract prices under applicable programs, unbilled claims and processing time lags and inventory levels in the distribution channel. Estimates are assessed each period and adjusted as required to revised information or actual experience. In
addition, See “—Net Sales” above for further discussion and analysis of each significant category of gross-to-net sales adjustments.

Gross-to-Net Sales Adjustments

The following categories of
gross-to-net sales adjustments involve significant estimates, judgments and information obtained from external sources. See “—Net Sales” above for further discussion and analysis of each significant category of gross-to-net sales
adjustments.

Charge-backs related to government programs

Our U.S. business participates in programs with government entities, the most significant of which are the U.S. Department of Defense and
the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and other parties, including covered entities under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, whereby pricing on products is extended below wholesaler list price to participating entities. These entities purchase
products through wholesalers at the lower program price and the wholesalers then charge us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower program price. Accounts receivable is reduced for the estimated amount of un-processed charge-back
claims attributable to a sale (typically within a two to four week time lag).

Cash discounts

In the U.S. and certain other countries, cash discounts are offered as an incentive for prompt payment, generally approximating 2% of the
sales price. Accounts receivable is reduced for the estimated amount of un-processed cash discounts (typically within a 1 month time lag).


Managed healthcare rebates and other contract discounts

Rebates and discounts are offered to managed healthcare organizations in the U.S. managing prescription drug programs and Medicare
Advantage prescription drug plans covering the Medicare Part D drug benefit in addition to their commercial plans, as well as other contract counterparties such as hospitals and group purchasing organizations globally. Beginning in 2011, the rebates
for the Medicare Part D program included a 50% discount on the Company’s brand-name drugs to patients who fall within the Medicare Part D coverage gap. Rebates are also required under the U.S. Department of Defense TRICARE Retail Pharmacy
Refund Program. The estimated amount for these unpaid or unbilled rebates and discounts are presented as a liability. A $67 million reversal for the estimated amount of 2011 Medicare Part D coverage gap discounts occurred in 2012 after receipt of
the actual invoices.

Medicaid rebates

Our U.S. businesses participates in state government Medicaid programs and other qualifying Federal and state government programs requiring discounts and rebates to participating state and local
government entities. All discounts and rebates provided through these programs are included in our Medicaid rebate accrual. Retroactive to January 1, 2010, minimum rebates on Medicaid drug sales increased from 15.1% to 23.1%. Medicaid rebates
have also been extended to drugs used in managed Medicaid plans beginning in March 2010. The estimated amount for these unpaid or unbilled rebates is presented as a liability. A $37 million reversal for the estimated amount of 2010 and 2011 Managed
Medicaid discounts occurred in 2012 after receipt of the actual invoices.

Sales returns

Products are typically eligible to be returned between six months prior to and twelve months after product expiration, in accordance with
our policy. Estimated returns for established products are determined after considering historical experience and other factors including levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, product recalls, product
discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, introductions of generic products, introductions of competitive new products and instances of expected precipitous declines in demand following the loss of exclusivity. The estimated amount for
product returns is presented as a liability. Reserves of $173 million were established for

Plavix

* and

Avapro*

/

Avalide*

at December 31, 2012 after considering the relevant factors as well as estimated future retail and wholesale
inventory work down that would occur after the loss of exclusivity.

Estimated returns for new products are determined after
considering historical sales return experience of similar products, such as those within the same product line or similar therapeutic category. We defer recognition of revenue until the right of return expires or until sufficient historical
experience to estimate sales returns is developed in limited circumstances. This typically occurs when the new product is not an extension of an existing line of product or when historical experience with products in a similar therapeutic category
is lacking. Estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel and projected demand are also considered in estimating sales returns for new products. Although not reflected as a gross to net adjustment, $27 million of revenue related to

Yervoy

was deferred in 2011 as a result of limited returns experience.

Use of information from external sources

Information from external sources is used to estimate gross-to-net sales adjustments. Our estimate of inventory at the
wholesalers are based on the projected prescription demand-based sales for our products and historical inventory experience, as well as our analysis of third-party information, including written and oral information obtained from certain wholesalers
with respect to their inventory levels and sell-through to customers and third-party market research data, and our internal information. The inventory information received from wholesalers is a product of their recordkeeping process and excludes
inventory held by intermediaries to whom they sell, such as retailers and hospitals.

We have also continued the practice of
combining retail and mail prescription volume on a retail-equivalent basis. We use this methodology for internal demand forecasts. We also use information from external sources to identify prescription trends, patient demand and average selling
prices. Our estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that rely on third-party information, as certain third-party information was itself in the form of estimates, and reflect other limitations including lags between the date as of
which third-party information is generated and the date on which we receive third-party information.

Retirement Benefits

Accounting for pension and postretirement benefit plans requires actuarial valuations based on significant assumptions
for discount rates and expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. In consultation with our actuaries, these significant assumptions and others such as salary growth, retirement, turnover, healthcare trends and mortality rates are evaluated
and selected based on expectations or actual experience during each remeasurement date. Pension expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings, projected benefit obligations and future cash funding.
Actual results in any given year may differ from those estimated because of economic and other factors.


The yield on high quality corporate bonds that coincides with the cash flows of the
plans’ estimated payouts is used in determining the discount rate. The Citigroup Pension Discount curve is used for the U.S. plans. The U.S. plans’ pension expense for 2012 was determined using a 4.25% weighted-average discount rate. The
present value of benefit obligations at December 31, 2012 for the U.S. pension plans was determined using a 3.74% discount rate. If the discount rate used in determining the U.S. plans’ pension expense for 2012 was reduced by an additional
1%, such expense would increase by approximately $12 million. If the assumed discount rate used in determining the U.S. pension plans’ projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2012 was reduced by an additional 1%, the projected benefit
obligation would increase by approximately $1.2 billion.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is estimated
considering expected returns for individual asset classes with input from external advisors. We also consider long-term historical returns including actual performance compared to benchmarks for similar investments. The U.S. plans’ pension
expense for 2012 was determined using an 8.75% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. If the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining the U.S. plans’ pension expense for 2012 was reduced by 1%, such
expense would increase by $47 million.

For a more detailed discussion on retirement benefits, see “Item 8. Financial
Statements—Note 18. Pension, Postretirement and Postemployment Liabilities.”

Business Combinations

Goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in business combinations, licensing and other transactions were $16.4 billion at
December 31, 2012, representing 46% of total assets.

Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at the date
of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. The fair value of intangible assets, including IPRD, is typically determined using
the “income method.” This method starts with a forecast of net cash flows, risk adjusted for estimated probabilities of technical and regulatory success (for IPRD) and adjusted to present value using an appropriate discount rate that
reflects the risk associated with the cash flow streams. All assets are valued from a market participant view which might be different than specific BMS views. The valuation process is very complex and requires significant input and judgment using
internal and external sources. Although the valuations are required to be finalized within a one-year period, it must consider all and only those facts and evidence available at the acquisition date. The most complex and judgmental matters
applicable to the valuation process are summarized below:

•

Unit of account –

Most intangible assets are valued as single global assets rather than multiple assets for each jurisdiction or
indication after considering the development stage, expected levels of incremental costs to obtain additional approvals, risks associated with further development, amount and timing of benefits expected to be derived in the future, expected patent
lives in various jurisdictions and the intention to promote the asset as a global brand.

•

Estimated useful life

– The asset life expected to contribute meaningful cash flows is determined after considering all pertinent
matters associated with the asset, including expected regulatory approval dates (if unapproved), exclusivity periods and other legal, regulatory or contractual provisions as well as the effects of any obsolescence, demand, competition, and other
economic factors, including barriers to entry.

•

Probability of Technical and Regulatory Success (PTRS) Rate –

PTRS rates are determined based upon industry averages considering the
respective programs development stage and disease indication and adjusted for specific information or data known at the acquisition date. Subsequent clinical results or other internal or external data obtained could alter the PTRS rate and
materially impact the estimated fair value of the intangible asset in subsequent periods leading to impairment charges.

•

Projections –

Future revenues are estimated after considering many factors such as initial market opportunity, pricing, sales
trajectories to peak sales levels, competitive environment and product evolution. Future costs and expenses are estimated after considering historical market trends, market participant synergies and the timing and level of additional development
costs to obtain the initial or additional regulatory approvals, maintain or further enhance the product. We generally assume initial positive cash flows to commence shortly after the receipt of expected regulatory approvals which typically may not
occur for a number of years. Actual cash flows attributed to the project are likely to be different than those assumed since projections are subjected to multiple factors including trial results and regulatory matters which could materially change
the ultimate commercial success of the asset as well as significantly alter the costs to develop the respective asset into commercially viable products.

•

Tax rates

– The expected future income is tax effected using a market participant tax rate. Our recent valuations typically use a U.S.
tax rate (and applicable state taxes) after considering the jurisdiction in which the intellectual property is held and location of research and manufacturing infrastructure. We also considered that any earnings repatriation would likely have U.S.
tax consequences.

•

Discount rate –

Discount rates are selected after considering the risks inherent in the future cash flows; the assessment of the
asset’s life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory, or economic barriers to entry, as well as expected changes in standards of practice for indications addressed by the
asset.


See “Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 4. Acquisitions” for specific
details and values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions of Amylin and Inhibitex in 2012, Amira in 2011 and ZymoGenetics in 2010. Significant estimates utilized at the time of the valuations to support the fair
values of the lead compounds within the acquisitions include:

Impairment

Goodwill

Goodwill was $7.6 billion at December 31, 2012.
Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment on an enterprise level by assessing qualitative factors or performing a quantitative analysis in determining whether it is more likely than not that its fair value exceeds the carrying value.
Examples of qualitative factors assessed in the current year included our share price, our financial performance compared to budgets, long-term financial plans, macroeconomic, industry and market conditions as well as the substantial excess of fair
value over the carrying value of net assets from the annual impairment test performed in the prior year. Positive and negative influences of each relevant factor were assessed both individually and in the aggregate and as a result it was concluded
that no additional quantitative testing was required.

For discussion on goodwill, acquired in-process research and
development and other intangible assets, see “Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 1. Accounting Policies—Goodwill, Acquired In-Process Research and Development and Other Intangible Assets.”

Other Intangible Assets, including IPRD

Other intangible assets were $8.8 billion at December 31, 2012, including licenses ($626 million), developed technology rights ($7.2 billion), capitalized software ($261 million) and IPRD ($668
million). Intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever current facts or circumstances warrant a review, although IPRD is required to be tested at least annually. Intangible assets are highly vulnerable to impairment charges, particularly
newly acquired assets for recently launched products or IPRD. These assets are initially measured at fair value and therefore any reduction in expectations used in the valuations could potentially lead to impairment. Some of the more common
potential risks leading to impairment include competition, earlier than expected loss of exclusivity, pricing pressures, adverse regulatory changes or clinical trial results, delay or failure to obtain regulatory approval and additional development
costs, inability to achieve expected synergies, higher operating costs, changes in tax laws and other macro-economic changes. The complexity in estimating the fair value of intangible assets in connection with an impairment test is similar to the
initial valuation.

Considering the high risk nature of research and development and the industry’s success rate of
bringing developmental compounds to market, IPRD impairment charges are likely to occur in future periods. We recognized charges of $2.1 billion in 2012 including a $1.8 billion charge resulting from the discontinued development of BMS-986094 and
for other projects previously acquired in the Medarex, Inc and Inhibitex acquisition resulting from unfavorable clinical trial results, additional development costs, extended development periods and decisions to cease further development. We also
recognized charges of $30 million in 2011 and $10 million in 2010 related to three Medarex projects for which development has ceased. IPRD is closely monitored and assessed each period for impairment.

In addition to IPRD, commercial assets are also subject to impairment. For example, an impairment charge of $120 million was recognized
in 2012 related to a non-key product (

Recothrom

) acquired in the acquisition of ZymoGenetics after continuing competitive pricing pressures. The preliminary estimated fair value of developed technology rights resulting from the acquisition of
Amylin was $6.3 billion, including $5.3 billion allocated to a recently-launched single asset,

Bydureon*

. These assets are monitored for changes in expectations from those used in the initial valuation, including revenue trends and operating
synergies.


Contingencies

In the normal course of business, we are subject to contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, that cover a wide range of matters, including, among others, government
investigations, shareholder lawsuits, product and environmental liability, contractual claims and tax matters. We recognize accruals for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be
reasonably estimated. These estimates are subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, as such, actual results could vary from these estimates.

For discussions on contingencies, see “Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 1. Accounting Policies—Contingencies,” “—Note 7. Income Taxes” and “—Note 21. Legal
Proceedings and Contingencies.”

Income Taxes

Valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is
required often requires significant judgment including long-range forecasts of future taxable income and evaluation of tax planning initiatives. Adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowances are made to earnings in the period when such
assessments are made. Our deferred tax assets were $5.1 billion, net of valuation allowances of $4.4 billion at December 31, 2012 and $3.2 billion, net of valuation allowances of $3.9 billion at December 31, 2011.

Deferred tax assets related to a U.S. Federal net operating loss carryforward of $170 million and a U.S. Federal tax credit carryforward
of $31 million were recognized at December 31, 2012. The net operating loss carryforward expires in varying amounts beginning in 2022. The U.S. Federal tax credit carryforward expires in varying amounts beginning in 2017. The realization of
these carryforwards is dependent on generating sufficient domestic-sourced taxable income prior to their expiration. Although realization is not assured, we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized.

In addition, a deferred tax asset related to a U.S. Federal and state capital loss of $794 million was recognized at
December 31, 2012 that can be carried back three years and carried forward five years. The realization of this carryforward is dependent upon generating sufficient capital gains prior to its expiration. A $411 million valuation allowance was
established for this item at December 31, 2012.

Taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries
expected to be reinvested indefinitely offshore. During 2010, the Company completed an internal reorganization of certain legal entities which contributed to a $207 million tax charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010. It is possible that
U.S. tax authorities could assert additional material tax liabilities arising from the reorganization. If such assertion were to occur, the Company would vigorously challenge any such assertion and believes it would prevail; however there can be no
assurance of such a result.

Prior to the Mead Johnson Nutrition Company (Mead Johnson) split-off in 2009, the following
transactions occurred: (i) an internal spin-off of Mead Johnson shares while still owned by us; (ii) conversion of Mead Johnson Class B shares to Class A shares; and; (iii) conversion of Mead Johnson & Company to a
limited liability company. These transactions as well as the split-off of Mead Johnson through the exchange offer should qualify as tax-exempt transactions under the Internal Revenue Code based upon a private letter ruling received from the Internal
Revenue Service related to the conversion of Mead Johnson Class B shares to Class A shares, and outside legal opinions. Certain assumptions, representations and covenants by Mead Johnson were relied upon regarding the future conduct of its
business and other matters which could affect the tax treatment of the exchange. For example, the current tax law generally creates a presumption that the exchange would be taxable to us, if Mead Johnson or its shareholders were to engage in
transactions that result in a 50% or greater change in its stock ownership during a four year period beginning two years before the exchange offer, unless it is established that the exchange offer were not part of a plan or series of related
transactions to effect such a change in ownership. If the internal spin-off or exchange offer were determined not to qualify as a tax exempt transaction, the transaction could be subject to tax as if the exchange was a taxable sale by us at market
value.

In addition, a negative basis or excess loss account (ELA) existed in our investment in stock of Mead Johnson prior to
these transactions. We received an opinion from outside legal counsel to the effect that it is more likely than not that we eliminated the ELA as part of these transactions and do not have taxable income with respect to the ELA. The tax law in this
area is complex and it is possible that even if the internal spin-off and the exchange offer is tax exempt under the Internal Revenue Code, the IRS could assert that we have additional taxable income for the period with respect to the ELA. We could
be exposed to additional taxes if this were to occur. Based upon our understanding of the Internal Revenue Code and opinion from outside legal counsel, a tax reserve of $244 million was established reducing the gain on disposal of Mead Johnson
included in discontinued operations in 2009.

We agreed to certain tax related indemnities with Mead Johnson as set forth in
the tax sharing agreement. For example, Mead Johnson has agreed to indemnify us for potential tax effects resulting from the breach of certain representations discussed above as well as certain transactions related to the acquisition of Mead
Johnson’s stock or assets. We have agreed to indemnify Mead Johnson for certain taxes related to its business prior to the completion of the IPO and created as part of the restructuring to facilitate the IPO.


We established liabilities for possible assessments by tax authorities resulting from known
tax exposures including, but not limited to, transfer pricing matters, tax credits and deductibility of certain expenses. Such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid and may need to be adjusted over
time as more information becomes known.

For discussions on income taxes, see “Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 1.
Accounting Policies—Income Taxes” and “—Note 7. Income Taxes.”

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This annual report on Form 10-K (including documents incorporated by reference) and other written and oral statements we
make from time to time contain certain “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify these forward-looking
statements by the fact they use words such as “should”, “expect”, “anticipate”, “estimate”, “target”, “may”, “project”, “guidance”, “intend”, “plan”,
“believe” and other words and terms of similar meaning and expression in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. One can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate
strictly to historical or current facts. Such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including factors that could delay, divert or change any of them, and could cause actual
outcomes to differ materially from current expectations. These statements are likely to relate to, among other things, our goals, plans and projections regarding our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, market position, product
development, product approvals, sales efforts, expenses, performance or results of current and anticipated products and the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results, which are based on current expectations that
involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including internal or external factors that could delay, divert or change any of them in the next several years. We have included important factors in the cautionary statements included in this Annual Report
on Form 10-K, particularly under “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” that we believe could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement.

Although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions, no assurance can be given that any goal or plan set forth in forward-looking statements can be achieved and readers are cautioned not
to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date made. We undertake no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.


Item 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

We are exposed to market risk resulting from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. Certain derivative financial instruments are used when available on a cost-effective basis to hedge our
underlying economic exposure. All of our financial instruments, including derivatives, are subject to counterparty credit risk considered as part of the overall fair value measurement. Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading
purposes.

Foreign Exchange Risk

Significant amounts of our revenues, earnings and cash flow is exposed to changes in foreign currency rates. Our primary net foreign currency translation exposures are the euro, Japanese yen, Chinese
renminbi, Canadian dollar and British pound. Foreign currency forward contracts are used to manage foreign exchange risk that primarily arises from certain intercompany purchase transactions and are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges
when appropriate. In addition, we are exposed to foreign exchange transaction risk that arises from non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities and earnings denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies. Foreign currency forward contracts
are used to offset a portion of these exposures and are not designated as hedges. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in earnings as incurred.

We estimate that a 10% appreciation in the underlying currencies being hedged from their levels against the U.S. dollar (with all other variables held constant) would decrease the fair value of foreign
exchange forward contracts by $162 million at December 31, 2012. If realized, this appreciation would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts.

We are also exposed to translation risk on non-U.S. dollar-denominated net assets. Non-U.S. dollar borrowings are used to hedge the foreign currency exposures of our net investment in certain foreign
affiliates and are designated as hedges of net investments. The effective portion of foreign exchange gains or losses on these hedges is recognized as part of the foreign currency translation component of accumulated OCI. If our net investment were
to fall below the equivalent value of the non-U.S. debt borrowings, the change in the remeasurement basis of the debt would be subject to recognition in income as changes occur. For additional information, see “Item 8. Financial
Statements—Note 9. Financial Instruments.”

Interest Rate Risk

Fixed-to-floating interest rate swap contracts are used and designated as fair-value hedges as part of our interest rate risk management
strategy. These contracts are intended to provide us with an appropriate balance of fixed and floating rate debt. We estimate that an increase of 100 basis points in short-term or long-term interest rates would decrease the fair value of our
interest rate swap contracts by $66 million, excluding the effects of our counterparty and our own credit risk. If realized, the fair value reduction would affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts.

We estimate that an increase of 100 basis points in long-term interest rates would decrease the fair value of long-term debt by $621
million. Our marketable securities are subject to changes in fair value as a result of interest rate fluctuations and other market factors. Our policy is to invest only in institutions that meet high credit quality standards. We estimate that an
increase of 100 basis points in interest rates in general would decrease the fair value of our debt security portfolio by approximately $95 million.

Credit Risk

Although not material, certain European government-backed
entities with a higher risk of default were identified by monitoring economic factors including credit ratings, credit-default swap rates and debt-to-gross domestic product ratios in addition to entity specific factors. Historically, our exposure
was limited by factoring receivables and deferring revenues until the collection of cash. However, during 2012, counterparties in our factoring arrangements suspended factoring of receivables from Spanish and Portuguese government-backed entities
and limited factoring of receivables from certain Italian government-backed entities. Our credit exposures in Europe may increase in the future due to further reductions in our factoring arrangements and the ongoing sovereign debt crisis. Our credit
exposure to government-backed trade receivables in Greece, Portugal, Italy and Spain were approximately $252 million at December 31, 2012, of which approximately 75% is from government-backed entities.

We monitor our investments with counterparties with the objective of minimizing concentrations of credit risk. Our investment policy
places limits on the amount and time to maturity of investments with any individual counterparty. The policy also requires that investments are made primarily with highly rated corporate, financial, U.S. government and government supported
institutions.

The use of derivative instruments exposes us to credit risk. When the fair value of a derivative instrument
contract is positive, we are exposed to credit risk if the counterparty fails to perform. When the fair value of a derivative instrument contract is negative, the counterparty is exposed to credit risk if we fail to perform our obligation. Under the
terms of the agreements, posting of collateral is not required by any party whether derivatives are in an asset or liability position. We have a policy of diversifying derivatives with counterparties to mitigate the overall risk of counterparty
defaults. For additional information, see “Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 9. Financial Instruments.”

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS

Dollars in Millions

The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.


Note 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), including the accounts of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (which
may be referred to as Bristol-Myers Squibb, BMS, or the Company) and all of its controlled majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. Material subsequent events are evaluated and disclosed through the
report issuance date.

Codevelopment, cocommercialization and license arrangements are assessed to determine whether the terms
provide economic or other control over the entity requiring consolidation of an entity. Entities controlled by means other than a majority voting interest are referred to as variable interest entities. There were no arrangements with material
variable interest entities during any of the periods presented.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements requires the use of management estimates and assumptions. The most significant assumptions are
employed in estimates used in determining the fair value and potential impairment of intangible assets; sales rebate and return accruals; legal contingencies; income taxes; and pension and postretirement benefits. Actual results may differ from
estimated results.

Reclassifications

Certain prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The presentation of depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of cash flows includes the
depreciation of property, plant and equipment, the amortization of intangible assets and deferred income. The provision for restructuring, equity in net income of affiliates, and litigation expense, net, previously presented separately on the
consolidated statements of earnings are currently presented as components of other (income)/expense.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sales price is fixed and determinable, collectability is
reasonably assured and title and substantially all risks and rewards of ownership is transferred, generally at time of shipment. However, certain sales of non-U.S. businesses are recognized on the date of receipt by the purchaser. See
“—Note 3. Alliances and Collaborations” for further discussion of revenue recognition related to alliances. Provisions are made at the time of revenue recognition for expected sales returns, discounts, rebates and estimated sales
allowances based on historical experience updated for changes in facts and circumstances including the impact of applicable healthcare legislation. Such provisions are recognized as a reduction of revenue.

Revenue is deferred until the right of return no longer exists or sufficient historical experience to estimate sales returns is developed
when a new product is not an extension of an existing line of product or there is no historical experience with products in a similar therapeutic category.

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes includes income taxes paid or
payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes
are enacted. Valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant
judgment including the long-range forecast of future taxable income and the evaluation of tax planning initiatives. Adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowances are made to earnings in the period when such assessments are made.

We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on
examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized in the financial statements for a particular tax position is based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized
upon settlement.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include U.S. Treasury securities, government agency securities, bank deposits, time deposits and money market funds. Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with
original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase and are recognized at cost, which approximates fair value.


Marketable Securities and Investments in Other Companies

Marketable securities are classified as “available-for-sale” on the date of purchase and reported at fair value. Fair value is
determined based on observable market quotes or valuation models using assessments of counterparty credit worthiness, credit default risk or underlying security and overall capital market liquidity.

Investments in 50% or less owned companies are accounted for using the equity method of accounting when the ability to exercise
significant influence is maintained. The share of net income or losses of equity investments is included in equity in net income of affiliates in other (income)/expense. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment by assessing if the decline in
market value of the investment below the carrying value is other than temporary, which considers the intent and ability to retain the investment, the length of time and extent that the market value has been less than cost, and the financial
condition of the investee.

Inventory Valuation

Inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market.

Property, Plant and Equipment
and Depreciation

Expenditures for additions, renewals and improvements are capitalized at cost. Depreciation is computed
on a straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the related assets. The estimated useful lives of depreciable assets range from 20 to 50 years for buildings and 3 to 20 years for machinery, equipment, and fixtures.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Current facts or circumstances are periodically evaluated to determine if the carrying value of depreciable assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. If such circumstances exist, an estimate of
undiscounted future cash flows generated by the long-lived asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists at its lowest level of identifiable cash flows. If an asset is
determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset’s fair value and its carrying value. An estimate of the asset’s fair value is based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If
quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques using Level 3 fair value inputs, including a discounted value of estimated future cash flows. Long-lived assets held for sale are reported at
the lower of its carrying value or its estimated net realizable value.

Capitalized Software

Eligible costs to obtain internal use software for significant systems projects are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful
life of the software. Insignificant costs to obtain software for projects are expensed as incurred.

Business Combinations

Businesses acquired are consolidated upon obtaining control of the acquiree. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are
recognized at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. Legal, audit, business valuation, and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when
incurred.

Goodwill, Acquired In-Process Research and Development and Other Intangible Assets

The fair value of intangible assets is typically determined using the “income method” which utilizes Level 3 fair value inputs.
The market participant valuations assume a global view considering all potential jurisdictions and indications based on discounted after-tax cash flow projections, risk adjusted for estimated probability of technical and regulatory success (for
IPRD).

Finite-lived intangible assets, including licenses, developed technology rights and IPRD projects that reach
commercialization are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. Estimated useful lives are determined considering the period in which the assets are expected to contribute to future cash flows.

Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment by assessing qualitative factors or performing a quantitative analysis in determining
whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of net assets are below their carrying amounts. Examples of qualitative factors assessed in 2012 include our share price, our financial performance compared to budgets, long-term financial
plans, macroeconomic, industry and market conditions as well as the substantial excess of fair value over the carrying value of net assets from the annual impairment test performed in the prior year. Each relevant factor is assessed both
individually and in the aggregate.

IPRD is tested for impairment on an annual basis and more frequently if events occur or
circumstances change that would indicate a potential reduction in the fair values of the assets below their carrying value. If the carrying value of IPRD is determined to exceed the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference.


Finite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest
that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying value exceeds the projected undiscounted pre-tax cash flows of the intangible asset, an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair
value (discounted after-tax cash flows) is recognized.

Restructuring

Restructuring charges are recognized as a result of actions to streamline operations and rationalize manufacturing facilities. Judgment is
used when estimating the impact of restructuring plans, including future termination benefits and other exit costs to be incurred when the actions take place. Actual results could vary from these estimates.

Contingencies

Loss
contingencies from legal proceedings and claims may occur from a wide range of matters, including, government investigations, shareholder lawsuits, product and environmental liability, contractual claims and tax matters. Accruals are recognized when
it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Gain contingencies are not recognized until realized. Legal fees are expensed as incurred.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Derivatives are used principally in the
management of interest rate and foreign currency exposures and are not held or used for trading purposes.

Derivatives are
recognized at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, changes in fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to
the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) and subsequently
recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. Cash flows are classified consistent with the underlying hedged item.

Derivatives are designated and assigned as hedges of forecasted transactions, specific assets or specific liabilities. When hedged assets or liabilities are sold or extinguished or the forecasted
transactions being hedged are no longer probable to occur, a gain or loss is immediately recognized in earnings.

Non-derivative instruments, primarily euro denominated long-term debt, are also designated as hedges of net investments in foreign
affiliates. The effective portion of the designated non-derivative instrument is recognized in the foreign currency translation section of OCI and the ineffective portion is recognized in earnings.

Shipping and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs are included in marketing, selling and administrative expenses and were $125 million in 2012, $139 million in 2011 and $135 million in 2010.

Advertising and Product Promotion Costs

Advertising and product promotion costs are expensed as incurred.

Foreign Currency
Translation

Foreign subsidiary earnings are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates. The net assets of
foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates are recognized in OCI.

Research and Development

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical study costs are accrued over the service periods specified in the
contracts and adjusted as necessary based upon an ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred. Strategic alliances with third parties provide rights to develop, manufacture, market and/or sell pharmaceutical products, the
rights to which are owned by the other party. Certain research and development payments to alliance partners are contingent upon the achievement of certain pre-determined criteria. Milestone payments achieved prior to regulatory approval of the
product are expensed as research and development. Milestone payments made in connection with regulatory approvals are capitalized and amortized to cost of products sold over the remaining useful life of the asset. Capitalized milestone payments are
tested for recoverability periodically or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Research and development is recognized net of reimbursements in connection with collaboration
agreements.


Upfront, pre-approval milestone and other licensing receipts obtained during development are
deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the product in other income. If the Company has no future obligation for development, upfront milestone and other licensing receipts are recognized immediately in other income. The amortization
period of upfront, licensing and milestone receipts is assessed and determined after considering terms of the arrangements.

Note 2. BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

BMS operates in a single segment engaged in the discovery, development, licensing, manufacturing, marketing,
distribution and sale of innovative medicines that help patients prevail over serious diseases. A global research and development organization and supply chain organization are utilized and responsible for the development and delivery of products to
the market. Regional commercial organizations are used to distribute and sell the product. The business is also supported by global corporate staff functions. Segment information is consistent with the financial information regularly reviewed by the
chief operating decision maker, the chief executive officer, for purposes of evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets, and planning and forecasting future periods.

Products are sold principally to wholesalers, and to a lesser extent, directly to distributors, retailers, hospitals, clinics, government
agencies and pharmacies. Gross sales to the three largest pharmaceutical wholesalers in the U.S. as a percentage of global gross sales were as follows:

Note 3. ALLIANCES AND COLLABORATIONS

Alliances and collaborations are utilized with third parties for the development and commercialization of certain
products. These collaborations can include arrangements for access to intellectual property, research, development, manufacturing and/or commercial capabilities. The arrangements are often entered into in order to share risks and rewards related to
a specific program or product or as part of a specific divestiture strategy. Unless otherwise noted, operating results associated with the alliances and collaborations are generally treated as follows: product revenues from BMS sales are included in
net sales; royalties, collaboration, profit sharing and distribution fees are included in cost of goods sold; post-approval milestone payments to partners are deferred and amortized over the useful life of the related products in cost of products
sold; cost sharing reimbursements offset the applicable operating expense; payments to BMS attributed to upfront, pre-approval based milestone and other licensing payments are deferred and amortized over the estimated useful life of the related
products in other income/expense or as a reduction to cost of products sold for the Amylin diabetes collaboration; income and expenses attributed to a collaboration’s non-core activities, such as supply and manufacturing arrangements and
compensation for opting-out of commercialization in certain countries, are included in other income/expense; partnerships and joint ventures are either consolidated or accounted for under the equity method of accounting and related cash receipts and
distributions are treated as operating cash flow.

Sanofi

BMS has agreements with Sanofi for the codevelopment and cocommercialization of

Avapro*

/

Avalide*

, an angiotensin II receptor
antagonist indicated for the treatment of hypertension and diabetic nephropathy, and

Plavix*

, a platelet aggregation inhibitor. The worldwide alliance operates under the framework of two geographic territories; one in the Americas
(principally the U.S., Canada, Puerto Rico and Latin American countries) and Australia and the other in Europe and Asia. Accordingly, territory partnerships were formed to manage central expenses, such as marketing, research and development and
royalties, and to supply finished product to the individual countries. In general, at the country level, agreements either to copromote (whereby a partnership was formed between the parties to sell each brand) or to comarket (whereby the parties
operate and sell their brands independently of each other) are in place.

BMS acts as the operating partner and owns a 50.1%
majority controlling interest in the territory covering the Americas and Australia and consolidates all country partnership results for this territory with Sanofi’s 49.9% share of the results reflected as a noncontrolling interest. BMS
recognizes net sales in this territory and in comarketing countries outside this territory (e.g. Germany, Italy for irbesartan only, Spain and Greece). Royalties owed to Sanofi are included in cost of products sold (other than development
royalties). Sanofi acts as the operating partner and owns a 50.1% majority controlling interest in the territory covering Europe and Asia. BMS has a 49.9% ownership interest in this territory which is included in equity in net income of affiliates.
Distributions of profits relating to the partnerships are included in operating activities.

BMS and Sanofi have a separate
partnership governing the copromotion of irbesartan in the U.S. Sanofi paid BMS $350 million for their acquisition of an interest in the irbesartan license for the U.S. upon formation of the alliance.

Summarized financial information related to this alliance is as follows:


The following is summarized financial information for interests in the partnerships with
Sanofi for the territory covering Europe and Asia, which are not consolidated but are accounted for using the equity method:

Cost of products sold includes discovery royalties of $133 million in 2012, $184 million in 2011 and $307
million in 2010, which are paid directly to Sanofi. All other expenses are shared based on the applicable ownership percentages. Current assets and current liabilities include approximately $293 million in 2012, $400 million in 2011 and $567 million
in 2010 related to receivables/payables attributed to cash distributions to BMS and Sanofi as well as intercompany balances between partnerships within the territory. The remaining current assets and current liabilities consist of third-party trade
receivables, inventories and amounts due to BMS and Sanofi for the purchase of inventories, royalties and expense reimbursements.

In September 2012, BMS and Sanofi restructured the terms of the codevelopment and cocommercialization agreements discussed above. Effective as of January 1, 2013, subject to the receipt of regulatory
approvals in certain countries, Sanofi will assume the worldwide operations of the alliance with the exception of

Plavix*

for the U.S. and Puerto Rico. The alliance for

Plavix*

in these two markets will continue unchanged through
December 2019 under the same terms as in the original alliance arrangements. In exchange for the rights being assumed by Sanofi, BMS will receive quarterly royalties from January 1, 2013 until December 31, 2018 and a terminal payment from
Sanofi of $200 million at the end of 2018. All ongoing disputes between the companies have been resolved, including a one-time payment of $80 million by BMS to Sanofi related to the

Avalide*

supply disruption in the U.S. in 2011 (accrued for
in 2011).

Otsuka

BMS has a worldwide commercialization agreement with Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Otsuka), to codevelop and copromote

Abilify*

, for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar mania disorder and
major depressive disorder, excluding certain Asian countries. The U.S. portion of the amended commercialization and manufacturing agreement expires upon the expected loss of product exclusivity in April 2015. The contractual share of

Abilify*

net sales recognized by BMS was 58% in 2010 and 53.5% in 2011 and 51.5% in 2012.

In the UK, Germany, France and Spain, BMS
receives 65% of third-party net sales. In these countries and the U.S., third-party customers are invoiced by BMS on behalf of Otsuka and alliance revenue is recognized when

Abilify*

is shipped and all risks and rewards of ownership have
transferred to third party customers. BMS recognizes all of the net sales in certain countries where it is the exclusive distributor for the product or has an exclusive right to sell

Abilify*

.

BMS purchases the product from Otsuka and performs finish manufacturing for sale to third-party customers by BMS or Otsuka. Under the
terms of the amended agreement, BMS paid Otsuka $400 million, which is amortized as a reduction of net sales through the expected loss of U.S. exclusivity in April 2015. The unamortized amount is included in other assets. Otsuka receives a royalty
based on 1.5% of total U.S. net sales, which is included in cost of products sold. Otsuka is responsible for 30% of the U.S. expenses related to the commercialization of

Abilify*

from 2010 through 2012. BMS also receives additional
reimbursement from Otsuka for costs incurred by BMS in excess of the resource requirements specified in the agreement.

Beginning January 1, 2013, BMS will receive the following percentages of U.S. annual net sales. Net sales will be initially
recognized at 35% and adjusted to reflect the actual level of net sales in 2013:


The U.S. commercialization agreement was amended in October 2012 requiring Otsuka to assume
full responsibility for providing and funding all sales force efforts effective January 2013. In consideration, BMS paid Otsuka $27 million in January 2013, and will be responsible for funding certain operating expenses up to $82 million in 2013,
$56 million in 2014 and $8 million in 2015. In the EU, Otsuka will reimburse BMS for its sales force effort provided through March 31, 2013. Beginning April 1, 2013 Otsuka will assume responsibility for providing and funding sales force
effort.

BMS and Otsuka also entered into an oncology collaboration for

Sprycel

and

Ixempra

(ixabepilone) for
the U.S., Japan and European Union (EU) markets (the Oncology Territory). A collaboration fee, classified in cost of products sold, is paid to Otsuka based on the following percentages of annual net sales of

Sprycel

and

Ixempra

in the
Oncology Territory:

During these periods, Otsuka contributes (i) 20% of the first $175 million of certain commercial
operational expenses relating to the oncology products, and (ii) 1% of such commercial operational expenses relating to the products in the territory in excess of $175 million. Beginning in 2011, Otsuka copromotes

Sprycel

in the U.S. and
Japan, and has exercised the right to copromote in the top five EU markets beginning in January 2012.

The U.S. extension and
the oncology collaboration include a change-of-control provision in the case of an acquisition of BMS. If the acquiring company does not have a competing product to

Abilify*

, then the new company will assume the

Abilify*

agreement (as
amended) and the oncology collaboration as it exists today. If the acquiring company has a product that competes with

Abilify*

, Otsuka can elect to request the acquiring company to choose whether to divest

Abilify*

or the competing
product. In the scenario where

Abilify*

is divested, Otsuka would be obligated to acquire the rights of BMS under the

Abilify*

agreement (as amended). The agreements also provide that in the event of a generic competitor to

Abilify*

after January 1, 2010, BMS has the option of terminating the

Abilify*

April 2009 amendment (with the agreement as previously amended remaining in force). If BMS were to exercise such option then either (i) BMS would
receive a payment from Otsuka according to a pre-determined schedule and the oncology collaboration would terminate at the same time or (ii) the oncology collaboration would continue for a truncated period according to a pre-determined
schedule.

The EU agreement remained unchanged and will expire in June 2014. In other countries where BMS has the exclusive
right to sell

Abilify*

, the agreement expires on the later of April 2015 or expiration of the applicable patent or data exclusivity in such country.

In addition to the $400 million extension payment, total milestones paid to Otsuka were $217 million, of which $157 million was expensed as IPRD in 1999. The remaining $60 million was capitalized in other
intangible assets and was amortized to cost of products sold over the remaining life of the original agreement in the U.S.

Summarized financial information related to this alliance is as follows:

Lilly

BMS has an Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) commercialization agreement with Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly) through Lilly’s 2008 acquisition of ImClone Systems Incorporated (ImClone) for the
codevelopment and promotion of

Erbitux*

and necitumumab (IMC-11F8) in the U.S., which expires as to

Erbitux*

in September 2018. BMS also has codevelopment and copromotion rights to both products in Canada and Japan.

Erbitux*

is
indicated for use in the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and for use in the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Under the EGFR agreement, with respect to

Erbitux*

sales in North America, Lilly
receives a distribution fee based on a flat rate of 39% of net sales in North America plus reimbursement of certain royalties paid by Lilly.


In 2007, BMS and ImClone amended their codevelopment agreement with Merck KGaA (Merck) to
provide for cocommercialization of

Erbitux*

in Japan. The rights under this agreement expire in 2032; however, Lilly has the ability to terminate the agreement after 2018 if it determines that it is commercially unreasonable for Lilly to
continue.

Erbitux*

received marketing approval in Japan in 2008 for the use of

Erbitux*

in treating patients with advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer. BMS receives 50% of the pre-tax profit from Merck sales of

Erbitux*

in
Japan which is further shared equally with Lilly.

BMS is amortizing $500 million of license acquisition costs in costs of
products sold through 2018.

In 2010, BMS and Lilly restructured the EGFR commercialization agreement described above between
BMS and ImClone as it relates to necitumumab, a novel targeted cancer therapy currently in Phase III development for non-small cell lung cancer. Both companies share in the cost of developing and potentially commercializing necitumumab in the U.S.,
Canada and Japan. Lilly maintains exclusive rights to necitumumab in all other markets.

In November 2012, we provided notice
of the termination of our global codevelopment and cocommercialization arrangement for necitumumab (IMC-11F8), a fully human monoclonal antibody being investigated as an anticancer treatment, which was discovered by ImClone and is part of the
alliance between the Company and Lilly, with all rights returning to Lilly. The termination is effective May 2014, though we and Lilly may terminate earlier.

BMS acquired Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Amylin) on August 8, 2012 (see “—Note 4.
Acquisitions” for further information). Amylin had previously entered into a settlement and termination agreement with Lilly regarding their collaboration for the global development and commercialization of

Byetta*

and

Bydureon

*
(exenatide products) under which the parties agreed to transition full responsibility of these products to Amylin. Although the transition of the U.S. operations was completed, Lilly had not yet transitioned the non-U.S. operations to Amylin. In
September 2012, BMS provided notification to Lilly that BMS will assume essentially all non-U.S. operations of the exenatide products during the first half of 2013 and therefore terminate Lilly’s exclusive right to non-U.S. commercialization of
the exenatide products, subject to certain regulatory and other conditions. BMS is responsible for any non-U.S. losses incurred by Lilly during 2012 and 2013 up to a maximum of $60 million and is entitled to tiered royalties until the transition is
complete. Promissory notes assumed in the acquisition of Amylin aggregating $1.4 billion were repaid to Lilly during 2012.

Gilead

BMS and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead) have a joint venture to develop and commercialize

Atripla*

(efavirenz
600 mg/ emtricitabine 200 mg/ tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg), a once-daily single tablet three-drug regimen for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, combining

Sustiva

, a product of BMS, and

Truvada*

(emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), a product of Gilead, in the U.S., Canada and Europe. BMS accounts for its participation in the U.S. joint venture under the equity method of accounting.

Net sales of the bulk efavirenz component of

Atripla*

are deferred until the combined product is sold to third-party customers.
Net sales for the efavirenz component are based on the relative ratio of the average respective net selling prices of

Truvada*

and

Sustiva

.

Summarized financial information related to this alliance is as follows:


AstraZeneca

In 2012, BMS and AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca, entered into a collaboration regarding the worldwide development and commercialization of Amylin’s portfolio
of products (

Bydureon*

,

Byetta*

,

Symlin*

and metreleptin, which is currently in development). The arrangement is based on the framework of the existing diabetes alliance agreements discussed further below, including the equal
sharing of profits and losses arising from the collaboration. AstraZeneca has indicated its intent to establish equal governance rights over certain key strategic and financial decisions regarding the collaboration pending required anti-trust
approvals in certain international markets.

BMS received preliminary proceeds of $3.6 billion from AstraZeneca as
consideration for entering into the collaboration including $73 million included in accrued expenses that is expected to be reimbursed back to AstraZeneca in 2013. The remaining $3.5 billion is accounted for as deferred income and amortized as a
reduction to cost of products sold on a pro-rata basis over the estimated useful lives of the related long-lived assets assigned in the purchase price allocation (primarily intangible assets with a weighted-average estimated useful life of 12 years
and property, plant and equipment with a weighted-average estimated useful life of 15 years). The net proceeds that BMS will receive from AstraZeneca as consideration for entering into the collaboration are subject to certain other adjustments
including the right to receive an additional $135 million when AstraZeneca exercises its option for equal governance rights.

BMS and AstraZeneca agreed to share in certain tax attributes related to the Amylin collaboration. The preliminary proceeds of $3.6
billion that BMS received from AstraZeneca included $207 million related to sharing of certain tax attributes.

In addition,
BMS continues to maintain two worldwide diabetes codevelopment and cocommercialization agreements with AstraZeneca for

Onglyza

,

Kombiglyze XR

(saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release),

Komboglyze

(saxagliptin
and metformin immediate-release marketed in the EU) and

Forxiga

(dapagliflozin). The agreements for saxagliptin exclude Japan. In this document unless specifically noted, we refer to both

Kombiglyze

and

Komboglyze

as

Kombiglyze

.

Forxiga

was approved in the EU in November 2012.

Onglyza

and

Forxiga

were discovered by BMS.

Kombiglyze

was codeveloped with AstraZeneca. Both companies jointly develop the clinical and marketing
strategy and share commercialization expenses and profits and losses equally on a global basis and also share in development costs, with the exception of

Forxiga

development costs in Japan, which are borne by AstraZeneca. BMS manufactures
both products. BMS has opted to decline involvement in cocommercialization for both products in certain countries not in the BMS global commercialization network and instead receives compensation based on net sales recorded by AstraZeneca in these
countries.

BMS received $300 million in upfront, milestone and other licensing payments related to saxagliptin to date and
could receive up to an additional $300 million for sales-based milestones. BMS also received $250 million in upfront, milestone and other licensing payments related to dapagliflozin to date, including $80 million received in January 2013, and could
potentially receive up to an additional $150 million for development and regulatory milestones and up to an additional $390 million for sales-based milestones. BMS is entitled to reimbursements for 50% of capital expenditures related to Amylin.

Summarized financial information related to these alliances is as follows:


Pfizer

BMS and Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) maintain a worldwide codevelopment and cocommercialization agreement for

Eliquis

, an anticoagulant discovered by BMS for the prevention and treatment of atrial
fibrillation and other arterial thrombotic conditions.

Eliquis

was approved in the US and Japan in December 2012. Pfizer funds 60% of all development costs under the initial development plan effective January 1, 2007. The companies
jointly develop the clinical and marketing strategy and share commercialization expenses and profits equally on a global basis. In certain countries not in the BMS global commercialization network, Pfizer will commercialize

Eliquis

alone and
will pay compensation to BMS based on a percentage of net sales. BMS manufactures the product.

BMS received $654 million in
upfront, milestone and other licensing payments for

Eliquis

to date, including $95 million received in February 2013 and could receive up to an additional $230 million for development and regulatory milestones. These payments are deferred and
amortized over the estimated useful life of the products in other income.

Summarized financial information related to this alliance is as
follows:

Valeant

In 2012, BMS and PharmaSwiss SA, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. (Valeant) entered into a collaboration for certain mature brand products in Europe. In connection
with the collaboration, Valeant is responsible for the marketing, promotion, distribution and sale of the products and related regulatory matters in the covered territory, and BMS is responsible for the maintenance of the products’ intellectual
property and supply of the products. The collaboration expires December, 31, 2014 at which time Valeant has the right to purchase the trademarks and intellectual property at a price determined based on a multiple of sales. If the right is not
exercised, all rights transferred to Valeant during the collaboration period revert back to BMS.

As consideration for
entering into the collaboration, BMS received $79 million at the start of the collaboration period which was allocated to the license and other rights transferred to Valeant ($61 million) and the option to purchase the remaining assets at the end of
the collaboration ($18 million). The allocation was based on the estimated fair value of the option and other elements after considering various market factors, including an analysis of any estimated excess of the fair value of the mature brands
business over the potential purchase price if the option to purchase the trademarks and intellectual property is exercised at December 31, 2014. The fair value of the option was recorded as a liability, and changes in the estimated fair value
of the option liability will be recognized in the results of operations. The remaining $61 million will be recognized as alliance revenue throughout the term of the collaboration. BMS will also recognize revenue during the collaboration period for
the supply of the product, and provide certain information technology, regulatory, order processing, distribution and other transitional services in exchange for a fee during the first six months of the collaboration.

Note 4. ACQUISITIONS

Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Acquisition

On August 8, 2012, BMS completed its acquisition of the outstanding shares of Amylin, a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative medicines
to treat diabetes and other metabolic diseases. Acquisition costs of $29 million were included in other expenses.

BMS
obtained full U.S. commercialization rights to Amylin’s two primary commercialized assets,

Bydureon*

, a once-weekly diabetes treatment and

Byetta*

, a daily diabetes treatment, both of which are glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)
receptor agonists approved in certain countries to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. BMS also obtained full commercialization rights to

Symlin*

(pramlintide acetate), an amylinomimetic approved in the U.S. for
adjunctive therapy to mealtime insulin to treat diabetes. Goodwill generated from this acquisition was primarily attributed to the expansion of our diabetes franchise.


IPRD was attributed to metreleptin, an analog of the human hormone leptine being studied and
developed for the treatment of diabetes and/or hypertriglyceridemia in pediatric and adult patients with inherited or acquired lipodystrophy. The estimated useful life and the cash flows utilized to value metreleptin assumed initial positive cash
flows to commence shortly after the expected receipt of regulatory approvals, subject to trial results.

Inhibitex, Inc. Acquisition

On February 13, 2012, BMS completed its acquisition of the outstanding shares of Inhibitex, Inc. (Inhibitex), a
clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing products to prevent and treat serious infectious diseases. Acquisition costs of $12 million were included in other expense.

BMS obtained Inhibitex’s lead asset, INX-189, an oral nucleotide polymerase (NS5B) inhibitor in Phase II development for the
treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infections. Goodwill generated from this acquisition was primarily attributed to the potential to offer a full portfolio of therapy choices for hepatitis virus infections as well as to provide additional levels
of sustainability to BMS’s virology pipeline.

IPRD was primarily attributed to INX-189. INX-189 was expected to be most
effective when used in combination therapy and it was assumed all market participants would inherently maintain franchise synergies attributed to maximizing the cash flows of their existing virology pipeline assets. The cash flows utilized to value
INX-189 included such synergies and also assumed initial positive cash flows to commence shortly after the expected receipt of regulatory approvals, subject to trial results.

In August 2012, the Company discontinued development of INX-189 in the interest of patient safety. As a result, the Company recognized a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge of $1.8 billion related to the
IPRD intangible asset in the third quarter of 2012. For further information discussion of the impairment charge, see “—Note 13. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”

Amira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Acquisition

On September 7, 2011, BMS
completed its acquisition of the outstanding shares of Amira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Amira) for $325 million in cash plus three separate, contingent $50 million payments due upon achievement of certain development and sales-based milestones. The
first contingent payment was made in the fourth quarter of 2011. The purchase price of Amira includes the estimated fair value of the total contingent consideration of $58 million, which was recorded in other liabilities. Acquisition costs of $1
million were included in other expense. Amira was a privately-held biotechnology company primarily focused on the discovery and development of therapeutic products for the treatment of cardiovascular and fibrotic inflammatory diseases. The
acquisition provides BMS with: 1) full rights to develop and commercialize AM152 which has completed Phase I clinical studies and the remainder of the Amira lysophosphatidic acid 1 receptor antagonist program; 2) researchers with fibrotic expertise;
and 3) a pre-clinical autotaxin program. Goodwill generated from the acquisition was primarily attributed to acquired scientific expertise in fibrotic diseases allowing for expansion into a new therapeutic class.

The contingent liability was estimated utilizing a model that assessed the probability of achieving each milestone and discounted the
amount of each potential payment based on the expected timing. Estimates used in evaluating the contingent liability were consistent with those used in evaluating the acquired IPRD. The discount rate for each payment was consistent with market debt
yields for the non-callable, publicly-traded bonds of BMS with similar maturities to each of the estimated potential payment dates. This fair value measurement was based on significant inputs not observable in the market and therefore represents a
Level 3 measurement.

ZymoGenetics, Inc. Acquisition

On October 8, 2010, BMS completed its acquisition of the outstanding shares of common stock of ZymoGenetics, Inc. (ZymoGenetics) in October 2010. Acquisition costs of $10 million were included in
other expense. ZymoGenetics is focused on developing and commercializing therapeutic protein-based products for the treatment of human diseases. The companies collaborated on the development of peginterferon lambda, a novel interferon in Phase IIb
development at the acquisition date, for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection. The acquisition provides the Company with full rights to develop and commercialize peginterferon lambda and also brings proven capabilities with therapeutic
proteins and revenue from

Recothrom

, an FDA approved specialty surgical biologic. Goodwill generated from the acquisition was primarily attributed to full ownership rights to peginterferon lambda.


The final purchase price allocation for ZymoGenetics, Amira and Inhibitex and the
preliminary purchase price allocation (pending final valuation of intangible assets and deferred income taxes) for Amylin were as follows:

Cash paid for the acquisition of Amylin included payments of $5,093 million to its outstanding common
stockholders and $219 million to holders of its stock options and restricted stock units (including $94 million attributed to accelerated vesting that was accounted for as stock compensation expense in the third quarter of 2012).

The results of operations from acquired companies are included in the consolidated financial statements as of the acquisition date.

Revisions to goodwill from preliminary estimates at September 30, 2012 for Amylin relate primarily to an adjustment of
the preliminary amount allocated to the fair value of acquired IPRD (decrease of $250 million) based on additional information obtained related to future cash flow projections, net of the resulting deferred tax adjustment ($99 million).

Pro forma supplemental financial information is not provided as the impacts of the acquisitions were not material to operating results in
the year of acquisition. Goodwill, IPRD and all intangible assets valued in these acquisitions are non-deductible for tax purposes.

Note 5. OTHER (INCOME)/EXPENSE

Other (income)/expense includes:


Restructuring charges included termination benefits for workforce reductions of
manufacturing, selling, administrative, and research and development personnel across all geographic regions of approximately 1,205 in 2012, 822 in 2011 and 995 in 2010.

The following table represents the activity of employee termination and other exit cost liabilities:

Note 7. INCOME TAXES

The provision/(benefit) for income taxes consisted of:

Effective Tax Rate

The reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the U.S. statutory Federal income tax rate was:

The change in the 2012 effective tax rate from 2011 was due to:

•

A tax benefit of $392 million attributable to a capital loss deduction resulting from the tax insolvency of Inhibitex; and

•

Favorable earnings mix between high and low tax jurisdictions primarily attributed to lower

Plavix*

sales and a $1,830 million impairment
charge for BMS-986094 intangible asset in the U.S. and to a lesser extent, an internal transfer of intellectual property.


Partially offset by:

•

Contingent tax matters which resulted in a $66 million charge in 2012 and $161 million benefit in 2011;

•

An unfavorable impact on the current year rate from the delay in the legal enactment of the research and development tax credit, which was not
extended as of December 31, 2012; and

•

Changes in prior period estimates upon finalizing U.S. tax returns resulting in a $54 million benefit in 2011.

The change in the 2011 effective tax rate from 2010 was due to:

•

A $207 million charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010, which resulted primarily from additional U.S. taxable income from earnings of
foreign subsidiaries previously considered to be indefinitely reinvested offshore;

•

Changes in prior period estimates upon finalizing U.S. tax returns resulting in a $54 million benefit in 2011 and a $30 million charge in 2010; and

•

Higher tax benefits from contingent tax matters primarily related to the effective settlements and remeasurements of uncertain tax positions ($161
million in 2011 and $131 million in 2010).

Partially offset by:

•

Unfavorable earnings mix between high and low tax jurisdictions compared to the prior year;

•

The non-tax deductible annual pharmaceutical company fee effective January 1, 2011 (tax impact of $80 million); and

•

An out-of-period tax adjustment of $59 million in 2010 for previously unrecognized net deferred tax assets primarily attributed to deferred profits
related to certain alliances as of December 31, 2009 (not material to any prior periods).

Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the Act) was signed into law on January 2, 2013. Among the provisions of the Act, was the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit and look thru exception for 2012 and 2013. As a result, the 2012 R&D
tax credit and look thru exception benefit will be recognized in the first quarter of 2013.

Deferred Taxes and Valuation Allowance

The components of current and non-current deferred income tax assets/(liabilities) were as follows:


The U.S. Federal net operating loss carryforwards were $486 million at December 31,
2012. These carryforwards were acquired as a result of certain acquisitions and are subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The net operating loss carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2022. The
U.S. Federal tax credit carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2017. The realization of the U.S. Federal tax credit carryforwards is dependent on generating sufficient domestic-sourced taxable income prior to their expiration. The
capital loss available of $2,200 million can be carried back to 2009 and carried forward to 2017. The foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2013 (certain amounts have unlimited lives).

Management has established a valuation allowance when a deferred tax asset is more likely than not to be realized. At December 31,
2012, a valuation allowance of $4,404 million was established for the following items: $3,659 million primarily for foreign net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, $338 million for state deferred tax assets including net operating loss and
tax credit carryforwards, $15 million for U.S. Federal net operating loss carryforwards and $392 million for U.S Federal capital losses.

In 2011, foreign holding companies net operating losses and their corresponding valuation allowances included an increase of $2,027 million as a result of statutory impairment charges that are not
required in consolidated net earnings. These foreign holding companies had a higher asset basis for statutory purposes than the basis used in the consolidated financial statements due to an internal reorganization of certain legal entities in prior
periods.

Changes in the valuation allowance were as follows:

Income tax payments were $676 million in 2012, $597 million in 2011 and $672 million in 2010. The current
tax benefit realized as a result of stock related compensation credited to capital in excess of par value of stock was $71 million in 2012, $47 million in 2011 and $10 million in 2010.

U.S. taxes have not been provided on approximately $21 billion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as these undistributed
earnings are indefinitely invested offshore at December 31, 2012. Additional tax provisions will be required if these earnings are repatriated in the future to the U.S. or if such earnings are determined to be remitted in the foreseeable
future. Due to complexities in the tax laws and assumptions that would have to be made, it is not practicable to estimate the amounts of income taxes that will have to be provided. As a result, BMS has favorable tax rates in Ireland and Puerto Rico
under grants not scheduled to expire prior to 2023.

An internal reorganization of certain legal entities resulted in a $207
million charge in 2010. It is possible that U.S. tax authorities could assert additional material tax liabilities arising from the reorganization. BMS would vigorously challenge any such assertion, were it to occur, and believes it would prevail;
however, there can be no assurance of such a result.

Business is conducted in various countries throughout the world and is
subject to tax in numerous jurisdictions. A significant number of tax returns are filed and subject to examination by various Federal, state and local tax authorities. Tax examinations are often complex, as tax authorities may disagree with the
treatment of items reported requiring several years to resolve. Liabilities are established for possible assessments by tax authorities resulting from known tax exposures including, but not limited to, transfer pricing matters, tax credits and
deductibility of certain expenses. Such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid and may need to be adjusted over time as more information becomes known. The effect of changes in estimates related to
contingent tax liabilities is included in the effective tax rate reconciliation above.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:


Additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Uncertain tax benefits reduce deferred tax assets to the extent the uncertainty directly related to that
asset; otherwise, they are recognized as either current or non-current U.S. and foreign income taxes payable. Accrued interest and penalties payable for unrecognized tax benefits are included in either current or non-current U.S. and foreign income
taxes payable. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are included in income tax expense.

BMS is
currently under examination by a number of tax authorities, including but not limited to the major tax jurisdictions listed in the table below, which have proposed adjustments to tax for issues such as transfer pricing, certain tax credits and the
deductibility of certain expenses. BMS estimates that it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2012 will decrease in the range of approximately $370 million to $400 million in the next twelve
months as a result of the settlement of certain tax audits and other events. The expected change in unrecognized tax benefits, primarily settlement related, will involve the payment of additional taxes, the adjustment of certain deferred taxes
and/or the recognition of tax benefits. BMS also anticipates that it is reasonably possible that new issues will be raised by tax authorities which may require increases to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits; however, an estimate of such
increases cannot reasonably be made at this time. BMS believes that it has adequately provided for all open tax years by tax jurisdiction.

The following is a summary of major tax jurisdictions for which tax authorities may assert additional taxes based upon tax years currently under audit and subsequent years that will likely be audited:

Note 8. EARNINGS PER SHARE


Note 9. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable and payable, debt
instruments and derivatives. The carrying amount of receivables and accounts payable approximates fair value due to their short term maturity.

Changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates create exposure to market risk. Certain derivative financial instruments are used when available on a cost-effective basis to hedge the underlying
economic exposure. These instruments qualify as cash flow, net investment and fair value hedges upon meeting certain criteria, including effectiveness of offsetting hedged exposures. Changes in fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge
accounting are recognized in earnings as they occur. Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading purposes.

Financial instruments are subject to counterparty credit risk which is considered as part of the overall fair value measurement.
Counterparty credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis and mitigated by limiting amounts outstanding with any individual counterparty, utilizing conventional derivative financial instruments and only entering into agreements with counterparties
that meet high credit quality standards. The consolidated financial statements would not be materially impacted if any counterparty failed to perform according to the terms of its agreement. Collateral is not required by any party whether
derivatives are in an asset or liability position under the terms of the agreements.

Fair Value Measurements –

The fair values of
financial instruments are classified into one of the following categories:

Level 1 inputs utilize non-binding
quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs. These instruments include U.S. treasury securities.

Level 2 inputs utilize observable prices for similar instruments, non-binding quoted prices for identical or
similar instruments in markets that are not active, and other observable inputs that can be corroborated by market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. These instruments include corporate debt securities, commercial
paper, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured debt securities, certificates of deposit, money market funds, foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swap contracts, equity funds, fixed income funds and long-term debt.
Additionally, certain corporate debt securities utilize a third-party matrix pricing model that uses significant inputs corroborated by market data for substantially the full term of the assets. Equity and fixed income funds are primarily invested
in publicly traded securities and are valued at the respective net asset value of the underlying investments. There were no significant unfunded commitments or restrictions on redemptions related to equity and fixed income funds as of
December 31, 2012. Level 2 derivative instruments are valued using London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR) yield curves, less credit valuation adjustments, and observable forward foreign exchange rates at
the reporting date. Valuations of derivative contracts may fluctuate considerably from period-to-period due to volatility in underlying foreign currencies and underlying interest rates, which are driven by market conditions and the duration of the
contract. Credit adjustment volatility may have a significant impact on the valuation of interest rate swaps due to changes in counterparty credit ratings and credit default swap spreads.

Level 3 unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. Valuation models for the Auction Rate
Security (ARS) and Floating Rate Security (FRS) portfolio are based on expected cash flow streams and collateral values including assessments of counterparty credit quality, default risk underlying the security, discount rates and overall capital
market liquidity. The fair value of the ARS was determined using an internally developed valuation which was based in part on indicative bids received on the underlying assets of the security and other evidence of fair value. The ARS is a private
placement security rated ‘BBB-’ by Standard and Poor’s as of December 31, 2012 and represents interests in insurance securitizations. Due to the current lack of an active market for FRS and the general lack of transparency into
their underlying assets, other qualitative analysis is relied upon to value FRS including discussions with brokers and fund managers, default risk underlying the security and overall capital markets liquidity.


Available-For-Sale Securities and Cash Equivalents

The following table summarizes available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2012 and 2011:

The following table summarizes the classification of available-for-sale securities in the consolidated balance sheet:

Money market funds and other securities aggregating $1,288 million and $5,469 million at
December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, were included in cash and cash equivalents and valued using Level 2 inputs. Cash and cash equivalents maintained in foreign currencies were $493 million at December 31, 2012 and are subject to
currency rate risk.

At December 31, 2012, $3,512 million of non-current available for sale corporate debt securities and
FRS mature within five years. All auction rate securities mature beyond 10 years.

The change in fair value for the
investments in equity and fixed income funds are recognized in other income/expense and are designed to offset the changes in fair value of certain employee retirement benefits.

The following table summarizes the activity for financial assets utilizing Level 3 fair value measurements:


Qualifying Hedges and Non-Qualifying Derivatives

The following summarizes the fair value of outstanding derivatives:

Cash Flow Hedges —

Foreign currency forward contracts are primarily utilized to hedge
forecasted intercompany inventory purchase transactions in certain foreign currencies. These forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges with the effective portion of changes in fair value being temporarily reported in accumulated OCI and
recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. The notional amount of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts was primarily attributed to the Euro ($929 million) and Japanese yen ($413 million) at December 31, 2012.

The net gains on foreign currency forward contracts qualifying for cash flow hedge accounting are expected to be reclassified
to cost of products sold within the next two years, including $25 million of pre-tax gains to be reclassified within the next 12 months. Cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued when the forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring on
the originally forecasted date, or 60 days thereafter, or when the hedge is no longer effective. Assessments to determine whether derivatives designated as qualifying hedges are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of hedged
items are performed at inception and on a quarterly basis. Any ineffective portion of the change in fair value is included in current period earnings. The earnings impact related to discontinued cash flow hedges and hedge ineffectiveness was not
significant during all periods presented.

Net Investment Hedges —

Non-U.S. dollar borrowings of
€541 million ($714 million) are designated to hedge the foreign currency exposures of the net investment in certain foreign affiliates. These borrowings are designated as net investment hedges and recognized in long term debt. The
effective portion of foreign exchange gains or losses on the remeasurement of the debt is recognized in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated OCI with the related offset in long term debt.

Fair Value Hedges —

Fixed-to-floating interest rate swap contracts are designated as fair value hedges and are used as part
of an interest rate risk management strategy to create an appropriate balance of fixed and floating rate debt. The swaps and underlying debt for the benchmark risk being hedged are recorded at fair value. The effective interest rate paid on
fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps is one-month LIBOR (0.210% as of December 31, 2012) plus an interest rate spread ranging from 1.3% to 2.9%. When the underlying swap is terminated prior to maturity, the fair value basis adjustment to the
underlying debt instrument is amortized into earnings as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining life of the debt.

During 2011, fixed-to-floating interest rate swap contracts of $1.6 billion notional amount and €1.0 billion notional amount were
terminated generating total proceeds of $356 million (including accrued interest of $66 million). During 2010, fixed-to-floating interest rate swap contracts of $237 million notional amount and €500 million notional amount were terminated
generating total proceeds of $116 million (including accrued interest of $18 million).

Non-Qualifying Foreign Exchange
Contracts —

Foreign currency forward contracts are used to offset exposure to foreign currency-denominated monetary assets, liabilities and earnings. The primary objective of these contracts is to protect the U.S. dollar value of foreign
currency-denominated monetary assets, liabilities and earnings from the effects of volatility in foreign exchange rates that might occur prior to their receipt or settlement in U.S. dollars. These contracts are not designated as hedges and are
adjusted to fair value through other (income)/expense as they occur, and substantially offset the change in fair value of the underlying foreign currency denominated monetary asset, liability or earnings. The effect of non-qualifying hedges on
earnings was not significant for all periods presented.

Debt Obligations

Short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt includes:


Long-term debt and the current portion of long term debt includes:

Included in the current portion of long-term debt is $50 million of Floating Rate Convertible Senior
Debentures due 2023 which can be redeemed by the holders at par on September 15, 2013 and 2018, or if a fundamental change in ownership occurs. The Debentures are callable at par at any time by the Company. The Debentures have a current
conversion price of $39.99, equal to a conversion rate of 25.0047 shares for each $1,000 principal amount, subject to certain anti-dilutive adjustments.

During the third quarter 2012, $2.0 billion of senior unsecured notes were issued: $750 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.875% Notes due 2017, $750 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.000%
Notes due 2022 and $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.250% Notes due 2042 in a registered public offering. Interest on the notes will be paid semi-annually. The notes rank equally in right of payment with all of BMS’s existing and
future senior unsecured indebtedness. BMS may redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at any time at a predetermined redemption price. The net proceeds of the note issuances were $1,950 million, which is net of a discount of $36 million and deferred
loan issuance costs of $14 million.

The average amount of commercial paper outstanding was $224 million at a weighted-average
interest rate of 0.16% during 2012. The maximum month end amount of commercial paper outstanding was $700 million with no outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2012.

Substantially all of the $2.0 billion debt obligations assumed in the acquisition of Amylin were repaid during the third quarter of 2012, including a promissory note with Lilly with respect to a revenue
sharing obligation and Amylin senior notes due 2014.

The principal value of long-term debt obligations was $6,631 million at
December 31, 2012, of which $648 million is due in 2013, $27 million is due in 2014, $659 million is due in 2016, $750 million is due in 2017 and the remaining $4,547 million is due in 2018 or thereafter. The fair value of long-term debt was
$8,285 million and $6,406 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and was estimated based upon the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt instruments. The fair value of short-term borrowings approximates the carrying
value due to the short maturities of the debt instruments.

Debt repurchase activity was as follows:


Interest payments were $241 million in 2012, $171 million in 2011 and $178 million in 2010
net of amounts related to interest rate swap contracts.

BMS currently has two separate $1.5 billion five-year revolving
credit facilities from a syndicate of lenders, including a new facility received in July 2012. There are no financial covenants under either facility. No borrowings were outstanding under either revolving credit facility at December 31, 2012 or
2011.

At December 31, 2012, $249 million of financial guarantees were provided in the form of stand-by letters of credit
and performance bonds. The stand-by letters of credit are issued through financial institutions in support of guarantees made by BMS and its affiliates for various obligations. The performance bonds were issued to support a range of ongoing
operating activities, including sale of products to hospitals and foreign ministries of health, bonds for customs, duties and value added tax and guarantees related to miscellaneous legal actions. A significant majority of the outstanding financial
guarantees will expire within the year and are not expected to be funded.

Note 10. RECEIVABLES

Receivables include:

Receivables are netted with deferred income related to alliance partners until recognition of income. As
a result, alliance partner receivables and deferred income were reduced by $1,056 million and $901 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. For additional information regarding alliance partners, see “—Note 3. Alliances
and Collaborations.” Non-U.S. receivables sold on a nonrecourse basis were $956 million in 2012, $1,077 million in 2011, and $932 million in 2010. In the aggregate, receivables from three pharmaceutical wholesalers in the U.S. represented 37%
and 55% of total trade receivables at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Changes to the allowances for bad debt, charge-backs and
cash discounts were as follows:

Note 11. INVENTORIES

Inventories include:

Inventories expected to remain on-hand beyond one year were $424 million at December 31, 2012 and
$260 million at December 31, 2011 and included in non-current assets.


Note 12. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Property, plant and equipment includes:

Depreciation expense was $382 million in 2012, $448 million in 2011 and $473 million in 2010.

Note 13. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill were as follows:

Other includes an out-of-period adjustment to correct the purchase price allocation for the September
2009 Medarex acquisition and a $24 million contingent milestone payment from a prior acquisition. The Medarex purchase price adjustment decreased other intangible assets by $98 million and increased deferred tax assets by $34 million and goodwill by
$64 million. The effect of this adjustment was not material for the current or any prior periods.

Other intangible assets include:

Changes in other intangible assets were as follows:

Annual amortization expense of other intangible assets is expected to be approximately $850 million in
2013, $850 million in 2014, $750 million in 2015, $750 million in 2016, $700 million in 2017 and $4,210 million thereafter.


BMS announced the discontinued development of BMS-986094 (formerly known as INX-189), a
nucleotide polymerase (NS5B) inhibitor that was in Phase II development for the treatment of the hepatitis C virus infection on August 23, 2012. The decision was made in the interest of patient safety, based on a rapid, thorough and ongoing
assessment of patients in a Phase II study that was voluntarily suspended on August 1, 2012. BMS acquired BMS-986094 with its acquisition of Inhibitex in February 2012. As a result of the termination of this development program, a $1,830
million pre-tax impairment charge was recognized for the IPRD intangible asset.

An impairment charge of $120 million was
recognized in 2012 related to a partial write-down to fair value of developed technology costs related to a non-key product (

Recothrom

) acquired in the acquisition of ZymoGenetics. The developed technology impairment charge resulted from
continued competitive pricing pressures.

Note 14. ACCRUED EXPENSES

Accrued expenses include:

Note 15. SALES REBATES AND RETURN ACCRUALS

Reductions to trade receivables and accrued rebates and returns liabilities are as follows:

Note 16. DEFERRED INCOME

Deferred income includes:

Upfront, milestone and other licensing receipts are amortized over the expected life of the product. See
“—Note 3. Alliances and Collaborations” for information pertaining to revenue recognition and other transactions including $3.5 billion of proceeds received from AstraZeneca related to the Amylin collaboration during the 2012.
Deferred gains on several sale-leaseback transactions are amortized over the remaining lease terms of the related facilities through 2018. Deferred income amortization was $308 million in 2012, $173 million in 2011 and $137 million in 2010.


Note 17. EQUITY

Treasury stock is recognized at the cost to reacquire the shares. Shares issued from treasury are
recognized utilizing the first-in first-out method.

In May 2010, the Board of Directors authorized a repurchase of up to $3.0
billion of common stock and in June 2012 increased its authorization for the repurchase of common stock by an additional $3.0 billion. Repurchases may be made either in the open market or through private transactions, including under repurchase
plans established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

Noncontrolling interest is primarily related to the

Plavix*

and

Avapro*

/

Avalide*

partnerships with Sanofi for the
territory covering the Americas. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest are presented net of taxes of $317 million in 2012, $792 million in 2011 and $683 million in 2010 with a corresponding increase to the provision for income taxes.
Distribution of the partnership profits to Sanofi and Sanofi’s funding of ongoing partnership operations occur on a routine basis. The above activity includes the pre-tax income and distributions related to these partnerships.


The components of other comprehensive income/(loss) (OCI) were as follows:

(a)

Realized (gains)/losses on derivatives qualifying as effective hedges are recognized in costs of products sold.

(b)

See “Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 18. Pension, Postretirement and Postemployment Liabilities” for further detail.

(c)

Realized (gains)/losses on available for sale securities are recognized in other (income)/expense.

The accumulated balances related to each component of other comprehensive income/(loss) (OCI), net of taxes, were as follows:


Note 18. PENSION, POSTRETIREMENT AND POSTEMPLOYMENT LIABILITIES

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans and
termination indemnity plans for regular full-time employees. The principal defined benefit pension plan is the Bristol-Myers Squibb Retirement Income Plan, which covers most U.S. employees and represents approximately 70% of the consolidated pension
plan assets and obligations. The funding policy is to contribute at least the minimum amount required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Plan benefits are based primarily on the participant’s years of credited
service and final average compensation. Plan assets consist principally of equity and fixed-income securities.

Comprehensive
medical and group life benefits are provided for substantially all U.S. retirees who elect to participate in comprehensive medical and group life plans. The medical plan is contributory. Contributions are adjusted periodically and vary by date of
retirement. The life insurance plan is noncontributory. Plan assets consist principally of equity and fixed-income securities. Similar plans exist for employees in certain countries outside of the U.S.

The net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans includes:

A $151 million pension settlement charge was recognized in 2012 for the primary U.S. pension plan as a
result of annual lump sum payments exceeding interest and service costs during the fourth quarter. The charge included the acceleration of a portion of unrecognized actuarial losses.

Net actuarial loss and prior service cost of $147 million is expected to be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost
for pension and postretirement benefit plans in 2013.


Changes in defined benefit and postretirement benefit plan obligations, assets, funded
status and amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets were as follows:

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $8,068 million and $7,322
million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Additional information related to pension plans was as follows:

Actuarial Assumptions

Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December 31 were as follows:


Weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the
years ended December 31 were as follows:

The yield on high quality corporate bonds that matches the duration of the benefit obligations is used in
determining the discount rate. The Citigroup Pension Discount curve is used in developing the discount rate for the U.S. plans.

Several factors are considered in developing the expected return on plan assets, including long-term historical returns and input from
external advisors. Individual asset class return forecasts were developed based upon market conditions, for example, price-earnings levels and yields and long-term growth expectations. The expected long-term rate of return is the weighted-average of
the target asset allocation of each individual asset class. Historical long-term actual annualized returns for U.S. pension plans were as follows:




10 years

8.5%

5.6%

4.7%

15 years

6.5%

7.0%

7.9%

20 years

8.5%

8.1%

9.3%

Pension and postretirement liabilities were increased by $459 million at December 31, 2012 with a
corresponding charge to other comprehensive income as a result of actuarial losses attributed to the benefit obligation ($731 million) partially offset by higher than expected return on plan assets ($272 million). These actuarial losses resulted
from prevailing equity and fixed income market conditions and a reduction in interest rates in 2012.

The expected return on
plan assets was determined using the expected rate of return and a calculated value of assets, referred to as the “market-related value” which approximates the fair value of plan assets at December 31, 2012. Differences between the
assumed and actual returns are amortized to the market-related value on a straight-line basis over a three-year period.

Gains
and losses have resulted from changes in actuarial assumptions (such as changes in the discount rate) and from differences between assumed and actual experience (such as differences between actual and expected return on plan assets). These gains and
losses (except those differences being amortized to the market-related value) are only amortized to the extent they exceed 10% of the higher of the market-related value or the projected benefit obligation for each respective plan. As a result,
approximately $840 million related to pension benefits is not expected to be amortized during 2013. The majority of the remaining actuarial losses are amortized over the life expectancy of the plans’ participants for U.S. plans (30 years) and
expected remaining service periods for most other plans into cost of products sold, research and development, and marketing, selling and administrative expenses as appropriate.

Assumed healthcare cost trend rates at December 31 were as follows:




Healthcare cost trend rate assumed for next year

6.8%

7.4%

7.9%

Rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (the ultimate trend rate)

4.5%

4.5%

4.5%

Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have an effect on the amounts reported for the healthcare plans. A
one-percentage-point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects:


Plan Assets

The fair value of pension and postretirement plan assets by asset category at December 31, 2012 and 2011 was as follows:

The investment valuation policies per investment class are as follows:

Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for
identical assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs. These instruments include equity securities, equity funds, and fixed income funds publicly traded on a national securities exchange, U.S.
treasury and agency securities, and cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase and are recognized at cost, which approximates fair
value. Pending trade sales and purchases are included in cash and cash equivalents until final settlement.

Level 2 inputs include observable prices for similar instruments, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in
markets that are not active, and other observable inputs that can be corroborated by market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Equity funds, fixed income funds, event driven hedge funds and short-term investment funds
classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy are valued at the net asset value of their shares held at year end. There were no significant unfunded commitments or restrictions on redemptions related to investments valued at NAV as of
December 31, 2012. Corporate debt securities, government mortgage backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligation bonds, asset backed securities, U.S. treasury and agency securities, state and municipal bonds, and real estate interests
classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy are valued utilizing observable prices for similar instruments and quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active.

Level 3 unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. Equity funds and venture capital and
limited partnership investments classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy are valued at estimated fair value. The estimated fair value is based on the fair value of the underlying investment values or cost plus or minus accumulated
earnings or losses which approximates fair value. Insurance contract interests are carried at contract value, which approximates the estimated fair value and is based on the fair value of the underlying investment of the insurance company. Insurance
contracts are held by certain foreign pension plans. Valuation models for corporate debt securities, collateralized mortgage obligation bonds and asset backed securities classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy are based on estimated
bids from brokers or other third-party vendor sources that utilize expected cash flow streams and collateral values including assessments of counterparty credit quality, default risk, discount rates and overall capital market liquidity.


The following summarizes the activity for financial assets utilizing Level 3 fair value measurements:

The investment strategy emphasizes equities in order to achieve higher expected returns and lower
expenses and required cash contributions over the long-term. A target asset allocation of 70% public equity (58% U.S. and 12% international), 8% private equity and 22% fixed income is maintained for the U.S. pension plans. Investments are well
diversified within each of the three major asset categories. Approximately 81% of the U.S. pension plans equity investments are actively managed. Venture capital and limited partnerships are typically valued on a three month lag. BMS Company common
stock represents less than 1% of the plan assets at December 31, 2012 and 2011.

Contributions

Contributions to the U.S. pension plans were $335 million in 2012, $343 million in 2011 and $341 million in 2010.

Contributions to the international pension plans were $61 million in 2012, $88 million in 2011 and $90 million in 2010. Aggregate
contributions to the U.S. and international plans are expected to be $100 million in 2013.

Estimated Future Benefit Payments

Savings Plan

The principal defined contribution plan is the Bristol-Myers Squibb Savings and Investment Program. The contribution is based on employee contributions and the level of Company match. The expense related
to the plan was $190 million in 2012, $181 million in 2011 and $188 million in 2010.

Post Employment Benefit Plan

Post-employment liabilities for long-term disability benefits were $90 million and $92 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011,
respectively. The expense related to these benefits was $17 million in 2012 and $18 million in both 2011 and 2010.

Termination Indemnity
Plans

Statutory termination obligations are recognized on an undiscounted basis assuming employee termination at each
measurement date. The liability recognized for these obligations was $29 million and $25 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.


Note 19. EMPLOYEE STOCK BENEFIT PLANS

On May 1, 2012, the shareholders approved the 2012 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (the 2012 Plan), which replaced
the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan. Shares of common stock reserved for issuance pursuant to stock plans, options and conversions of preferred stock were 283 million at December 31, 2012. Shares available to be granted for the active
plans, adjusted for the combination of plans, were 116 million at December 31, 2012. Shares for the stock option exercise and share unit vesting are issued from treasury stock. Only shares actually delivered to participants in
connection with an award after all restrictions have lapsed will reduce the number of shares reserved. Shares tendered in a prior year to pay the purchase price of options and shares previously utilized to satisfy withholding tax obligations
upon exercise continue to be available and reserved.

Executive officers and key employees may be granted options to purchase
common stock at no less than the market price on the date the option is granted. Options generally become exercisable ratably over 4 years and have a maximum term of 10 years. Additionally, the plan provides for the granting of stock appreciation
rights whereby the grantee may surrender exercisable rights and receive common stock and/or cash measured by the excess of the market price of the common stock over the option exercise price.

Common stock may be granted to key employees, subject to restrictions as to continuous employment. Restrictions expire over a four year
period from date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period. A stock unit is a right to receive stock at the end of the specified vesting period but has no voting rights.

Market share units were granted to certain executives beginning in 2010. Vesting is conditioned upon continuous employment until vesting
date and the payout factor equals at least 60%. The payout factor is the share price on vesting date divided by share price on award date, with a maximum of 200%. The share price used in the payout factor is calculated using an average of the
closing prices on the grant or vest date, and the nine trading days immediately preceding the grant or vest date. Vesting occurs ratably over four years.

Long-term performance awards have a three year cycle and are delivered in the form of a target number of performance share units. The number of shares ultimately issued is calculated based on actual
performance compared to earnings targets and other performance criteria established at the beginning of the performance period. The awards have annual goals with a maximum payout of 167.5%. If threshold targets are not met for a performance period,
no payment is made under the plan for that annual period. Vesting occurs at the end of the three year period.

Stock-based
compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and is recognized over the vesting period. The acceleration of unvested stock options and restricted stock units in connection with the acquisition of Amylin resulted in stock-based
compensation expense in 2012. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Stock-based compensation expense was as follows:

Share-based compensation activities were as follows:


Total compensation costs related to share-based payment awards not yet recognized and the
weighted-average period over which such awards are expected to be recognized at December 31, 2012 were as follows:

Additional information related to share-based compensation awards is summarized as follows:

The following table summarizes significant ranges of outstanding and exercisable options at
December 31, 2012 (amounts in millions, except per share data):

The aggregate intrinsic value in the preceding table represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value, based
on the closing stock price of $32.59 on December 31, 2012.

Fair Value Assumptions

The fair value of restricted stock units and long-term performance awards is determined based on the closing trading price of the
Company’s common stock on the grant date. Beginning in 2010, the fair value of performance share units granted was not discounted because they participate in dividends. The fair value of performance share units granted prior to 2010 was
discounted using the risk-free interest rate on the date of grant because they do not participate in dividends.

The fair
value of the market share units was estimated on the date of grant using a model applying multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying market conditions. The model uses the following input variables:




Expected volatility

24.1

%

24.3

%

24.8

%

Risk-free interest rate

0.6

%

1.8

%

1.9

%

Dividend yield

4.4

%

4.9

%

5.8

%

Expected volatility is based on the four year historical volatility levels on the Company’s common
stock and the current implied volatility. The four-year risk-free interest rate was derived from the Federal Reserve, based on the market share units’ contractual term. Expected dividend yield is based on historical dividend payments.


Note 20. LEASES

Minimum rental commitments for non-cancelable operating leases (primarily real estate and motor vehicles) in effect at
December 31, 2012, were as follows:

Operating lease expense was $142 million in 2012, $136 million in 2011 and $145 million in 2010. Sublease
income was not material for all periods presented.

Note 21. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits, claims, government investigations and
other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company recognizes accruals for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. These matters
involve patent infringement, antitrust, securities, pricing, sales and marketing practices, environmental, commercial, health and safety matters, consumer fraud, employment matters, product liability and insurance coverage. Legal proceedings that
are material or that the Company believes could become material are described below.

Although the Company believes it has
substantial defenses in these matters, there can be no assurance that there will not be an increase in the scope of pending matters or that any future lawsuits, claims, government investigations or other legal proceedings will not be material.
Unless otherwise noted, the Company is unable to assess the outcome of the respective litigation nor is it able to provide an estimated range of potential loss. Furthermore, failure to enforce our patent rights would likely result in substantial
decreases in the respective product sales from generic competition.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Plavix*

Australia

As previously disclosed, Sanofi was notified that, in August 2007, GenRx Proprietary Limited (GenRx) obtained regulatory approval of an application for clopidogrel bisulfate 75mg tablets in Australia.
GenRx, formerly a subsidiary of Apotex Inc. (Apotex), has since changed its name to Apotex. In August 2007, Apotex filed an application in the Federal Court of Australia (the Federal Court) seeking revocation of Sanofi’s Australian Patent
No. 597784 (Case No. NSD 1639 of 2007). Sanofi filed counterclaims of infringement and sought an injunction. On September 21, 2007, the Federal Court granted Sanofi’s injunction. A subsidiary of the Company was subsequently added as a
party to the proceedings. In February 2008, a second company, Spirit Pharmaceuticals Pty. Ltd., also filed a revocation suit against the same patent. This case was consolidated with the Apotex case and a trial occurred in April 2008. On
August 12, 2008, the Federal Court of Australia held that claims of Patent No. 597784 covering clopidogrel bisulfate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, and taurocholate salts were valid. The Federal Court also held that the process claims,
pharmaceutical composition claims, and claim directed to clopidogrel and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts were invalid. The Company and Sanofi filed notices of appeal in the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia (Full Court) appealing
the holding of invalidity of the claim covering clopidogrel and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, process claims, and pharmaceutical composition claims which have stayed the Federal Court’s ruling. Apotex filed a notice of appeal appealing
the holding of validity of the clopidogrel bisulfate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, and taurocholate claims. A hearing on the appeals occurred in February 2009. On September 29, 2009, the Full Court held all of the claims of Patent
No. 597784 invalid. In November 2009, the Company and Sanofi applied to the High Court of Australia (High Court) for special leave to appeal the judgment of the Full Court. In March 2010, the High Court denied the Company and Sanofi’s
request to hear the appeal of the Full Court decision. The case has been remanded to the Federal Court for further proceedings related to damages. It is expected the amount of damages will not be material to the Company.


Plavix* –

EU

As previously disclosed, in 2007, YES Pharmaceutical Development Services GmbH (YES Pharmaceutical) filed an application for marketing
authorization in Germany for an alternate salt form of clopidogrel. This application relied on data from studies that were originally conducted by Sanofi and BMS for

Plavix*

and were still the subject of data protection in the EU. Sanofi and
BMS have filed an action against YES Pharmaceutical and its partners in the administrative court in Cologne objecting to the marketing authorization. This matter is currently pending, although these specific marketing authorizations now have been
withdrawn from the market. The resolution of this lawsuit is not expected to have a material impact on the Company.

Canada (Apotex, Inc.)

On April 22, 2009, Apotex filed an impeachment action against Sanofi in the Federal
Court of Canada alleging that Sanofi’s Canadian Patent No. 1,336,777 (the ‘777 Patent) is invalid. On June 8, 2009, Sanofi filed its defense to the impeachment action and filed a suit against Apotex for infringement of the
‘777 Patent. The trial was completed in June 2011 and in December 2011, the Federal Court of Canada issued a decision that the ‘777 Patent is invalid. Sanofi has appealed this decision though generic companies have since entered the market
and a decision is expected later this year.

Abilify*

As previously disclosed, Otsuka has filed patent infringement actions against Teva, Barr Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Barr), Sandoz Inc. (Sandoz), Synthon Laboratories, Inc (Synthon), Sun Pharmaceuticals (Sun),
Zydus Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Zydus), and Apotex relating to U.S. Patent No. 5,006,528, (‘528 Patent) which covers aripiprazole and expires in April 2015 (including the additional six-month pediatric exclusivity period). Aripiprazole is
comarketed by the Company and Otsuka in the U.S. as

Abilify*

. A non-jury trial in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey (NJ District Court) against Teva/Barr and Apotex was completed in August 2010. In November 2010, the NJ
District Court upheld the validity and enforceability of the ‘528 Patent, maintaining the main patent protection for

Abilify*

in the U.S. until April 2015. The NJ District Court also ruled that the defendants’ generic aripiprazole
product infringed the ‘528 Patent and permanently enjoined them from engaging in any activity that infringes the ‘528 Patent, including marketing their generic product in the U.S. until after the patent (including the six-month pediatric
extension) expires. Sandoz, Synthon, Sun and Zydus are also bound by the NJ District Court’s decision. In December 2010, Teva/Barr and Apotex appealed this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit). In May
2012, the Federal Circuit affirmed the NJ District Court’s decision. In June 2012, Apotex filed a petition for rehearing

en banc

which was denied

.

In December 2012, the United States Supreme Court denied Apotex’s Petition for
a Writ of Certiorari requesting an appeal of the Federal Circuit decision, which concluded the matter.

Atripla*

In April 2009, Teva filed an abbreviated New Drug Application (aNDA) to manufacture and market a generic version of

Atripla*

.

Atripla*

is a single tablet three-drug regimen combining the Company’s

Sustiva

and Gilead’s

Truvada*

. As of this time, the Company’s U.S. patent rights covering

Sustiva

’s composition
of matter and method of use have not been challenged. Teva sent Gilead a Paragraph IV certification letter challenging two of the fifteen Orange Book-listed patents for

Atripla*

.

Atripla*

is the product of a joint venture between the
Company and Gilead. In May 2009, Gilead filed a patent infringement action against Teva in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY). In January 2010, the Company received a notice that Teva has amended its aNDA and is
challenging eight additional Orange Book-listed patents for

Atripla*

. In March 2010, the Company and Merck, Sharp & Dohme Corp. (Merck) filed a patent infringement action against Teva also in the SDNY relating to two U.S.
Patents which claim crystalline or polymorph forms of efavirenz. In March 2010, Gilead filed two patent infringement actions against Teva in the SDNY relating to six Orange Book-listed patents for

Atripla*

. Trial is expected in 2013. It is
not possible at this time to reasonably assess the outcome of these lawsuits or their impact on the Company.

Baraclude

In August 2010, Teva filed an aNDA to manufacture and market generic versions of Baraclude. The Company received a
Paragraph IV certification letter from Teva challenging the one Orange Book-listed patent for Baraclude, U.S. Patent No. 5,206,244 (the ‘244 Patent). In September 2010, the Company filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the U.S.
District Court for the District of Delaware (Delaware District Court) against Teva for infringement. In February 2013, the Delaware District Court ruled against the Company and invalidated the ‘244 Patent. The Company will appeal the Delaware
District Court’s decision and is evaluating all other legal options. Upon final FDA approval of its aNDA, Teva could launch its generic product. There could be a rapid and significant negative impact on U.S. sales of Baraclude beginning in
2013. U.S. net sales of Baraclude were $241 million in 2012.

In June 2012, the Company filed a patent infringement lawsuit
against Sandoz following the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification letter challenging the same Orange-Book listed patent. The parties have requested that the case be dismissed. In February 2013, the parties filed a stipulation of dismissal and the
case has been dismissed.


Sprycel

In September 2010, Apotex filed an aNDA to manufacture and market generic versions of

Sprycel

. The Company received a Paragraph IV certification letter from Apotex challenging the four Orange
Book listed patents for

Sprycel

, including the composition of matter patent. In November 2010, the Company filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the NJ District Court against Apotex for infringement of the four Orange Book listed patents
covering

Sprycel

, which triggered an automatic 30-month stay of approval of Apotex’s aNDA. In October 2011, the Company received a Paragraph IV notice letter from Apotex informing the Company that it is seeking approval of generic
versions of the 80 mg and 140 mg dosage strengths of

Sprycel

and challenging the same four Orange Book listed patents. In November 2011, BMS filed a patent infringement suit against Apotex on the 80 mg and 140 mg dosage strengths in the NJ
District Court. This case has been consolidated with the suit filed in November 2010. Trial is currently scheduled for September 2013. Discovery in this matter is ongoing. It is not possible at this time to reasonably assess the outcome of this
lawsuit or its impact on the Company.

Sustiva

–

EU

In January 2012, Teva obtained a European marketing authorization for Efavirenz Teva 600 mg tablets. In February 2012, the Company and
Merck filed lawsuits and requests for injunctions against Teva in the Netherlands, Germany and the U.K. for infringement of Merck’s European Patent No. 0582455 and Supplementary Protection Certificates expiring in November 2013. As of
December 2012, requests for injunctions have been granted in the U.K. and denied in the Netherlands and Germany. The Company and Merck are appealing the denial of the request for injunction in the Netherlands. It is not possible at this time to
reasonably assess the outcome of these lawsuits or their impact on the Company.

GENERAL COMMERCIAL LITIGATION

Clayworth Litigation

As
previously disclosed, the Company, together with a number of other pharmaceutical manufacturers, was named as a defendant in an action filed in California Superior Court in Oakland,

James Clayworth et al. v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, et
al

., alleging that the defendants conspired to fix the prices of pharmaceuticals by agreeing to charge more for their drugs in the U.S. than they charge outside the U.S., particularly Canada, and asserting claims under California’s
Cartwright Act and unfair competition law. The plaintiffs sought trebled monetary damages, injunctive relief and other relief. In December 2006, the Court granted the Company and the other manufacturers’ motion for summary judgment based on the
pass-on defense, and judgment was then entered in favor of defendants. In July 2008, judgment in favor of defendants was affirmed by the California Court of Appeals. In July 2010, the California Supreme Court reversed the California Court of
Appeal’s judgment and the matter was remanded to the California Superior Court for further proceedings. In March 2011, the defendants’ motion for summary judgment was granted and judgment was entered in favor of the defendants. The
plaintiffs appealed that decision and the California Court of Appeals affirmed summary judgment for the defendants. In October 2012, the plaintiffs filed a petition seeking review by the California Supreme Court which was denied in November 2012.

Remaining Apotex Matters Related to

Plavix

*

As previously disclosed, in November 2008, Apotex filed a lawsuit in New Jersey Superior Court entitled,

Apotex Inc., et al. v. sanofi-aventis, et al

., seeking payment of $60 million, plus
interest calculated at the rate of 1% per month from the date of the filing of the lawsuit, until paid, related to the break-up of a March 2006 proposed settlement agreement relating to the-then pending

Plavix*

patent litigation against
Apotex. In April 2011, the New Jersey Superior Court granted the Company’s cross-motion for summary judgment motion and denied Apotex’s motion for summary judgment. Apotex appealed these decisions and the New Jersey Appellate Division
reversed the grant of summary judgments. The case has been remanded back to the Superior Court for additional proceedings. It is not possible at this time to reasonably assess the outcome of this lawsuit or its impact on the Company.

In January 2011, Apotex filed a lawsuit in Florida State Court, Broward County, alleging breach of contract relating to the May 2006
proposed settlement agreement with Apotex relating to the then pending

Plavix*

patent litigation. Apotex is seeking damages for the amount of profits it alleges it would have received from selling its generic clopidogrel bisulfate for
somewhere between 8 and 11.5 months had the May 2006 agreement been approved by regulators. Discovery has concluded. The Company moved for summary judgment which was denied in November 2012. The case is now scheduled for a trial beginning in March
2013. It is not possible at this time to reasonably assess the outcome of this lawsuit or its impact on the Company.

PRICING, SALES AND
PROMOTIONAL PRACTICES LITIGATION AND INVESTIGATIONS

Abilify*

Federal Subpoena

In January 2012, the Company received a subpoena from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York
requesting information related to, among other things, the sales and marketing of

Abilify*

. It is not possible at this time to assess the outcome of this matter or its potential impact on the Company.


Abilify*

State Attorneys General Investigation

In March 2009, the Company received a letter from the Delaware Attorney General’s Office advising of a multi-state coalition
investigating whether certain

Abilify*

marketing practices violated those respective states’ consumer protection statutes. It is not possible at this time to reasonably assess the outcome of this investigation or its potential impact on
the Company.

Abilify*

Co-Pay Assistance Litigation

In March 2012, the Company and its partner Otsuka were named as co-defendants in a putative class action lawsuit filed by union health and
welfare funds in the SDNY. Plaintiffs are challenging the legality of the

Abilify*

co-pay assistance program under the Federal Antitrust and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations laws, and seeking damages. The Company and Otsuka
have filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. It is not possible at this time to reasonably assess the outcome of this litigation or its potential impact on the Company.

AWP Litigation

As previously disclosed, the Company, together with a
number of other pharmaceutical manufacturers, has been a defendant in a number of private class actions as well as suits brought by the attorneys general of various states. In these actions, plaintiffs allege that defendants caused the Average
Wholesale Prices (AWPs) of their products to be inflated, thereby injuring government programs, entities and persons who reimbursed prescription drugs based on AWPs. The Company remains a defendant in two state attorneys general suits pending in
state courts around the country having settled the lawsuits brought by the Mississippi and Louisiana Attorneys General. Beginning in August 2010, the Company was the defendant in a trial in the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania (Commonwealth
Court), brought by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. In September 2010, the jury issued a verdict for the Company, finding that the Company was not liable for fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation; however, the Commonwealth Court judge issued a
decision on a Pennsylvania consumer protection claim that did not go to the jury, finding the Company liable for $28 million and enjoining the Company from contributing to the provision of inflated AWPs. The Company has moved to vacate the decision
and the Commonwealth has moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, which the Commonwealth Court denied. The Company has appealed the decision to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.

Qui Tam Litigation

In March 2011, the Company was served with an unsealed
qui tam complaint filed by three former sales representatives in California Superior Court, County of Los Angeles. The California Department of Insurance has elected to intervene in the lawsuit. The complaint alleges the Company paid kickbacks to
California providers and pharmacies in violation of California Insurance Frauds Prevention Act, Cal. Ins. Code § 1871.7. Discovery is ongoing. It is not possible at this time to reasonably assess the outcome of this lawsuit or its impact on the
Company.

PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION

The Company is a party to various product liability lawsuits. As previously disclosed, in addition to lawsuits, the Company also faces unfiled claims involving its products.

Plavix*

As
previously disclosed, the Company and certain affiliates of Sanofi are defendants in a number of individual lawsuits in various state and federal courts claiming personal injury damage allegedly sustained after using

Plavix*

. Currently, more
than 2,000 claims are filed in state and federal courts in various states including California, Illinois, New Jersey, and New York. The defendants terminated the previously disclosed tolling agreement effective as of September 1, 2012. In
February 2013, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation granted the Company and Sanofi’s motion to establish a multidistrict litigation to coordinate federal pretrial proceedings in

Plavix

* product liability and related cases. It
is not possible at this time to reasonably assess the outcome of these lawsuits or the potential impact on the Company.

Reglan*

The Company is one of a number of defendants in numerous lawsuits, on behalf of approximately 2,700 plaintiffs,
claiming personal injury allegedly sustained after using

Reglan*

or another brand of the generic drug metoclopramide, a product indicated for gastroesophageal reflux and certain other gastrointestinal disorders. The Company, through its
generic subsidiary, Apothecon, Inc., distributed metoclopramide tablets manufactured by another party between 1996 and 2000. It is not possible at this time to reasonably assess the outcome of these lawsuits or the potential impact on the Company.
The resolution of these pending lawsuits is not expected to have a material impact on the Company.


Hormone Replacement Therapy

The Company is one of a number of defendants in a mass-tort litigation in which plaintiffs allege, among other things, that various hormone therapy products, including hormone therapy products formerly
manufactured by the Company (

Estrace

*, Estradiol,

Delestrogen*

and

Ovcon*

) cause breast cancer, stroke, blood clots, cardiac and other injuries in women, that the defendants were aware of these risks and failed to warn
consumers. The Company has agreed to resolve the claims of approximately 400 plaintiffs. As of February 2013, the Company remains a defendant in approximately 35 actively pending lawsuits in federal and state courts throughout the U.S. All of the
Company’s hormone therapy products were sold to other companies between January 2000 and August 2001. The resolution of these remaining lawsuits is not expected to have a material impact on the Company.

Byetta* and Bydureon*

Amylin, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (see “—Note 4. Acquisitions”), and Lilly are co-defendants in product liability litigation related to

Byetta* and Bydureon

*. As
of February 2013, there were approximately 120 separate lawsuits pending on behalf of approximately 575 plaintiffs in various courts in the U.S. The vast majority of these cases have been brought by individuals who allege personal injury sustained
after using

Byetta*

, primarily pancreatitis, and, in some cases, claiming alleged wrongful death. Of these, the Company has agreed in principle to resolve the claims of over 300 plaintiffs. The majority of cases are pending in California
state court, where the Judicial Council has granted Amylin’s petition for a “coordinated proceeding” for all California state court cases alleging harm from the alleged use of

Byetta*

. Amylin and Lilly are currently
scheduled for trial in one single-plaintiff case in the second quarter of 2013. We cannot reasonably predict the outcome of any lawsuit, claim or proceeding. However, given that Amylin has product liability insurance coverage for existing
claims and future related claims involving

Byetta*

, it is expected the amount of damages, if any, will not be material to the Company.

BMS-986094

In August
2012, the Company announced that it had discontinued development of BMS-986094, an investigational compound which was being tested in clinical trials to treat the hepatitis C virus infection due to the emergence of a serious safety issue. To date,
five lawsuits have been filed against the Company in Texas State Court by plaintiffs, which have been removed to Federal Court, alleging that they participated in the Phase II study of BMS-986094 and suffered injuries as a result thereof. We
have an agreement in principle to resolve four of the five filed claims and the vast majority of claims that have surfaced to date in this matter. In total, slightly fewer than 300 patients were administered the compound at various doses and
durations as part of the clinical trials. The resolution of the remaining lawsuit and any other potential future lawsuits is not expected to have a material impact on the Company.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS

As previously reported, the Company is a party
to several environmental proceedings and other matters, and is responsible under various state, federal and foreign laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), for certain costs of investigating
and/or remediating contamination resulting from past industrial activity at the Company’s current or former sites or at waste disposal or reprocessing facilities operated by third-parties.

CERCLA Matters

With
respect to CERCLA matters for which the Company is responsible under various state, federal and foreign laws, the Company typically estimates potential costs based on information obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or counterpart
state or foreign agency and/or studies prepared by independent consultants, including the total estimated costs for the site and the expected cost-sharing, if any, with other “potentially responsible parties,” and the Company accrues
liabilities when they are probable and reasonably estimable. The Company estimated its share of future costs for these sites to be $72 million at December 31, 2012, which represents the sum of best estimates or, where no best estimate can
reasonably be made, estimates of the minimal probable amount among a range of such costs (without taking into account any potential recoveries from other parties).

New Brunswick Facility – Environmental & Personal Injury Lawsuits

Since May 2008, over 250 lawsuits have been filed against the Company in New Jersey Superior Court by or on behalf of current and former residents of New Brunswick, New Jersey who live or have lived
adjacent to the Company’s New Brunswick facility. The complaints either allege various personal injuries damages resulting from alleged soil and groundwater contamination on their property stemming from historical operations at the New
Brunswick facility, or are claims for medical monitoring. A portion of these complaints also assert claims for alleged property damage. In October 2008, the New Jersey Supreme Court granted Mass Tort status to these cases and transferred them to the
New Jersey Superior Court in Atlantic County for centralized case management purposes. The Company intends to defend itself vigorously in this litigation. Discovery is ongoing. Since October 2011, over 100 additional cases have been filed in New
Jersey Superior Court and removed by the Company to United States District Court, District of New Jersey. It is not possible at this time to reasonably assess the outcome of these lawsuits or the potential impact on the Company.


North Brunswick Township Board of Education

As previously disclosed, in October 2003, the Company was contacted by counsel representing the North Brunswick, NJ Board of Education
(BOE) regarding a site where waste materials from E.R. Squibb and Sons may have been disposed from the 1940’s through the 1960’s. Fill material containing industrial waste and heavy metals in excess of residential standards was discovered
during an expansion project at the North Brunswick Township High School, as well as at a number of neighboring residential properties and adjacent public park areas. In January 2004, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) sent
the Company and others an information request letter about possible waste disposal at the site, to which the Company responded in March 2004. The BOE and the Township, as the current owners of the school property and the park, are conducting and
jointly financing soil remediation work and ground water investigation work under a work plan approved by the NJDEP, and have asked the Company to contribute to the cost. The Company is actively monitoring the clean-up project, including its costs.
To date, neither the school board nor the Township has asserted any claim against the Company. Instead, the Company and the local entities have negotiated an agreement to attempt to resolve the matter by informal means, and avoid litigation. A
central component of the agreement is the provision by the Company of interim funding to help defray cleanup costs and assure the work is not interrupted. The Company transmitted interim funding payments in December 2007 and November 2009. The
parties commenced mediation in late 2008; however, those efforts were not successful and the parties moved to a binding allocation process. The parties are expected to conduct fact and expert discovery, followed by formal evidentiary hearings and
written argument. Hearings likely will be scheduled for mid-to-late 2013. In addition, in September 2009, the Township and BOE filed suits against several other parties alleged to have contributed waste materials to the site. The Company does not
currently believe that it is responsible for any additional amounts beyond the two interim payments totaling $4 million already transmitted. Any additional possible loss is not expected to be material.

OTHER PROCEEDINGS

Italy
Investigation

In July 2011, the Public Prosecutor in Florence, Italy (Italian Prosecutor) initiated a criminal
investigation against the Company’s subsidiary in Italy (BMS Italy). The allegations against the Company relate to alleged activities of a former employee who left the Company in the 1990s. The Italian Prosecutor also had requested interim
measures that a judicial administrator be appointed to temporarily run the operations of BMS Italy. In October 2012, the parties reached an agreement to resolve the request for interim measures which resulted in the Italian Prosecutor withdrawing
the request and this request was accepted by the Florence Court. It is not possible at this time to assess the outcome of the underlying investigation or its potential impact on the Company.

SEC Germany Investigation

In October 2006, the SEC informed the Company
that it had begun a formal inquiry into the activities of certain of the Company’s German pharmaceutical subsidiaries and its employees and/or agents. The SEC’s inquiry encompasses matters formerly under investigation by the German
prosecutor in Munich, Germany, which have since been resolved. The Company understands the inquiry concerns potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The Company is cooperating with the SEC.

FCPA Investigation

Note 23. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Collaboration with The Medicines Company

In February 2013, BMS and The Medicines Company entered into a global license and two year collaboration regarding

Recothrom

, a recombinant thrombin for use as a topical hemostat to control
non-arterial bleeding during surgical procedures (previously acquired by BMS in connection with its acquisition of ZymoGenetics in 2010). Net sales of

Recothrom

were $67 million in 2012. In connection with the collaboration, The Medicines
Company will be responsible for all sales, distribution, marketing and certain regulatory matters relating to

Recothrom,

and BMS will be responsible for the exclusive supply of the product. Certain assets were transferred to The Medicines
Company at the start of the collaboration period, primarily the

Recothrom

Business License Agreement and other regulatory assets. BMS retained all other assets related to

Recothrom

including the patents, trademarks and inventory.


The collaboration expires in February 2015 at which time The Medicines Company has the right
to purchase the remaining assets of the business held by BMS at a price determined based on a multiple of sales (plus the cost of any remaining inventory held by BMS at that time). If the option is not exercised, all assets previously transferred to
The Medicines Company during the collaboration period revert back to BMS.

BMS received $115 million at the start of the
collaboration period, which will be allocated to the license and other rights transferred to The Medicines Company and the written option, which will be recorded as an option liability at fair value. The allocation will be based on the estimated
fair value of the elements after considering various market factors and the estimated excess of the fair value of the business over the potential purchase price if the option to purchase is exercised. Changes in the estimated fair value of the
option liability will be recognized in the results of operations. The remaining amount of proceeds received upon entering into the collaboration will be recognized as alliance revenue throughout the term of the collaboration. BMS will also recognize
alliance revenue during the collaboration period for tiered royalties and supply of product. BMS will provide certain information technology, regulatory, order processing, distribution and other transitional services in exchange for a fee during a
period up to six months commencing at the start of the collaboration.

Agreement to enter into Collaboration with Reckitt Benckiser
Group plc

In February 2013, BMS and Reckitt Benckiser Group plc (RBL) agreed to enter into a license and three year
collaboration regarding several over-the-counter-products sold primarily in Mexico and Brazil. The transaction is expected to close during the first or second quarter of 2013, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. Net
sales of these products were approximately $100 million in 2012.

In connection with the collaboration, RBL will be
responsible for all sales, distribution, marketing and certain regulatory matters and BMS will be responsible for the exclusive supply of the products. Certain limited assets are expected to be transferred to RBL at the start of the collaboration
period, primarily the market authorization, as well as the employees directly attributed to the business. BMS will retain all other assets related to the business including the patents, trademarks and inventory during the collaboration period.

Upon expiration of the collaboration, RBL will have the right to purchase the remaining assets of the business held by BMS at
a price determined based on a multiple of sales (plus the cost of any remaining inventory held by BMS at that time). If the option is not exercised, all assets previously transferred to RBL during the collaboration period revert back to BMS.

BMS is expected to receive proceeds of $482 million at the start of the collaboration period which will be allocated to the
license and other rights transferred to RBL and the written option, which will be recorded as an option liability at fair value. The allocation will be based on the estimated fair value of the elements after considering various market factors.
Changes in the estimated fair value of the option liability will be recognized in the results of operations. The remaining amount of proceeds received upon entering into the collaboration will be recognized as alliance revenue throughout the term of
the collaboration. BMS will also recognize alliance revenue during the collaboration period for tiered royalties and supply of product. BMS will also provide certain information technology, regulatory, order processing, distribution and other
transitional services in exchange for a fee during a period up to six months commencing at the start of the collaboration.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Bristol-Myers Squibb Company

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”)
as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Bristol-Myers
Squibb Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 15, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of
Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of December 31, 2012, management carried out an evaluation, under the
supervision and with the participation of its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e).
Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that as of December 31, 2012, such disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the chief executive
officer and chief financial officer, management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 based on the framework in “Internal Control—Integrated Framework” issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As permitted by SEC guidance, we excluded Amylin from management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012. Amylin’s financial
statement amounts constituted 23% of total assets (including $6.2 billion of acquired developed technology rights and in-process research and development) and 1% of total net sales of the Company’s consolidated financial statement amounts and a
pre-tax loss of $270 million as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012. Based on that assessment, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective at December 31, 2012 to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of its financial reporting and the preparation of its financial statements for external purposes in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. Due to its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Deloitte & Touche LLP,
an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Company’s financial statements included in this report on Form 10-K and issued its report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2012, which is included herein.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

In August 2012, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (the Company) completed its acquisition of Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Amylin) which
represents a material change in the internal control over financial reporting since management’s last assessment of effectiveness. Amylin’s operations utilize separate information and accounting systems and processes and it was not
possible to complete an evaluation and review of the internal controls over financial reporting since the completion of the acquisition. Management intends to complete its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
for Amylin within one year of the acquisition date. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting in the fourth quarter of 2012 that have or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Bristol-Myers Squibb Company

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”)
as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As described in Management’s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Amylin”), which was acquired on August 8, 2012 and whose financial statement
amounts constitute 23% of total assets (including $6.2 billion of acquired developed technology rights and in-process research and development) and 1% of total net sales of the Company’s consolidated financial statement amounts and a pre-tax
loss of $270 million as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Amylin. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s
principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2012, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated
financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012 of the Company and our report dated February 15, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
