SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS
- -----------------------------------------

Bristol-Myers Squibb, for the most part, purchases the principal raw
materials and supplies used in each industry segment in the open market.
Substantially all such materials are obtainable from a number of sources so
that the loss of any one source of supply would not have a material adverse
effect on the Company.


PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES
- --------------------------------

The Company owns or is licensed under a number of patents in the United
States and foreign countries covering products, principally in the
pharmaceuticals and medical devices segments, and has also developed many
brand names and trademarks for products in each industry segment.  The
Company considers the overall protection of its patent, trademark and license
rights to be of material value and acts to protect these rights from
infringement.  The Company believes that no single patent or license is of
material importance in relation to the business as a whole.


COMPETITION, DISTRIBUTION AND CUSTOMERS
- ---------------------------------------

The markets in which Bristol-Myers Squibb competes are generally broad based,
heavily competitive and include many competitors.  The principal means of
competition utilized to market the products of Bristol-Myers Squibb include
quality, service, price and product performance.  The products of the
pharmaceuticals segment and the medical devices segment are promoted on a
national and international basis in medical journals and directly to the
medical profession.  The Company is also utilizing direct-to-consumer
advertising for a number of its pharmaceutical products.  Most of the other
products of Bristol-Myers Squibb are generally advertised and promoted on a
national and international basis through the use of television, radio, print
media, consumer offers, and window and in-store displays.  Bristol-Myers
Squibb's products are principally sold to the wholesale and retail trade both
nationally and internationally.  Certain products of the pharmaceuticals and
medical devices segments are also sold to other drug manufacturers, hospitals
and the medical profession.  None of the segments is dependent upon a single
customer, or a few customers, such that the loss of any one or more would
have a material adverse effect on the segment.






RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
- ------------------------

Research and development is essential to Bristol-Myers Squibb's businesses,
particularly to the Pharmaceuticals Segment.  Management continues to place
great emphasis on these activities. Pharmaceutical research and development
is carried out by the Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute
which has major facilities in Princeton, Hopewell and New Brunswick, New
Jersey; and Wallingford, Connecticut. Pharmaceutical research and development
is also carried out at various other facilities in the United States and in
Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom.

Bristol-Myers Squibb spent $1,385 million in 1997, $1,276 million in 1996 and
$1,199 million in 1995 on company sponsored research and development
activities.  Pharmaceutical research and development spending, as a percentage
of pharmaceutical sales, was 12.0% in 1997 compared to 12.3% in 1996 and 12.9%
in 1995.


REGULATION
- ----------

Most aspects of the Company's business are subject to some degree of
government regulation in the countries in which its operations are conducted.
The Company's policy is to comply fully with all regulatory requirements
applying to its products and operations.  For some products, and in some
countries, government regulation is significant and, in general, there is a
trend to more stringent regulation.  The Company devotes significant time,
effort and expense addressing the extensive governmental regulatory
requirements applicable to its business.  Governmental regulatory actions can
result in the recall or seizure of products, suspension or revocation of the
authority necessary for the production or sale of a product, and other civil
and criminal sanctions.

In the United States, the drug, medical device, diagnostic, food and cosmetic
industries in which the Company operates have long been subject to regulation
by various federal, state and local agencies, primarily as to product
manufacture, safety, efficacy, advertising and labeling.  Assuring compliance
with appropriate laws and regulations requires increasing expenditures of time
and resources.

In addition, governmental bodies in the United States as well as other
countries have expressed concern about costs relating to health care and, in
some cases, have focused attention on the pricing of drugs and on appropriate
drug utilization.  Government regulation in these areas already exists in some
countries and may be expanded significantly in the United States and other
countries in the future.

While the Company is unable to predict the extent to which its business may
be affected by future regulatory developments, it believes that its
substantial experience dealing with governmental regulatory requirements and
restrictions on its operations throughout the world and its development of new
and improved products should enable it to compete effectively within this
environment.

Bristol-Myers Squibb employed approximately 53,600 people at December 31,
1997.

Squibb's operations.  There are currency restrictions relating to repatriation

Item 3.                    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

Breast Implant Litigation
- -------------------------

Reference is made to Note 16 Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K Annual
Report.

As of December 31, 1997, approximately 23,000 domestic and 1,300 foreign
breast implant recipients were plaintiffs in lawsuits pending in federal and
state courts in the United States and in certain courts in Canada and
Australia.  Of the 23,000 domestic plaintiffs, about 12,300 have opted out of
the class action settlement described below.  The remaining 10,700 plaintiffs
have chosen to participate in the settlement, and their lawsuits are expected
to be dismissed.  Some 400 foreign breast implant recipients have opted out
of the Revised Settlement but the opt-out period has not yet expired for
foreign women.  Only those suits filed by plaintiffs who have opted out of
the class action settlement may proceed in the United States.  Appeals
related to the Revised Settlement are pending.

Other manufacturers of breast implants, as well as suppliers of component
parts and other parties, are also defendants in the majority of these cases.
Some of these plaintiffs have sued numerous manufacturers without specifying
the manufacturer of the implants involved.

In addition to individual suits, the Company has been named as a defendant,
together with other defendants, in a purported class action brought on behalf
of children allegedly exposed to silicone in utero and through breast milk.
(FEUER, ET AL., V. MCGHAN, ET AL., U.S.D.C, E. Dist. NY, 93-0146.)   The
suit, which has not been certified as a class action, names all breast
implant manufacturers as defendants and seeks to establish a medical
monitoring fund.  On April 11, 1996, a class action on behalf of all women in
the Canadian province of British Columbia was certified in the provincial
court of British Columbia on the single issue of whether silicone gel breast
implants are reasonably fit for their intended purpose (HARRINGTON V. DOW
CORNING CORPORATION ET AL., Supreme Court, British Columbia, C954330).  A
previously certified class action lawsuit entitled IN RE: LOUISIANA BREAST
IMPLANT CLASS ACTION (previously SPITZFADEN, ET AL. VS. DOW CORNING CORP., ET
AL.), No. 92-2589, was decertified by the trial court in December 1997 and is
not expected to proceed as a class action.

The Company is a participant in a class action settlement approved by the
Honorable Sam C. Pointer, Jr., Chief Judge of the United States District
Court for the Northern District of Alabama (LINDSEY, ET AL., V. DOW CORNING,
ET AL., CV-94-P-11558-S), before whom all federal breast implant cases were
consolidated for pretrial purposes.  On December 22, 1995, Judge Pointer
approved a revised settlement program (Revised Settlement) for resolution of
claims seeking damages for personal injuries from allegedly defective breast
implants.  The Revised Settlement arises out of a class action settlement
approved by the Court on September 1, 1994.  On January 16, 1996, the
Company, Baxter Healthcare Corporation and Baxter International
(collectively, Baxter), and Minnesota, Mining and Manufacturing Company (3M)
(hereinafter, the Settling Defendants) each paid $125 million into a court-
established fund as an initial reserve to pay claims under the Revised
Settlement.  In 1997, the Company made additional contributions to the court-
established fund totaling approximately $190 million.  McGhan Medical
Corporation and Union Carbide Corporation are also parties to the Revised
Settlement.





The fifteen-year Revised Settlement program provides benefits to those breast
implant recipients who have had at least one breast implant manufactured by
one of the Settling Defendants (or their predecessors or subsidiaries).
Several kinds of benefits are available for eligible participants with breast
implants made by companies affiliated with Bristol-Myers Squibb, Baxter and
3M: (1) for current claimants, compensation generally ranging from $10,000 to
$50,000 based on disease and disability definitions of the original
settlement, plus supplemental benefits of an additional $15,000 to $50,000
for claimants with ruptured implants; (2) for current claimants seeking
higher benefits and for other registrants, compensation ranging from $75,000
to $250,000 based on more stringent disease and disability definitions (Long-
Term Benefits); and (3) although the Settling Defendants are not recommending
removal of implants absent some specific medical reason, a $3,000 payment for
those class members (other than late registrants) who seek removal of
implants.  In addition, current claimants are eligible for an advance payment
of $5,000, and other registrants are eligible for an advance payment of
$1,000.  For current claimants, benefits would be payable regardless of the
number of claimants seeking compensation, regardless of the total dollar
value of approved claims, and regardless of the outcome of appeals from the
order approving the settlement.  For other registrants, benefits would be
subject to an aggregate $755 million limit for all participating companies
over the fifteen-year life of the program.  The Company's individual
aggregate limit for such benefits is $400 million.  In the event the dollar
value of the future claims subject to the limit exceeds this amount,
claimants may be afforded additional opt-out rights but without the right to
assert punitive or other statutory multiple damage claims.  The Company's
obligations to make payments under the Revised Settlement are not affected by
the number of class members electing to opt out of the settlement or the
number of class members making claims under it.  However, the Company's
obligations to fund Long-Term Benefits are cancelable if certain provisions
of the Revised Settlement are disapproved on appeal.

The Revised Settlement was the subject of an appeal filed by certain foreign
breast implant recipients.  In November 1996, the Settling Defendants settled
that appeal, and the benefits of the Revised Settlement were extended, with
certain modifications, to foreign breast implant recipients.  Pursuant to the
settlement, the Settling Defendants paid (on an equal basis) an aggregate of
$25 million into a court-approved settlement fund as an initial reserve for
payment of foreign claims.

Approximately 380,000 domestic class members (with implants of all
manufacturers, not just MEC, Baxter and 3M) registered with the original
settlement approved in 1994.  Around 88,000 of these class members have
indicated that they received at least one breast implant manufactured by MEC
or a related company.  Of these 88,000 registrants, 14,300 have opted out of
the Revised Settlement;  6,300 of these have proved to the satisfaction of
the claims office that they received a breast implant of MEC or a related
company, while the remaining 8,000 opt-outs have indicated their belief (but
have not proved) that they received an MEC breast implant.  The 14,300 opt-
outs who have or claim to have MEC implants are among the 44,800 domestic
registrants (with implants of all manufacturers) who opted out of the Revised
Settlement.  The Company has identified approximately 10,800 persons from
among the 44,800 opt-outs (with implants of all defendants, not just MEC) as
plaintiffs in lawsuits against it.  An as yet undetermined number of these
10,800 plaintiffs do not have MEC implants and their claims against the
Company are expected to be dismissed.  An additional 1,570 plaintiffs with
claims based upon MEC implants remain from among domestic class members who




previously opted out of the settlement originally approved in 1994.  Because
the opt-out period is essentially over for domestic class members, the number
of opt-outs is not expected to increase materially.  However, because of
continuing uncertainties, it is still not possible to predict on any precise
basis the total number of women with MEC implants who will pursue lawsuits
against the Company.

The cost of the settlement is dependent upon complex and varying factors,
including the number of class members that participate, the kinds of claims
asserted and approved under the settlement, and their dollar value.  In light
of the continuing uncertainties attendant to these and other factors, it is
not possible to achieve any precision at this time in estimating the cost of
the settlement to the Company.

In May of 1996, the Company, together with other Settling Defendants, entered
into a $50 million settlement of claims asserted by certain health insurers
based upon payments made or benefits provided by insurers and represented
health plans to participating registrants that allegedly involve or relate to
silicone gel breast implants.  The Company has paid $20.2 million to the
settlement, which extinguishes the potential claims of the majority of the
U.S. commercial and non-governmental health care insurer market against both
the defendants and settlement class members.

In July of 1995, the Company entered into a $20.5 million (U.S. funds) class
action settlement with plaintiff representatives in the provinces of Ontario
and Quebec.  The class includes persons who have or had MEC breast implants
and who reside in Ontario and Quebec or who received their MEC implants
there.  The settlement, which had minimal opt-outs, has been approved by the
provincial courts of Ontario and Quebec.

The Company's insurers were notified of the breast implant claims and the
Revised Settlement, and generally reserved their rights or declined to
confirm coverage.  The Company has reached settlements with many of the
insurers (generally in connection with coverage litigation filed by the
Company in Texas state court).  The settlement agreements provided cash or
confirmed coverage.  Legal proceedings remain unresolved against some of the
insurers.

The cost to the Company of resolving opt-out claims is subject to a number of
complex uncertainties.  Primary among them is the difficulty of estimating
with any precision the quantity and quality of such claims.  While there have
been large judgments, defendants have won more trials than they have lost,
and in 1996 and 1997, the Company's trial experience was highly favorable.
The Company has maintained throughout this litigation that breast implants do
not cause disease and medical and scientific data support the Company's
position.  The Company's view has found strong support in the December 1996
decision of a federal judge in Oregon, who ruled to exclude the testimony of
plaintiffs' experts concerning a causal link between silicone gel breast
implants and systemic illness on the ground that it fails to satisfy
standards for reliability under current Supreme Court guidelines.  In
addition, a science panel appointed by Judge Pointer is in the process of
reviewing the scientific literature regarding any relation between breast
implants and disease, and is expected to report its findings in 1998.   The
results of continuing medical research and a variety of additional factors,
including the success of other legal defenses and the success of the Revised
Settlement program, might substantially affect the cost of resolving opt-out
cases.






In the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company recorded a charge of $500 million
before taxes ($310 million after taxes) in respect of breast implant cases.
The charge consisted of $1.5 billion for potential liabilities and expenses,
offset by $1 billion of expected insurance proceeds.  In the fourth quarters
of 1994 and 1995, the Company recorded additional special charges of $750
million before taxes ($488 million after taxes) and $950 million before taxes
($590 million after taxes), respectively, related to breast implant product
liability claims.  Although the cost of the Revised Settlement and the
ongoing litigation cannot at present be predicted with any reasonable degree
of precision, the Company, based on the information set forth above and on
related estimates, continues to believe that previously established reserves
should be adequate to address these claims.

Infant Formula Matters
- ----------------------

The Company, one of its subsidiaries, and others are or have been defendants
in a number of antitrust actions in various states filed on behalf of
purported statewide classes of indirect purchasers of infant formula products
and by the Attorneys General of Louisiana, Minnesota and Mississippi,
alleging a price fixing conspiracy and other violations of state antitrust or
deceptive trade practice laws and seeking penalties and other relief.  The
Company has previously reported reaching settlements and receiving final
court approval in the majority of these cases.  The only open cases are in
Louisiana and Missouri.  On November 6, 1997, the court in Louisiana
dismissed the plaintiffs' case.  The plaintiffs are appealing that dismissal.
In Missouri, the Company has a motion to dismiss pending. The Company
believes that these actions are without merit and that their ultimate
disposition will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's results
of operations, liquidity or consolidated financial position.

Prescription Drug Litigation
- ----------------------------

As of December 31, 1997, the Company is a defendant in over 100 actions
brought against the Company and more than 30 other pharmaceutical
manufacturers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy benefit managers in various
federal district courts by certain chain drugstores, supermarket chains and
independent drugstores, suing either individually or as a representative of
a nationwide class of retail pharmacies that has been certified.  These
cases, which have been coordinated for pretrial purposes in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, seek treble damages and
injunctive relief on account of an alleged antitrust conspiracy concerning
the pricing and marketing of brand name prescription drugs in violation of
the Sherman Act; individual retailer plaintiffs also assert claims of
unlawful price discrimination under the Robinson-Patman Act.  Discovery has
been completed with respect to claims concerning the alleged Sherman Act
violations.  Completion of additional discovery with respect to Robinson-
Patman Act claims against the Company has been stayed.  It is estimated that
the class members who have not opted out represent approximately two-thirds
of retail pharmacy purchases of brand name prescription drugs during the
alleged damages period.  As of May 1, 1996, the Company, without admitting
any wrongdoing, reached an amended agreement to settle the class action.  On
May 30, 1997, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit
dismissed appeals challenging the District Court's approval of the amended
class action settlement.  On October 29, 1997, the class settlement became
final.  Trial in the class case against the manufacturer and wholesaler
defendants who have not settled is scheduled for September 14, 1998, with
trial in the actions brought by the individual retailer plaintiffs to follow.
The largest opt-out retailer plaintiffs have purported to quantify their





Sherman Act damage claims against the defendants, including the Company,
asserting damages aggregating approximately $2.4 billion before trebling.  On
November 20, 1997, two large retail chains, Eckerd Corporation and American
Drug Stores, initiated similar actions in the Northern District of Illinois
against several manufacturer and wholesaler defendants, including the
Company.  On August 15, 1997, the Seventh Circuit ruled on consolidated
appeals from several District Court rulings.  The Appeals Court reversed the
District Court's denial of summary judgment to the manufacturer defendants,
including the Company, on the overcharge damages claims based on plaintiffs'
indirect purchases from wholesalers of defendant manufacturers' drugs.
However, the Court of Appeals also reversed the District Court's grant of
summary judgment to the wholesaler defendants in the class action and stated
that class and individual plaintiffs might be able to recover overcharge
damages on indirect purchases from wholesalers if they demonstrated that
wholesalers participated in the alleged Sherman Act violations.  After
remand, the District Court granted the individual plaintiffs leave to amend
their complaints to join the wholesalers as defendants.  Class action cases
brought by retail pharmacies in state courts against similar defendants
including the Company and alleging similar claims under state law have been
filed in California, Alabama, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Mississippi.  Final
settlements have been approved in the Wisconsin and Minnesota class actions.
The Mississippi court has ruled that the case may not proceed as a class
action, but has refused to dismiss the claims of named plaintiffs.  Class
action cases brought by consumers in state courts against similar defendants
including the Company and alleging similar claims under state law have been
brought in Alabama, California, Washington, New York, Arizona, the District
of Columbia, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Kansas, Florida,
Tennessee and North Carolina.  Four of these state consumer cases were
removed to federal court and transferred to the consolidated proceedings in
the Northern District of Illinois.  These four cases have recently been
remanded to state court and all the consumer class actions are now in state
court.  The consumer actions brought in Washington and New York have been
dismissed; an appeal is pending in New York.  A consumer class has been
certified in the District of Columbia case, while class certification has
been denied in the Maine, Michigan and Minnesota consumer cases.  Plaintiffs
in Minnesota responded to the denial of class certification by filing a new
consumer class action seeking only injunctive relief on August 14, 1997.  In
July 1996, the Company received a subpoena from the Federal Trade Commission
(FTC) in an investigation it is conducting to determine whether U.S.
pharmaceutical manufacturers have engaged in unfair methods of competition by
engaging in unlawful concerted activities on prices of pharmaceutical
products.  On May 27, 1997, the FTC served a second subpoena and a Civil
Investigative Demand (CID) on the Company for information and documents.  The
Company responded to this CID and has completed its document production.  On
December 31, 1997, the FTC requested additional documents.  The Company
believes that the above-described actions are without merit and that their
ultimate disposition will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's
results of operations, liquidity or consolidated financial position.

Environmental Matters
- ---------------------

The Company, together with others, is a party to, or otherwise involved in,
a number of proceedings brought by the Environmental Protection Agency or
comparable state agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) or comparable state laws
directed at the cleanup of hazardous waste sites.  While it is not possible
to predict with certainty the outcome of these cases, the Company believes
that the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material





adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, liquidity or
consolidated financial position.

Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

Summary

In 1997, Bristol-Myers Squibb achieved record levels of sales, earnings and
earnings per share. Worldwide sales grew to $16.7 billion, an 11% increase
over 1996.  Domestic sales, which represent 58% of worldwide sales, increased
14% to $9.6 billion, while international sales increased 7% to $7.1 billion.
Exchange rate fluctuations had an unfavorable effect of 3% on worldwide sales
and 8% on international sales.  Sales growth resulted from a 14% increase due
to volume with no changes overall from pricing activity.  In 1997,
significant contributions to the Company's sales growth were made by the
Company's most important products, many of which experienced double- and even
triple-digit sales growth on a worldwide basis.

Earnings before income taxes increased 12% to $4,482 million in 1997, net
earnings increased 12% to $3,205 million, basic earnings per share increased
13% to $3.22 and diluted earnings per share increased 12% to $3.14.  Net
earnings and basic earnings per share have increased at compound annual
growth rates of 12% and 13%, respectively, over the past 10 years.

Bristol-Myers Squibb's financial position remains strong.  At December 31,
1997, the Company held $1.8 billion in cash, time deposits and marketable
securities.  Cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.5 billion and
continued to be the primary source of funding to finance dividend
distributions of $1.5 billion and treasury stock repurchases of $1.2 billion.
Dividends per common share were $1.52 in 1997, increasing from $1.50 per
share paid in 1996.  The Company's payout ratio, calculated as dividends per
common share over basic earnings per common share, were 47.2%, 52.8% and
57.6%, in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively, excluding the 1995 special
charge and provision for restructuring.  In December 1997, the Company
announced another dividend increase, the twenty-sixth consecutive year that
dividends have increased.  The 1998 indicated annual payment is $1.56 per
share.  Bristol-Myers Squibb's strong financial position is evidenced further
by its triple-A credit rating from both Moody's and Standard & Poor's, making
Bristol-Myers Squibb one of only seven U.S. companies with this distinction.

In 1997, Bristol-Myers Squibb established its long-term strategic objective
to be the number one company in earnings per share growth within its
competitive universe.  To achieve this objective, the Company is making
strategic investments behind a number of high priority projects.  The
Company's top priority project is to become the most productive, respected
and innovative pharmaceutical research and development organization in the
world.  Other high priority projects focus on high growth products in fast
growing markets, including PRAVACHOL*, TAXOL*(R) (paclitaxel), GLUCOPHAGE and
HERBAL ESSENCES*, as well as enhancing the balanced strength of its core
businesses.  During 1997, increases were made in advertising and promotion
expenditures, sales force personnel and research and development facilities
and personnel to help ensure the success of these high priority projects.

Total equity market capitalization was $94 billion as of December 31, 1997,
a 72.3% increase over last year.  Total return to stockholders, share price
appreciation together with reinvested dividends, was 77.0% for 1997, which
compares favorably to the 33.4% return of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index.





Employment levels at December 1997 increased to 53,600 from 51,200 at
December 1996, with increases in the pharmaceutical sales force and increases
due to acquisitions.

During the year, the Company made a number of strategic acquisitions.  In
January 1998, the Company completed the acquisition of Redmond Products,
Inc., a leading hair care manufacturer in the United States which markets
well-known products including AUSSIE Mega Shampoo, AUSSIE 3 Minute Miracle
Conditioner and AUSSIE Sprunch Spray, among others.  In Latin America, the
Company acquired Abeefe S.A., Peru's largest pharmaceutical manufacturer and
marketer of a broad range of prescription and nonprescription anti-infective,
respiratory, anti-inflammatory and dermatological products; CHOCO MILK*,
Mexico's leading milk-based nutritional supplement; and SAL DE UVAS PICOT*,
a leading effervescent antacid product.

Net Sales and Earnings

Worldwide sales increased 11% in 1997 to $16.7 billion, compared with
increases of 9% and 15% in 1996 and 1995, respectively.  The consolidated
sales growth resulted from a 14% increase due to volume, a 3% decrease due to
unfavorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations and no changes overall from
pricing activity.  In 1996, the 9% increase in sales reflected an 11%
increase due to volume, a 2% decrease due to unfavorable foreign exchange
rate fluctuations and no changes overall from pricing activity.  In 1995, the
15% increase in sales reflected a 13% increase due to volume, while price
increases and exchange rate fluctuations each contributed 1% to growth on a
worldwide basis.  Domestic sales increased 14% in 1997, and 10% in both 1996
and 1995, while international sales increased 7% in 1997, 9% in 1996 and 22%
in 1995.  In general, the businesses of the Company's industry segments are
not seasonal.

Net earnings and basic earnings per share in 1997 increased 12% to $3,205
million and 13% to $3.22 per share from $2,850 million and $2.84 per share in
1996.  1995 net earnings and basic earnings per share were $1,812 million and
$1.79 per share ($2,600 million and $2.57 per share excluding the 1995
provision for restructuring and special charge).  Diluted earnings per share
in 1997, 1996 and 1995 were $3.14, $2.80 and $1.78, respectively.  Net
earnings margins increased to 19.2% in 1997 from 18.9% in both 1996 and 1995,
excluding the 1995 charges.

The effective income tax rate on earnings before income taxes was 28.5% in
1997 compared to 29.0% and 24.6% in 1996 and 1995, respectively.  Excluding
the 1995 special charge and provision for restructuring, the effective income
tax rate on earnings before income taxes was 29.0% in 1995.  The lower 1997
effective income tax rate compared to 1996 and 1995 resulted from increased
income in lower tax rate jurisdictions.

As described in the notes to the financial statements, in the fourth quarter
of 1997, the Company divested Linvatec Corporation, its arthroscopy and
surgical powered instrument business, for $370 million, resulting in a gain
of $225 million before taxes, $140 million after taxes.  At the same time,
the Company recorded a provision for restructuring of $225 million before
taxes, $140 million after taxes.  The provision for restructuring primarily
relates to the consolidation of plants and facilities and related employee
termination costs.  In the fourth quarter of 1995, the Company recorded a
special charge to earnings of $950 million before taxes, $590 million after
taxes, or $.58 per common share, basic and diluted (see Note 16 -
Contingencies), as well as a provision for restructuring of $310 million
before taxes, $198 million after taxes.






Expenses

Total costs and expenses as a percentage of sales were 73.2% in 1997 compared
with 73.4% in both 1996 and 1995, excluding the 1995 special charge and
provision for restructuring.

As a percentage of sales, cost of products sold increased to 26.7% in 1997
from 26.3% in 1996, principally due to incremental low margin Oncology
Therapeutic Network sales, partially offset by increased sales of higher
margin promoted pharmaceutical products.  In 1996, cost of products sold as
a percentage of sales remained relatively unchanged at 26.3% compared to
26.4% in 1995.  Excluding 1996 acquisitions, cost of products sold as a
percentage of sales decreased to 25.5% in 1996 due to a favorable product mix
and manufacturing efficiencies.

Advertising and promotion expenses in support of new and existing products
increased 15% to $2,241 million in 1997 from $1,946 million in 1996, and as
a percentage of sales, increased to 13.5% from 12.9%, principally due to
increased spending on direct-to-consumer campaigns for several pharmaceutical
products as well as incremental advertising support of beauty care products.
In 1996, advertising and promotion expenses increased 18% from 1995 levels
primarily due to incremental spending in the Pharmaceuticals and Beauty Care
Segments, supporting direct-to-consumer campaigns and new product launches,
respectively.

Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 6% to $4,173 million
in 1997 from $3,925 million in 1996, and as a percentage of sales, decreased
to 25.0% in 1997 from 26.1% in 1996 and 26.7% in 1995 as a direct result of
the Company's productivity programs and higher sales volumes.

The Company's investment in research and development totaled $1,385 million
in 1997, an increase of 9% over 1996, and as a percentage of sales, decreased
to 8.3% in 1997 from 8.5% in 1996.  This spending level reflects the
Company's commitment to research over a broad range of therapeutic areas and
clinical development in support of new products.  The Company acquired a new
research facility in Hopewell, N.J., and announced its intention to hire
2,000 additional scientists over the next several years.  Over the past 10
years, research and development expenses have increased at a compound annual
growth rate of 10%.  In 1997, research and development spending dedicated to
the research and development of pharmaceutical products was 12.0% of
pharmaceutical sales compared to 12.3% and 12.9% in 1996 and 1995,
respectively.  During 1997, 1996 and 1995, the Company entered into a number
of research alliances, licensing agreements and biotechnology collaborations.
These agreements are providing important new products as well as early-stage
compounds for further development and new processes that will help the
Company screen for new drugs more effectively.

Business Segments

All five of the Company's business segments - Pharmaceuticals, Consumer
Medicines, Nutritionals, Medical Devices and Beauty Care - reported sales
increases, excluding foreign exchange, during the year.  By the end of 1997,
Bristol-Myers Squibb had 63 products with more than $50 million in annual
sales, 33 of which had more than $100 million in annual sales.





Sales in the Pharmaceuticals Segment, which is the Company's largest segment
at 59% of total Company, increased 15% to $9,932 million in 1997.  Sales
growth resulted from a 17% increase in volume and a 1% increase in selling
prices, offset by a 3% decrease due to the unfavorable effect of foreign
exchange rate fluctuations.  Domestic sales increased 23% and international
sales increased 13%, excluding foreign exchange, primarily due to volume
growth.

Sales of PRAVACHOL*, a cholesterol-lowering agent, and the Company's largest
selling product, were $1.4 billion, an increase of 34%.  Domestic sales
increased 39% to $875 million.  Results of the Long-term Intervention with
Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease (LIPID) trial showed PRAVACHOL* treatment
reduced consequences of coronary heart disease, including heart attack,
stroke and death, by 20% to 30%.  Sales of MONOPRIL*, a second generation
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with once-a-day dosing,
increased 28% to $328 million, with strong growth in both domestic and
international markets.  The Company and Sanofi S.A. received U.S. marketing
clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for irbesartan and
clopidogrel.  Irbesartan, sold as AVAPRO in the United States, is an
angiotensin II receptor blocker for the treatment of hypertension, and
clopidogrel, to be sold as PLAVIX in the United States, is a platelet
inhibitor for the reduction of stroke and heart attack in patients with
atherosclerosis.  AVAPRO was launched in the United States during the fourth
quarter, and PLAVIX is planned to launch in early 1998.  Sales of
cardiovascular drugs, the largest product group in the segment, increased 3%
to $2,905 million.  Due to the loss of patent exclusivity in several European
countries in the first quarter of 1997, and in the United States in February
1996, sales of captopril, an ACE inhibitor sold primarily under the trademark
CAPOTEN*, declined $296 million to $795 million.  Excluding CAPOTEN* sales,
cardiovascular drugs increased 22%.

Sales of anti-cancer drugs increased 23% to $2,420 million.  Sales of TAXOL*,
the Company's leading anti-cancer agent, increased 16% to $941 million.  In
June and September 1997, the Company was granted use patents in the United
States covering specific dosage regimes for TAXOL*, and in August 1997, the
FDA cleared TAXOL* for use in second-line treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi's
sarcoma.  Sales of PARAPLATIN*, which is used in combination therapy for the
treatment of ovarian cancer, increased 17%.  Sales in the Oncology
Therapeutics Network (OTN), a specialty distributor of anti-cancer medicines
and related products, acquired in October 1996, were $480 million.

Anti-infective drug sales were $2,235 million, an increase of 20% over the
prior year.  Strong growth was recorded for ZERIT* and VIDEX*, the Company's
two antiretroviral agents.  Sales of ZERIT*,  the Company's fastest growing
product, increased by $258 million, or 185% to $398 million, while sales of
VIDEX* grew 35% to $152 million.  In December 1997, ZERIT* became the most
commonly prescribed thymidine nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor in
HIV therapy in the United States, surpassing AZT.  In August 1997, ZERIT*
received approval from the European Union for use in combination therapy for
first-line treatment of HIV, and in January 1997, a new oral solution of
ZERIT*, representing a significant addition to the limited therapeutic
options available to treat HIV-infected infants and children, was introduced.
Sales of CEFZIL*, an oral cephalosporin used in the treatment of respiratory
infections, and MAXIPIME*, a fourth generation injectable cephalosporin, also
contributed to the growth of anti-infectives.






Sales of central nervous system drugs increased 26% to $955 million, due to
the strong growth of BUSPAR*, the Company's novel anti-anxiety agent, and
SERZONE*, an antidepressant that offers a low incidence of side effects.
Sales of BUSPAR* increased 20% to $443 million, while sales of SERZONE*
increased 70% to $185 million.  In May 1997, studies presented at an American
Psychiatric Association meeting demonstrated that SERZONE* increased sleep
efficiency in people suffering from depression.

GLUCOPHAGE, an oral medication for type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes
continued to experience strong growth, with sales increasing 74% to $579
million.  The Company has sponsored a public awareness program that offers
information to physicians and their patients on the proper management of type
2 diabetes, a serious undertreated medical condition that afflicts more than
15 million Americans. GLUCOPHAGE is the leading branded product in the United
States for this disease.

In 1996, Pharmaceuticals Segment sales increased 12% over 1995 levels.
Increases in sales of PRAVACHOL*, TAXOL*, PARAPLATIN*, ZERIT*, MONOPRIL*,
BUSPAR*, CEFZIL*, GLUCOPHAGE, SERZONE* and VIDEX* were partially offset by
decreases in sales of CAPOTEN*, due to the loss of patent exclusivity,
DURICEF*, QUESTRAN*, VEPESID* and ISOVUE*.

The margin on earnings before taxes decreased to 29.7% in 1997 from 30.4% in
1996 primarily due to increased investment in advertising and promotion
expenses in support of high priority products, and lower margin sales for
OTN. In 1996, the margin on earnings before taxes increased to 30.4% from
29.6% in 1995 due to a decrease, as a percentage of sales, in research and
development spending.

Sales in the Consumer Medicines Segment increased 6% to $1,351 million,
reflecting a 13% increase due to volume, a 6% decrease due to the unfavorable
effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and a 1% decrease in selling
prices.  International sales increased 6% (17% excluding the unfavorable
effect of foreign exchange), while domestic sales increased 5%.  Sales of
analgesic products increased 3% (9% excluding the effect of foreign
exchange), due to volume growth from EFFERALGAN* and ASPIRINE UPSA* from the
UPSA Group, as well as domestic growth of EXCEDRIN*.  In January 1998, the
Company received clearance from the FDA to market EXCEDRIN* Migraine, the
first and only medication for migraine headache pain available to consumers
without a prescription.   The SEA BREEZE* and KERI* lines of skin care
products also performed well, with strong growth in the Japanese marketplace.
VAGISTAT-1*, the first and only one-dose over-the-counter medication for
vaginal yeast infections, was introduced in April 1997.

In 1996, worldwide sales of Consumer Medicines increased 5% from 1995 levels,
(an increase of 11%, excluding foreign exchange), primarily due to increased
sales of EXCEDRIN*, BUFFERIN* and analgesics from the UPSA Group including
EFFERALGAN*, DAFALGAN* and ASPIRINE UPSA*.

The margin on earnings before taxes improved to 9.3% in 1997, from 7.7% in
1996 and 5.8% in 1995, as a result of efficiency gains due to productivity
programs.

Sales in the Nutritionals Segment increased 7% to $1,911 million, reflecting
a 10% increase due to volume, a 2% decrease due to the unfavorable effect of
foreign exchange rate fluctuations and a 1% decrease in selling prices.
International sales increased 15% (21% excluding the unfavorable effect of
foreign exchange), while domestic sales increased 1%.  Mead Johnson continues





to increase its worldwide and U.S. leadership position in the infant formula
market.  Total infant formula sales increased due to growth of NUTRAMIGEN*,
LACTOFREE* and PROSOBEE* special infant formulas.  Sales of ENFAMIL*, the
Company's largest selling infant formula, decreased 3% to $674 million
worldwide, while increasing 9% internationally to $167 million, excluding
foreign exchange.  BOOST* and SUSTACAL* adult nutritional beverages, and
ALACTA NF*, a nutritious beverage for preschool-age children sold outside the
U.S., also contributed to sales growth.

In 1996, worldwide sales of Nutritionals increased 13% from 1995 levels,
primarily due to increased sales of infant formulas, including ENFAMIL*, and
adult consumer nutritionals.

The margin on earnings before taxes improved to 21.1% in 1997, from 20.7% in
1996 and 19.9% in 1995, primarily due to higher sales volumes, improved
manufacturing efficiencies and gains due to productivity programs.

In the Medical Devices Segment, sales of $1,802 million reflected a 3%
decrease from prior year levels.  Volume gains of 2% were achieved, while
sales were impacted by a 1% decrease due to changes in selling prices and a
4% decrease due to the effect of foreign exchange.  International sales
remained constant (excluding the effect of foreign exchange, sales increased
8%), while domestic sales decreased 6%. The Company's ConvaTec division is
the worldwide market share leader in ostomy and advanced wound care products.
Sales of ostomy and wound care products increased 6% and 16%, respectively,
excluding foreign exchange.  The Company's Zimmer division continues to be
the world market share leader in knee and hip replacements.  Worldwide sales
of knee prosthetic joint implants increased 2%, excluding the effect of
foreign exchange, led by growth of the NEXGEN* Complete Knee Solution.  Hip
replacement sales decreased 4%, excluding the effect of foreign exchange.
Zimmer is restructuring to focus on its core businesses of orthopaedic
implants and fracture fixation devices.  As discussed in the notes to the
financial statements, the Company completed the sale of Linvatec Corporation,
its arthroscopy and surgical powered instruments business, in December 1997.
Also, as part of its restructuring, Zimmer announced a 10% reduction in its
domestic work force, as well as a restructuring of its European business.

In 1996, worldwide sales of Medical Devices declined by $46 million and 2%,
although excluding foreign exchange, remained at 1995 levels.  In 1995,
medical device sales increased 13% as a result of increased sales of knee
implants, and ostomy and wound care products.  Excluding the acquisition of
Calgon Vestal Laboratories, and a divestiture in 1994, sales increased 7% in
1995.

The margin on earnings before taxes in the Medical Devices Segment decreased
to 20.0% in 1997, from 22.5% in 1996 and 22.8% in 1995, due to price
decreases, lower sales volumes and incremental manufacturing costs in
connection with recently introduced products.

Sales in the Beauty Care Segment increased 16% in 1997 to $1,705 million,
reflecting a 16% increase due to volume, a 1% increase due to pricing and a
1% decrease due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.  Excluding the effect
of foreign exchange, international sales increased 28% over 1996, while
domestic sales increased 12%.  The Company's Clairol division is the number
one hair products company in the United States and continues to maintain its
market share leadership in U.S. haircolorings.  Sales of the Company's hair
care products were especially strong, increasing 36% in 1997, primarily due





to sales of the HERBAL ESSENCES* complete line of shampoos, conditioners,
styling aids and body wash, which increased 168% to $351 million, aided by
its launch into additional countries in 1997.  Sales of INFUSIUM 23* hair
care products also contributed to growth of hair care products.  In
September, Clairol launched DAILY DEFENSE*, a complete line of shampoos and
conditioners designed to purify and fortify hair to protect it from
environmental and styling stresses.  Also in September, the Company's Matrix
Essentials division launched VITAL NUTRIENTS*, an innovative hair care line
that provides micro-nutrients, daily protection and internal moisture
balance.  Haircoloring product sales increased 4%, benefiting from the
continued success of NICE  N EASY*, NATURAL INSTINCTS*, salon haircolorings
and HYDRIENCE*, which increased 86% following its launch into international
markets.

In 1996, sales in the Beauty Care Segment increased 13% from 1995 levels,
primarily due to increased sales of haircoloring, hair and skin care
products.

The margin on earnings before taxes in 1997 was 17.1% compared to 17.0% in
1996, and increased from 15.3% in 1995 primarily due to higher volumes and
productivity programs, offset by the cost of new product introductions and
other spending programs.

Geographic Areas

Bristol-Myers Squibb products are available in virtually every country in the
world; its largest markets are the United States, France, Japan, Germany and
Canada.

Sales in the U.S., net of inter-area sales, increased 14% in 1997.  Sales in
the Pharmaceuticals, Beauty Care and Nutritionals segments, comprised 59%,
12% and 11%, respectively, of the region's sales.  Products with strong
growth in the region included PRAVACHOL*, GLUCOPHAGE, ZERIT*, HERBAL
ESSENCES*, TAXOL*, BUSPAR*, PARAPLATIN*, NUTRAMIGEN*, BOOST* and incremental
sales from the OTN acquisition.  The margin on earnings before taxes
decreased to 24.5% in 1997 from 26.0% in 1996 primarily due to increases, as
a percentage of sales, in cost of products sold and advertising and promotion
expenses.  In 1996, sales in the U.S. increased 10%, net of inter-area sales,
primarily due to anti-cancer and anti-infective drugs from the
Pharmaceuticals Segment, infant formulas from the Nutritionals Segment and
haircoloring and hair care products from the Beauty Care Segment.  Strong
sales increases were achieved despite a 68% decline in sales of CAPOTEN*.
The margin on earnings before taxes increased to 26.0% in 1996 from 25.6% in
1995.

Sales in Europe, Mid-East and Africa, net of inter-area sales, increased 2%
(12% excluding foreign exchange).  Pharmaceuticals and Consumer Medicines,
which comprised nearly 73% of sales in the region, increased 10% and 17%,
respectively, excluding foreign exchange.  Products with strong growth in the
region included ZERIT*, PRAVACHOL*, TAXOL*, MAXIPIME*, EFFERALGAN*, PLUSSSZ*,
a vitamin-enriched effervescent drink, and the introductions of HERBAL
ESSENCES* and HYDRIENCE*.  Increases in sales of these products were
partially offset by decreases in sales of CAPOTEN* due to the loss of
exclusivity in several European countries in early 1997.  The margin on
earnings before taxes increased to 23.8% in 1997 from 21.9% in 1996 primarily
due to manufacturing efficiencies as a result of the Company's productivity
programs.  In 1996, sales in Europe, Mid-East and Africa, net of inter-area




sales, increased 8% (10% excluding foreign exchange), due to strong sales
growth of products from the Pharmaceuticals Segment including anti-cancer and
antiretroviral drugs, which were partially offset by decreases in sales of
CAPOTEN* and penicillins and from the Medical Devices Segment, including
ostomy and wound care products.  In the Nutritionals Segment, sales of
PLUSSSZ* and vitamins from the 1996 acquisition of Pharmavit, as well as
analgesic products in the Consumer Medicines Segment, contributed to sales
growth in the region.  The margin on earnings before taxes decreased to 21.9%
in 1996 from 22.7% in 1995.

Sales in Other Western Hemisphere countries, net of inter-area sales,
increased 25% in 1997 (26% excluding foreign exchange).  Pharmaceuticals,
which comprised nearly 66% of the region's sales, increased 22%.  Products
with strong growth included PRAVACHOL*, VIDEX*, ZERIT*, TAXOL*, introductory
sales of HYDRIENCE* and HERBAL ESSENCES*, and sales from the acquisitions of
CHOCO MILK* and SAL DE UVAS PICOT*.  The margin on earnings before taxes
increased to 14.2% in 1997 from 11.1% in 1996 reflecting improved gross
margins due to manufacturing efficiencies.  In 1996, sales in Other Western
Hemisphere countries increased 19% (25% excluding foreign exchange), due to
increased sales of cardiovascular, anti-cancer and anti-infective drugs from
the Pharmaceuticals Segment, infant formulas from the Nutritionals Segment,
and haircoloring and hair care products from the Beauty Care Segment.  Sales
of pharmaceutical products from the 1996 acquisition of Argentia S.A. also
contributed to sales growth in the region.  The margin on earnings before
taxes decreased to 11.1% in 1996 from 12.2% in 1995.

Sales in the Pacific region increased 5%, net of inter-area sales, (13%
excluding foreign exchange) in 1997.  Pharmaceuticals and Nutritionals
comprised 38% and 30%, respectively, of the region's sales.  Products with
strong growth included PRAVACHOL*, SEA BREEZE*, ZERIT*, TAXOL*, KERI*
products, ALACTA NF*, ENFAMIL* and the launch of HERBAL ESSENCES*.  The
margin on earnings before taxes decreased to 3.2% in 1997 from 4.4% in 1996
due to increases, as a percentage of sales, in cost of products sold and
sales force expenses.  In 1996, sales in the Pacific region, net of inter-
area sales, increased 2% (12% excluding foreign exchange), as a result of
increased sales from analgesics, infant formulas, school-age nutritional
beverages, skin care, anti-infective and cardiovascular drugs.  The margin on
earnings before taxes decreased to 4.4% in 1996 from 5.8% in 1995, primarily
as a result of increases, as a percentage of sales, in advertising and
promotion expenditures in support of new and existing products.

Financial Position

Cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable securities totaled
$1.8 billion at December 31, 1997, compared to $2.2 billion at both December
31, 1996 and 1995.  Working capital was $2.7 billion at December 31, 1997,
compared to $2.5 billion and $2.2 billion at December 31, 1996 and 1995,
respectively.  Cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable
securities, and the conversion of other working capital items are expected to
fund near-term operations of the Company.

In August 1997, the Company issued $300 million principal amount of 6.875%
Debentures due August 1, 2097, and in November 1996, the Company issued $350
million principal amount of 6.80% Debentures due November 15, 2026.  Proceeds
from the sale of these securities have been used for general corporate
purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, stock repurchase
programs, repayment or refinancing of borrowings, and acquisitions.




The Company is exposed to market risk, including changes in currency exchange
rates and interest rates.  To reduce financial risks, the Company enters into
certain derivative financial instruments where available on a cost effective
basis to hedge its underlying economic exposure.  These instruments are also
managed on a consolidated basis to efficiently net exposures and thus take
advantage of any natural offsets.

It is the Company's policy to hedge underlying economic exposures to reduce
foreign exchange and interest rate risk.  Derivative financial instruments
are not used for trading purposes.  Gains and losses on hedging transactions
are offset by gains and losses on the underlying exposures being hedged.

Foreign exchange option contracts and, to a lesser extent, forward contracts,
are used to hedge anticipated transactions.  The Company's primary foreign
currency exposures in relation to the U.S. dollar are the French franc,
Deutsche mark, Spanish peseta and Japanese yen.

The table below summarizes the Company's outstanding foreign exchange option
contracts as of December 31, 1997.  The fair value of option contracts, which
will change over time, is estimated based on forward currency rates and other
relevant market factors.  The fair value of option contracts should be viewed
in relation to the fair value of the underlying hedged transactions and the
overall reduction in exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates.

The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable
securities with various financial institutions.  These financial institutions
are located primarily in the U.S., Puerto Rico and Ireland, and Company
policy is designed to limit exposure to any one financial institution.

Cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable securities at
December 31, 1997 were denominated primarily in U.S. dollar instruments with
near-term maturities.  The average interest yield on cash and cash
equivalents was 5.6% at December 31, 1997 while interest yields on time
deposits and marketable securities averaged 5.1% at December 31, 1997.




Short-term borrowings and long-term debt at December 31, 1997 are denominated
primarily in U.S. dollars but also include French franc short-term borrowings
due to banks of $191 million and Japanese yen long-term debt of $171 million.
Disclosures related to short-term borrowings and long-term debt are included
in the notes to the financial statements.

Internally generated cash provided by operations was $2.5 billion in 1997,
$2.6 billion in 1996 and $2.5 billion in 1995.  Cash provided by operations
continued to be the Company's primary source of funds to finance operating
needs and expenditures for new plants and equipment.  As part of the
Company's ongoing commitment to improve plant efficiency and maintain
superior research facilities, the Company has invested nearly $1.9 billion in
capital expansion over the past three years.

Cash provided by operations was also used to pay dividends of over $4.5
billion over the past three years, to fund acquisitions at a cost of $920
million over the last three years, and to finance the share repurchase
program.  The Company's share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of
common stock from time to time in the open market or through private
transactions as market conditions permit.  During 1997, the Company purchased
16.8 million shares of common stock at a cost of $1,162 million, bringing the
total shares acquired since the program's inception to 123 million.  During
the past three years, the Company has repurchased 43 million shares at a cost
of $2.3 billion.

Return on Stockholder's Equity was 46.5% in 1997, 46.0% in 1996 and 45.1% in
1995, excluding the 1995 special charge and the provision for restructuring.

The Company will adopt recently issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 132, Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other
Postretirement Benefits, in 1998.  This statement does not change the
measurement or the recognition of pension and postretirement expenses.  It
eliminates certain current disclosures, and requires additional disclosures
or changes on the benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets.

Subsequent to year end, the Company entered into two revolving credit
facility agreements totaling $500 million.  They are available for use as
needed for general corporate purposes.

The Company has reviewed its information systems for YEAR 2000 compliance and
has initiated plans to remedy any deficiencies in a timely manner.  As a
result of the review and action plan, the Company believes the cost of such
remedial corrective actions are not material to the Company's financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        (dollars in millions)


Note 1  ACCOUNTING POLICIES
- ---------------------------

Basis of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and all of its
subsidiaries.

Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents primarily include
securities with a maturity of three months or less at the time of
purchase, recorded at cost, which approximates market.

Time Deposits and Marketable Securities - Time deposits and marketable
securities are available for sale and are recorded at fair value, which
approximates cost.

Inventory Valuation - Inventories are generally stated at average cost,
not in excess of market.

Capital Assets and Depreciation - Expenditures for additions, renewals
and betterments are capitalized at cost.  Depreciation is generally
computed by the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives
of the related assets.

Excess of Cost over Net Tangible Assets - The excess of cost over net
tangible assets received in business acquisitions is being amortized on
a straight-line basis over periods not exceeding 40 years.

Earnings Per Share - Basic earnings per common share are computed using
the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per common share are computed using the weighted
average number of shares outstanding during the year, plus the
incremental shares outstanding assuming the exercise of dilutive stock
options.

Each share of the Company's preferred stock is convertible into 8.48
shares of common stock and is callable at the Company's option.  The
reductions in the number of issued shares of preferred stock in 1997, 1996
and 1995 were due to conversions into shares of common stock.

Dividends per common share were $1.52 in 1997, $1.50 in 1996 and $1.48 in
1995.

Stock Compensation Plans
- ------------------------

Under the Company's stock option plans, officers, directors and key
employees may be granted options to purchase the Company's common stock
at no less than 100% of the market price on the date the option is
granted.  Options generally become exercisable in installments of 25% per
year on each of the first through the fourth anniversaries of the grant
date and have a maximum term of 10 years.  Additionally, the plans provide





                     BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY
               NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                         (dollars in millions)


for the granting of stock appreciation rights whereby the grantee may
surrender exercisable options and receive common stock and/or cash
measured by the excess of the market price of the common stock over the
option exercise price.  The plans also provide for the granting of
performance-based stock options to certain key executives.

Under the terms of the 1983 Stock Option Plan, as amended, additional
shares are authorized in the amount of 0.9% of the outstanding shares per
year through 2003 and incorporates the Company's long-term performance
award plan.

Under the TeamShare Stock Option Plan, all full-time employees, excluding
key executives, meeting certain years of service requirements are granted
options to purchase the Company's common stock at the market price on the
date the options are granted.  The Company has authorized 30,000,000
shares for issuance under the plan.  As of December 31, 1997, a total of
21,984,200 options were granted under the plan with generally 400 options
granted to each eligible employee.  Individual grants generally become
exercisable on or after the third anniversary of the grant date.

The Company's restricted stock award plan provides for the granting of up
to 6,000,000 shares of common stock to key employees, subject to
restrictions as to continuous employment except in the case of death or
normal retirement.  Restrictions generally expire over a five-year period
from date of grant.  Compensation expense is recognized over the
restricted period.  At December 31, 1997, a total of 1,253,352 shares were
outstanding under the plan.

The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations in accounting
for its plans.  Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized
for its stock-based compensation plans other than for restricted stock and
performance-based awards.  Had compensation cost for the Company's other
stock option plans been determined based upon the fair value at the grant
date for awards under these plans consistent with the methodology
prescribed under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Company's net income and
basic earnings per share would have been reduced by approximately $85
million, or $.09 per common share - basic and $.08 per common share -
diluted, in 1997, $55 million, or $.05 per common share, basic and diluted
in 1996 and $35 million, or $.03 per common share, basic and diluted in
1995.  The fair value of the options granted during 1997, 1996 and 1995
was estimated as $12.82 per common share, $8.51 per share and $6.47 per
share, respectively, on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-
pricing model with the following assumptions:

Note 11  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
- ------------------------------

Foreign exchange option contracts and, to a lesser extent, forward
contracts, are used to hedge anticipated transactions.

The Company has exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets
and liabilities, which approximated $2,070 million, $1,640 million and
$1,385 million at December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively,
primarily in Deutsche marks, French francs, Italian lire and Japanese
yen.  The Company mitigates the effect of these exposures through
third-party borrowings and foreign exchange forward contracts.

The risk of loss associated with the types of foreign exchange option
contracts entered into by the Company is limited to premium amounts
paid for the option contracts.  Premiums are deferred in Prepaid
expenses and amortized in the consolidated statement of earnings (in
the Other caption) over the time frame of the underlying hedged
transaction.  Gains and losses related to the option contracts, which
qualify as hedges of foreign currency anticipated transactions, are
recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions are recognized.
Gains and losses on foreign exchange forward contracts are recognized
in the basis of the underlying transaction being hedged.

The notional amounts of the Company's foreign exchange option
contracts at December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995 were $1,279 million,
$1,172 million and $1,126 million, respectively.

For measurement purposes, an annual rate of increase in the per capita
cost of covered health care benefits of 7.8% for participants under age
65 and 7.0% for participants age 65 and over was assumed for 1998; the
rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 5.0% in 2007 and to remain at
that level thereafter.  Increasing the assumed medical care cost trend
rates by 1 percentage point in each year would increase the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 1997 by $23 million
and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net
postretirement benefit expense for the year then ended by $2 million.  The
weighted-average discount rate used in determining the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation was 7.5% in 1997, 7.8% in 1996 and 7.3%
in 1995.

Plan assets principally consist of equity securities and fixed income
securities.  The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was
10.0% in 1997, 1996 and 1995.

Note 16  CONTINGENCIES
- ----------------------

Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings of a nature considered normal to
its businesses are pending against the Company and certain of its
subsidiaries.  The most significant of these are described below.
Reference is made to Item 3 Legal Proceedings in Part 1 of this Form 10-K
Annual Report.

Breast Implant Litigation
- -------------------------

As of December 31, 1997, approximately 24,000 persons were plaintiffs in
suits against the Company, its subsidiary, Medical Engineering Corporation
(MEC), and certain other subsidiaries, in federal and state courts in the
United States and in certain courts in Canada and Australia,  alleging
damages for personal injuries of various types resulting from
polyurethane-covered breast implants and smooth-walled breast implants.
The Company, MEC and certain other defendants are participants in a
settlement program originally approved on September 1, 1994, and revised
on December 22, 1995, by the Federal District Court in Birmingham,
Alabama.  About 11,000 of these plaintiffs are participating in the
revised settlement, and are expected to discontinue their lawsuits.
Separate class action settlements have been approved in the provincial
courts of Ontario and Quebec, and an agreement has been reached under
which other foreign breast implant recipients may settle their claims.

Approximately 380,000 domestic class members (with implants of all
manufacturers, not just MEC, Baxter and 3M) originally registered with the
revised settlement.  Around 88,000 of these class members have indicated
that they received at least one breast implant manufactured by MEC or a
related company.  Of these 88,000 registrants, 14,300 have opted out of
the revised settlement; 6,300 of these have proved to the satisfaction of
the claims office that they received a breast implant of MEC or a related
company, while the remaining 8,000 opt-outs have indicated their belief
(but have not proved) that they received an MEC breast implant.  The
14,300 opt-outs who have or claim to have MEC implants are among the
44,800 domestic registrants (with implants of all manufacturers) who opted
out of the revised settlement.  The Company has identified approximately
10,800 persons from among the 44,800 opt-outs (with implants of all
defendants, not just MEC) as plaintiffs in lawsuits against it.  An as yet
undetermined number of these 10,800 plaintiffs do not have MEC implants
and their claims against the Company are expected to be dismissed.  An
additional 1,570 claims based upon MEC implants remain from among domestic
class members who previously opted out of the settlement originally
approved in 1994.  Because the opt-out period is essentially over, the
number  of opt-outs in not expected to increase materially.  However,
because of continuing uncertainties, it is still not possible to predict
on any precise basis the total number of women with MEC implants who will
pursue lawsuits against the Company.

The cost of the settlement is dependent upon complex and varying factors,
including the number of class members that participate, the kinds of
claims approved and their dollar value.  The cost to the Company of

               NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                         (dollars in millions)


resolving opt-out claims is also subject to a number of complex uncertain-
ties in addition to the unknown quantity and quality of such claims. As
set forth in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, in 1995, 1996 and
1997, the Company paid substantial sums to settle litigation and opt-out
claims and for litigation expenses, as well as to the revised settlement.

In connection with breast implant product liability claims, the Company
recorded special charges in 1993 of $500 million before taxes, $310
million after taxes, or $.30 per common share, basic and diluted; in 1994
of $750 million before taxes, $488 million after taxes, or $.48 per common
share, basic and diluted; and in 1995 of $950 million before taxes, $590
million after taxes, or $.58 per common share, basic and diluted.  The
1993 special charge consisted of $1.5 billion (recorded as Product
Liability), offset by $1.0 billion of expected insurance proceeds
(recorded as Insurance Recoverable).

In light of the continuing uncertainties (including additional insurance
recoveries), the cost of the revised settlement and the ongoing litigation
cannot at present be predicted with any reasonable degree of precision.
However, the Company, based on the information set forth above and on
related estimates, continues to believe that previously established
reserves should be adequate to address these claims.

Other Actions
- -------------

The Company, one of its subsidiaries, and others are or have been
defendants in a number of antitrust actions in various states filed on
behalf of purported statewide classes of indirect purchasers of infant
formula products and by the Attorneys General of Louisiana, Minnesota and
Mississippi, alleging a price fixing conspiracy and other violations of
state antitrust or deceptive trade practice laws and seeking penalties and
other relief.  The Company has previously reported reaching settlements
and receiving final court approval in the majority of these cases.  The
only open cases are in Louisiana and Missouri. On November 6, 1997, the
court in Louisiana dismissed the plaintiffs' case.  The plaintiffs are
appealing that dismissal.  In Missouri, the Company has a motion to
dismiss pending.

As of December 31, 1997, the Company is a defendant in over 100 actions
brought against the Company and more than 30 other pharmaceutical
manufacturers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy benefit managers in various
federal district courts by certain chain drugstores, supermarket chains
and independent drugstores, suing either individually or as
representatives of a nationwide class of retail pharmacies that has been
certified.  These cases, which have been coordinated for pretrial
purposes, all seek treble damages and injunctive relief on account of
alleged antitrust violations in the pricing and marketing of brand name
prescription drugs.  The Company, without admitting any wrongdoing,
reached an amended agreement as of May 1, 1996, to settle the class
action, and that settlement has become final.  The largest opt-out
retailer plaintiffs have purported to quantify their damage claims against
the defendants, including the Company, asserting damages aggregating
approximately $2.4 billion before trebling.  Cases brought by retail




pharmacies in state court under state law alleging similar grounds are
proceeding in California, Alabama, Mississippi, Wisconsin and Minnesota;
the Wisconsin and Minnesota cases are subject to settlements.  Purported
class actions brought by consumers in state court under state law alleging
similar grounds have been brought in California, Washington, New York,
Arizona, Maine, Alabama, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, the District of
Columbia, Kansas, Florida, Tennessee and North Carolina.

While it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these
cases, it is the opinion of management that these lawsuits, claims and
proceedings which are pending against the Company are without merit or
will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's operating
results, liquidity or consolidated financial position.

To the Board of Directors
and Stockholders of
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company



In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the
index appearing under Item 14(a)(1) and (2) on page 59 present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Bristol-Myers
Squibb Company and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1997, 1996 and
1995, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the
years then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.
