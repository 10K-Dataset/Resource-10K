SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS
- -----------------------------------------

Bristol-Myers Squibb, for the most part, purchases the principal raw materials
and supplies used in each industry segment in the open market.  Substantially
all such materials are obtainable from a number of sources so that the loss of
any one source of supply would not have a material adverse effect on the
Company.


PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES
- --------------------------------

The Company owns or is licensed under a number of patents in the United States
and foreign countries covering products, principally in the medicines
and medical devices segments, and has also developed many brand
names and trademarks for products in each industry segment.  The Company
considers the overall protection of its patent, trademark and license rights
to be of material value and acts to protect these rights from infringement.
The Company believes that no single patent or license is of material
importance in relation to the business as a whole.





COMPETITION, DISTRIBUTION AND CUSTOMERS
- ---------------------------------------

The markets in which Bristol-Myers Squibb competes are generally broad based,
heavily competitive and include many competitors.  The principal means of
competition utilized to market the products of Bristol-Myers Squibb include
quality, service, price and product performance.  The pharmaceutical products
of the medicines segment and the products of the medical devices segment are
promoted on a national and international basis in medical journals and
directly to the medical profession.  The Company is also utilizing
direct-to-consumer advertising for a number of its pharmaceutical products.
Most of the other products of Bristol-Myers Squibb are generally advertised
and promoted on a national and international basis through the use of
television, radio, print media, consumer offers, and window and in-store
displays.  Bristol-Myers Squibb's products are principally sold to the
wholesale and retail trade both nationally and internationally.  Certain
products of the medicines and medical devices segments are also sold to other
drug manufacturers, hospitals and the medical profession.  None of the
segments is dependent upon a single customer, or a few customers, such that
the loss of any one or more would have a material adverse effect on the
segment.


RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
- ------------------------

Research and development is essential to Bristol-Myers Squibb's businesses,
particularly to the Medicines Segment.  Management continues to emphasize
leadership, innovation and productivity as strategies for success in the
Research Institute. Pharmaceutical research and development is carried out
by the Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute which has
major facilities in Princeton, Hopewell and New Brunswick, New Jersey; and
Wallingford, Connecticut. Pharmaceutical research and development is also
carried out at various other facilities in the United States and in Belgium,
France, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom.

Bristol-Myers Squibb spent $1,577 million in 1998, $1,385 million in 1997 and
$1,276 million in 1996 on Company sponsored research and development
activities.  Pharmaceutical research and development spending, as a percentage
of pharmaceutical sales, was 12.4% in 1998 compared to 12.0% in 1997 and 12.3%
in 1996.


REGULATION
- ----------

Most aspects of the Company's business are subject to some degree of
government regulation in the countries in which its operations are
conducted.  The Company's policy is to comply fully with all regulatory
requirements applying to its products and operations. For some products,
and in some countries, government regulation is significant and, in general,
there is a trend to more stringent regulation.  The Company devotes
significant time, effort and expense addressing the extensive governmental
regulatory requirements applicable to its business.  Governmental regulatory
actions can result in the recall or seizure of products, suspension or
revocation of the authority necessary for the production or sale of a product,
and other civil and criminal sanctions.

In the United States, the drug, medical device, diagnostic, food and cosmetic
industries in which the Company operates have long been subject to regulation
by various federal, state and local agencies, primarily as to product
manufacture, safety, efficacy, advertising and labeling.  Assuring compliance
with appropriate laws and regulations requires increasing expenditures of time
and resources.




In addition, governmental bodies in the United States as well as other
countries have expressed concern about costs relating to health care and, in
some cases, have focused attention on the pricing of drugs and on appropriate
drug utilization.  Government regulation in these areas already exists in some
countries and may be expanded significantly in the United States and other
countries in the future.

While the Company is unable to predict the extent to which its business may
be affected by future regulatory developments, it believes that its
substantial experience dealing with governmental regulatory requirements and
restrictions on its operations throughout the world and its development of
new and improved products should enable it to compete effectively within this
environment.



EMPLOYEES
- ---------

Bristol-Myers Squibb employed approximately 54,700 people at December 31, 1998.

conducting business abroad, including possible nationalization or

to time and their effects may be favorable or unfavorable on Bristol-Myers
Squibb's operations. There are currency restrictions relating to repatriation
of earnings in certain countries.

Item 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

Breast Implant Litigation
- -------------------------

Reference is made to Note 16 Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K Annual
Report.

The Company, together with its subsidiary, Medical Engineering Corporation
(MEC), and certain other companies, has been named as a defendant in a number
of claims and lawsuits alleging damages for personal injuries of various
types resulting from breast implants formerly manufactured by MEC or a related
company.  Of the more than 90,000 claims or potential claims against the
Company in direct lawsuits or through registration in the national class
action Revised Settlement Program (described below), most have been dealt with
through the Revised Settlement, other settlements, or trial.  As of January 1,
1999, the Company's contingent liability in respect of breast implant claims
was limited to residual unpaid Revised Settlement Program obligations and to
roughly 6,000 remaining opt-outs who have pursued or may pursue their claims
in court.

As of December 31, 1998, approximately 15,000 United States and 1,300 foreign
breast implant recipients were plaintiffs in lawsuits pending in federal and
state courts in the United States and in certain courts in Canada and
Australia.  These figures include the claims of plaintiffs that are in the
process of being settled and/or dismissed. In these lawsuits, about 10,200
U.S. and 400 foreign plaintiffs opted out of the Revised Settlement.  The
lawsuits of the 4,800 U.S. plaintiffs who did not opt out are expected to be
dismissed since these plaintiffs are among the estimated 74,000 women with MEC
implants who chose to participate in the nationwide settlement.  Of the
remaining opt-out plaintiffs, some have claims based upon products that were
not manufactured and sold by MEC; many others have claims that are in the
process of being settled.  Under the terms of the Revised Settlement Program,
additional opt-outs are expected to be minimal since the deadline for U.S.
class members to opt out has passed.  In addition, the Company's remaining
obligations under the Revised Settlement Program are limited because most
payments to "Current Claimants" (see below) have already been made, no
additional "Current Claims" may be filed without court approval, and payments
of claims to so-called "Other Registrants" and "Late Registrants" are limited
by the terms of the Revised Settlement Program.  The Company believes it will
be able to address remaining opt-out claims as well as expected remaining
obligations under the Revised Settlement Program within its reserves
described below.



Breast implants were manufactured by several companies, including MEC, which
the Company acquired in 1982. Until 1991, MEC manufactured two types of breast
implants, polyurethane-covered silicone breast implants and smooth-walled
silicone breast implants.  In these lawsuits, plaintiffs typically contend
that silicone in breast implants causes systemic disease and/or local
complications.  Some plaintiffs with polyurethane-covered silicone breast
implants contend that the polyurethane component causes injury, including
cancer.  Most of the disease claims involve non-specific complaints such as
chronic fatigue, aches and pains and other symptoms that commonly affect the
population at large.  Many women claim local complications such as rupture,
hardening or contracture, and disfigurement or scarring.  The plaintiffs
typically seek compensatory damages for alleged medical conditions and
emotional distress as well as punitive damages.  The defendants have based
their defense in part on the lack of credible scientific evidence that breast
implants cause disease.  Many large scale epidemiological studies have found
no connection between breast implants and the alleged diseases.  Defendants
also contend that warnings set forth in the product literature adequately
advised physicians and surgeons of the risks of local complications.

The Company is a participant in the national class action Revised Settlement
Program approved on December 22, 1995, by the Honorable Sam C. Pointer, Jr.,
Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District
of Alabama (Lindsey, et al., v. Dow Corning, et al., CV-94-P-11558-S), before
whom all federal breast implant cases were consolidated for pretrial purposes.
The Revised Settlement arises out of the class action settlement approved by
the Court on September 1, 1994.  All appeals from the Order approving the
Revised Settlement have been dismissed.  On January 16, 1996, the Company,
Baxter Healthcare Corporation and Baxter International (collectively, Baxter),
and Minnesota, Mining and Manufacturing Company (3M) (hereinafter, the
Settling Defendants) each paid $125 million into a court-established fund as
an initial reserve to pay claims under the Revised Settlement.  The Company
has made and will make additional contributions to the court-established fund.

The fifteen-year Revised Settlement provides benefits to those U.S. breast
implant recipients who have had at least one breast implant manufactured by
one of the Settling Defendants (or their related companies).  Several kinds
of benefits are available for eligible participants with breast implants made
by companies affiliated with the Company, Baxter and 3M:  (1) for Current
Claimants, compensation generally ranging from $10,000 to $50,000 based on
disease and disability definitions of the original settlement, plus
supplemental benefits of an additional $15,000 to $50,000 for claimants with
ruptured implants; (2) for Current Claimants seeking higher benefits and for
Other and Late Registrants, compensation ranging from $75,000 to $250,000
based on more stringent disease and disability definitions (Long-Term
Benefits); and (3) although the Settling Defendants are not recommending
removal of implants absent some specific medical reason, a $3,000 payment for
those class members (other than Late Registrants) who seek removal of implants.
Current Claimants are eligible for an advance payment of $5,000, and Other
Registrants are eligible for an advance payment of $1,000.  Other Registrants
who receive their $1,000 advance payment by June 15, 1999, are eligible for
an additional $2,500 payment if they relinquish their rights to further
benefits under the Revised Settlement and provide a full release of their
breast implant claims.  For Current Claimants, benefits are payable regardless
of the number of claimants seeking compensation, and regardless of the total
dollar value of approved claims.  For Other and Late Registrants, benefits are
subject to an aggregate $725 million limit for the three Settling Defendants
over the fifteen-year life of the program.  The Company's individual aggregate
limit for such benefits is $400 million.  In the event the dollar value of the
claims subject to the limit were to exceed this amount, claimants may be
afforded additional opt-out rights but without the right to assert punitive or
other statutory multiple damage claims.  The Company's obligations to make
payments under the Revised Settlement are not affected by the number of class
members electing to opt out of the settlement or the number of class members
making claims under it except to the extent of the above-mentioned dollar
limits.




In addition to individual suits and the Lindsey class action, the Company
continues as a defendant, together with other defendants, in two other class
action proceedings.  On April 11, 1996, a class action on behalf of all women
in the Canadian province of British Columbia was certified in the provincial
court of British Columbia on the single issue of whether silicone gel breast
implants are reasonably fit for their intended purpose (Harrington v. Dow
Corning Corporation et al., Supreme Court, British Columbia, C954330).  Also,
there is an action pending on behalf of children allegedly exposed to silicone
in utero and through breast milk (Feuer, et al., v. McGhan, et al., U.S.D.C.,
E.D.N.Y., 93-0146), which has not been certified as a class action, and which
names all breast implant manufacturers as defendants and seeks to establish a
medical monitoring fund.

The Company entered into several other settlements of breast implant-related
claims.  In July of 1995, the Company entered into a $20.5 million
(U.S. funds) class action settlement with plaintiff representatives in the
provinces of Ontario and Quebec.  The class includes persons who have or had
MEC breast implants and who reside in Ontario and Quebec or who received their
MEC implants there.  The settlement, which had minimal opt-outs, has been
approved by the provincial courts of Ontario and Quebec.  In May of 1996, the
Company, together with other Settling Defendants in the Revised Settlement
Program, entered into a $50 million settlement of claims asserted by certain
health insurers based upon payments made or benefits provided by insurers and
represented health plans to participating registrants that allegedly involve
or relate to silicone gel breast implants.  The Company has contributed $22.5
million to the settlement, which extinguishes the potential claims of the
majority of the U.S. commercial and non-governmental health care insurer
market against both the defendants and settlement class members.  In November
1996, the benefits of the Revised Settlement were extended, with certain
modifications, to foreign breast implant recipients.  Pursuant to this
settlement, the Settling Defendants paid (on an equal basis) an aggregate of
$25 million into a court-approved settlement fund as an initial reserve for
payment of foreign claims.

The Company's insurers were notified of the breast implant claims and the
Revised Settlement, and a number reserved their rights or declined coverage.
The Company reached settlement with many of these insurers in connection with
coverage litigation filed by it in state court in Texas.  In 1993, the Company
offset its breast implant product liability special charges by $1.0 billion of
expected insurance proceeds (recorded as Insurance Recoverable). The Company
now believes that it will obtain additional amounts of insurance proceeds
above that amount and has recorded an additional Insurance Recoverable in the
fourth quarter of 1998 of approximately $100 million.

While there have been a few large judgments, defendants have won more trials
than they have lost, and the Company's trial experience has been mostly
favorable.  The Company has maintained throughout this litigation that breast
implants do not cause disease, and medical and scientific data support the
Company's position.  The Company's view has found support in the trial courts.
Courts in several states have ruled to exclude the testimony of plaintiffs'
experts concerning a causal link between silicone gel breast implants and
systemic illness on the ground that it fails to satisfy standards for
reliability under current U.S. Supreme Court guidelines.  A national science
panel of four independent experts appointed by Judge Pointer has recently
issued its unanimous report, based on a comprehensive review of the medical
and scientific literature, that there is no evidence linking silicone breast
implants and systemic disease.  The Company intends to dispose of the claims
of remaining opt-outs by continuing to implement its plan to settle cases at
values it deems acceptable, and to wage a vigorous defense, including taking
cases to trial, of those cases that do not settle at such values.

In the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company recorded a charge of $500 million
before taxes ($310 million after taxes) in respect of breast implant cases.
The charge consisted of $1.5 billion for potential liabilities and expenses,
offset by $1.0 billion of expected insurance proceeds.  In the fourth quarters
of 1994 and 1995, the Company recorded additional special charges of $750
million before taxes ($488 million after taxes) and $950 million before taxes
($590 million after taxes), respectively, related to breast implant product
liability claims.  In the fourth quarter of 1998, the Company recorded an
additional special charge to earnings in the amount of $800 million before
taxes and increased its insurance receivable in the amount of $100 million,
resulting in a net charge to earnings of $433 million after taxes in respect
of breast implant product liability claims.




Infant Formula Matters
- ----------------------

The Company, one of its subsidiaries, and others have been defendants in a
number of antitrust actions in various states filed on behalf of purported
statewide classes of indirect purchasers of infant formula products and by
the Attorneys General of Louisiana, Minnesota and Mississippi, alleging a
price fixing conspiracy and other violations of state antitrust or deceptive
trade practice laws and seeking penalties and other relief.  The Company has
resolved all of these cases, except for a private action in Louisiana.  On
November 6, 1997, the court in Louisiana dismissed the plaintiffs' case.  The
plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for
the Fifth Circuit. The Company believes that this action is without merit and
that its ultimate disposition will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company's results of operations, liquidity or consolidated financial position.

Prescription Drug Litigation
- ----------------------------

As of December 31, 1998, the Company is a defendant in over 100 actions
brought against the Company and more than 30 other pharmaceutical
manufacturers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy benefit managers in various
federal district courts by certain chain drugstores, supermarket chains and
independent drugstores, suing individually.  These cases, which have been
coordinated for pretrial purposes in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois, seek treble damages and injunctive relief on
account of an alleged antitrust conspiracy concerning the pricing and
marketing of brand name prescription drugs in violation of the Sherman Act
and also assert claims of unlawful price discrimination under the Robinson-
Patman Act.  The Company and a number of other pharmaceutical manufacturers
previously settled a class action case brought against it and other
pharmaceutical manufacturers and wholesalers that made similar claims under
the Sherman Act and has also settled claims brought by some of the in
dividual plaintiffs who opted out of the retailer class action.  On August 4,
1998, the court denied motions made in the individual retailer cases by
manufacturer defendants, including the Company, for partial summary judgment
dismissing the plaintiffs' Sherman Act damage claims to the extent based on
purchases from wholesalers that occurred more than four years prior to
November 20, 1997, when the court permitted those plaintiffs to amend their
complaints to name wholesalers as defendants.  On December 15, 1998, the
United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit declined to accept an
interlocutory appeal from the ruling denying partial summary judgment.  A
trial in the class action case against the manufacturer and wholesaler
defendants who had not settled the class action commenced on September 14,
1998, and ended on November 30, 1998, when the court granted the defendants'
motion for a directed verdict.  The class plaintiffs have appealed from that
ruling.  Cases brought by retail pharmacies in state court under state law
alleging similar grounds are pending in Alabama, California and Mississippi.
Settlements of cases brought as class actions in state court on behalf of
consumers in those states have received final approval in Arizona, the
District of Columbia, Florida, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New York,
North Carolina and Wisconsin; settlements of such cases are subject to final
court approval in California and Tennessee.  A purported class action on
behalf of consumers in Alabama and eight other states that was brought in
state court in Alabama against the Company and other pharmaceutical
manufacturers remains pending; on December 29, 1998, activity in that case
was stayed pending resolution of certain appeals, including an appeal in the
Alabama retailer case, by the Supreme Court of Alabama.  On June 16, 1998, a
purported class action on behalf of consumers in Tennessee and 12 other states
was filed in state court in Tennessee against the Company and other
pharmaceutical manufacturers.  On July 6, 1998, a class consisting of
consumers in Tennessee and the other states was conditionally certified,
without notice to the defendants.  By order dated November 13, 1998, the court
in that action denied the defendants' motion to vacate the conditional class
certification and also stayed all further proceedings pending further order of
the court.  On March 9, 1999, a purported class action on behalf of consumers
in North Dakota was brought in state court in North Dakota against the Company
and other pharmaceutical manufacturers.  In the fourth quarter of 1998, the
Company recorded a special charge to earnings in the amount of $100 million
before taxes ($62 million after taxes) in respect of prescription drug
litigation.



Environmental Matters
- ---------------------


The Company, together with others, is a party to, or otherwise involved in,
a number of proceedings brought by the Environmental Protection Agency or
comparable state agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) or comparable state laws
directed at the cleanup of hazardous waste sites.  While it is not possible
to predict with certainty the outcome of these cases, the Company believes
that the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material
adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, liquidity or
consolidated financial position.

Item 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

Summary

In 1998, Bristol-Myers Squibb achieved record levels of sales, with all four
of the Company's business segments reporting sales increases, excluding the
effects of foreign exchange and divestitures. Worldwide sales grew to $18.3
billion, a 9% increase over 1997.  Domestic sales, which represent 61% of
worldwide sales, increased 15% to $11.1 billion, while international sales
increased 2% to $7.2 billion.  Sales growth resulted from a 10% increase due
to volume and a 2% increase from changes in selling prices.  Exchange rate
fluctuations had an unfavorable effect of 3% on worldwide sales and 7% on
international sales, primarily due to Asian and Latin American currencies.

In 1998, the Company's most important products, most of which experienced
double-digit sales increases on a worldwide basis, made significant
contributions to the Company's sales growth.  Two products, PRAVACHOL* and
TAXOL*(R) (paclitaxel), exceeded $1 billion in sales for 1998.  An additional
seven products exceeded over a half billion dollars in annual sales.  By the
end of 1998, Bristol-Myers Squibb had 64 product lines with more than $50
million in annual sales, 36 of which had more than $100 million in annual
sales.

Earnings before income taxes, excluding the 1998 special charge, increased 13%
to $5.1 billion in 1998.  Net earnings, on this basis, increased 13% to $3.6
billion; basic and diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $1.83 and
$1.79, respectively.  Net earnings and diluted earnings per share, excluding
special charges, have both increased at a compound annual growth rate of 10%
over the past five years.

Bristol-Myers Squibb's financial position remains strong.  At December 31,
1998, the Company held $2.5 billion in cash, time deposits and marketable
securities.  Cash provided by operating activities reached an all time high
of $4.1 billion.  Returns to shareholders included dividend distributions of
$1.6 billion and treasury stock repurchases of $1.6 billion.  Dividends per
common share were $.78 in 1998, increasing from $.76 per share paid in 1997.
The Company's payout ratio was 43%, 47% and 53% of net income in 1998, 1997
and 1996, respectively, excluding the 1998 special charge.  In December 1998,
the Company announced another dividend increase, the 27th consecutive year
that dividends have increased.  The 1999 indicated annual payment is $.86 per
share, a 10% increase over 1998.  Bristol-Myers Squibb's strong financial
position is evidenced further by its triple-A credit rating from both Moody's
and Standard & Poor's, making Bristol-Myers Squibb one of only eight U.S.
industrial companies with this distinction.

Bristol-Myers Squibb's priorities over the past five years have been focused
on growth, productivity and a dynamic operating culture.  In 1997, the Company
established a long-term strategic objective to be the number one company in
earnings per share growth year after year within its competitive universe.
To help achieve this objective, the Company is making strategic investments
behind a number of high priority projects.  During the year, progress was made
in a number of areas in these projects, including:





    * All goals for pharmaceutical research and development were exceeded.
      Eleven major regulatory approvals were obtained and nine major dossiers
      were filed during the year.
    * PRAVACHOL*, a cholesterol-lowering agent, was shown to provide
      additional cardiovascular benefits in addition to the established
      reduction in deaths from coronary heart disease and the risk of heart
      attacks.
    * TAXOL*, the Company's leading anti-cancer agent, received a new
      indication in combination with cisplatin for first-line ovarian cancer.
    * GLUCOPHAGE, the leading branded oral medication for treatment of
      non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes, was shown to have an excellent
      therapeutic efficacy profile in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and is
      the leader in the U.S. Oral Anti-diabetic market.
    * HERBAL ESSENCES* became number two in the U.S. shampoo/conditioner
      category after only three years on the market.
    * The Company's productivity for growth program contributed more than $600
      million in incremental benefits.


Total equity market capitalization was $133 billion as of December 31, 1998,
a 42% increase over last year.  1997 equity market capitalization was $94
billion, an increase of 72% over 1996.  Total return to stockholders, share
price appreciation together with reinvested dividends, was 43.0% for 1998,
77.0% for 1997 and 32.1% for 1996.  The 1998 return compares favorably to the
28.6% return of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index.


On December 1, 1998, the Company's Board of Directors declared a two-for-one
stock split of the common stock of the Company, effective February 1999.
This is the second stock split in the past two years.  The Board of Directors
also recommended that an amendment be considered for stockholder approval at
the annual meeting of stockholders to increase the number of authorized shares
of common stock from 2.25 billion to 4.5 billion. All share and per share
information presented herein has been adjusted for the effect of the stock
split.

Net Sales and Earnings

Worldwide sales increased 9% in 1998 to $18.3 billion, compared with increases
of 11% and 9% in 1997 and 1996, respectively.  The consolidated sales growth
resulted from a 10% increase due to volume, a 3% decrease due to foreign
exchange rate fluctuations and a 2% increase due to changes in selling prices.
In 1997, the 11% increase in sales reflected a 14% increase due to volume, a
3% decrease due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and no changes overall
from pricing activity.  In 1996, the 9% increase in sales reflected an 11%
increase due to volume, a 2% decrease due to foreign exchange rate
fluctuations and no changes overall from pricing activity. Domestic sales
increased 15% in 1998, 14% in 1997 and 10% in 1996, while international sales
increased 2% in 1998 (9% excluding foreign exchange), 7% in 1997 (15%
excluding foreign exchange) and 9% in 1996 (13% excluding foreign exchange).
In general, the businesses of the Company's industry segments are not seasonal.

As described in Notes 2 and 16 to the financial statements, the Company has
determined the final cost of its breast implant product liability (related to
a previously discontinued business of a subsidiary) and the cost of litigation
for prescription drug pricing cases.  Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of
1998, the Company recorded a special charge of $800 million before taxes, $495
million after taxes, or $.24 per diluted share, to augment the reserve for
breast implant liability and for the prescription drug pricing litigation,
offset by expected insurance recoveries.  The breast implant component of the
charge is $700 million before taxes ($800 million of liability offset by
insurance receivables of $100 million), and the prescription drug pricing
component is $100 million before taxes.  As a result of the special charge,
1998 net earnings were $3,141 million, basic earnings per share were $1.58
and diluted earnings per share were $1.55.





Net earnings, excluding the special charge, were $3,636 million, a 13%
increase over the prior year.  Basic earnings per share were $1.83 and diluted
earnings per share were $1.79, both increasing 14% over 1997.  In 1997, net
earnings of $3,205 million increased 12% from $2,850 million in 1996.  Basic
and diluted earnings per share of $1.61 and $1.57, respectively, increased 13%
and 12%, from $1.42 and $1.40, respectively, in 1996.  Net earnings margins,
excluding the special charge, increased to 19.9% in 1998 from 19.2% in 1997
and 18.9% in 1996.

The effective income tax rate on earnings before income taxes was 28.3% in
1998, excluding the special charge, compared to 28.5% and 29.0% in 1997 and
1996, respectively.  The effective income tax rate has decreased since 1996
due to increased income in lower tax rate jurisdictions.

As described in Note 4 to the financial statements, in 1998 the Company
completed the acquisition of Redmond Products, Inc., a leading hair care
manufacturer in the United States.  The Company also, in 1998, acquired
Phytoervas, a line of premium retail hair care products in Brazil, and Dong-A
Biotech Co., Ltd., a marketer and distributor of pharmaceutical products in
South Korea.  In 1997, the Company acquired Abeefe S.A., Peru's largest
pharmaceutical manufacturer and marketer.  The Company also, in 1997, acquired
CHOCO MILK*, Mexico's leading milk-based nutritional supplement, and
SAL DE UVAS PICOT*, a leading effervescent antacid product in Mexico.
In 1996, the Company acquired Pharmavit, one of Hungary's leading
manufacturers of over-the-counter medicines, nutritional products and generic
pharmaceuticals.  The Company also, in 1996, acquired Argentia S.A., one of
Argentina's largest manufacturers and marketers of ethical pharmaceuticals,
and completed the acquisition of Oncology Therapeutics Network, a
specialty distributor of anti-cancer medicines and related products.

As described in Note 4 to the financial statements, in the first quarter of
1998, the Company divested its BAN brand of anti-perspirants and deodorants.
In the second quarter of 1998, the Company divested A/S GEA, a Denmark-based
generic drug business, and Hexachimie, a specialty chemical manufacturer based
in France.  In the fourth quarter of 1997, the Company divested Linvatec
Corporation, its arthroscopy and surgical powered instrument business.
These divestitures resulted in gains before taxes of $201 million in 1998
and $225 million in 1997.

The Company recorded restructuring charges of $201 million in 1998 and $225
million in 1997.  These restructuring charges consist primarily of asset
write-downs and employee-related costs related to the consolidation and
closure of plants and facilities.


Expenses

Total costs and expenses as a percentage of sales, excluding the special
charge, were 72.3% in 1998 compared with 73.2% in 1997 and 73.4% in 1996.

As a percentage of sales, cost of products sold remained relatively unchanged
at 26.6% in 1998 compared to 26.7% in 1997.  In 1997, cost of products sold
as a percentage of sales increased to 26.7% from 26.3% in 1996, principally
due to incremental lower margin Oncology Therapeutics Network sales,
partially offset by increased sales of higher margin promoted pharmaceutical
products.

Following a 15% increase in advertising and promotion expenses in 1997 due
to product launches and direct-to-consumer campaigns for our high priority
pharmaceutical products, 1998 expenses increased 3% to $2,312 million from
$2,241 million.




Marketing, selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales,
decreased to 24.2% in 1998 from 25.0% in 1997 and 26.1% in 1996.  This
decreasing trend is a direct result of the Company's productivity programs
partially offset by increases in pharmaceutical sales force personnel.

The Company's investment in research and development totaled $1,577 million
in 1998, an increase of 14% over 1997, and as a percentage of sales,
increased to 8.6% in 1998 from 8.3% in 1997.  This spending level reflects
the Company's commitment to research over a broad range of therapeutic areas
and to clinical development in support of new products. Over the past 10
years, research and development expenses have increased at a compound annual
growth rate of 9%.  In 1998, research and development spending dedicated to
the research and development of pharmaceutical products increased 16%, and
was 12.4% of pharmaceutical sales compared to 12.0% and 12.3% in 1997 and
1996, respectively.  In 1998, the Company initiated filings with the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) for ORZEL, the first oral agent for colorectal
cancer in the U.S., and TEQUIN, a broad-spectrum oral quinolone antibiotic.
Additional filings are expected in 1999 for omapatrilat, a novel
antihypertensive.  During 1998, 1997 and 1996, the Company entered into a
number of research alliances, licensing agreements and biotechnology
collaborations.  These agreements are providing important new products,
early-stage compounds for further development and new processes that will help
the Company screen for new drugs more effectively.

Business Segments

All four of the Company's business segments - Medicines, Nutritionals, Medical
Devices and Beauty Care - reported sales increases, excluding foreign exchange
and divestitures, during the year.

Sales in the Medicines Segment (Pharmaceuticals and Consumer Medicines), which
is the Company's largest segment at 69% of the total Company, increased 12%
to $12,573 million in 1998.  Sales growth resulted from a 13% increase due to
volume and a 2% increase from selling prices, offset by a 3% decrease due to
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations.  Domestic sales increased
20% and international sales increased 8%, excluding foreign exchange,
primarily due to volume growth.

Sales of PRAVACHOL*, the Company's largest-selling product, were $1.6 billion,
an increase of 14%. Domestic sales increased 17% to $1,022 million.  In
November 1998, results from the landmark LIPID trial were published in the
New England Journal of Medicine showing that PRAVACHOL* improved total
mortality, improved results for patients with unstable angina and reduced
total hospitalizations. In July 1998, additional findings of the Cholesterol
and Recurrent Events (CARE) Trial were published in the Journal of the
American College of Cardiology, demonstrating cardiovascular protection in
women, the subgroup studied, as well as for a broad range of patients.  In
June 1998, the FDA cleared enhanced drug interaction labeling for PRAVACHOL*,
for reduced potential to interact with some commonly prescribed medications.
In March 1998, the FDA cleared PRAVACHOL* for use in reducing the risk of
stroke in patients who have had a heart attack and have normal cholesterol
levels. PRAVACHOL* is the only drug of its type indicated to reduce the risk
of a heart attack in patients with and without established coronary heart
disease.  Sales of MONOPRIL*, a second generation angiotensin converting
enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with once-a-day dosing, increased 16% to $380 million,
with strong growth in both domestic and international markets and strong
acceptance among managed care organizations in the United States.  Products
from the Bristol-Myers Squibb and Sanofi S.A. joint venture, AVAPRO and
PLAVIX, were launched in the fourth quarter of 1997 and first quarter of
1998, respectively. PLAVIX, a platelet aggregation inhibitor for the reduction
of stroke, heart attack and vascular death in atherosclerotic patients,
reached sales of $144 million for the year, and AVAPRO, an angiotensin II
receptor blocker for the treatment of hypertension, had sales of $120 million.
Sales of cardiovascular drugs, the largest product group in the Medicines
segment, increased 11% to $3,210 million.  Due to the loss of patent
exclusivity in several European countries in the first quarter of 1997, and
in the United States in February 1996, sales of captopril, an ACE inhibitor
sold primarily under the trademark CAPOTEN*, declined 20% to $636 million.
Excluding CAPOTEN* sales, cardiovascular drug sales increased 22%.



Sales of anti-cancer drugs increased 21% to $2,925 million.  Sales of TAXOL*
increased 28% to $1,206 million. In September 1998, the FDA approved
Genentech Inc.'s product, Herceptin(R), as a first-line therapy in combination
with TAXOL* for treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer.  Also
in September, the European Community approved a TAXOL* indication for
non-small cell lung cancer.  In May 1998, a U.S.-based cooperative group
study, sponsored under the Bristol-Myers Squibb Cooperative Research and
Development Agreement with the National Cancer Institute, showed that by
adding TAXOL* to a regimen with other commonly used chemotherapy drugs, the
risk of death for women with early-stage breast cancer was reduced by 26%.
This study, which enrolled over 3,000 women, was the first to show such a
significant survival benefit in early-stage breast cancer in over 20 years.
In April 1998, TAXOL*, in combination with cisplatin, was approved by the FDA
for first line treatment of ovarian cancer.  Sales of PARAPLATIN*, which is
used in combination therapy for the treatment of ovarian cancer, increased 20%
to $525 million.  Sales by the Oncology Therapeutics Network (OTN) were $657
million.

Anti-infective drug sales were $2,412 million, an increase of 8% over the
prior year.  Sales of ZERIT*, an antiretroviral agent, increased 38% to $551
million, and sales of VIDEX* grew 7% to $162 million.  ZERIT* is the most
commonly prescribed thymidine nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor in
HIV therapy in the United States.  In June 1998, the Company announced a large
phase III study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of once-daily dosing of
VIDEX*, as Bristol-Myers Squibb seeks to develop a more convenient dosing
regimen for HIV patients.  Sales of CEFZIL*, an oral cephalosporin used in
the treatment of respiratory infections and sinusitis, and MAXIPIME*, a fourth
generation injectable cephalosporin, also contributed to the growth of
anti-infectives.

Sales of central nervous system drugs increased 15% to $1,099 million, due
to the strong growth of BUSPAR*, the Company's novel anti-anxiety agent, and
SERZONE*, an antidepressant.  Sales of BUSPAR* increased 20% to $531 million,
while sales of SERZONE* increased 39% to $257 million.

GLUCOPHAGE continued to experience strong growth, with sales increasing 49%
to $861 million.  In September 1998, results of the United Kingdom Prospective
Diabetes Study demonstrated the excellent therapeutic efficacy profile of
GLUCOPHAGE in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Sales of EXCEDRIN* increased 17% to $241 million following clearance by the
FDA in January 1998 to market EXCEDRIN* Migraine, the first and only
non-prescription medication approved for relief of migraine pain.

In 1997, Medicines Segment sales increased 14% over 1996 levels.  Increases in
sales of PRAVACHOL*, TAXOL*, PARAPLATIN*, ZERIT*, MONOPRIL*, BUSPAR*, CEFZIL*,
GLUCOPHAGE, SERZONE*, VIDEX* and volume growth of EFFERALGAN* and ASPIRINE
UPSA* from the UPSA Group were partially offset by decreases in sales of
CAPOTEN*.



The margin on earnings before taxes decreased slightly to 27.8% in 1998 from
27.9% in 1997, as increases, as a percentage of sales, in research and
development expenditures and sales force expenditures were offset
by decreases in advertising and promotional spending and general
administrative expenses, In 1997, the margin on earnings before taxes
decreased to 27.9% from 28.0% in 1996 due to increased investment in
advertising and promotion expenses in support of high priority products and
lower margin sales for OTN.

Sales in the Medical Devices Segment, excluding the December 1997 divestiture
of Zimmer's arthroscopy and surgical powered instrument business, increased 7%
over prior year levels to $1,647 million, reflecting a 10% increase due to
volume, a 3% decrease due the effect of foreign exchange and no effect from
selling prices.  Domestic sales increased 9% and international sales increased
6% (11% excluding the effect of foreign exchange).  Including the divestiture,
Medical Device sales decreased 9%. The Company's ConvaTec division is the
worldwide market share leader in ostomy and advanced wound care products.
Sales of ostomy and wound care products increased 5% and 9%, respectively,
excluding foreign exchange.  Worldwide sales of knee prosthetic joint implants
increased 1% and hip replacement sales decreased 2%, excluding the effect of
foreign exchange.

In 1997, worldwide sales of Medical Devices decreased 3%, an increase of
1% excluding foreign exchange.

The margin on earnings before taxes in the Medical Devices Segment improved
to 20.5% in 1998, from 19.5% in 1997 due to decreases, as a percentage of
sales, in other marketing and general administrative expenses, partially
offset by increases in cost of products sold due to higher costs for products
sold under a distribution agreement with the acquirer of Linvatec.  The
margin on earnings before taxes in the Medical Devices Segment decreased to
19.5% in 1997 from 22.5% in 1996, due to incremental manufacturing costs in
connection with recently introduced products.

Sales in the Nutritionals Segment decreased 2% to $1,759 million, reflecting
a 2% increase due to volume, a 6% decrease due to the effect of foreign
exchange rate fluctuations primarily in Asia and a 2% increase due to changes
in selling prices.   International sales decreased 7% (an increase of 7%
excluding the effect of foreign exchange), and domestic sales increased 2%.
Mead Johnson continues to be the leader in the worldwide and U.S. infant
formula markets.  Total infant formula sales decreased 1% to $1,203 million
(an increase of 2% excluding foreign exchange).  Sales of ENFAMIL*, the
Company's largest selling infant formula, decreased 3% to $649 million
worldwide (a decrease of 1% excluding foreign exchange).  Gains were recorded
for NUTRAMIGEN* and LACTO FREE* specialty infant formulas.  BOOST*, an adult
nutritional beverage, and CHOCO MILK*, a milk-based nutritional supplement
acquired in July 1997, also contributed to sales growth.

In 1997, worldwide sales of Nutritionals increased 6% from 1996 levels,
primarily due to growth of NUTRAMIGEN*, LACTO FREE* and PROSOBEE* specialty
infant formulas, and adult consumer nutritionals.

The margin on earnings before taxes improved to 21.4% in 1998 from 20.6% in
1997, primarily due to a decrease, as a percentage of sales, in cost of
products sold, resulting from improved manufacturing efficiencies and
productivity programs. The margin on earnings before taxes in the Nutritionals
Segment decreased to 20.6% in 1997 from 21.1% in 1996.



Sales in the Beauty Care Segment increased 22% in 1998 to $2,305 million,
reflecting a 22% increase due to volume, a 3% increase due to pricing and a
3% decrease due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.  Excluding the effect
of foreign exchange, international sales increased 26% over 1997, while
domestic sales increased 25%. The Company's Clairol division continues to be
the number one hair products company in the United States.  Sales of the
Company's hair care products were especially strong, increasing 49% in 1998,
primarily due to sales of the HERBAL ESSENCES* complete line of shampoos,
conditioners, styling aids and body wash, which increased 60% to $561 million.
HERBAL ESSENCES* is the number two brand in the total shampoo and conditioner
market in the U.S. after only three years on the market, and number three in
body wash after less than two years on the market.  The Redmond AUSSIE* brand,
acquired in January 1998, has added more than $100 million in sales for the
year. DAILY DEFENSE* and VITAL NUTRIENTS*, both launched in September 1997,
contributed $82 million and $34 million, respectively, in sales for the year.
Haircoloring product sales increased 6%, benefiting from the continued success
of HYDRIENCE*, NATURAL INSTINCTS*, salon haircolorings and the launch of
REVITALIQUE*, a new premium permanent haircolor.

In 1997, sales in the Beauty Care Segment increased 14% from 1996 levels,
primarily due to increased sales of hair care products, led by HERBAL
ESSENCES*.

The margin on earnings before taxes in 1998 improved to 15.7% from 14.8%
in 1997 and 14.4% in 1996, primarily due to higher volumes and manufacturing
efficiencies due to productivity programs, partially offset by investment
spending behind new product introductions.

Geographic Areas

Bristol-Myers Squibb products are available in virtually every country in
the world; its largest markets are the United States, France, Japan,
Germany and Canada.

Sales in the U.S., net of inter-area sales, increased 15% in 1998.
Sales in the Medicines and Beauty Care Segments, comprised 68% and 15%,
respectively, of the region's sales.  Products with strong growth in the
region included GLUCOPHAGE, TAXOL*, PRAVACHOL*, HERBAL ESSENCES*, BUSPAR*,
PARAPLATIN*, and initial sales of PLAVIX and AUSSIE* hair care products.
The margin on earnings before taxes increased to 26.2% in 1998 from 24.5% in
1997 primarily due to decreases, as a percentage of sales, in cost of products
sold, advertising and general administrative expenses. In 1997, sales in
the U.S. increased 14%, net of inter-area sales, primarily due to anti-cancer
and anti-infective drugs from the Medicines Segment, specialty infant formulas
from the Nutritionals Segment and hair care products from the Beauty Care
Segment. The margin on earnings before taxes decreased to 24.5% in 1997 from
26.0% in 1996 primarily due to increases, as a percentage of sales, in cost
of products sold and advertising and promotion expenses.

Sales in Europe, Mid-East and Africa, net of inter-area sales, increased
4% (6% excluding foreign exchange). Medicines Segment comprise nearly 77%
of sales in the region.  Products with strong growth in the region included
TAXOL*, ZERIT*, PRAVACHOL*, HERBAL ESSENCES* and initial sales of AVAPRO.
Increases in sales of these products were partially offset by decreases in
sales of CAPOTEN* of $104 million due to the loss of exclusivity in several
European countries in early 1997.  The margin on earnings before taxes
decreased to 23.4% in 1998 from 23.8% in 1997 primarily due to increases,
as a percentage of sales, in promotional expenses.  In 1997, sales in Europe,
Mid-East and Africa, net of inter-area sales, increased 2% (12% excluding
foreign exchange), due to sales growth of products from the Medicines Segment
including anti-cancer, antiretroviral and analgesic products, and the
introductions of HERBAL ESSENCES* and HYDRIENCE* from the Beauty Care segment.
These increases were partially offset by decreases in sales of CAPOTEN* due
to loss of exclusivity.  The margin on earnings before taxes increased to
23.8% in 1997 from 21.9% in 1996 due to manufacturing efficiencies as a result
of the Company's productivity programs.



Sales in Other Western Hemisphere countries, net of inter-area sales,
increased 11% in 1998 (20% excluding foreign exchange).  Medicines and Beauty
Care Segments comprised nearly 62% and 18%, respectively, of the region's
sales.  Products with strong growth included HERBAL ESSENCES* and CHOCO MILK*,
due to their recent introductions into the region.  The margin on earnings
before taxes decreased to 12.8% in 1998 from 14.2% in 1997 reflecting
increases, as a percentage of sales, in cost of products sold.  In 1997,
sales in Other Western Hemisphere countries, net of inter-area sales,
increased 25% (26% excluding foreign exchange), due to increased sales of
cardiovascular, anti-cancer and anti-infective drugs from the Medicines
Segment, introductory sales of HYDRIENCE* and HERBAL ESSENCES* from the Beauty
Care Segment, and sales from the acquisitions of CHOCO MILK* and SAL DE UVAS
PICOT*.  The margin on earnings before taxes increased to 14.2% in 1997 from
11.1% in 1996, reflecting improved gross margins due to manufacturing
efficiencies.

Sales in the Pacific region increased 5% in 1998, net of inter-area sales
and excluding the effect of foreign exchange.  Including foreign exchange,
sales decreased 11% primarily due to currency fluctuations in Japan, the
Philippines, Thailand and Australia and economic downturns in the region.
Medicines and Nutritionals Segments comprised 45% and 22%, respectively, of
the region's sales.  Increases in TAXOL* and HERBAL ESSENCES* (launched in
the region in 1997) were offset in part by decreases in infant formulas and
CAPOTEN*, which lost patent exclusivity in Japan in 1997.  As a result of
economic downturns and unfavorable fluctuations in exchange rates, earnings
before taxes in the Pacific region were minimal in 1998.  In 1997, sales in
the Pacific region, net of inter-area sales, increased 5% (13% excluding
foreign exchange), as a result of increased sales from pharmaceuticals, skin
care products, infant formulas and the launch of HERBAL ESSENCES*.  The
margin on earnings before taxes decreased to 3.2% in 1997 from 4.4% in 1996,
primarily as a result of increases, as a percentage of sales, in cost of
products sold and sales force expenses.

Financial Instruments


Cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable securities totaled
$2.5 billion at December 31, 1998, compared to $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion
at December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively.  Working capital was $3.0 billion
at December 31, 1998, compared to $2.7 billion and $2.5 billion at
December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively.  Cash and cash equivalents, time
deposits and marketable securities, and the conversion of other working
capital items are expected to fund near-term operations of the Company.

The Company is exposed to market risk, including changes in currency exchange
rates and interest rates.  To reduce these risks, the Company enters into
certain derivative financial instruments where available on a cost-effective
basis to hedge its underlying economic exposure. These instruments also are
managed on a consolidated basis to efficiently net exposures and thus take
advantage of any natural offsets.

It is the Company's policy to hedge certain underlying economic exposures to
reduce foreign exchange and interest rate risk.  Derivative financial
instruments are not used for trading purposes.  Gains and losses on hedging
transactions are offset by gains and losses on the underlying exposures being
hedged.



Foreign exchange option contracts and, to a lesser extent, forward contracts
are used to hedge anticipated transactions.  The Company's primary foreign
currency exposures in relation to the U.S. dollar are the French franc,
Deutsche mark and Japanese yen.

The table below summarizes the Company's outstanding foreign exchange option
contracts as of December 31, 1998.  The fair value of option contracts,
which will change over time, is estimated based on forward currency rates
and other relevant market factors.  The fair value of option contracts
should be viewed in relation to the fair value of the underlying hedged
transactions and the overall reduction in exposure to adverse fluctuations
in foreign currency exchange rates.

At December 31, 1997, the Company held right to sell option contracts with an
aggregate notional amount, carrying value and fair value of $1,035 million,
$17 million and $48 million, respectively.  These contracts primarily related
to option contracts with the right to sell French francs and Deutsche marks.
The Company also held right to buy option contracts, primarily to buy Japanese
yen for U.S. dollars and Japanese yen for Deutsche marks, with an aggregate
notional amount, carrying value and fair value of $244 million, $5 million
and $7 million, respectively.

The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable
securities with various financial institutions.  These financial institutions
are located primarily in the U.S. and Europe, and Company policy is designed
to limit exposure to any one financial institution.

Recently Issued Accounting Standard

On June 15, 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
(FAS 133), which becomes effective for financial statements beginning
January 1, 2000.  FAS 133 requires that companies recognize all derivatives
as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure these
instruments at fair value. The Company is currently evaluating this statement
and its impact on the Company's existing accounting policies and financial
reporting disclosures.



Year 2000

The Company has reviewed its information systems for Year 2000 compliance.
The Year 2000 problem arises because many computer systems use only two
digits to represent the year. These programs may not process dates beyond
1999, which may cause miscalculations or system failures.

The Company has a comprehensive compliance program to assess the Year 2000
problem in the processing of data in the Company's information technology
(IT) and non-IT systems, including manufacturing, and research and
development systems. With regard to IT systems, this program has been
implemented, and the assessment as well as the required corrective actions
and testing are substantially complete. With regard to the critical
manufacturing, and research and development systems, the assessment has been
completed, with corrective actions and testing to be substantially completed
by mid-year 1999.

In connection with this compliance program, the Company also has asked
critically important vendors, customers, suppliers, governmental regulatory
authorities and financial institutions, whose incomplete or untimely
resolution of the Year 2000 problem could potentially have a significant
impact on the Company's operations, to assess their Year 2000 readiness.
This assessment has been substantially completed.

Contingency plans are being prepared, where necessary, to minimize any
significant exposures from the failures of these third parties to be Year
2000 compliant. These plans will be substantially completed by mid-year 1999,
and include development of backup procedures, identification of alternate
suppliers, and possible increases in inventory levels.

The Company does not expect the Year 2000 problem, as well as the cost of
the compliance program, to have a material impact on the Company's results
of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, there can be no
absolute assurance that third parties will convert their systems in a timely
manner and in a way that is compatible with the Company's systems.

Euro Conversion

On January 1, 1999, certain members of the European Union established fixed
conversion rates between their existing currencies and the European Union's
common currency, known as the Euro. The transition period for the introduction
of the Euro will be between January 1, 1999, and January 1, 2002. It is
planned that by July 1, 2002, the participating countries will withdraw all
currencies and use the Euro exclusively.

The Company has committed resources to conduct assessments and to take
corrective actions to ensure it is prepared for the introduction of the Euro.
The Company is currently evaluating methods to address the many areas involved
with the introduction of the Euro, including information management, finance,
legal and tax. This review includes the conversion of information technology,
business and financial systems, evaluating currency risk and the effect on
the Company's financial instruments as well as the impact on the pricing and
the distribution of the Company's products.

The Company believes the effect of the introduction of the Euro, as well as
any related cost of conversion, will not have a material impact on the
Company's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.



Financial Position

Cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable securities at
December 31, 1998 were denominated primarily in U.S. dollar instruments with
near-term maturities.  The average interest yield on cash and cash equivalents
was 4.7% at December 31, 1998 while interest yields on time deposits and
marketable securities averaged 4.5% at December 31, 1998.

Short-term borrowings and long-term debt at December 31, 1998 are denominated
primarily in U.S. dollars; however, a subsidiary of the Company had $167
million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 1998. This commercial
paper has original maturities not exceeding 270 days.  $116 million is
denominated in ECU's (Euros) and $51 million is denominated in U.S. dollars.
Also included is Japanese yen long-term debt of $284 million.

During 1998, the Company entered into two credit facilities, aggregating
$500 million, with a syndicate of lenders as support for its commercial paper
program.  The credit facilities consist of a $250 million, 364-day credit
facility which may be renewed annually with the consent of the lenders for
an additional 364-day period and a $250 million, 5-year credit facility,
extendible at each anniversary date with the consent of the lenders. There
were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facilities at December 31,
1998.  In addition, the Company has unused short-term lines of credit with
foreign banks of $494 million.

Disclosures related to short-term borrowings and long-term debt are included
in the notes to the financial statements.

Internally generated cash provided by operations was $4.1 billion in 1998,
$2.5 billion in 1997 and $2.6 billion in 1996.  Cash provided by operations
continued to be the Company's primary source of funds to finance operating
needs and expenditures for new plants and equipment.  As part of the Company's
ongoing commitment to improve plant efficiency and maintain superior research
facilities, the Company has invested over $2.1 billion in capital expansion
over the past three years.

Cash provided by operations also was used to pay dividends of over $4.5
billion over the past three years, to fund acquisitions at a cost of $663
million over the past three years, and to finance the share repurchase
program.  The Company's share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of
common stock from time to time in the open market or through private
transactions as market conditions permit.  During 1998, the Company purchased
30.6 million shares of common stock at a cost of $1.6 billion, bringing the
total shares acquired since the program's inception to 277 million.  During
the past three years, the Company has repurchased 101 million shares at a
cost of $3.6 billion.

Employment levels at December 1998 increased to 54,700 from 53,600 at December
1997, with increases primarily in pharmaceutical sales force and research and
development personnel.

Return on Stockholders' Equity continued to improve over the last three years
and was 49.2% in 1998, excluding the special charge, 46.5% in 1997 and 46.0%
in 1996.

                      BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY
               NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                         (dollars in millions)


Note 1  ACCOUNTING POLICIES
- ---------------------------

Basis of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and all of its subsidiaries.

Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents primarily include
securities with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase,
recorded at cost, which approximates market.

Time Deposits and Marketable Securities - Time deposits and marketable
securities are available for sale and are recorded at fair value, which
approximates cost.

Inventory Valuation - Inventories are generally stated at average cost, not
in excess of market.

Capital Assets and Depreciation - Expenditures for additions, renewals and
betterments are capitalized at cost.  Depreciation is generally computed by
the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the related
assets.

Excess of Cost over Net Tangible Assets - The excess of cost over net tangible
assets received in business acquisitions is being amortized on a straight-line
basis over periods not exceeding 40 years.

Earnings Per Share - Basic earnings per common share are computed using the
weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year.  Diluted
earnings per common share are computed using the weighted average number of
shares outstanding during the year, plus the incremental shares outstanding
assuming the exercise of dilutive stock options.


Note 2  SPECIAL CHARGE
- ----------------------

As described in Note 16, the Company has determined the final cost of its
breast implant product liability (related to a previously discontinued
business of a subsidiary) and the cost of litigation for prescription drug
pricing cases. Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of 1998, the Company
recorded a special charge of $800 million before taxes, $495 million after
taxes, or $.24 per diluted share, to augment the reserve for breast implant
liability and for the prescription drug pricing litigation, offset by expected
insurance recoveries. The breast implant component of the charge is $700
million before taxes ($800 million of liability offset by insurance
receivables of $100 million), and the prescription drug pricing component is
$100 million before taxes.

The Company has settled its United States Federal income tax returns with the
Internal Revenue Service through 1991.

United States Federal income taxes have not been provided on substantially
all of the unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, since it is
management's practice and intent to reinvest such earnings in the operations
of these subsidiaries.  The total amount of the net unremitted earnings of
non-U.S. subsidiaries was approximately $3.2 billion at December 31, 1998.

Each share of the Company's preferred stock is convertible into 16.96 shares
of common stock and is callable at the Company's option.  The reductions in
the number of issued shares of preferred stock in 1998, 1997 and 1996 were
due to conversions into shares of common stock.

Dividends per common share were $.78 in 1998, $.76 in 1997 and $.75 in 1996.

Stock Compensation Plans
- ------------------------

Under the Company's 1997 Stock Incentive Plan, officers, directors and key
employees may be granted options to purchase the Company's common stock at
no less than 100% of the market price on the date the option is granted.
Options generally become exercisable in installments of 25% per year on each
of the first through the fourth anniversaries of the grant date and have a
maximum term of 10 years. Additionally, the plan provides for the granting
of stock appreciation rights whereby the grantee may surrender exercisable
options and receive common stock and/or cash measured by the excess of the
market price of the common stock over the option exercise price.  The plan
also provides for the granting of performance-based stock options to certain
key executives.

Under the terms of the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, additional
shares are authorized in the amount of 0.9% of the outstanding shares per
year through 2002.  The plan incorporates the Company's long-term performance
awards.

In addition, the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan provides for the granting of up
to 20,000,000 shares of common stock to key employees, subject to restrictions
as to continuous employment except in the case of death or normal retirement.
Restrictions generally expire over a five-year period from date of grant.
Compensation expense is recognized over the restricted period.  At December 31,
1998, a total of 2,536,364 restricted shares were outstanding under the plan.

Under the TeamShare Stock Option Plan, all full-time employees, excluding key
executives, meeting certain years of service requirements are granted options
to purchase the Company's common stock at the market price on the date the
options are granted.  The Company has authorized 60,000,000 shares for
issuance under the plan.  As of December 31, 1998, a total of 59,482,400
options were granted under the plan with generally 800 options granted to
each eligible employee.  Individual grants generally become exercisable on or
after the third anniversary of the grant date.  As of December 31, 1998,
18,841,100 shares have been exercised under the plan.

The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations in accounting for
its plans.  Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for its
stock-based compensation plans other than for restricted stock and
performance-based awards.  Had compensation cost for the Company's other stock
option plans been determined based upon the fair value at the grant date for
awards under these plans consistent with the methodology prescribed under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, the Company's net income and earnings per share
would have been reduced by approximately $136 million, or $.07 per common
share, basic and diluted, in 1998, $85 million, or $.04 per common share,
basic and diluted, in 1997 and $55 million, or $.03 per common share, basic
and diluted, in 1996.  The fair value of the options granted during 1998, 1997
and 1996 was estimated as $11.80 per common share, $6.41 per common share and
$4.26 per common share, respectively, on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:

Note 11  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
- ------------------------------

Foreign exchange option contracts and, to a lesser extent, forward contracts,
are used to hedge anticipated transactions.

The Company has exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and
liabilities, which approximated $2,310 million, $2,070 million and $1,640
million at December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively, primarily in
Deutsche marks, French francs, Italian lire and Japanese yen.  The Company
mitigates the effect of these exposures through third-party borrowings.

The risk of loss associated with the types of foreign exchange option
contracts entered into by the Company is limited to premium amounts paid for
the option contracts.  Premiums are deferred in Prepaid Expenses and amortized
in the consolidated statement of earnings (in the Other caption) over the
time frame of the underlying hedged transaction.  Gains and losses related
to the option contracts, which qualify as hedges of foreign currency
anticipated transactions, are recognized in earnings when the hedged
transactions are recognized.  Gains and losses on foreign exchange forward
contracts are recognized in the basis of the underlying transaction being
hedged.

The Company does not anticipate any material adverse effect on its financial
position resulting from its involvement in these instruments, nor does it
anticipate non-performance by any of its counterparties.

At December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, the carrying value of all financial
instruments, both short- and long-term, approximated their fair values.

                              (dollars in millions)

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, and fair
value of plan assets for the pension plans with accumulated benefit
obligations in excess of plan assets were $288 million, $230 million and
$40 million, respectively, as of December 31, 1998, $271 million, $208 million
and $37 million, respectively, as of December 31, 1997, and $272 million,
$202 million and $38 million, respectively, as of December 31, 1996.  This
is primarily attributable to an unfunded benefit equalization plan.

In 1998, the increase in total projected benefit obligation was due to a lower
discount rate.

The principal defined contribution plan is the Bristol-Myers Squibb Savings
and Investment Program.  The Company's contribution is based on employee
contributions and the level of company match.  Company contributions to the
plan were $45 million in 1998, $40 million in 1997 and $39 million in 1996.


Note 15  POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS OTHER THAN PENSIONS
- ---------------------------------------------------------

The Company provides comprehensive medical and group life benefits to
substantially all U.S. retirees who elect to participate in the Company's
comprehensive medical and group life plans.  The medical plan is contributory.
Contributions are adjusted periodically and vary by date of retirement and the
original retiring company.  The life insurance plan is non-contributory.  Plan
assets principally consist of equity securities and fixed income securities.

Cost for the Company's postretirement benefit plans included the following
components:

For measurement purposes, an annual rate of increase in the per capita cost
of covered health care benefits of 7.2% for participants under age 65 and
6.7% for participants age 65 and over was assumed for 1999; the rate was
assumed to decrease gradually to 4.75% in 2007 and to remain at that level
thereafter.

A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would
have the following effects:

In 1998, the increase in total benefit obligation was due to a lower
discount rate.


Note 16  CONTINGENCIES
- ----------------------

Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings of a nature considered normal to its
businesses are pending against the Company and certain of its subsidiaries.
The most significant of these are described below.  Reference is made to
Item 3 Legal Proceedings in Part 1 of this Form 10-K Annual Report.

Breast Implant Litigation
- -------------------------

The Company, together with its subsidiary, Medical Engineering Corporation
(MEC), and certain other companies, has been named as a defendant in a number
of claims and lawsuits alleging damages for personal injuries of various
types resulting from polyurethane-covered breast implants and smooth-walled
breast implants formerly manufactured by MEC or a related company.  Of the
more than 90,000 claims or potential claims against the Company in direct




                    BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY
              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                       (dollars in millions)

lawsuits or through registration in the nationwide class action settlement
approved by the Federal District Court in Birmingham, Alabama (the Revised
Settlement), most have been dealt with through the Revised Settlement, other
settlements, or trial.  It is expected that as of January 1, 1999, the
Company's contingent liability in respect of breast implant claims will be
limited to residual unpaid Revised Settlement obligations and to roughly 6,000
remaining opt-outs who have pursued or may pursue their claims in court.

As of December 31, 1998, approximately 15,000 United States and 1,300 foreign
breast implant recipients were plaintiffs in lawsuits pending in federal and
state courts in the United States and in certain courts in Canada and
Australia.  These figures include the claims of plaintiffs that are in the
process of being settled and/or dismissed. In these lawsuits, about 10,200
U.S. and 400 foreign plaintiffs opted out of the Revised Settlement.  The
lawsuits of the 4,800 U.S. plaintiffs who did not opt out are expected to be
dismissed since these plaintiffs are among the estimated 74,000 women with MEC
implants who chose to participate in the nationwide settlement.  Of the
remaining opt-out plaintiffs, some have claims based upon products that were
not manufactured and sold by MEC; many others have claims that are in the
process of being settled.  Under the terms of the Revised Settlement,
additional opt-outs are expected to be minimal since the deadline for U.S.
class members to opt out has passed. In addition, the Company's remaining
obligations under the Revised Settlement Program are limited because most
payments to "Current Claimants" already have been made, no additional
"Current Claims" may be filed without court approval, and because payments
of claims to so-called "Other Registrants" and "Late Registrants" are limited
by the terms of the Revised Settlement.  Separate class action settlements
have been approved in the provincial courts of Ontario and Quebec, and an
agreement has been reached under which other foreign breast implant recipients
may settle their claims.  The Company believes it will be able to address
remaining opt-out claims as well as expected remaining obligations under
the Revised Settlement Program within its reserves described below.

In the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company recorded a charge of $500 million
before taxes ($310 million after taxes) in respect of breast implant cases.
The charge consisted of $1.5 billion for potential liabilities and expenses,
offset by $1.0 billion of expected insurance proceeds.  In the fourth quarters
of 1994 and 1995, the Company recorded additional special charges of $750
million before taxes ($488 million after taxes) and $950 million before taxes
($590 million after taxes), respectively, related to breast implant product
liability claims. In the fourth quarter of 1998, the Company recorded an
additional special charge to earnings in the amount of $800 million before
taxes and increased its insurance receivable in the amount of $100 million,
resulting in a net charge to earnings of $433 million after taxes in respect
of breast implant product liability claims.  At December 31, 1998, 1997 and
1996 the amount of insurance recoverable was $523 million, $619 million and
$853 million, respectively, and included in current and other liabilities
for product liability claims was $1,121 million, $1,036 million and $1,831
million, respectively.

Prescription Drug Litigation
- ----------------------------

As of December 31, 1998, the Company is a defendant in over 100 actions
brought against the Company and more than 30 other pharmaceutical
manufacturers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy benefit managers in various
federal district courts by certain chain drugstores, supermarket chains
and independent drug stores, which opted out of a nationwide class (previously
settled by the Company) and are suing individually.  These cases have been
coordinated for pretrial purposes and all seek treble damages and injunctive
relief on account of alleged antitrust violations in the pricing and marketing
of brand name prescription drugs.  Cases brought by retail pharmacies in state
court under state law alleging similar grounds are pending in California,
Alabama and Mississippi.  Purported class actions, some

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                    (dollars in millions)


purportedly multistate in reach, brought by consumers in state court under
state law alleging similar grounds have been settled, subject to court
approval, in California and remain pending in Alabama and Tennessee.  In the
fourth quarter of 1998, the Company recorded a special charge to earnings in
the amount of $100 million before taxes ($62 million after taxes) in respect
of this prescription drug litigation.  While it is not possible to predict
with certainty the outcome of these cases, it is the opinion of management
that they will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's operating
results, liquidity or consolidated financial position.
