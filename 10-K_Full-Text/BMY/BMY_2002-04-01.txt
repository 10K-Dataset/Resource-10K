PART I

Item 1. BUSINESS.

DESCRIPTION OF BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY

General:

Bristol-Myers Squibb Company ("Bristol-Myers Squibb" or the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in August 1933 under the name
Bristol-Myers Company as successor to a New York business started in 1887. In 1989, the Bristol-Myers Company changed its name to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, as a result of a merger. The Company,
through its divisions and subsidiaries, is a major producer and distributor in one significant business segment—medicines. Operations of the Nutritional and ConvaTec businesses are not
material to the financial statements. In general, the business of the Company is not seasonal.

In
2000, the Company announced the planned divestiture of its Clairol and Zimmer businesses. Accordingly, the operations of these businesses have been reflected as discontinued operations in the
accompanying financial statements. On November 15, 2001, the Company completed the sale of Clairol for $4.95 billion and on August 6, 2001, the Company spun off Zimmer
Holdings, Inc., in a tax-free distribution.

In
October 2001, the Company acquired the DuPont Pharmaceuticals business for cash of $7.8 billion. DuPont Pharmaceuticals is primarily a domestic pharmaceutical and imagery product
business focused on research and development. In addition, in November 2001, the Company purchased 14.4 million shares of ImClone Systems, Inc. ("ImClone") for $70 per share,
which represented 19.9% of the shares outstanding just prior to the commencement of the public tender offer. The completion of the public tender offer is part of a strategic agreement between the
Company and ImClone that also includes an arrangement to codevelop and copromote an investigational cancer drug, Erbitux. These transactions were financed with proceeds from the issuance of
$1.5 billion of commercial paper, issuance of $5.0 billion of medium-term notes and internal cash flows.

brand names of products which are registered trademarks owned by the Company.

SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS

In general, Bristol-Myers Squibb purchases its principal raw materials and supplies in the open market. Substantially all such materials are obtainable from a number of sources
so that the loss of any one source of supply would not have a material adverse effect on the Company.

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES

The Company owns or is licensed under a number of patents in the United States and foreign countries covering products, and has also developed many brand names and trademarks
for products. The Company considers the overall protection of its patent, trademark and license rights to be of material value and acts to protect these rights from infringement. U.S. patents that are
expected to expire in the next three years include the composition of matter patents for MONOPRIL* (December 2002) and SERZONE* (March 2003). In addition, a use patent for PARAPLATIN*
will expire in April 2004. Hatch-Waxman data protection will expire for GLUCOPHAGE XR in October 2003 and GLUCOVANCE in July 2003. All of these expiry dates could be extended by
an additional six months under the pediatric extension, upon the completion and acceptance of pediatric studies by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in advance of the expiration. The Company
believes that no single patent or license is of material importance in relation to the business as a whole.

COMPETITION, DISTRIBUTION AND CUSTOMERS

The markets in which Bristol-Myers Squibb competes are generally broad-based and highly competitive. The principal means of competition utilized to market the products of
Bristol-Myers Squibb include quality, service, price and product performance. Pharmaceutical products and the products of ConvaTec are promoted on a national and international basis in medical
journals and directly to the medical profession. The Company is also utilizing direct-to-consumer advertising for a number of its pharmaceutical products. Most of the other
products of Bristol-Myers Squibb are generally advertised and promoted on a national and international basis through the use of television, radio, print media, consumer offers, and window and
in-store displays. Bristol-Myers Squibb's products are principally sold to the wholesale and retail trade both nationally and internationally. Certain products are also sold to other drug
manufacturers, hospitals and the medical profession. Three wholesalers accounted for approximately 45% of net sales from continuing operations in 2001.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Research and development is essential to Bristol-Myers Squibb's business. Pharmaceutical research and development is carried out by the Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical
Research Institute, which has major facilities in Princeton, Hopewell and New Brunswick, New Jersey; Wilmington, Delaware and Wallingford, Connecticut. Pharmaceutical research and development is also
carried out at various other facilities in the United States and in Belgium, Canada, France, Italy and the United Kingdom.


Management continues to emphasize leadership, innovation and productivity as strategies for success in the Research Institute.

Bristol-Myers
Squibb, excluding DuPont and ImClone, spent $2,124 million in 2001, $1,939 million in 2000 and $1,759 million in 1999 on Company sponsored research and development
activities. On this basis, pharmaceutical research and development spending, as a percentage of pharmaceutical sales, was 13.5% in 2001 compared with 13.0% in 2000 and 12.6% in 1999.

REGULATION

Most aspects of the Company's business are subject to some degree of government regulation in the countries in which its operations are conducted. The Company's policy is to
comply fully with all regulatory requirements applying to its products and operations. For some products, and in some countries, government regulation is significant and, in general, there is a trend
to more stringent regulation. The Company devotes significant time, effort and expense addressing the extensive governmental regulatory requirements applicable to its business. Governmental regulatory
actions can
result in the recall or seizure of products, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for the production or sale of a product, and other civil and criminal sanctions.

In
the United States, the drug, medical device, diagnostic and food industries in which the Company operates have long been subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies,
primarily as to product manufacture, safety, efficacy, advertising and labeling.

In
addition, governmental bodies in the United States as well as other countries have expressed concern about costs relating to health care and, in some cases, have focused attention on the pricing of
drugs and on appropriate drug utilization. Government regulation in these areas already exists in some countries and may be expanded significantly in the United States and other countries in the
future.

While
the Company is unable to predict the extent to which its business may be affected by future regulatory developments, it believes that its substantial experience dealing with governmental
regulatory requirements and restrictions on its operations throughout the world and its development of new and improved products should enable it to compete effectively within this environment.

EMPLOYEES

Bristol-Myers Squibb employees from continuing operations were approximately 46,000 people at December 31, 2001.

DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN OPERATIONS

Reference is made to Note 13 Financial Instruments, and Note 14 Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II,
Item 8 of this Form 10-K Annual Report.

International
operations are subject to certain risks which are inherent in conducting business abroad, including possible nationalization or expropriation, price and exchange controls, limitations on
foreign participation in local enterprises and other restrictive governmental actions. In addition, changes in the relative value of currencies take place from time to time and their effects may be
favorable or unfavorable on Bristol-Myers Squibb's operations. There are currency restrictions relating to repatriation of earnings in certain countries.


Item 2. PROPERTIES.

Bristol-Myers Squibb's world headquarters is located at 345 Park Avenue, New York, New York, where it leases approximately 460,000 square feet of floor space, approximately
215,000 square feet of which is sublet to others.

Bristol-Myers
Squibb manufactures products at thirty-seven major worldwide locations with an aggregate floor space of approximately 13,300,000 square feet. All facilities are owned by Bristol-Myers
Squibb. The following table illustrates the geographic location of the Company's significant manufacturing facilities.

Portions
of these facilities and other facilities owned or leased by Bristol-Myers Squibb in the United States and elsewhere are used for research, administration, storage and distribution.
Bristol-Myers Squibb's facilities are well maintained, adequately insured and in satisfactory condition.

Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

Various
lawsuits, claims and proceedings of a nature considered normal to its businesses are pending against the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. The most significant of these are described
below.

Reference
is made to Note 18 Litigation in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K Annual Report.

BREAST IMPLANT LITIGATION

The Company, together with its subsidiary Medical Engineering Corporation (MEC) and certain other companies, remains a defendant in a number of claims and lawsuits alleging
damages for personal injuries of various types resulting from polyurethane-covered breast implants and smooth-walled breast implants formerly manufactured by MEC or a related company. The vast
majority of claims against the Company in direct lawsuits have been resolved through settlements or trial. Likewise, claims or potential claims against the Company registered in the nationwide class
action settlement approved by the Federal District Court in Birmingham, Alabama (Revised Settlement), have been or will be resolved through the Revised Settlement. The Company expects it will be able
to address all remaining claims or potential claims through its product liability reserves.

TAXOL* LITIGATION

In 1997 and 1998, the Company filed several lawsuits alleging that a number of generic drug companies infringed its patents covering methods of administering paclitaxel when
they filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications seeking regulatory approval to sell paclitaxel. These actions were consolidated for discovery in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey
(District Court). The Company did not assert a monetary claim against any of the defendants, but sought to prevent the defendants from marketing paclitaxel in a manner that violates the Company's
patents. The defendants asserted that they did not infringe the Company's patents and that these patents are invalid and unenforceable.

In
early 2000, the District Court invalidated most claims of the Company's patents. On April 20, 2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court's summary
judgment of the invalidity of all but two claims of the patents at issue. Those two claims relate to the low-dose, three-hour


administration of paclitaxel in which the patient is given a specified regimen of premedicants before the administration of paclitaxel. The appellate court remanded those two claims to the District
Court for further proceedings. In 2001 the Company filed an additional patent infringement suit against another company seeking to market generic paclitaxel.

In
September 2000, one of the defendants received final approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its Abbreviated New Drug Application for paclitaxel and is marketing the
product. Additional final approvals have since been announced by the FDA and sales of additional generic products have begun.

Some
of the defendants asserted counterclaims seeking damages for alleged antitrust and unfair competition violations. The Company believed its patents were valid when it filed the suits, and the
counterclaims asserted are believed to be without merit. Since the filing of the suits, six private actions have been filed by parties alleging antitrust, consumer protection and similar claims
relating to the Company's actions to obtain and enforce patent rights. The plaintiffs seek declaratory judgment, damages (treble and/or punitive where allowed), disgorgement and injunctive relief. In
September 2000, the Federal Trade Commission initiated an investigation relating to paclitaxel. Various state attorneys general have also initiated investigations regarding paclitaxel. At this
time, none of these federal and state agencies has brought any claims against the Company relating to paclitaxel, nor have they indicated whether any such claims will be brought. The Company is
cooperating in these investigations.

The
lawsuits with four of the defendants have been settled with defendants agreeing to drop all claims against the Company relating to paclitaxel and the Company granting licenses to the four
defendants under certain paclitaxel patent rights. The Company is considering its options with respect to the two remaining patent infringement defendants. It is not possible at this time to make a
reasonable assessment as to the final outcome of these lawsuits and investigations. Nor is it possible to reasonably estimate the impact those litigations and investigations might have if the Company
were not to prevail.

BUSPAR* LITIGATION

On November 21, 2000, the Company obtained a patent, U.S. Patent No. 6,150,365 ("365 patent"), relating to a method of using BUSPAR* or buspirone. The Company
submitted timely information relating to the "365 patent" to the FDA for listing in an FDA publication commonly known as the "Orange Book," and the FDA thereafter listed the patent in the Orange Book.

Delisting
Suits. Generic-drug manufacturers sued the FDA and the Company to compel the delisting of the "365 patent" from the Orange Book. Although one district court declined to order the
delisting of the "365 patent", another ordered the Company to cause the delisting of the patent from the Orange Book. The Company complied with the court's order but appealed the decision to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit reversed the district court that ordered the delisting.

Patent
Suits. The Company is seeking to enforce the "365 patent" in actions against two generic drug manufacturers.

Antitrust
Suits. Following the delisting of the "365 patent" from the Orange Book, a number of purchasers of buspirone and several generic drug makers filed lawsuits against the Company alleging that
it improperly triggered statutory marketing exclusivity. The attorneys general of 29 states and Puerto Rico have also filed suit against the Company with parallel allegations. Some of the private
plaintiffs have amended their allegations to include charges that a 1994 agreement between the Company and a generic company improperly blocked the entry of generic buspirone to the market. The
central issues raised by these cases are whether the Company improperly caused the listing of the "365 patent" in the Orange Book and whether the 1994 agreement was improper. Plaintiffs seek
declaratory judgment, damages (treble and/or punitive where allowed), disgorgement and injunctive relief.


Multidistrict
Litigation (MDL) proceedings. The Judicial Panel on MDL granted the Company's motions to have all of the patent and antitrust cases consolidated in a single forum. The court before which
the buspirone litigations are now pending issued two opinions dated February 14, 2002. In the first opinion, the court found that the "365 patent" does not cover uses of buspirone and therefore
is not infringed. In the second opinion, the court denied the Company's motion to dismiss the federal antitrust and state law claims against the Company. The second opinion allows the claims against
the Company to proceed, except as to federal antitrust claims for damages accrued more than four years before the filing of the complaints.

Government
Investigations. The Federal Trade Commission and a number of state attorneys general have initiated investigations concerning the listing of the "365 patent" in the Orange Book. The Company
is cooperating in these investigations. A number of attorneys general, but not all of them, filed an action against the Company, as noted earlier.

It
is not possible at this time to make a reasonable assessment as to the final outcome of these lawsuits and investigations. If the Company were not to prevail in final, non-appealable
determinations of these litigations and investigations, the impact on the Company could be material.

VANLEV* LITIGATIONS

In April, May and June 2000, the Company, its former chairman of the board and chief executive officer, Charles A. Heimbold, Jr., and its chief scientific officer, Peter
S. Ringrose, Ph.D., were named as defendants in a number of class action lawsuits alleging violations of federal securities laws and regulations. These actions have been consolidated into one action
for pretrial proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. The plaintiff claims that the defendants disseminated materially false and misleading statements and failed to
disclose information concerning the safety and expected availability of its product VANLEV during the period November 8, 1999, through April 19, 2000. The plaintiff seeks compensatory
damages, costs and expenses.

In
March 2002, the Company and its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Peter R. Dolan, were named as defendants in a purported securities class action lawsuit alleging violations of federal
securities laws and regulations. The action is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants disseminated materially false and
misleading statements and failed to disclose safety data of its product VANLEV during the period September 25, 2001, through March 19, 2002. The plaintiffs seek compensatory damages,
costs and expenses.

It
is not possible at this time to make a reasonable assessment of the final outcome of these matters or the amount of damages if the Company were not to prevail.

Environmental Matters

The Company, together with others, is a party to, or otherwise involved in, a number of proceedings brought by the Environmental Protection Agency or comparable state agencies
under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) or comparable state laws directed at the cleanup of hazardous waste sites.

While
it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these cases, it is the opinion of management that they will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's operating results,
liquidity or consolidated financial position.

Item 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

No
matters were submitted to security holders during this period.

Item 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

Summary

The
year 2001 was one of change for Bristol-Myers Squibb. Consistent with the strategy to become a more focused pharmaceutical Company, a number of transactions were completed during the year,
including the divestiture of two nonpharmaceutical businesses: Clairol (beauty care) and Zimmer (orthopaedics). The results for these businesses have been reported as discontinued operations and
excluded from consolidated sales and expenses for all years. In addition, in the fourth quarter 2001, the Company acquired the DuPont Pharmaceuticals business (DuPont) and made a 19.9% equity
investment in a biotechnology company—ImClone Systems, Inc. (ImClone).

Including
sales by DuPont, Bristol-Myers Squibb reported $19.4 billion in annual global sales for 2001, an increase of 7% (9% excluding foreign exchange) over 2000. Domestic sales, representing
68% of worldwide sales, increased 9% to $13.1 billion, while international sales increased 3% (8% excluding foreign exchange) to $6.3 billion. Sales for the Company, excluding sales by
DuPont, were $19.1 billion, an increase of 5% (7% excluding foreign exchange) over 2000.

The
Company's most important product lines made a significant contribution to the Company's sales growth. Many of these experienced double digit growth on a worldwide basis. During the year, the
Company had four blockbuster products, each with annual sales in excess of $1 billion—PRAVACHOL*, GLUCOPHAGE, PLAVIX and TAXOL* (paclitaxel). In fact, PRAVACHOL* and GLUCOPHAGE each
had annual sales in excess of $2 billion. The Company had 50 product lines with more than $50 million in annual sales, including 28 with more than $100 million in annual sales and
four with more than $500 million in annual sales.

Earnings
from continuing operations before income taxes increased 11% to $6.4 billion from $5.8 billion in 2000 on a stand-alone basis, which excludes the effects of the DuPont and
ImClone transactions and nonrecurring items. On this basis, net earnings increased 10% to $4.7 billion; basic and diluted earnings per share increased 11% to $2.44 and 12% to $2.41,
respectively. Net earnings for the total Company (continuing and discontinued operations) increased 11% to $5.2 billion in 2001. On this same basis, basic and diluted earnings per share
increased 13% to $2.70 and $2.67, respectively.

Bristol-Myers
Squibb's financial position remains strong. At December 31, 2001, the Company held almost $5.7 billion in cash, time deposits and marketable securities. Cash provided from
operating activities reached $5.4 billion in 2001. In connection with the DuPont and ImClone transactions, the Company issued $5.0 billion of notes of which $2.5 billion matures
in 2006 and $2.5 billion matures in 2011 with coupon interest rates of 4.75% and 5.75%, respectively. Returns to shareholders included dividend distributions of $2.1 billion and stock
repurchases of $1.6 billion. Dividends per common share were $1.10 in 2001, increasing from $0.98 per share paid in 2000. In December 2001, the Company announced a dividend increase, the
30th consecutive year that dividends have increased. The 2002 indicated annual payment is $1.12 per common share, a 2% increase over 2001. As further evidence of its strong financial position,
Bristol-Myers Squibb is one of only seven U.S. industrial companies to receive a AAA credit rating from both Moody's and Standard & Poor's investment rating agencies.

In
2001, consistent with our mission to extend and enhance human life, by developing the highest-quality products, the Company on a stand-alone basis invested $2.1 billion in research and
development, a 10% growth over 2000. Research and development dedicated to pharmaceutical products increased 11% over 2000, with a compound annualized growth in spending of 14% over the past five
years. That continuing investment led to the discovery of innovative new products and the development of new indications for existing products in 2001 that led to twelve regulatory filings, including
VANLEV* for hypertension, ARIPIPRAZOLE for schizophrenia and PLAVIX for acute coronary syndrome. In addition, the Company


received seven regulatory approvals for supplemental submissions, including TEQUIN* for short-course (five-day) regimen.

U.S.
patents that are expected to expire in the next three years include the composition of matter patents for MONOPRIL* (December 2002) and SERZONE* (March 2003). In addition, a use
patent for PARAPLATIN* will expire in April 2004. Hatch-Waxman data protection will expire for GLUCOPHAGE XR in October 2003 and GLUCOVANCE in July 2003. All of these expiry dates
could be extended by an additional six months under the pediatric extension, upon the completion and acceptance of pediatric studies by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in advance of the
expiration.

In
October 2001, the Company acquired the DuPont Pharmaceuticals business from E. I. duPont de Nemours and Company for $7.8 billion. In 2001, the Company also announced a collaboration
agreement with Exelixis, Inc., to create a new generation of cancer drugs that selectively destroy cancers that harbor defects in tumor-suppressed gene pathways.

In
September 2001, the Company entered into a commercial agreement with ImClone to codevelop and copromote an investigational cancer drug, Erbitux. Under the commercial agreement, the Company
was required to pay ImClone an aggregate of $1 billion upon the achievement of three milestones, of which $200 million was paid in 2001. In November 2001, the Company also
purchased 14.4 million shares of ImClone for $70 per share, which represented approximately 19.9% of the ImClone shares outstanding just prior to the commencement of the public tender offer.

On
December 28, 2001, ImClone announced that the FDA refused to accept for filing the Biologics License Application (BLA) that had been submitted by ImClone for Erbitux. The BLA had been
submitted to gain marketing approval to treat irinotecan-refractory colorectal carcinoma.

On
January 18, 2002, the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the House Energy and Commerce Committee announced it is investigating questions about the conduct of ImClone in the
development of Erbitux. On January 25, 2002, ImClone announced it had received an informal inquiry from the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as inquiries from the Justice Department
and the aforementioned subcommittee. The Company will cooperate with these investigations.

The
Company and ImClone met with the FDA in February 2002 and are currently evaluating next steps.

On
March 5, 2002, the agreement with ImClone was revised to reduce the total payments to $900 million from $1 billion. Under the new agreement the Company paid ImClone
$140 million in the first quarter of 2002 and will pay ImClone $60 million in March 2003 and an aggregate of $500 million upon the achievement of two milestones. Also under
the agreement, the Company will pay ImClone a distribution fee based on a flat rate of 39% of product revenues in North America.

The
carrying value of the Company's approximately 19.9% equity investment in ImClone was $481 million as of December 31, 2001. On a per-share basis, the carrying value of the
Company's ImClone investment and the closing market value of ImClone shares as of December 31, 2001, were $33.40 and $46.46, respectively. Given the FDA's December 28, 2001, action and
the market value of ImClone shares since December 31, 2001 ($19.58 per share as of January 24, 2002), it is possible that the Company could recognize a charge for impairment of the
investment in ImClone in future periods based upon further developments of the status of Erbitux and the market value of ImClone.

Net Sales

Sales
increased 7% in 2001 to $19.4 billion, including the sales from the DuPont acquisition. Domestic sales increased 9% in 2001 and 14% in 2000, while international sales increased 3% in 2001
(8% excluding foreign exchange) and decreased 2% in 2000 (a 5% increase excluding foreign exchange). On a stand-alone basis, excluding sales from the DuPont acquisition, sales increased 5% in 2001 to
$19.1 billion compared with increases of 8% and 12% in 2000 and 1999, respectively. The consolidated sales growth in


2001, on a stand-alone basis, resulted from a 5% increase due to volume, a 2% increase due to changes in selling prices and a 2% decrease due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. In 2000, the 8%
increase in sales reflected an 8% increase due to volume, a 3% increase due to changes in selling prices and a 3% decrease due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. In 1999, the 12% increase in sales
reflected an 11% increase due to volume, a 2% increase due to changes in selling prices and a 1% decrease due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. In general, the business of the Company is not
seasonal.

A
significant portion of the Company's domestic pharmaceutical sales is made to wholesalers. As a result, the financial results and quarterly comparisons are affected by fluctuations in the buying
patterns of these major wholesalers and the corresponding changes in inventory levels maintained by these wholesalers. These changes may not reflect underlying prescriber demand. While the Company
cannot verify wholesaler inventory levels, the Company believes average wholesaler inventories of products in the U.S. increased during 2001 by approximately four weeks of its average sales to these
wholesalers primarily due to sales incentives offered by the Company to them. As a result, the Company estimates the Company's 2001 domestic pharmaceutical sales included approximately
four weeks of additional sales. The Company believes current inventories of its products held by wholesalers in the U.S. significantly exceed levels the Company considers desirable on a
going-forward basis. The Company is in the process of developing a plan to reduce these wholesaler inventory levels. The Company expects this reduction in wholesaler inventories to lower levels will
negatively impact its financial results in future periods. The Company will make further disclosure later in April 2002 about the plans it is developing to reduce wholesaler inventory levels and the
Company's expectations with respect to the likely impact on its financial results.

In
2001, worldwide pharmaceutical sales, on a stand-alone basis, increased 6% (8% excluding foreign exchange), with U.S. pharmaceutical sales up 8% over the prior year. Key pharmaceutical products and
their sales include the following:

Sales
of PRAVACHOL*, a cholesterol-lowering agent and the Company's largest-selling product, increased 20% to $2,173 million. Domestic sales increased 21% to $1,366 million, while
international sales increased 17% (22% excluding foreign exchange) to $807 million. In December 2001, the FDA approved an 80-milligram version of PRAVACHOL*.

GLUCOPHAGE
franchise sales increased 42% to $2,682 million. GLUCOPHAGE IR, the leading branded oral medication for treatment of non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes, saw
sales increase 18% to $2,049 million. The Company expects sales of GLUCOPHAGE IR will decline significantly because generic metformin became available in the U.S. in January 2002.
GLUCOVANCE, a new oral
combination drug, and GLUCOPHAGE XR Extended Release tablets had sales of $330 million and $303 million, respectively, compared with introductory sales in 2000 of $110 million and
$50 million, respectively.

Sales
of PLAVIX, a platelet aggregation inhibitor, increased 50% to $1,350 million, driven in part by the positive results of the CURE study (Clopidogrel in Unstable angina to prevent Recurrent
ischemic Events), which were published in the

New England Journal of Medicine

in August 2001. Sales of AVAPRO, an angiotensin II receptor blocker
for the treatment of hypertension, increased 34% to $510 million. AVAPRO and PLAVIX are cardiovascular products that were launched from the alliance between Bristol-Myers Squibb and
Sanofi-Synthelabo.

Sales
of TAXOL*, the Company's leading anticancer agent, decreased 25% to $1,197 million. International sales increased 8% (15% excluding foreign exchange) to $652 million, led by strong
sales in Japan and France. Domestic sales decreased 45% to $545 million due to generic competition.

Sales
of PARAPLATIN*, which is used in combination therapy for the treatment of ovarian cancer, increased 2% to $702 million.

MONOPRIL*,
a second-generation angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, had increased sales of 4% reaching $458 million.


Sales
of SERZONE*, a novel treatment for depression, increased 14% to $409 million.

Sales
of BUSPAR*, an antianxiety agent, decreased 52% to $338 million due to generic competition.

Sales
of TEQUIN*, a quinolone antibiotic, increased to $320 million from $131 million in 2000. In November 2001, the FDA approved TEQUIN* for short-course (five-day)
regimen in treatment of acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis.

Sales
of VIDEX*, an antiretroviral agent, increased 28% to $259 million due to increased sales of VIDEX* EC enteric-coated beadlets, launched in 2000.

Sales
from the Oncology Therapeutics Network, a specialty distributor of anticancer medicines and related products, increased 33% to $1,433 million.

Total
infant formula sales increased 4% to $1,255 million. Worldwide sales of ENFAMIL*, the Company's largest-selling infant formula, increased 6% to $773 million.

Sales
of ostomy products increased 5% (9% excluding foreign exchange) to $450 million, while sales of wound care products increased 9% (13% excluding foreign exchange) to $252 million.

Earnings

In 2001, earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 11% to $6,442 million from $5,826 million in 2000 on a stand-alone basis, which
excludes the impact of the DuPont, ImClone and nonrecurring items described below. Net earnings, on this basis, increased 10% to $4,736 million compared with $4,309 million in 2000.
Basic earnings per share increased 11% to $2.44 from $2.19 in the prior year, and diluted earnings per share increased 12% to $2.41 from $2.16. Net earnings margins increased to 24.8% in 2001 from
23.7% in 2000. In 2000, net earnings excluding the nonrecurring items described below were $4,309 million, a 14% increase over 1999. On this basis, basic earnings per share and diluted earnings
per share increased 15% and 16%, respectively, over 1999, and net earnings margins increased to 23.7% in 2000 from 22.4% in 1999.

The
Company recorded certain nonrecurring items (nonrecurring items) in 2001 and 2000 to earnings from continuing operations. The nonrecurring items included in 2001 were acquired
in-process research and development charges of $2,744 million before taxes related to the DuPont and ImClone transactions, pretax expenses on the DuPont and ImClone transactions of
$246 million (which includes the loss from operations, amortization and interest expenses and other onetime costs), a gain on sales of businesses (three branded pharmaceutical
products—CORZIDE*, DELESTROGEN* and FLORINEF*; the licensing rights to CORGARD* in the U.S.; and its SOLAGE product line) of $315 million before taxes and restructuring and other
charges of $781 million before taxes, related primarily to workforce reductions, contract sales force termination, exiting product lines and the downsizing and streamlining of business
operations. In 2000, nonrecurring items include the gain on sales of businesses (three pharmaceutical products—ESTRACE CREAM*, OVCON 35* and OVCON 50*—and its SEA
BREEZE* brand in Japan) of $160 million pretax, as well as restructuring charges of $508 million before taxes in connection with workforce reductions and asset write-downs related to the
consolidation and closure of plants and facilities.

The
effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations before income taxes was 15.4% in 2001 compared with 25.2% in 2000 and 26.5% in 1999. The decline in the effective income tax rate
to 15.4% in 2001 is due to lower pretax income in the U.S. as a result of the write-off of acquired in-process research and development and other nonrecurring items. The
effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, on a stand-alone basis, was 26.5% in 2001 compared with
26.0% in 2000, excluding nonrecurring items, and 26.5% in 1999. The effective income tax rate for 2001, on a stand-alone basis, increased as a result of lower production of TAXOL* and BUSPAR* in lower
tax jurisdictions.


Expenses

Total costs and expenses, on a stand-alone basis excluding the impact of the DuPont and ImClone transactions and nonrecurring items, as a percentage of sales, improved over the
last three years to 66.2% in 2001 compared with 68.0% in 2000 and 69.4% in 1999. Including DuPont, ImClone and nonrecurring items, continuing operations total cost and expenses, as a percentage of
sales, were 84.6%.

Cost
of products sold, as a percentage of sales, increased to 28.4% in 2001 from 26.1% in 2000 principally due to increased sales of lower-margin products from the Oncology Therapeutics Network and
from a decline in higher-margin TAXOL* and BUSPAR* sales. Including DuPont, cost of products sold for continuing operations, as a percentage of sales, increased to 28.7%. In 2000, cost of products
sold, as a percentage of sales, declined to 26.1% compared with 26.9% in 1999 principally due to manufacturing variances.

Advertising
and promotion expenses decreased 14% from the prior year to $1,433 million in 2001 primarily due to lower spending on TAXOL* and BUSPAR*. In 2000, advertising and promotion expenses
increased 8% from 1999 to $1,672 million. As a percentage of sales, 2001 advertising and promotion expenses decreased to 7.4%, while 2000 expenses remained at the 1999 level of 9.2%.

Marketing,
selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 20.1% in 2001 from 21.2% in 2000 and 22.4% in 1999. This decreasing trend is a result of continued improvement in
cost-efficiencies. In 2001, the decline is also partially due to a reduction in sales force expenses.

The
Company's investment in research and development, on a stand-alone basis, totaled $2,124 million in 2001, an increase of 10% over 2000, and as a percentage of sales, increased to 11.1% in
2001, compared with 10.6% in 2000 and 10.4% in 1999. This spending level reflects the Company's commitment to research over a broad range of therapeutic areas and to the clinical development of new
products. In 2001, research and development spending dedicated to pharmaceutical products increased 11%, and was 13.5% of pharmaceutical sales compared with 13.0% and 12.6% in 2000 and 1999,
respectively. Including DuPont and ImClone, research and development expenses increased 17% to $2,259 million, or 11.6% of sales.

As
described in the notes to the financial statements, in 2001 the Company divested three pharmaceutical products—CORZIDE*, DELESTROGEN*, and FLORINEF*; the licensing rights to CORGARD* in
the U.S.; ESTRACE* tablets; the Apothecon commodity business; and its SOLAGE product line. In 2000, the Company completed the sale of three pharmaceutical products—ESTRACE CREAM*, OVCON
35* AND OVCON 50*—as well as its SEA BREEZE* brand in Japan. In 1999, the Company completed the sale of Laboratori Guieu, SpA, an Italian-based gynecologic, pediatric and dermatologic
products business. Also in 1999, the Company acquired CAL-C-TOSE*, a nutritional milk modifier product in Mexico.

Discontinued Operations

As described in Note 2 to the financial statements, in the fourth quarter 2001, the Company completed the sale of Clairol, which resulted in a pretax gain of
$4.2 billion ($2.5 billion after taxes). The gain is included in the net gain on disposal of discontinued operations. Also in 2001, the Company spun off Zimmer Holdings, Inc., in
a tax-free transaction, resulting in a common stock dividend of $203 million.

In
2000, the Company completed the sale of Matrix Essentials, Inc. (an affiliate of Clairol), resulting in a pretax gain of $402 million ($240 million after tax). The gain is
included in the net gain on disposal of discontinued operations. Also in 2000, the Company recorded restructuring charges to discontinued operations of $34 million before taxes in connection
with workforce reductions.

Net
earnings from discontinued operations, which includes earnings only through the date of divestiture, decreased to $226 million in 2001 from $375 million in 2000 and
$378 million in 1999.


Geographic Areas

Bristol-Myers Squibb products are available in virtually every country in the world. The Company's largest markets are the U.S., France, Japan, Germany, Italy and Canada.

Sales
in the U.S. increased 9% in 2001. Products with strong growth included GLUCOPHAGE, PLAVIX, PRAVACHOL*, TEQUIN* and AVAPRO. TAXOL* and BUSPAR* sales declined due to generic competition. In 2000,
sales in the U.S. increased 14% primarily due to the growth of GLUCOPHAGE, PLAVIX, BUSPAR*, PARAPLATIN* and AVAPRO.

Sales
in Europe, Mid-East and Africa increased 6% in 2001. Excluding foreign exchange, sales increased 10% as a result of the strong growth of PRAVACHOL* and TAXOL* in France and Italy. In
2000, sales in Europe, Mid-East and Africa decreased 9%. Sales increased 3% excluding foreign exchange as a result of the growth of PRAVACHOL*, TAXOL*, AVAPRO and PLAVIX in France, Italy
and Spain. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in CAPOTEN sales due to generic competition.

Sales
in Other Western Hemisphere countries decreased 2% in 2001. Excluding foreign exchange, sales in the region increased 3%. The unfavorable impact of foreign exchange was felt primarily in Brazil.
Growth was driven primarily by increased sales in Mexico. In 2000, sales in Other Western Hemisphere countries increased 3% (6% excluding foreign exchange) primarily as a result of growth in Canada
due to increased sales of AVAPRO and ENFAMIL* and in Mexico, due to the growth of ENFAMIL* and CAL-C-TOSE*.

Sales
in the Pacific region decreased 1% in 2001 (an 11% increase excluding foreign exchange). The unfavorable impact of foreign exchange was felt primarily in Japan. Products with strong growth
included TAXOL* and PARAPLATIN* in Japan and nutritional products in the Philippines, Thailand and China. In 2000, Pacific region sales increased 12% (11% excluding foreign exchange) as a result of
increases in BUFFERIN*, TAXOL* and PARAPLATIN*.

Financial Instruments

The Company is exposed to market risk due to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. To reduce that risk, the Company enters into certain derivative financial
instruments, when available on a cost-effective basis, to hedge its underlying economic exposure. These instruments also are managed on a consolidated basis to efficiently net exposures
and thus take advantage of any natural offsets. Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading purposes. Gains and losses on hedging transactions are offset by gains and losses on the
underlying exposures being hedged.

Foreign
exchange option contracts and forward contracts are used to hedge anticipated transactions. The Company's primary foreign currency exposures in relation to the U.S. dollar are the Japanese

The
table below summarizes the Company's outstanding foreign exchange contracts as of December 31, 2001. The fair value of foreign exchange option contracts is estimated by using the
Black-Scholes model and is based on year-end currency rates. The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is based on year-end forward currency rates. The fair value of
option contracts and forward contracts should be viewed


in relation to the fair value of the underlying hedged transactions and the overall reduction in exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

At
December 31, 2000, the Company held right-to-sell option contracts with an aggregate notional amount and fair value of $1,319 million and $73 million,
respectively. These contracts primarily related to option contracts with the right to sell euros, Mexican pesos and Brazilian reals. Other contracts at December 31, 2000, primarily included
option contracts with the right to buy Japanese yen for U.S. dollars, which had an aggregate notional amount and fair value of $76 million and $1 million.

The
Company maintains cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable securities with various financial institutions. These financial institutions are located primarily in the U.S. and Europe.
Company policy is designed to limit exposure to any one financial institution.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets

, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. SFAS
No. 144 addresses accounting models for use in determining the impairment of long-lived assets and the appropriate methodology for
recording an impairment loss. The initial adoption of this accounting requirement will not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In
June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

, effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2001. SFAS No. 142 addresses the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets acquired outside a business combination and the recognition and measurement of
goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition. Under the new rules, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual
impairment tests. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. Application of the nonamortization provisions will not have a material effect on the Company's
financial statements.


Goodwill
associated with the DuPont and ImClone transactions and all future business combinations will not be amortized, but will instead be reviewed for impairment at least annually. The Company will
adopt the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets as of January 1, 2002.

Critical Accounting Policies

The critical accounting policies of the Company are described in Note 1 to the financial statements. The policies on investments, goodwill, and acquired
in-process research and development are considered noteworthy because they involve estimates, judgments or significant transactions.

Financial Position

Cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable securities totaled $5.7 billion at December 31, 2001, compared with $3.4 billion at
December 31, 2000. Working capital was $3.5 billion at December 31, 2001, compared with $4.2 billion at December 31, 2000, resulting from higher accrued liabilities
due to the restructuring reserves established in the current year. Cash and cash equivalents, time deposits, marketable securities and the conversion of other working-capital items are expected to
fund the near-term operations of the Company.

Cash
and cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable securities at December 31, 2001, were denominated primarily in U.S. dollar instruments with near-term maturities. The average
interest yield on cash and cash equivalents was 2.0% at December 31, 2001, while interest yields on time deposits and marketable securities averaged 1.7%.

Short-term
borrowings and long-term debt at December 31, 2001, are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars but also include Japanese yen long-term debt of
$217 million.

Internally
generated cash provided from operations was $5.4 billion in 2001, $4.7 billion in 2000 and $4.2 billion in 1999. Cash provided from operations continued to be the
Company's primary source of funds to finance operating needs and expenditures for new plants and equipment. As part of the Company's ongoing commitment to improve plant efficiency and maintain
superior research facilities, the Company has invested $2.3 billion in capital expansion over the past three years. Cash flow from operations also included product liability payments and
pension contributions.

Cash
provided from operations also was used over the past three years to pay dividends of $5.8 billion, to finance $5.3 billion of the Company's share repurchase program and to fund
business acquisitions, including the purchase of patents and trademarks at a cost of $595 million. The Company's share repurchase program authorizes the Company to purchase common stock from
time to time in the open market or through private transactions as market conditions permit.

During
2001, the Company purchased 27 million shares of common stock at a cost of $1.6 billion, bringing the total shares acquired since the program's inception to 367 million
shares. During the past three years, the Company has repurchased 89 million shares at a cost of $5.3 billion.

Employment
levels of 46,000 at December 2001 increased from prior-year levels of 44,000 as a result of the DuPont acquisition.

Forward Looking Information

This annual report on Form 10K (including documents incorporated by reference) and other written and oral statements the Company makes from time to time contain certain
"forward-looking" statements within the meaning of the Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify these
forward-looking statements by the fact they use words such as "should", "anticipate", "estimate", "may", "will", "project", "intend", "plan", "believe" and other words of similar meaning and
expression in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial


performance. One can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements are likely to relate to, among other
things, our goals, plans and projections regarding our financial position, results of operations, market position and product development, which are based on current expectations that involve inherent
risks and uncertainties, including factors that could delay, divert or change any of them in the next several years.

Although
it is not possible to predict or identify all factors, they may including the following:

•

New
government laws and regulations, such as (i) health care reform initiatives in the United States at the state and federal level and in other
countries; (ii) changes in the FDA and foreign regulatory approval processes that may cause delays in approving, or preventing the approval of, new products; (iii) tax changes such as
the phasing out of tax benefits heretofore available in the United States and certain foreign countries; and (iv) new laws, regulations and judicial decisions affecting pricing or marketing.

•

Competitive
factors, such as (i) new products developed by competitors that have lower prices or superior performance features or that are otherwise
competitive with Bristol-Myers Squibb's current products; (ii) generic competition as Bristol-Myers Squibb products mature and patents expire on products; (iii) technological advances
and patents attained by competitors; and (iv) problems with licensors, suppliers and distributors; and business combinations among the Company's competitors or major customers.

•

Difficulties
and delays inherent in product development, manufacturing and sale, such as (i) products that may appear promising in development may
fail to reach market for numerous reasons, including efficacy or safety concerns, the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and the difficulty or excessive cost to manufacture;
(ii) seizure or recall of products; (iii) the failure to obtain, the imposition of limitations on the use of, or loss of patent and other intellectual property rights;
(iv) failure to comply with Current Good Manufacturing Practices and other application regulations and quality assurance guidelines that could lead to temporary manufacturing shutdowns, product
shortages and delays in product manufacturing; and (v) other manufacturing or distribution problems.

•

Legal
difficulties, any of which can preclude or delay commercialization of products or adversely affect profitability, including (i) intellectual
property disputes; (ii) adverse decisions in litigation, including product liability and commercial cases; (iii) the inability to obtain adequate insurance with respect to this type of
liability; (iv) recalls of pharmaceutical products or forced closings of manufacturing plants; (v) government investigations; (vi) claims asserting violations of securities,
antitrust and other laws; and (vii) environmental matters.

•

Increasing
pricing pressures worldwide, including rules and practices of managed care groups and institutional and governmental purchasers, judicial
decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement and pricing in general.

•

Fluctuations
in buying patterns of major distributors, retail chains and other trade buyers which may result from seasonality, pricing, wholesaler buying
decisions or other factors.

•

Greater
than expected costs and other difficulties related to the integration of DuPont Pharmaceuticals and unanticipated effects and difficulties of other
acquisitions, dispositions and other events, including obtaining regulatory approvals occurring in connection with evolving business strategies.

•

Changes
to advertising and promotional spending and other categories of spending that may affect sales.


•

Changes
in the Company's structure resulting from acquisitions, divestitures, mergers, restructurings or other strategic initiatives.

•

Economic
factors over which Bristol-Myers Squibb has no control such as changes of business and economic conditions including, but not limited to, changes in
interest rates and fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates.

•

Changes
in business, political and economic conditions due to the recent terrorist attacks in the U.S., the threat of future terrorist activity in the U.S.
and other parts of the world and related U.S. military action overseas.

•

Changes
in accounting standards promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission or the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants, which may require adjustments to financial statements.

No
assurance can be given that any goal or plan set forth in forward-looking statements can be achieved and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of
the date made. Bristol-Myers Squibb undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statement as a result of future events or developments.

BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions)

Note 1    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Consolidation—The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and all of its subsidiaries.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents—Cash and cash equivalents primarily include securities with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase, recorded at cost, which approximates
market value.

Time
Deposits and Marketable Securities—Time deposits and marketable securities are available for sale and are recorded at fair value, which approximates cost.

Inventory
Valuation—Inventories are generally stated at average cost, not in excess of market.

Capital
Assets and Depreciation—Expenditures for additions, renewals and betterments are capitalized at cost. Depreciation is generally computed by the straight-line method
based on the estimated useful lives of the related assets. The estimated useful lives of the major classes of depreciable assets are 50 years for buildings and 3 to 40 years for
machinery, equipment and fixtures. The Company periodically evaluates whether current events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable assets may not be recoverable. An
estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the asset, or the appropriate group of assets, is compared with the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists.

Investments—The
Company consolidates all majority (more than 50 percent) owned subsidiaries. The Company accounts for 50 percent or less owned companies over which it has the
ability to exercise significant influence using the equity method of accounting. The Company's share of net income or losses of investments is included in the consolidated statement of earnings. The
Company periodically reviews these investments for impairment and adjusts these investments to their fair value when a decline in market value is deemed to be other than temporary.

Acquisitions—The
Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141,

Business Combinations

. This statement
requires that companies use the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated and/or consummated after June 30, 2001.

Goodwill—In
June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets

, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. SFAS No. 142 addresses the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets acquired
outside a business combination and the recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition. Under the new rules, goodwill will no longer be amortized
but will be subject to annual impairment tests. In connection with this accounting change, the goodwill resulting from the Company's DuPont Pharmaceuticals acquisition and ImClone investment will not
be amortized.

The
goodwill arising from business acquisitions, prior to June 30, 2001, is amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from 15 to 40 years. This goodwill will
not be amortized after December 31, 2001. Application of the nonamortization provisions will not have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.

Intangible
Assets—Intangible assets consist of patents, technology and licenses and are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from 3 to 17 years.
Accumulated amortization on intangible assets was $631 million in 2001 and $495 million in 2000.

Intangible
assets are periodically reviewed for impairment based on an assessment of future operations (including cash flows).


Acquired
In-Process Research and Development—The fair value of acquired in-process research and development is determined by independent appraisal and based on the
present value of each research project's projected cash flows, utilizing an income approach. Future cash flows are predominately based on the net income forecast of each project consistent with
historical pricing, margins and expense levels of similar products. Revenues are estimated based on relevant market size and growth factors, expected industry trends, individual project life cycles
and the life of each research project's underlying patent. In determining the fair value of each research project, expected revenues are first adjusted for technical risk of completion. The resulting
cash flows are then discounted at a rate approximating the Company's weighted average cost of capital, 13% in 2001.

Product
Liability—Accruals for product liability are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be
reasonably estimated, based on existing information. These accruals are adjusted periodically as assessment efforts progress or as additional information becomes available.

Receivables
for related insurance or other third-party recoveries for product liabilities are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a recovery will be realized. Insurance
recoverable recorded on the balance sheet has, in general, payment terms of two years or less.

Derivative
Financial Instruments—Derivative financial instruments are used by the Company principally in the management of its interest rate and foreign currency exposures. The Company
does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

The
Company records all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in a derivative's fair value are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met. If the
derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized as a charge or credit to earnings.
If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in the
consolidated statement of earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized as a charge or credit to earnings.

The
Company designates and assigns derivatives as hedges of forecasted transactions, specific assets or specific liabilities. When hedged assets or liabilities are sold or extinguished or the
forecasted transactions being hedged are no longer expected to occur, the Company recognizes the gain or loss on the designated hedging financial instruments.

Revenue
Recognition—Revenue from product sales is recognized upon shipment to customers.

Earnings
Per Share—Basic earnings per common share are computed using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share are computed
using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year plus the incremental shares outstanding assuming the exercise of dilutive stock options.

Note 2    DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In 2000, the Company announced the planned divestitures of its Clairol and Zimmer businesses. Accordingly, the operations of Clairol (which includes its Matrix
Essentials, Inc. [Matrix] affiliate) and


Zimmer have been reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings.

On
November 15, 2001, the Company completed the sale of Clairol to Procter & Gamble for cash proceeds of approximately $5.0 billion. The sale resulted in a pretax gain of
$4.2 billion ($2.5 billion after taxes), which is included in the gain on disposal of discontinued operations.

On
August 6, 2001, the Company spun off Zimmer Holdings, Inc., in a tax-free distribution, resulting in a common stock dividend of $203 million.

In
2000, the Company completed the sale of Matrix to Cosmair, Inc., a wholly owned U.S. subsidiary of L'Oreal S.A., resulting in a pretax gain of $402 million
($240 million after taxes). The gain is included in the gain on disposal of discontinued operations.

The
net sales and earnings of discontinued operations are as follows:

Earnings
before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2000, include restructuring charges of $34 million.

The
consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of cash flows include the Clairol and Zimmer businesses through date of disposition. The net assets of discontinued operations at
December 31, 2000, were $924 million, consisting of current assets of $866 million and long-term assets of $616 million less liabilities (principally current)
of $558 million.

The
Company uses a centralized approach to the cash management and financing of its operations and accordingly, the Company did not allocate debt to these businesses.

Cash
flows from operating and investing activities of discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $5.3 billion (including approximately
$5.0 billion of proceeds from the sale of Clairol), $998 million (including $438 million of proceeds from the sale of Matrix) and $261 million, respectively.


Note 3    ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

DuPont Pharmaceuticals Acquisition

On October 1, 2001, the Company acquired the DuPont Pharmaceuticals business (DuPont) from E. I. duPont de Nemours and Company for cash of $7.8 billion. The
results of DuPont have been included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. DuPont is primarily a domestic pharmaceutical and imagery product business focused on
research and development. This acquisition was financed with proceeds from the issuance of $1.5 billion of commercial paper, issuance of $5.0 billion of medium-term notes and
internal cash flows.

The
purchase price allocation has been prepared on a preliminary basis, and reasonable changes are expected as additional information becomes available. Following is a summary of the estimated fair
values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of the acquisition:

The
total intangible assets of $1,976 million will be amortized over their weighted-average useful lives and include core and developed technology of $1,783 million (15 and
11 years weighted-average useful life, respectively) and patents of $193 million (11 year weighted-average useful life).

The
goodwill of $3,884 million was assigned to the pharmaceuticals reporting unit. Of that total amount, $2,418 million is expected to be deductible for tax purposes over a
15 year period.

The
preliminary value of $2,009 million assigned to acquired in-process research and development was charged to earnings in the fourth quarter of 2001. The charge was associated
with five research projects in the Cardiovascular, Central Nervous System, Oncology, and Anti-Infective therapeutic areas ranging from the preclinical to the phase II development stage.
The amount was determined by identifying research projects for which technological feasibility has not been established and for which there is no alternative future use. The projected FDA approval
dates are years 2005 through 2008, at which time the Company expects these projects to begin to generate cash flows. The cost to complete these research projects is estimated at $1.2 billion.
All of the research and development projects considered in the valuation are subject to the normal risks and uncertainties associated with demonstrating the safety and efficacy required to obtain FDA
approval.


In
connection with the acquisition, the Company incurred $640 million of restructuring costs as a result of severance and relocation of workforce, the elimination of duplicate facilities and
contract terminations. Such costs have been recognized by the Company as a liability assumed as of the acquisition date, resulting in additional goodwill.

These
restructuring costs consisted of $350 million of employee termination benefits for approximately 1,800 employees, $110 million related to the closure of facilities and
$180 million for contract
terminations. The $640 million originally recorded in accrued expenses was reduced to $523 million at December 31, 2001.

The
Company also incurred $61 million for purchase accounting adjustments and other costs in connection with the acquisition, which were expensed in the fourth quarter 2001.

Other

In 2001, the Company completed the sale of three pharmaceutical products—CORZIDE*, DELESTROGEN* and FLORINEF*; the licensing rights to CORGARD* in the U.S.;
ESTRACE*
tablets; the Apothecon commodity business; and its SOLAGE product line, all of which resulted in a pretax gain of $392 million.

In
2000, the Company completed the sale of three pharmaceutical products—ESTRACE CREAM*, OVCON 35* and OVCON 50*—as well as its SEA BREEZE* brand in Japan resulting in a pretax
gain of $160 million, recorded in continuing operations.

In
June 1999, the Company acquired CAL-C-TOSE*, a nutritional milk modifier. In September 1999, the Company entered into a development and commercialization
agreement for ARIPIPRAZOLE, a novel drug under study in phase III trials as a treatment for schizophrenia, with Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. In December 1999, the Company completed
the sale of Laboratori Guieu, a gynecologic, pediatric and dermatologic products business headquartered in Milan, Italy. The gain on the sale was not material.


Note 4    RESTRUCTURING

During 2001, the Company recorded pretax charges of $739 million for continuing operations. These charges were primarily for restructuring activities related to
workforce reductions, contract sales force termination, exiting product lines and the downsizing and streamlining of business operations and consisted of $272 million of employee termination
benefits for approximately 3,900 employees, $128 million of asset write-downs related to the closure of manufacturing and research facilities, $95 million of contract sales force
termination, $150 million of costs to exit certain product lines and $94 million of other expenses. The $739 million of charges were reported on the balance sheet as a reduction
of current assets ($150 million) and property, plant and equipment ($128 million) and an increase in accrued expenses ($461 million). The $461 million liability originally
recorded in accrued expenses was reduced to $308 million at December 31, 2001. The Company expects to substantially complete these restructuring activities by the end of 2002. Also
during 2001, the Company recorded a pretax charge of $42 million for settlement of litigation over promotional claims brought by a distributor of store-brand infant formula against Mead
Johnson.

In
2000, the Company recorded pretax charges of $508 million for continuing operations. These restructuring charges consisted primarily of workforce reductions and the downsizing and
streamlining of operations in certain international markets and the ConvaTec business, as well as reorganization of the Company's Global Business Services. At December 31, 2001, these actions
were substantially complete and the remaining liability was $40 million.

Note 7    ALLIANCES AND INVESTMENTS

In November 2001, the Company purchased 14.4 million shares of ImClone Systems, Inc. (ImClone), for $70 per share, or $1,007 million, which
represented approximately 19.9% of the ImClone shares outstanding just prior to the commencement of the public tender offer. This transaction is being accounted for using the equity method of
accounting. The completion of the public tender offer is part of a strategic agreement between the Company and ImClone that also includes an arrangement to codevelop and copromote an investigational
cancer drug, Erbitux, for a series of payments totaling $1 billion of which $200 million was paid in 2001.

On
March 5, 2002, the agreement with ImClone was revised to reduce the total payments to $900 million from $1 billion. Under the new agreement the Company paid ImClone
$140 million in the first quarter of 2002 and will pay ImClone $60 million in March 2003 and an aggregate of $500 million upon the achievement of two milestones. Also under
the agreement, the Company will pay ImClone a distribution fee based on a flat rate of 39% of product revenues in North America.

In
the fourth quarter of 2001, these transactions resulted in a pretax charge of approximately $735 million, comprised of $575 million for the write-off of acquired
in-process research and development related to the equity investment and $160 million for the write-off of milestone payments. The $140 million paid upon signing
the revised agreement will be expensed to in-process research and development in the first quarter of 2002. The acquired in-process research and development charge related to
three oncology research projects in the Phase I or later stage of development with one research project, Erbitux, in late Phase III development. The amount was determined by identifying research
projects in areas for which technological feasibility has not been established and for which there is no alternative future use. The projected U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval dates
used were years 2002 through 2008, at which time the Company expects these projects to begin to generate cash flows. The cost to complete these projects is estimated at $323 million. All of the
research and development projects considered in the valuation are subject to the normal risks and uncertainties associated with demonstrating the safety and efficacy required to obtain FDA approval.
The purchase price allocation resulted in $66 million of patent and technology intangible assets that will be amortized over their weighted-average useful lives of 17 years and
approximately $375 million of goodwill, which is not amortized.

On
December 28, 2001, ImClone announced that the FDA refused to accept for filing the Biologics License Application (BLA) that had been submitted by ImClone for Erbitux. The BLA had been


submitted to gain marketing approval to treat irinotecan-refractory colorectal carcinoma. The Company and ImClone met with the FDA in February 2002 and are currently evaluating next steps.

On
January 18, 2002, the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the House Energy and Commerce Committee announced it is investigating questions about the conduct of ImClone in the
development of Erbitux. On January 25, 2002, ImClone announced it had received an informal inquiry from the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as inquiries from the Justice Department
and the aforementioned subcommittee. The Company will cooperate with these investigations.

Of
the $1,207 million paid for the equity investment ($1,007 million) and the milestone payment ($200 million), $735 million was expensed as acquired in-process
research and development and the remaining $472 million was recorded as an equity investment. An additional $9 million was recorded to the investment primarily for acquisition costs,
resulting in a carrying value of $481 million at December 31, 2001. On a per-share basis, the carrying value of the Company's ImClone investment and the closing market value
of ImClone shares as of December 31, 2001, were $33.40 and $46.46, respectively. Given the FDA's December 28, 2001, action and the market value of ImClone shares since
December 31, 2001 ($19.58 per share as of January 24, 2002), it is possible that the Company could recognize a charge for impairment of the investment in ImClone in future periods based
upon further evaluation of the status of Erbitux and the market value of ImClone.

In
1997, the Company and Sanofi-Synthelabo (Sanofi) entered into a codevelopment, comarketing agreement for two products: AVAPRO (irbesartan), an angiotensin II receptor antagonist indicated for the
treatment of hypertension, and PLAVIX (clopidogrel), a platelet inhibitor. The worldwide alliance operates under the framework of two geographic territories: one in the Americas and Australia and the
other in Europe and Asia. Two territory partnerships were formed to manage central expenses, such as marketing, research and development, royalties, and to supply finished product to the individual
countries. At the country level, agreements to either copromote (whereby a partnership is formed between the parties to sell each brand) or to comarket (whereby the parties operate and sell their
brands independently of each other) are in place.

The
Company acts as the operating partner for the territories covering the Americas principally the U.S., Canada, Puerto Rico, and Latin America countries, and Australia and owns the majority
controlling interest in the territory. As such, the Company consolidates all country partnership results and records Sanofi's share of the results as a minority interest expense, included in other
income/expense. The Company recorded sales in this territory and in comarketing countries of $1,859 million, $1,284 million and $802 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Sanofi
acts as the operating partner of the territories covering Europe and Asia. The Company accounts for the investment in partnership entities in these territories as an equity investment and
records its share of results in other income/expense. Income before taxes from these partnership entities for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $82 million,
$57 million and $14 million, respectively.

The
effective tax rate on continuing operations declined to 15.4% in 2001 from 25.2% in 2000 due primarily to lower pretax income in the U.S. resulting from the write-off of acquired
in-process research and development and other nonrecurring items in 2001.

Prepaid
taxes at December 31, 2001 and 2000, were $890 million and $537 million, respectively. The deferred income taxes, included in Other Assets/(Liabilities), at
December 31, 2001 and 2000, were $630 million and $(425) million, respectively.

The
increase in the net prepaid and deferred tax assets to $1,520 million at December 31, 2001 from $112 million at December 31, 2000 relates primarily to acquired
in-process research and development and restructuring charges in 2001 that will give rise to tax deductions in future years.

Income
taxes paid during the year were $1,021 million, $1,620 million and $805 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

The
Company has settled its U.S. federal income tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service through 1994.

U.S.
federal income taxes have not been provided on substantially all of the unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, since it is management's practice and intent to reinvest such
earnings in the operations of these subsidiaries. The total amount of the net unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries was approximately $8.8 billion at December 31,
2001.

Included in short-term borrowings were amounts due to banks, primarily foreign, of $140 million and $152 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively, and current installments of long-term debt of $34 million at December 31, 2001, and $10 million at December 31, 2000. The average interest rate on
short-term borrowings was 7.41% and on current installments of long-term debt was 4.03% at December 31, 2001.

During
2001, the Company consolidated its two credit facilities, aggregating $500 million with a syndicate of lenders as support for its commercial paper program. The new credit facility
consists of a $500 million, five-year revolving credit facility, extendable at each anniversary date with the consent of the lenders. There were no borrowings outstanding under the
credit facility at December 31, 2001. In addition, the Company has unused short-term lines of credit with foreign banks of $290 million.

Each
share of the Company's preferred stock is convertible into 16.96 shares of common stock and is callable at the Company's option. The reductions in the number of issued shares of preferred stock
in 2001, 2000 and 1999 were due to conversions into shares of common stock.

Dividends
per common share were $1.10 in 2001, $0.98 in 2000 and $0.86 in 1999.

Stock Compensation Plans

Under the Company's 1997 Stock Incentive Plan, officers, directors and key employees may be granted options to purchase the Company's common stock at no less than 100% of the
market price on the date the option is granted. Options generally become exercisable in installments of 25% per year on each of the first through the fourth anniversaries of the grant date and have a
maximum term of 10 years. Additionally, the plan provides for the granting of stock appreciation rights whereby the grantee may surrender exercisable options and receive common stock and/or
cash measured by the excess of the market price of the common stock over the option exercise price. The plan also provides for the granting of performance-based stock options to certain key
executives.

Under
the terms of the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, additional shares are authorized in the amount of 0.9% of the outstanding shares per year through 2002. The plan incorporates the
Company's long-term performance awards.

In
addition, the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan provides for the granting of up to 20,000,000 shares of common stock to key employees, subject to restrictions as to continuous employment except in the case
of death or normal retirement. Restrictions generally expire over a five-year period from date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized over the restricted period. At
December 31, 2001, a total of 1,286,771 restricted shares were outstanding under the plan.


Under
the TeamShare Stock Option Plan, all full-time employees, excluding key executives, meeting certain years of service requirements, are granted options to purchase the Company's
common stock at the market price on the date the options are granted. The Company has authorized 62,000,000 shares for issuance under the plan. Individual grants generally became exercisable on or
after the third anniversary of the grant date. As of December 31, 2001, 30,430,045 shares have been exercised under the plan.

The
Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

, and related interpretations in
accounting for its plans. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for its stock-based compensation plans other than for restricted stock and performance-based awards. Had compensation
cost for the Company's other stock option plans been determined based upon the fair value at the grant date for awards under these plans consistent with the methodology prescribed under SFAS
No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

, the Company's net income and earnings per share would have been reduced by approximately
$246 million, or $.13 per common share, basic and diluted, in 2001, $218 million, or $.11 per common share, basic and diluted, in 2000 and $198 million, or $.10 per common share,
basic and diluted, in 1999. The fair value of the options granted during 2001, 2000 and 1999 was estimated as $22.59 per common share, $17.17 per common share and $17.37 per common share,
respectively, on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:

with the spin-off of Zimmer on August 6, 2001, unexercised Bristol-Myers Squibb stock options held by Zimmer employees were converted into Zimmer stock
options. For remaining unexercised Bristol-Myers Squibb stock options, the number of stock options and the exercise price were adjusted to preserve the intrinsic value of the stock options that
existed prior to the spin-off.

BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in millions)

At December 31, 2001, 217,702,408 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to stock plans, options and conversions of preferred stock. Options related to discontinued
operations and included in the above amounts are not material.

Note 13    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company is exposed to market risk due to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. As a result, the Company utilizes foreign exchange option and forward
contracts to offset the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on anticipated foreign currency transactions, primarily intercompany inventory purchases expected to occur within the next year.

The
Company has exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, which approximated $2,079 million and $1,781 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively, primarily in Europe, Japan, Mexico and Canada. The Company mitigates the effect of these exposures through third-party borrowings. The exposures to net foreign currency denominated
assets and liabilities related to discontinued operations and included in the above amounts are not material.

Foreign
exchange option contracts and forward contracts are used to hedge anticipated transactions. The Company's primary foreign currency exposures in relation to the U.S. dollar are the Japanese
yen, euro, Mexican peso and Canadian dollar. The notional amounts of the Company's foreign exchange derivative contracts at December 31, 2001 and 2000, were $1,387 million and
$1,395 million, respectively. For these derivatives, which qualify as hedges of future cash flows, the effective portion of changes in fair value is temporarily recorded in comprehensive income
and then recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. Any ineffective portion of hedges is reported in earnings as it occurs. The notional amounts of foreign exchange derivative
contracts related to discontinued operations and included in the above amounts are not material.

To
manage interest rate risk, the Company utilizes interest rate swap contracts. The Company enters into interest rate swaps to hedge against the effects of adverse changes in interest rates on future
cash outflows for interest. Gains and losses from changes in fair value on interest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges are initially deferred and recorded in other comprehensive
income. Amounts are transferred from other comprehensive income and recognized in earnings as interest expense in the same period as the hedged item is recognized in earnings.

In
2001, the Company entered into interest rate hedge contracts, with a notional amount of $2 billion, to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for long-term
fixed-rate debt issues in connection with the DuPont and ImClone transactions (see Notes 3 and 7). The contracts were designated as hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to
changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates. In the third quarter of 2001, the Company settled all existing interest rate hedge contracts, which coincided with the issuance of the
long-term fixed-rate debt. The Company recorded the contract settlements at fair value, resulting in a $69 million deferred loss, net of taxes, in accumulated other
comprehensive income/(loss), which will be recognized as a yield adjustment over the terms of the related borrowings.

The
fair value of derivative instruments, which is recorded in prepaid expenses at December 31, 2001, was $27 million. The fair values of the Company's derivative instruments are based
on relevant market information including current forward currency exchange rates and current interest rates. The fair value of option contracts is estimated by using the Black-Scholes model and is
based on year-end currency rates. The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is based on year-end forward currency rates. The carrying amount of the Company's other
financial instruments, which include cash equivalents, marketable


securities, accounts receivable, long-term debt and accounts payable, approximates the fair value at December 31, 2001 and 2000.

In
accordance with SFAS No. 133, the Company recorded a transition adjustment as of January 1, 2001, of $26 million, net of taxes, in other comprehensive income/(loss) to record
derivative instruments at their fair value.

A
reconciliation of current period changes, net of taxes, included in other comprehensive income/(loss) follows:

Note 16    RETIREMENT PLANS

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans for regular full-time employees. The principal pension
plan is the Bristol-Myers Squibb Retirement Income Plan. The Company's funding policy is to contribute amounts to provide for current service and to


fund past service liability. Plan benefits are based primarily on years of credited service and on the participant's compensation. Plan assets consist principally of equity and fixed-income
securities.

During
2001, the Company had a domestic curtailment/settlement loss of approximately $25 million resulting from reductions in employment levels primarily in connection with restructuring
activities and the Clairol divestiture.

Cost
of the Company's defined benefit plans included the following components:

December 31, 2000 and $319 million, $245 million and $56 million, respectively, as of December 31, 1999. This is attributable primarily to an unfunded benefit
equalization plan and, at December 31, 2001, a DuPont Pharmaceuticals Company U.S. pension plan.


Note 16    RETIREMENT PLANS (Continued)

The
principal defined contribution plan is the Bristol-Myers Squibb Savings and Investment Program. The Company's contribution is based on employee contributions and the level of Company match.
Company contributions to the plan were $54 million in 2001, $53 million in 2000 and $49 million in 1999.

Note 17    POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS OTHER THAN PENSIONS

The Company provides comprehensive medical and group life benefits for substantially all U.S. retirees who elect to participate in the Company's comprehensive medical and group
life plans. The medical plan is contributory. Contributions are adjusted periodically and vary by date of retirement and the original retiring Company. The life insurance plan is noncontributory. Plan
assets consist principally of equity securities and fixed-income securities.

Note 18    LITIGATION

Various
lawsuits, claims and proceedings of a nature considered normal to its businesses are pending against the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. The most significant of these are described
below.

BREAST IMPLANT LITIGATION

The Company, together with its subsidiary Medical Engineering Corporation (MEC) and certain other companies, remains a defendant in a number of claims and lawsuits alleging
damages for personal injuries of various types resulting from polyurethane-covered breast implants and smooth-walled breast implants formerly manufactured by MEC or a related company. The vast
majority of claims against the Company in direct lawsuits have been resolved through settlements or trial. Likewise, claims or potential claims against the Company registered in the nationwide class
action settlement approved by the Federal District Court in Birmingham, Alabama (Revised Settlement), have been or will be resolved through the Revised Settlement. The Company expects it will be able
to address all remaining claims or potential claims through its product liability reserves.


TAXOL* LITIGATION

In 1997 and 1998, the Company filed several lawsuits alleging that a number of generic drug companies infringed its patents covering methods of administering paclitaxel when
they filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications seeking regulatory approval to sell paclitaxel. These actions were consolidated for discovery in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey
(District Court). The Company did not assert a monetary claim against any of the defendants, but sought to prevent the defendants from marketing paclitaxel in a manner that violates the Company's
patents. The defendants asserted that they did not infringe the Company's patents and that these patents are invalid and unenforceable.

In
early 2000, the District Court invalidated most claims of the Company's patents. On April 20, 2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court's summary
judgment of the invalidity of all but two claims of the patents at issue. Those two claims relate to the low-dose, three-hour administration of paclitaxel in which the patient
is given a specified regimen of premedicants before the administration of paclitaxel. The appellate court remanded those two claims to the District Court for further proceedings. In 2001 the Company
filed an additional patent infringement suit against another company seeking to market generic paclitaxel.

In
September 2000, one of the defendants received final approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its Abbreviated New Drug Application for paclitaxel and is marketing the
product. Additional final approvals have since been announced by the FDA and sales of additional generic products have begun.

Some
of the defendants asserted counterclaims seeking damages for alleged antitrust and unfair competition violations. The Company believed its patents were valid when it filed the suits, and the
counterclaims asserted are believed to be without merit. Since the filing of the suits, six private actions have been filed by parties alleging antitrust, consumer protection and similar claims
relating to the Company's actions to obtain and enforce patent rights. The plaintiffs seek declaratory judgment, damages (treble and/or punitive where allowed), disgorgement and injunctive relief. In
September 2000, the Federal Trade Commission initiated an investigation relating to paclitaxel. Various state attorneys general have also initiated investigations regarding paclitaxel. At this
time, none of these federal and state agencies has brought any claims against the Company relating to paclitaxel, nor have they indicated whether any such claims will be brought. The Company is
cooperating in these investigations.

The
lawsuits with four of the defendants have been settled with defendants agreeing to drop all claims against the Company relating to paclitaxel and the Company granting licenses to the four
defendants under certain paclitaxel patent rights. The Company is considering its options with respect to the two remaining patent infringement defendants. It is not possible at this time to make a
reasonable assessment as to the final outcome of these lawsuits and investigations. Nor is it possible to reasonably estimate the impact those litigations and investigations might have if the Company
were not to prevail.

BUSPAR* LITIGATION

On November 21, 2000, the Company obtained a patent, U.S. Patent No. 6,150,365 ('365 patent), relating to a method of using BUSPAR* or buspirone. The Company
submitted timely information relating to the '365 patent to the FDA for listing in an FDA publication commonly known as the "Orange Book," and the FDA thereafter listed the patent in the Orange Book.


Delisting
Suits. Generic-drug manufacturers sued the FDA and the Company to compel the delisting of the '365 patent from the Orange Book. Although one district court declined to order the
delisting of the '365 patent, another ordered the Company to cause the delisting of the patent from the Orange Book. The Company complied with the court's order but appealed the decision to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit reversed the district court that ordered the delisting.

Patent
Suits. The Company is seeking to enforce the '365 patent in actions against two generic drug manufacturers.

Antitrust
Suits. Following the delisting of the '365 patent from the Orange Book, a number of purchasers of buspirone and several generic drug makers filed lawsuits against the Company alleging that
it improperly triggered statutory marketing exclusivity. The attorneys general of 29 states and Puerto Rico have also filed suit against the Company with parallel allegations. Some of the private
plaintiffs have amended their allegations to include charges that a 1994 agreement between the Company and a generic company improperly blocked the entry of generic buspirone to the market. The
central issues raised by these cases are whether the Company improperly caused the listing of the '365 patent in the Orange Book and whether the 1994 agreement was improper. Plaintiffs seek
declaratory judgment, damages (treble and/or punitive where allowed), disgorgement and injunctive relief.

Multidistrict
Litigation (MDL) proceedings. The Judicial Panel on MDL granted the Company's motions to have all of the patent and antitrust cases consolidated in a single forum. The court before which
the buspirone litigations are now pending issued two opinions dated February 14, 2002. In the first opinion, the court found that the '365 patent does not cover uses of buspirone and therefore
is not infringed. In the second opinion, the court denied the Company's motion to dismiss the federal antitrust and state law claims against the Company. The second opinion allows the claims against
the Company to proceed, except as to federal antitrust claims for damages accrued more than four years before the filing of the complaints.

Government
Investigations. The Federal Trade Commission and a number of state attorneys general have initiated investigations concerning the listing of the '365 patent in the Orange Book. The Company
is cooperating in these investigations. A number of attorneys general, but not all of them, filed an action against the Company, as noted earlier.

It
is not possible at this time to make a reasonable assessment as to the final outcome of these lawsuits and investigations. If the Company were not to prevail in final, non-appealable
determinations of these litigations and investigations, the impact on the Company could be material.

VANLEV* LITIGATIONS

In April, May and June 2000, the Company, its former chairman of the board and chief executive officer, Charles A. Heimbold, Jr., and its chief scientific officer, Peter
S. Ringrose, Ph.D., were named as defendants in a number of class action lawsuits alleging violations of federal securities laws and regulations. These actions have been consolidated into one action
for pretrial proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. The plaintiff claims that the defendants disseminated materially false and misleading statements and failed to
disclose information concerning the safety and expected availability of its product VANLEV during the period November 8, 1999, through April 19, 2000. The plaintiff seeks compensatory
damages, costs and expenses.


In
March 2002, the Company and its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Peter R. Dolan, were named as defendants in a purported securities class action lawsuit alleging violations of federal
securities laws and regulations. The action is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants disseminated materially false and
misleading statements and failed to disclose safety data of its product VANLEV during the period September 25, 2001, through March 19, 2002. The plaintiffs seek compensatory damages,
costs and expenses.

It
is not possible at this time to make a reasonable assessment of the final outcome of these matters or the amount of damages if the Company were not to prevail.

While
it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these cases, it is the opinion of management that they will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's operating results or
consolidated financial position.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

Management is responsible for the accompanying consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In
management's opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, information and representations included
in the Company's Annual Report are consistent with the financial statements.

The
Company maintains a system of internal accounting policies, procedures and controls intended to provide reasonable assurance, given the inherent limitations of all internal control systems, at
appropriate costs, that transactions are executed in accordance with Company authorization, that they are properly recorded and reported in the financial statements and that assets are adequately
safeguarded. The Company's internal auditors continually evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of this system of internal accounting policies, procedures and controls, and actions are taken to
correct deficiencies as they are identified.

The
Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is composed solely of nonemployee directors and is responsible for overseeing and monitoring the quality of the Company's accounting and auditing
practices. The Audit Committee meets several times during the year with management, the internal auditors and the independent accountants to discuss audit activities, internal controls and financial
reporting matters. The internal auditors and the independent accountants have full and free access to the Audit Committee.

The
appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent accountants by the Board of Directors was ratified by the stockholders. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP's Report to the Board of
Directors and Stockholders of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company appears in this Form 10-K Annual Report.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To
the Board of Directors

and Stockholders of

Bristol-Myers Squibb Company

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 14(a)(1) on page 58 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Bristol-Myers
Squibb Company and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under
Item 14(a)(2) on page 58 presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial
statements and the financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As
described in Note 1, the Company changed its method of accounting for business combinations and goodwill for transactions consummated subsequent to June 30, 2001, pursuant to new
standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.
