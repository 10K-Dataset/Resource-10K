SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS
- -----------------------------------------

In  general, Bristol-Myers Squibb purchases the principal raw materials and
supplies  used  in each industry segment in the open market.  Substantially
all such materials are obtainable from a number of sources so that the loss
of any one source of supply would not have a material adverse effect on the
Company.


PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES
- --------------------------------

The  Company  owns or is licensed under a number of patents in  the  United
States  and  foreign  countries  covering  products,  principally  in   the
medicines  and medical devices segments, and has also developed many  brand
names  and  trademarks for products in each industry segment.  The  Company
considers  the  overall  protection of its patent,  trademark  and  license
rights  to  be  of  material value and acts to protect  these  rights  from
infringement. In the years 2000 and 2001 exclusivity periods are  scheduled
to  expire  or  have  expired for GLUCOPHAGE, BUSPAR*  and  certain  TAXOL*
claims.  The  Company  believes that no single  patent  or  license  is  of
material importance in relation to the business as a whole.


COMPETITION, DISTRIBUTION AND CUSTOMERS
- ---------------------------------------

The  markets  in  which Bristol-Myers Squibb competes are generally  broad-
based  and highly competitive. The principal means of competition  utilized
to  market  the products of Bristol-Myers Squibb include quality,  service,
price and product performance. The pharmaceutical products of the Medicines
segment and the products of the Medical Devices segment are promoted  on  a
national  and international basis in medical journals and directly  to  the
medical  profession.  The  Company  is  also  utilizing  direct-to-consumer
advertising for a number of its pharmaceutical products. Most of the  other
products of Bristol-Myers Squibb are generally advertised and promoted on a
national  and  international basis through the use  of  television,  radio,
print  media,  consumer offers, and window and in-store displays.  Bristol-
Myers  Squibb's products are principally sold to the wholesale  and  retail
trade  both  nationally  and  internationally.  Certain  products  of   the
Medicines  and  Medical  Devices segments  are  also  sold  to  other  drug
manufacturers, hospitals and the medical profession. None of  the  segments
is dependent upon a single customer, or a few customers, such that the loss
of any one or more would have a material adverse effect on the segment.



RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
- ------------------------

Research and development is essential to Bristol-Myers Squibb's businesses,
particularly   to  the  Medicines  Segment.  Pharmaceutical  research   and
development  is  carried  out  by the Bristol-Myers  Squibb  Pharmaceutical
Research  Institute which has major facilities in Princeton,  Hopewell  and
New  Brunswick,  New  Jersey; and Wallingford, Connecticut.  Pharmaceutical
research and development is also carried out at various other facilities in
the  United  States and in Belgium, Canada, France, Italy, Japan,  and  the
United  Kingdom.  Management continues to emphasize leadership,  innovation
and productivity as strategies for success in the Research Institute.

Bristol-Myers Squibb spent $1,843 million in 1999, $1,577 million  in  1998
and  $1,385  million in 1997 on Company sponsored research and  development
activities.  Pharmaceutical  research  and  development  spending,   as   a
percentage of pharmaceutical sales, was 12.6% in 1999 compared to 12.4%  in
1998 and 12.0% in 1997.


REGULATION
- ----------

Most  aspects  of  the Company's business are subject  to  some  degree  of
government  regulation  in  the  countries  in  which  its  operations  are
conducted.  The  Company's policy is to comply fully  with  all  regulatory
requirements  applying to its products and operations. For  some  products,
and  in  some  countries,  government regulation  is  significant  and,  in
general, there is a trend to more stringent regulation. The Company devotes
significant  time, effort and expense addressing the extensive governmental
regulatory   requirements   applicable  to  its   business.    Governmental
regulatory  actions  can  result  in the recall  or  seizure  of  products,
suspension  or revocation of the authority necessary for the production  or
sale of a product, and other civil and criminal sanctions.

In  the  United  States,  the drug, medical device,  diagnostic,  food  and
cosmetic industries in which the Company operates have long been subject to
regulation  by various federal, state and local agencies, primarily  as  to
product manufacture, safety, efficacy, advertising and labeling.

In  addition,  governmental bodies in the United States as  well  as  other
countries  have expressed concern about costs relating to health care  and,
in  some  cases,  have focused attention on the pricing  of  drugs  and  on
appropriate drug utilization. Government regulation in these areas  already
exists  in  some countries and may be expanded significantly in the  United
States and other countries in the future.

While the Company is unable to predict the extent to which its business may
be  affected  by  future  regulatory developments,  it  believes  that  its
substantial  experience  dealing with governmental regulatory  requirements
and restrictions on its operations throughout the world and its development
of new and improved products should enable it to compete effectively within
this environment.

Item 3.          LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

Various  lawsuits, claims and proceedings of a nature considered normal  to
its  businesses  are  pending  against  the  Company  and  certain  of  its
subsidiaries. The most significant of these are described below.

Reference  is  made to Note 15 Litigation in the Notes to the  Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report.

Breast Implant Litigation
- -------------------------

The  Company, together with its subsidiary, Medical Engineering Corporation
(MEC),  and  certain other companies, has been named as a  defendant  in  a
number  of  claims and lawsuits alleging damages for personal  injuries  of
various  types  resulting  from polyurethane-covered  breast  implants  and
smooth-walled  breast implants formerly manufactured by MEC  or  a  related
Company.  Of  the more than 90,000 claims or potential claims  against  the
Company in direct lawsuits or through registration in the nationwide  class
action  settlement  approved by the Federal District Court  in  Birmingham,
Alabama  (the "Revised Settlement"), most have been dealt with through  the
Revised  Settlement, other settlements, or trial. As of December 31,  1999,
the  Company's contingent liability in respect of breast implant claims was
limited  to  residual unpaid Revised Settlement obligations and to  roughly
1,700  remaining  opt-outs who have pursued or may pursue their  claims  in
court.

As  of December 31, 1999, approximately 6,700 United States and 200 foreign
breast  implant recipients were plaintiffs in lawsuits pending  in  federal
and  state  courts in the United States and certain courts  in  Canada  and
Australia. These figures include the claims of plaintiffs that are  in  the
process  of being settled and/or dismissed. In these lawsuits, about  3,660
U.S.  and  49  foreign plaintiffs opted out of the Revised Settlement.  The
lawsuits  of the 3,040 U.S. plaintiffs who did not opt out are expected  to
be  dismissed  since these plaintiffs are among the estimated 74,000  women
with MEC implants who chose to participate in the nationwide settlement. Of
the  3,660  opt-out plaintiffs, an estimated 1,960 have claims  based  upon
products that were not manufactured or sold by MEC or that have been or are
in  the  process of being settled and/or dismissed. Accordingly, the number
of  remaining  plaintiffs who have pursued or may pursue  their  claims  in
court  against  the Company is roughly 1,700, as stated  in  the  preceding
paragraph.

Under the terms of the Revised Settlement, additional opt-outs are expected
to  be  minimal since the deadline for U.S. class members to  opt  out  has
passed.  In addition, the Company's remaining obligations under the Revised
Settlement Program are limited because most payments to "Current Claimants"
have already been made, no additional "Current Claims" may be filed without
court  approval,  and  because  payments  of  claims  to  so-called  "Other
Registrants" and "Late Registrants" are limited by the terms of the Revised
Settlement.  Separate class action settlements have been  approved  in  the
provincial courts of Ontario and Quebec, and an agreement has been  reached
under  which  other  foreign  breast implant recipients  may  settle  their
claims.  The Company believes it will be able to address remaining  opt-out
claims  as  well  as  expected  remaining  obligations  under  the  Revised
Settlement Program within its reserves described below.

Breast  implants  were  manufactured by several companies,  including  MEC,
which  the Company acquired in 1982. Until 1991, MEC manufactured two types
of  breast  implants,  polyurethane-covered silicone  breast  implants  and
smooth-walled  silicone  breast  implants. In  these  lawsuits,  plaintiffs
typically contend that silicone in breast implants causes systemic  disease
and/or  local  complications.  Some  plaintiffs  with  polyurethane-covered
silicone  breast  implants contend that the polyurethane  component  causes
injury,  including cancer.  Most of the disease claims involve non-specific
complaints such as chronic fatigue, aches and pains and other symptoms that



commonly   affect  the  population  at  large.   Many  women  claim   local
complications  such as rupture, hardening or contracture, and disfigurement
or scarring. The plaintiffs typically seek compensatory damages for alleged
medical conditions and emotional distress as well as punitive damages.  The
defendants  have  based  their defense in part  on  the  lack  of  credible
scientific  evidence that breast implants cause disease. Many  large  scale
epidemiological  studies have found no connection between  breast  implants
and  the alleged diseases. Defendants also contend that warnings set  forth
in the product literature adequately advised physicians and surgeons of the
risks of local complications.

The  Company  is  a  participant  in  the  national  class  action  Revised
Settlement Program approved on December 22, 1995, by the Honorable  Sam  C.
Pointer, Jr., formerly Chief Judge of the United States District Court  for
the  Northern District of Alabama (Lindsey, et al., v. Dow Corning, et al.,
CV-94-P-11558-S),  before  whom  all  federal  breast  implant  cases  were
consolidated  for pretrial purposes. The Revised Settlement arises  out  of
the class action settlement approved by the Court on September 1, 1994. All
appeals  from  the  Order  approving  the  Revised  Settlement  have   been
dismissed.  On January 16, 1996, the Company, Baxter Healthcare Corporation
and  Baxter International (collectively, Baxter), and Minnesota, Mining and
Manufacturing Company (3M) (hereinafter, the Settling Defendants) each paid
$125  million  into a court-established fund as an initial reserve  to  pay
claims  under  the Revised Settlement. The Company has made and  will  make
additional contributions to the court-established fund.

The  fifteen-year  Revised Settlement, which ends  on  December  15,  2010,
provides benefits to those U.S. breast implant recipients who have  had  at
least one breast implant manufactured by one of the Settling Defendants (or
their  related companies). For Current Claimants - those who submitted  the
proper documentation to the Claims Office in Houston by the 1994 deadline -
benefits  are  payable  regardless  of  the  number  of  claimants  seeking
compensation, and regardless of the total dollar value of approved  claims.
For  Other  and  Late Registrants - those who registered  with  the  Claims
Office  after  the Current Claimant deadline - benefits are subject  to  an
aggregate  $725  million limit for the three Settling Defendants  over  the
fifteen-year life of the program. The Company's individual aggregate  limit
for such benefits is $400 million, $27.6 million annually for the first ten
years,  and $24.8 million annually for the last five years. Amounts  unused
in one year may be rolled over to pay claims in ensuing years. In the event
the  dollar value of the claims subject to these limits were to exceed  the
amounts available to pay claims, claimants may be afforded additional  opt-
out  rights  but  without the right to assert punitive or  other  statutory
multiple  damage claims. The Company's obligations to make  payments  under
the  Revised  Settlement are not affected by the number  of  class  members
electing to opt out of the settlement or the number of class members making
claims under it except to the extent of the above-mentioned dollar limits.

In  addition to individual suits and the Lindsey class action, the  Company
is a defendant, together with other defendants, in a class action certified
on  April  11, 1996, in the Canadian province of British Columbia,  on  the
single issue of whether silicone gel breast implants are reasonably fit for
their  intended  purpose  (Harrington v. Dow Corning  Corporation  et  al.,
Supreme Court, British Columbia, C954330). A putative class action filed on
behalf  of  children  allegedly exposed to silicone in  utero  and  through
breast  milk  (Feuer,  et al., v. McGhan, et al., U.S.D.C.,  E.D.N.Y.,  93-
0146), which named all breast implant manufacturers and sought to establish
a medical monitoring fund, has been dismissed.

The  Company  entered  into several other settlements  of  breast  implant-
related  claims. In July of 1995, the Company entered into a $20.5  million
(U.S. funds) class action settlement with plaintiff representatives in  the
provinces of Ontario and Quebec. The class includes persons who have or had
MEC  breast  implants and who reside in Ontario and Quebec or who  received
their  MEC implants there. The settlement, which had minimal opt-outs,  has
been  approved by the provincial courts of Ontario and Quebec.  In  May  of
1996,  the Company, together with other Settling Defendants in the  Revised
Settlement  Program,  entered  into  a $50  million  settlement  of  claims



asserted  by  certain health insurers based upon payments made or  benefits
provided   by  insurers  and  represented  health  plans  to  participating
registrants  that  allegedly  involve or  relate  to  silicone  gel  breast
implants.  The  Company has contributed $22.5 million  to  the  settlement,
which  extinguishes  the  potential claims of  the  majority  of  the  U.S.
commercial and non-governmental health care insurer market against both the
defendants and settlement class members. In November 1996, the benefits  of
the  Revised  Settlement  were  extended, with  certain  modifications,  to
foreign  breast  implant  recipients.  Pursuant  to  this  settlement,  the
Settling  Defendants paid (on an equal basis) an aggregate of  $25  million
into a court-approved settlement fund as an initial reserve for payment  of
foreign claims.  On January 5, 2000, the Court advised the parties that the
foreign  settlement  was overfunded, and directed  the  transfer  of  $13.4
million  of  the $25 million fund to the Revised Settlement. The  Company's
share of the $13.4 million transferred was approximately $3 million.

The  Company's insurers were notified of the breast implant claims and  the
Revised  Settlement,  and  a  number  reserved  their  rights  or  declined
coverage.  The  Company reached settlement with many of these  insurers  in
connection with coverage litigation filed by it in state court in Texas. In
1993,  the  Company  offset  its breast implant product  liability  special
charges  by  $1.0  billion  of  expected insurance  proceeds  (recorded  as
Insurance  Recoverable). Because of its belief that additional  amounts  of
insurance  proceeds  above  that  amount will  be  recovered,  the  Company
recorded an additional Insurance Recoverable in the fourth quarter of  1998
of approximately $100 million.

While  there  have  been a few large judgments, defendants  have  won  more
trials  than  they have lost, and the Company's trial experience  has  been
mostly  favorable.  The Company has maintained throughout  this  litigation
that  breast implants do not cause disease, and medical and scientific data
support the Company's position. The Company's view has found support in the
trial  courts. Courts in several states have ruled to exclude the testimony
of plaintiffs' experts concerning a causal link between silicone gel breast
implants  and  systemic  illness on the ground that  it  fails  to  satisfy
standards  for reliability under current U.S. Supreme Court guidelines.  In
1998,  a  national science panel of four independent experts  appointed  by
Judge  Pointer issued its unanimous report, based on a comprehensive review
of the medical and scientific literature, that there is no evidence linking
silicone  breast implants and systemic disease.  Similarly,  in  1999,  the
Institute  of  Medicine  of  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  -  while
commenting that the frequency of local injuries is greater than expected  -
concluded  there is insufficient evidence to link silicone breast  implants
with disease. The Company intends to dispose of the claims of remaining opt-
outs by continuing to implement its plan to settle cases at values it deems
acceptable,  and  to  wage a vigorous defense, including  taking  cases  to
trial, of those cases that do not settle at such values.

In  the  fourth  quarter of 1993, the Company recorded  a  charge  of  $500
million  before  taxes  ($310 million after taxes)  in  respect  of  breast
implant   cases.  The  charge  consisted  of  $1.5  billion  for  potential
liabilities  and  expenses, offset by $1.0 billion  of  expected  insurance
proceeds.  In  the  fourth quarters of 1994 and 1995, the Company  recorded
additional special charges of $750 million before taxes ($488 million after
taxes)   and  $950  million  before  taxes  ($590  million  after   taxes),
respectively,  related to breast implant product liability claims.  In  the
fourth  quarter of 1998, the Company recorded an additional special  charge
to  earnings  in the amount of $800 million before taxes and increased  its
insurance  receivable in the amount of $100 million,  resulting  in  a  net
charge to earnings of $433 million after taxes in respect of breast implant
product liability claims.

Prescription Drug Litigation
- ----------------------------

The  Company remains a defendant in several actions challenging pricing  on
brand  name  prescription  drugs. These actions include  several  currently
consolidated  antitrust actions brought against the Company and  more  than
thirty  other  pharmaceutical manufacturers, drug wholesalers and  pharmacy
benefit  managers  by  certain  chain drugstores,  supermarket  chains  and



independent  drugstores; state pharmaceutical actions; and purported  class
actions  on behalf of consumers. In the fourth quarter of 1998, the Company
recorded a special charge to earnings in the amount of $100 million  before
taxes  ($62  million  after  taxes) in respect of  this  prescription  drug
litigation. The Company will continue to defend vigorously its position  in
this  ongoing  litigation  and believes it will  be  able  to  address  all
remaining claims within its reserves.

Infant Formula Matters
- ----------------------

The Company, one of its subsidiaries, and others have been defendants in  a
number  of antitrust actions in various states filed on behalf of purported
statewide classes of indirect purchasers of infant formula products and  by
the  Attorneys General of Louisiana, Minnesota and Mississippi, alleging  a
price  fixing  conspiracy  and  other  violations  of  state  antitrust  or
deceptive  trade practice laws and seeking penalties and other relief.  The
Company  has resolved all of these actions except for a purported statewide
class  action  of indirect purchasers in Louisiana in which the  plaintiffs
filed  a  petition  for certiorari in the United States  Supreme  Court  on
jurisdictional  grounds  following the  United  States  Court  of  Appeals'
affirmation  of the district court's dismissal of such action. On  November
29, 1999, the United States Supreme Court granted the plantiffs' petition.

TAXOL* Litigation
- -----------------

There  is  no  composition  of  matter patent for  paclitaxel  (the  active
ingredient  in TAXOL*). In the United States, the Company is presently  the
only manufacturer and marketer of a product containing paclitaxel.  In 1997
and  1998,  the Company filed several lawsuits alleging that  a  number  of
generic  drug companies infringed its patents covering certain  methods  of
administering paclitaxel when they filed abbreviated new drug  applications
seeking  regulatory approval to sell paclitaxel. The generic  drug  company
defendants  are  Boehringer Ingelheim Corp.; Ben Venue Laboratories,  Inc.;
Bedford Laboratories; Immunex Corporation; Zenith Goldline Pharmaceuticals,
Inc.;    Ivax    Corporation;   Mylan   Pharmaceuticals,    Inc.;    Marsam
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; and Schien Pharmaceuticals, Inc. These actions  were
consolidated  for  discovery in the United States District  Court  for  the
District  of  New  Jersey.  The Company does not assert  a  monetary  claim
against  any  of  the defendants, but seeks to prevent the defendants  from
marketing  paclitaxel in a manner that violates the Company's patents.  The
defendants  have  asserted that they do not infringe the Company's  patents
and that these patents are invalid and unenforceable.  Some defendants also
asserted  counterclaims seeking damages for alleged  antitrust  and  unfair
competition violations.

On  January  4,  2000, the District Court granted the Company's  motion  to
dismiss certain of the antitrust and unfair competition counterclaims.  The
Company's motion for summary judgment on the remaining antitrust and unfair
competition counterclaims was denied on March 17, 2000.

On  February  29,  2000, the District Court granted  in  part  the  generic
companies' summary judgment motions for invalidity by finding all claims of
the  Company's patents in dispute invalid, except for claims limited to the
treatment  of  ovarian  cancer. As a result of  this  ruling,  the  generic
companies  may obtain U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to  market
paclitaxel  solely for treatment of metastatic breast cancer after  failure
of   combination  chemotherapy.  The  District  Court's  opinion  left  for
determination at trial the validity of the claims of the Company's  patents
directed  to  the  low dose, three-hour administration  of  paclitaxel  for
ovarian  cancer  and denied the generic companies' summary judgment  motion
arguing  non-infringement of the Company's patents. The Company may  pursue
its appeal rights in the future.




The claims remaining in the lawsuits are currently scheduled for trial in
May 2000.  It is not possible at this time to make a reasonable assessment
of the outcome of the remaining claims in these actions nor to reasonably
estimate the impact on TAXOL* sales or the amount of damages were the
Company not to prevail.

Environmental Matters
- ---------------------

The Company, together with others, is a party to, or otherwise involved in,
a  number of proceedings brought by the Environmental Protection Agency  or
comparable  state agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental  Response,
Compensation  and  Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) or comparable  state
laws directed at the cleanup of hazardous waste sites.


While  it  is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome  of  these
cases,  it is the opinion of management that they will not have a  material
adverse   effect   on  the  Company's  operating  results,   liquidity   or
consolidated financial position.

Item  7.MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL  CONDITION  AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

Summary

In 1999, Bristol-Myers Squibb surpassed $20 billion in annual global sales
and achieved record levels of sales and  earnings. All four of the Company's
business segments achieved record levels  of sales, bringing the worldwide
sales to $20.2 billion, an 11% increase  over 1998. Domestic sales,
representing 63% of worldwide  sales, increased 15% to $12.8 billion, while
international sales increased 3%  to $7.4 billion. Sales growth resulted from
a 9% increase due to volume and a 2% increase from changes in selling prices.
Exchange rate fluctuations had no  effect on worldwide sales, but did have an
unfavorable effect of 2% on international  sales,  primarily  due  to  Latin
American and European currencies.

The  Company's most important product lines experienced double-digit sales
increases  on  a  worldwide  basis. In fact, three  products,  PRAVACHOL*,
TAXOL* (paclitaxel) and GLUCOPHAGE exceeded $1 billion in sales, while six
additional  products  exceeded over one-half  billion  dollars  in  annual
sales.  Bristol-Myers  Squibb had 64 product  lines  with  more  than  $50
million  in  annual  sales, including 35 with more than  $100  million  in
annual sales.

Earnings  before income taxes, excluding the 1998 special charge described
below, increased 14% to $5.8 billion in 1999. Net earnings, on this basis,
increased  15% to $4.2 billion; basic and diluted earnings per share  each
increased  15% to $2.10 and $2.06, respectively. Over the past five  years
net  earnings  and diluted earnings per share, excluding special  charges,
have   increased  at  compound  annual  growth  rates  of  12%  and   13%,
respectively. In 1999, the Company reported 15% diluted earnings per share
growth  over  the  prior  year for each of the first  three  quarters  and
excluding  the  1998  special charge, a 16%  growth  rate  in  the  fourth
quarter.

In  1999, consistent with the mission of the Company to extend and enhance
human life and develop the highest quality  products, the Company invested
more than $1.8 billion in research and  development, a 17% growth over the
prior year  and  growing  at  an annualized  rate  of  11%  over  the  past
five  years.  This  continuing investment  has  led to the discovery of
innovative new products  and  the development  of  new indications for
existing products including:  VANLEV* (omapatrilat),  a  novel  cardiovascular
compound  for  the  treatment  of hypertension, which is the first
antihypertensive ever to receive priority review  from  the  U.S.  Food  and
Drug Administration  (FDA)  under  the Prescription  Drug  User  Fee  Act;
a  GLUCOPHAGE/glyburide  product  and  GLUCOPHAGE  XR  Extended Release
Tablets, both for  diabetes;  VANIQA*,  a topical treatment for excessive facial
hair in women; TEQUIN*, an advanced antibiotic  for the treatment of multiple
common infections; an easier-to-digest, enteric-coated treatment form of VIDEX*
for HIV/AIDS; and TAXOL*,for adjuvant treatment of node-positive breast cancer.

Bristol-Myers Squibb's financial position remains strong. At December  31,
1999, the Company held almost $3.0 billion in cash, time deposits and
marketable securities. Cash provided by operating  activities reached $4.5
billion, the highest  in  the  last  10 years.  Returns  to shareholders
included dividend distributions  of  $1.7 billion and stock repurchases of
$1.4 billion. Dividends per common  share were  $.86  in  1999, increasing
from $.78 per share  paid  in  1998.  The Company has continued to lower its
dividend payout ratio, which represents cash  dividends  paid  per common
share divided by  diluted  earnings  per common  share, that amounted to 42%,
43% and 48% in 1999, 1998  and  1997, respectively,  excluding the 1998
special charge. In  December  1999,  the Company  announced  a  dividend
increase, the 28th consecutive  year  that dividends  have  increased,  and
expanded  the  share  repurchase  program authorization  by  an  additional
$2 billion. The  2000  indicated  annual payment  is  $.98 per common share,



a 14% increase over 1999, following  a 10% dividend increase in 1999. As
further evidence of its strong financial position,  Bristol-Myers  Squibb is
one  of  only  seven  U.S.  industrial companies  to  receive  a triple-A
credit rating  from  both  Moody's  and Standard & Poor's.

Net Sales and Earnings

Worldwide  sales  increased 11% in 1999 to $20.2  billion,  compared  with
increases  of  9% and 11% in 1998 and 1997, respectively. The consolidated
sales  growth  in  1999 resulted from a 9% increase due to  volume,  a  2%
increase  due  to changes in selling prices and no change due  to  foreign
exchange rate fluctuations. In 1998, the 9% increase in sales reflected  a
10%  increase  due to volume, a 3% decrease due to foreign  exchange  rate
fluctuations and a 2% increase due to changes in selling prices. In  1997,
the  11%  increase in sales reflected a 14% increase due to volume,  a  3%
decrease due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and no changes  overall
from pricing activity. Domestic sales increased 15% in both 1999 and 1998,
and  14%  in  1997, while international sales increased  3%  in  1999  (5%
excluding  foreign  exchange), 2% in 1998 (9% excluding foreign  exchange)
and  7%  in  1997  (15%  excluding  foreign  exchange).  In  general,  the
businesses of the Company's industry segments are not seasonal.

Earnings  before income taxes, excluding the 1998 charge described  below,
increased 14% to $5,767 million from $5,068 million in 1998. Net  earnings
on  this  basis increased 15% to $4,167 million compared to $3,636 million
in 1998. Basic earnings per share increased 15% to $2.10 from $1.83 in the
prior  year  and diluted earnings per share increased 15%  to  $2.06  from
$1.79.  Net earnings margins, excluding the 1998 special charge, increased
to  20.6%  in  1999 from 19.9% in 1998. As described in the notes  to  the
financial statements, in the fourth quarter of 1998, the Company  recorded
a  special charge of $800 million before taxes, $495 million after  taxes,
or  $.24  per  diluted share, to augment the reserve  for  breast  implant
liability and for prescription drug pricing litigation, offset by expected
insurance recoveries. The breast implant component of the charge was  $700
million  before  taxes  ($800  million of liability  offset  by  insurance
receivables of $100 million), and the prescription drug pricing  component
was $100 million before taxes. As a result of the special charge, 1998 net
earnings  were  $3,141 million, basic earnings per share  were  $1.58  and
diluted  earnings  per share were $1.55. In 1998, net earnings,  excluding
the  1998  special charge, were $3,636 million, a 13% increase over  1997.
Basic  earnings per share were $1.83 and diluted earnings per  share  were
$1.79, both increasing 14% over 1997. Net earnings margins, excluding  the
special charge, increased to 19.9% in 1998 from 19.2% in 1997.

The effective income tax rate on earnings before income taxes was 27.7% in
1999,  compared to 28.3% in 1998, excluding the special charge, and  28.5%
in  1997.  The effective income tax rate has decreased since 1997  due  to
increased income in lower tax rate jurisdictions.

As  described in Note 2 to the financial statements, in 1999, the  Company
acquired  CAL-C-TOSE*,  a  leading nutritional milk  modifier  product  in
Mexico.  In 1998, the Company acquired Redmond Products, Inc.,  a  leading
hair  care  manufacturer in the U.S. In 1998, the  Company  also  acquired
Phytoervas,  a  line of premium retail hair care products in  Brazil,  and
Dong-A  Biotech  Co., Ltd., a marketer and distributor  of  pharmaceutical
products in South Korea. In 1997, the Company acquired Abeefe S.A., Peru's
largest  pharmaceutical manufacturer and marketer. The  Company  also,  in
1997,  acquired  CHOCO  MILK*,  Mexico's  leading  milk-based  nutritional
supplement, and SAL DE UVAS PICOT*, a leading effervescent antacid product
in Mexico.

As  described in Note 2 to the financial statements, in the fourth quarter
of  1999,  the  Company completed the sale of Laboratori  Guieu,  SpA,  an
Italian-based   gynecological,  pediatric  and   dermatological   products
business. In the first quarter of 1998, the Company divested its Ban brand
of  anti-perspirants and deodorants. In the second quarter  of  1998,  the
Company  divested  A/S  GEA, a Denmark-based generic  drug  business,  and



Hexachimie,  a  specialty chemical manufacturer based in  France.  In  the
fourth  quarter  of 1997, the Company divested Linvatec  Corporation,  its
arthroscopy and powered surgical instrument business.

In  January  2000, the Company announced its intention to sell its  Matrix
Essentials,  Inc.  subsidiary, a manufacturer of  professional  hair  care
products sold exclusively through beauty salons.

Expenses

Total costs and expenses, as a percentage of sales, improved over the last
three  years  to 71.5% in 1999 compared with 72.3% in 1998, excluding  the
1998 special charge, and 73.2% in 1997.

As a percentage of sales, cost of products sold increased to 27.4% in 1999
compared to 26.6% in 1998, principally due to sales growth of lower margin
products  from  the  Oncology  Therapeutics  Network  (OTN),  a  specialty
distributor of anti-cancer medicines and related products. In  1998,  cost
of  products  sold as a percentage of sales remained at the  prior  year's
level  of  26.6% compared to 26.7% in 1997. Accordingly, the  Company  has
maintained  its  cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales  consistently
over the last three years, excluding
its oncology distribution business.

Advertising  and promotion expenses increased 4% over the  prior  year  to
$2,409  million  in  1999,  primarily due  to  the  continued  support  of
PRAVACHOL*, EXCEDRIN*, GLUCOPHAGE and PLAVIX in the Medicines segment  and
for  promotional  campaigns related to existing products and  new  product
launches  in the Beauty Care and Nutritional segments, including ENFAMIL*,
BOOST*,  ULTRESS*, VIACTIV* Soft Calcium Chews and AUSSIE LAND*. In  1998,
advertising  and  promotion expenses increased 3% to $2,312  million  from
$2,241  million  in  1997.  As  a percentage  of  sales,  advertising  and
promotion expenses decreased to 11.9% in 1999 from 12.6% in 1998 and 13.4%
in 1997, reflecting an improvement in the effectiveness of the advertising
and  promotion  spending.  This  decreasing  trend  is  primarily  due  to
reductions  in  direct-to-consumer advertising and  increases  in  medical
education efforts in the Medicines segment.

Marketing, selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of  sales,
decreased  to  22.6% in 1999 from 24.2% in 1998 and 25.0%  in  1997.  This
decreasing  trend  is a result of slower rates of increase  in  marketing,
sales  force  and general administrative expenses as compared  to  revenue
increases in the same period.

The  Company's  investment  in  research and  development  totaled  $1,843
million in 1999, an increase of 17% over 1998, and an increase to 9.1%  in
1999  as  a percentage of sales, from 8.6% in 1998 and 8.3% in 1997.  This
spending level reflects the Company's commitment to research over a  broad
range  of  therapeutic areas and to clinical development of new  products.
Over the past five years, research and development expenses have increased
at a compound annual growth rate of 11%. In 1999, research and development
spending dedicated to pharmaceutical products increased 18%, and was 12.6%
of  pharmaceutical  sales compared to 12.4% and 12.0% in  1998  and  1997,
respectively.

In  1999,  eight regulatory approvals were obtained and 10  dossiers  were
filed in the U.S. Most notably, in December 1999, the Company received FDA
approval for TEQUIN*, an advanced antibiotic for the treatment of multiple
common  infections, including those of the respiratory tract. The  Company
also   received  marketing  clearance  for  new  indications  for  several
products,  including: in October 1999, the use of TAXOL* by injection  for
adjuvant  treatment  of  node-positive breast  cancer  following  standard
chemotherapy; and, in September 1999, ZERIT* and VIDEX* were approved  for
use  as  first-line  components  of a combination  antiretroviral  therapy
regimen  for HIV-infected patients. In January 2000, the Company submitted
a New Drug Application (NDA) for VIDEX* (didanosine) a once-daily, easier-
to-digest,  enteric-coated form of VIDEX*. In December 1999,  the  Company



submitted  a filing for VANLEV* (omapatrilat) in the U.S., European  Union
and Canada. VANLEV* is the most clinically developed member of a new class
of  cardiovascular compounds developed for the treatment of  hypertension.
In 1999, the Company also initiated filings to gain marketing approval for
two  antidiabetic  drugs - a new oral antidiabetic combination  drug  that
leverages   the  benefits  of  two  widely  prescribed  oral  antidiabetic
medications,  GLUCOPHAGE  (metformin) and  glyburide,  a  well-established
sulfonylurea  antidiabetic,  and GLUCOPHAGE XR  (metformin  hydrochloride)
Extended  Release Tablets, a once-daily version of GLUCOPHAGE. A  NDA  for
VANIQA*, a topical treatment for excessive facial hair in women, was filed
in  September  1999. In 1999, the Company announced a number  of  research
alliances,  collaborations  and commercialization  agreements  with  other
companies,  including a development, commercialization  and  collaboration
agreement with Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., for aripiprazole, a  novel
drug under study in Phase III trials as a treatment for schizophrenia;  an
alliance  with  Millennium  Predictive Medicine,  Inc.,  a  subsidiary  of
Millennium  Pharmaceutical,  Inc.,  in  the  emerging  field   of   cancer
pharmacogenomics;  and  a licensing agreement and  research  collaboration
with OXiGENE, Inc., to develop and commercialize combretastatin anti-tumor
vascular targeting agents.

The  Company recorded $201 million and $225 million in gains from the sale
of businesses in 1998 and 1997,
respectively.  The  Company also recorded restructuring  charges  of  $201
million  in  1998  and  $225 million in 1997. These restructuring  charges
consisted  primarily  of  asset  write-downs  and  employee-related  costs
related to the consolidation and closure of plants and facilities.

Business Segments

All  four  of  the Company's business segments - Medicines,  Beauty  Care,
Medical  Devices  and Nutritionals - reported sales increases  during  the
year.

Sales  in  the Medicines segment (Pharmaceuticals and Consumer Medicines),
which  is  Bristol-Myers Squibb's largest segment  at  71%  of  the  total
Company,  increased 14% to $14,309 million in 1999. Sales growth  resulted
from  a  12% increase due to volume and a 3% increase from selling prices,
offset  by  a  1%  decrease  due to the effect of  foreign  exchange  rate
fluctuations.  Domestic  sales  increased  23%  and  international   sales
increased 5%, excluding foreign exchange, primarily due to volume growth.

Sales  of PRAVACHOL*, the Company's largest selling product, increased  4%
to $1,704 million. International sales increased 8% (10% excluding foreign
exchange) to $671 million. Domestic sales increased 1% to $1,033  million,
reflecting  intensifying  competition. The  product's  U.S.  market  share
leveled  off  at 15% for the year. In 1999, the results of the Prospective
Pravastatin Pooling Project, the largest statin drug analysis, found  that
PRAVACHOL* consistently helps reduce the risk of recurrent coronary events
in  women,  older  patients and patients with diabetes. The  Company  also
announced  the  launch of the Pravastatin or Atorvastatin  Evaluation  and
Infection Therapy, or PROVE IT, trial, the first major clinical  trial  to
compare  the effects of PRAVACHOL* versus Lipitor in reducing the risk  of
heart attacks and other cardiac events. This clinical trial also seeks  to
further examine the role of infection in atherosclerosis.

Sales of TAXOL*, the Company's leading anti-cancer agent, increased 23% to
$1.5  billion  as the product continued to benefit from increased  use  in
ovarian,   breast  and  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  following  standard
chemotherapy.  In  October 1999, the FDA approved the  use  of  TAXOL*  by
injection  for adjuvant treatment of node-positive breast cancer following
standard  chemotherapy.  There  is no composition  of  matter  patent  for
paclitaxel  (the active ingredient in TAXOL*). In the United  States,  the
Company  is  presently  the only manufacturer and marketer  of  a  product
containing  paclitaxel.   In  1997 and 1998,  the  Company  filed  several
lawsuits  alleging that a number of generic drug companies  infringed  its
patents  covering  certain methods of administering paclitaxel  when  they



filed  abbreviated  new drug applications seeking regulatory  approval  to
sell  paclitaxel. The defendants have asserted that they do  not  infringe
the   Company's   patents  and  that  these  patents   are   invalid   and
unenforceable.   Some  defendants  also  asserted  counterclaims   seeking
damages for alleged antitrust and unfair competition violation. On January
4,  2000,  the  District  Court granted the Company's  motion  to  dismiss
certain  of  the  antitrust  and  unfair  competition  counterclaims.  The
Company's  motion  for  summary judgment on the  remaining  antitrust  and
unfair competition counterclaims was denied on March 17, 2000. On February
29,  2000,  the  District  Court granted in part  the  generic  companies'
summary  judgment  motions for invalidity by finding  all  claims  of  the
Company's  patents in dispute invalid, except for claims  limited  to  the
treatment  of  ovarian  cancer. As a result of this  ruling,  the  generic
companies may obtain U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to  market
paclitaxel solely for treatment of metastatic breast cancer after  failure
of  combination  chemotherapy.  The  District  Court's  opinion  left  for
determination at trial the validity of the claims of the Company's patents
directed  to  the  low dose, three-hour administration of  paclitaxel  for
ovarian  cancer and denied the generic companies' summary judgment  motion
arguing non-infringement of the Company's patents. The Company may  pursue
its  appeal rights in the future. The claims remaining in the lawsuits are
currently  scheduled for trial in May 2000.  It is not  possible  at  this
time  to  make  a  reasonable assessment of the outcome of  the  remaining
claims  in  these actions nor to reasonably estimate the impact on  TAXOL*
sales or the amount of damages were the Company not to prevail.

GLUCOPHAGE sales increased 53% to $1,317 million. GLUCOPHAGE, the  leading
branded  oral medication for treatment of non-insulin dependent  (type  2)
diabetes,  had a 1999 market share of 31.3%, up from 26.9%  in  the  prior
year. In May 1999, the FDA approved AVANDIA in combination with GLUCOPHAGE
for  the  treatment of type 2 diabetes. AVANDIA is a product of SmithKline
Beecham, and is being co-promoted by Bristol-Myers Squibb in the U.S.  The
Hatch-Waxman  legislation exclusivity for GLUCOPHAGE expires in  September
2000.

PLAVIX,  a  platelet  aggregation inhibitor for the reduction  of  stroke,
heart attack and vascular death in atherosclerotic patients, reached sales
of  $547 million for the year compared to $144 million in the prior  year.
Sales  of AVAPRO, an angiotensin II receptor blocker for the treatment  of
hypertension,  increased  107%  to $255 million.  AVAPRO  and  PLAVIX  are
cardiovascular  products that were launched from the Bristol-Myers  Squibb
and Sanofi S.A. joint venture.

Sales  of  ZERIT*  and  VIDEX*, the Company's two anti-retroviral  agents,
increased  10%  to  $605  million and 27% to $205  million,  respectively.
ZERIT*  is  the  most  commonly  prescribed thymidine  nucleoside  reverse
transcriptase  inhibitor in HIV therapy in the U.S. In  1999,  ZERIT*  and
VIDEX* received regulatory approvals for use as first-line components of a
combination  antiretroviral  therapy regimen  for  HIV-infected  patients.
Also, in November, the FDA approved once-daily dosing for VIDEX*.

Sales of BUSPAR*, the Company's novel anti-anxiety agent, increased 14% to
$605  million, while sales of SERZONE*, a novel antidepressant,  increased
29%  to  $332 million. The exclusivity period for BUSPAR* expires  in  May
2000.

Sales  of  PARAPLATIN*,  which  is used in  combination  therapy  for  the
treatment of ovarian cancer, increased 14% to $600 million.

Sales  of  CEFZIL*,  an  oral  cephalosporin  used  in  the  treatment  of
respiratory  infections  and sinusitis, increased  12%  to  $402  million.
MONOPRIL*,   a  second-generation  angiotensin  converting  enzyme   (ACE)
inhibitor with once-a-day dosing, had increased sales of 12% reaching $424
million.



Sales  from the Oncology Therapeutics Network, a specialty distributor  of
anti-cancer medicines and related products, reached $894 million  for  the
year, an increase of 36% over 1998.

International   sales   of   MAXIPIME*,  a  fourth-generation   injectable
cephalosporin, increased 28% to $133 million. Effective January  1,  1999,
Dura   Pharmaceuticals,   Inc.  was  appointed  the   exclusive   domestic
distributor for MAXIPIME*.

Sales  of  EXCEDRIN*  remained at prior year levels of  $240  million.  In
October 1999, the FDA expanded the EXCEDRIN* Migraine indication from  the
treatment  of mild to moderate migraine pain to encompass the severe  pain
and  associated symptoms of the full migraine syndrome. Sales of BUFFERIN*
increased 18% to $147 million due to increased sales in Japan, while sales
of  EFFERALGAN*,  an  effervescent analgesic  sold  primarily  in  France,
increased 9% to $166 million.

Sales  of  captopril, an ACE inhibitor sold primarily under the  trademark
CAPOTEN*,  declined  24%  to  $484 million  due  to  the  loss  of  patent
exclusivity in international markets.

In 1998, Medicines segment sales increased 12% over 1997 levels. Increases
in  sales  of PRAVACHOL*, TAXOL*, PARAPLATIN*, ZERIT*, MONOPRIL*, BUSPAR*,
CEFZIL*,  GLUCOPHAGE, SERZONE*, VIDEX*, AVAPRO, PLAVIX and EXCEDRIN*  were
partially offset by decreases in sales of CAPOTEN*.

The  margin on earnings before taxes in the Medicines segment improved  to
28.1% in 1999 from 27.1% in 1998, as reductions, as a percentage of sales,
in  sales  force  expenditures, advertising  and  promotion  spending  and
general administrative expenses were partially offset by increases in cost
of  products sold. In 1998, the margin on earnings before taxes  of  27.1%
remained  at the prior year level as increases in research and development
and  sales force expenditures were offset by decreases in advertising  and
promotional spending and general administrative expenses.

Sales  in  the Beauty Care segment increased 3% in 1999 to $2,381 million,
reflecting a 2% increase due to volume, a 2% increase due to pricing and a
1% decrease due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. International sales
increased  7%  (9% excluding the effect of foreign exchange) and  domestic
sales increased 1%. A softening in market demand in combination with other
operating  factors, including the introduction of a new demand  management
manufacturing  system,  slowed domestic shipments  during  the  year.  The
Company's  Clairol division continues to be the number one  hair  products
Company  in  the  U.S.  Hair  care product sales  increased  6%  in  1999,
primarily  due to sales of the HERBAL ESSENCES* complete line of shampoos,
conditioners, styling aids, body wash and facial care. Sales of the HERBAL
ESSENCES*  line  increased 14% to $637 million due to the  launch  of  the
HERBAL ESSENCES* facial care line in the U.S. and the launch of the HERBAL
ESSENCES* hair care line in Japan, Germany and Brazil. HERBAL ESSENCES* is
the  number three brand in the total shampoo and conditioner market in the
U.S.,  and  is number four in body wash. Sales of DAILY DEFENSE* increased
44% to $118 million following its launch into international markets. Sales
of  AUSSIE* products were $124 million, an increase of 15% over the  prior
year.  Haircolor sales increased 1% with increases in NICE 'N EASY* of  3%
to  $187  million  and NATURAL INSTINCTS* of 9% to $94 million,  partially
offset by a decrease of 8% in HYDRIENCE* to $92 million.

In  1998, sales in the Beauty Care segment increased 22% from 1997 levels,
primarily  due  to increased sales of hair care products,  led  by  HERBAL
ESSENCES*.

The  margin on earnings before taxes in the Beauty Care segment  decreased
to  10.4% in 1999, from 14.9% in 1998, primarily due to an increase, as  a
percentage  of  sales,  in cost of products sold reflecting  a  change  in



product  mix,  higher  levels  of  operating  costs,  and  slower  product
shipments  compared to the prior year. Increased promotional  expenditures
for new product introductions and support for existing products, including
ULTRESS*  and AUSSIE LAND*, also contributed to the decline. In 1998,  the
margin  on  earnings  before taxes improved to 14.9% from  14.2%  in  1997
primarily  due to higher volumes and manufacturing efficiencies, partially
offset by investment spending behind new product introductions.

Sales  in  the  Medical Devices segment increased 4%  to  $1,682  million,
excluding  sales from a 1998 distribution agreement with the  acquirer  of
Zimmer's  divested  arthroscopy and powered surgical instrument  business.
Including the sales from the 1998 distribution agreement, Medical  Devices
sales  increased 2%, reflecting a 1% increase due to volume, a 1% increase
due  to  the  effect  of foreign exchange and no effect  from  changes  in
selling  prices.  Domestic  sales increased  2%  and  international  sales
increased  3%  (1%  excluding the effect of foreign  exchange).  Worldwide
sales  of  knee  prosthetic joint replacements  in  the  Company's  Zimmer
division  increased  11%  and hip replacement  sales  increased  12%.  The
Company's ConvaTec division is the worldwide market share leader in ostomy
and  advanced  wound care products. ConvaTec sales decreased  1%  to  $719
million  while remaining at prior year levels excluding foreign  exchange.
Sales  of  ostomy products decreased 3% and sales of wound  care  products
were slightly below prior year levels.

In  1998,  worldwide sales in the Medical Devices segment,  excluding  the
December  1997  divestiture of Zimmer's arthroscopy and  surgical  powered
instrument business, increased 7%.

The  margin  on  earnings  before taxes in  the  Medical  Devices  segment
improved  to 21.7% in 1999 from 20.4% in 1998, primarily due to a decrease
in  cost of products sold as a result of improved manufacturing processes.
The  margin  on  earnings  before taxes in  the  Medical  Devices  segment
improved  to  20.4%  in 1998 from 19.1% in 1997, due to  decreases,  as  a
percentage  of  sales,  in  other  marketing  and  general  administrative
expenses,  partially offset by increases in cost of products sold  due  to
higher  costs  for products sold under a distribution agreement  with  the
acquirer of Linvatec.

Sales  in  the  Nutritionals  segment  increased  5%  to  $1,850  million,
reflecting a 5% increase due to volume, a 1% decrease due to the effect of
foreign  exchange rate fluctuations primarily in Latin America  and  a  1%
increase  due to changes in selling prices. International sales  increased
2%  (5%  excluding  the effect of foreign exchange),  and  domestic  sales
increased 7%. Mead Johnson continues to be the leader in the worldwide and
U.S.  infant formula markets. Total infant formula sales increased  2%  to
$1,233  million  (3% excluding foreign exchange). Sales of  ENFAMIL*,  the
Company's  largest selling infant formula, increased 9%  to  $735  million
worldwide. Adult consumer nutritional sales increased 27% as a result of a
32% increase in sales of BOOST*, and $29 million in sales of VIACTIV* Soft
Calcium Chews launched in December 1998.

In  1998,  worldwide sales of Nutritionals decreased 2% from 1997  levels,
primarily  due  to decreases in infant formula sales partially  offset  by
growth of NUTRAMIGEN*, LACTO FREE*, BOOST* and CHOCO MILK*.

The  margin on earnings before taxes in the Nutritionals segment decreased
to  20.3%  in  1999  from  21.1%  in  1998,  primarily  due  to  increased
advertising  and promotion expenditures for ENFAMIL*, BOOST* and  VIACTIV*
Soft   Calcium  Chews.  The  margin  on  earnings  before  taxes  in   the
Nutritionals segment improved to 21.1% in 1998 from 20.1% in 1997  due  to
decreases,  as a percentage of sales, in cost of products sold,  resulting
from improved manufacturing efficiencies.

Geographic Areas

Bristol-Myers Squibb products are available in virtually every country  in



the  world;  its largest markets are the U.S., France, Japan, Germany  and
Canada.

Sales  in  the  United States, net of inter-area sales, increased  15%  in
1999.  Sales in the Medicines and Beauty Care segments comprised  72%  and
12%,  respectively, of the region's sales. Products with strong growth  in
the   region  included  GLUCOPHAGE,  TAXOL*,  ENFAMIL*,  BUSPAR*,  PLAVIX,
PARAPLATIN*  and AVAPRO. The margin on earnings before taxes decreased  to
24.2%  in  1999  from  25.3% in 1998 primarily  due  to  increases,  as  a
percentage  of  sales, in cost of products sold. In  1998,  sales  in  the
United  States  increased 15%, net of inter-area sales, primarily  due  to
growth  of  products  from  the  Medicines segment  including  GLUCOPHAGE,
TAXOL*,  PRAVACHOL* and hair care products from the Beauty  Care  segment.
The  margin on earnings before taxes increased to 25.3% in 1998 from 23.4%
in  1997 primarily due to decreases, as a percentage of sales, in cost  of
products sold, advertising and general administrative expenses.

Sales  in  Europe, Mid-East and Africa, net of inter-area sales, increased
2% (4% excluding foreign exchange). The Medicines segment comprised nearly
79%  of  sales  in the region. Products with strong growth in  the  region
included  PRAVACHOL*, TAXOL*, PLAVIX, AVAPRO and DAILY DEFENSE*. Increases
in  sales of these products were partially offset by decreases in sales of
ostomy  supplies  and  of  CAPOTEN*, due to the loss  of  exclusivity  and
generic  competition.  The margin on earnings before  taxes  increased  to
25.2%  in  1999 from 23.4% in 1998, primarily due to improved sales  force
effectiveness as evidenced by lower sales force expense, as  a  percentage
of  sales,  and  a  decrease in promotional expenses. In  1998,  sales  in
Europe,  Mid-East  and Africa, net of inter-area sales, increased  4%  (6%
excluding  foreign  exchange), due to sales growth of products,  including
TAXOL*,  ZERIT*,  PRAVACHOL* and HERBAL ESSENCES*.  These  increases  were
partially  offset  by  decreases in sales  of  CAPOTEN*  due  to  loss  of
exclusivity.  The margin on earnings before taxes decreased  to  23.4%  in
1998  from  23.8% in 1997 due to increases, as a percentage of  sales,  in
promotional expenses.

Sales  in Other Western Hemisphere countries, net of inter-area sales  and
excluding foreign exchange, increased 6% in 1999. The Medicines and Beauty
Care  segments comprised nearly 57% and 21%, respectively, of the region's
sales.  Including foreign exchange, sales decreased 5% primarily resulting
from  decreases in sales of CAPOTEN* and PRAVACHOL*, partially  offset  by
growth  in HERBAL ESSENCES*, ENFAMIL*, DAILY DEFENSE*, AVAPRO and  PLAVIX.
The  margin on earnings before taxes decreased to 6.5% in 1999 from  12.8%
in  1998  as  a result of the currency devaluation in Brazil and  regional
economic  downturns. In 1998, sales in Other Western Hemisphere countries,
net  of  inter-area sales, increased 11% (20% excluding foreign exchange),
due to the introduction of HERBAL ESSENCES* and CHOCO MILK* to the region.
The  margin on earnings before taxes decreased to 12.8% in 1998 from 14.2%
in  1997,  reflecting  increases, as a percentage of  sales,  in  cost  of
products sold.

Sales  in  the Pacific region, net of inter-area sales, increased  17%  in
1999  (8%  excluding foreign exchange). The favorable effect from  foreign
exchange   was   primarily  experienced  in  Japan.  The   Medicines   and
Nutritionals segments comprised 49% and 20%, respectively, of the region's
sales.  Products  with  strong growth included BUFFERIN*,  TAXOL*,  HERBAL
ESSENCES*  and PARAPLATIN*. TAXOL* sales improved 90% over the prior  year
following  the  Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare clearance  of  new
indications for TAXOL* as a treatment for breast and non-small  cell  lung
cancers.  In  1999,  margin on earnings before  taxes  increased  to  4.9%
primarily due to a decrease, as a percentage of sales, in advertising  and
promotion  spending.  As  a result of economic downturns  and  unfavorable
fluctuations  in  exchange rates, earnings before  taxes  in  the  Pacific
region  were minimal in 1998 and sales, net of inter-area sales, decreased
11%. Excluding foreign exchange, sales in 1998 increased 5% as a result of
increases  in  TAXOL* and HERBAL ESSENCES*, partly offset by decreases  in
infant formulas and CAPOTEN*.



Financial Instruments

Cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable securities totaled
almost  $3.0  billion at December 31, 1999, compared to $2.5  billion  and
$1.8  billion at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Working capital
continued  to  improve  in 1999 with $3.7 billion at  December  31,  1999,
compared  to $3.0 billion and $2.7 billion at December 31, 1998 and  1997,
respectively.  Cash  and  cash equivalents, time deposits  and  marketable
securities, and the conversion of other working capital items are expected
to fund near-term operations of the Company.

The  Company is exposed to market risk due to changes in currency exchange
rates.  To  reduce  this risk, the Company enters into certain  derivative
financial instruments, where available on a cost-effective basis, to hedge
its underlying economic exposure. These instruments also are managed on  a
consolidated basis to efficiently net exposures and thus take advantage of
any natural offsets.

It  is the Company's policy to hedge certain underlying economic exposures
to  reduce foreign exchange risk. Derivative financial instruments are not
used  for  trading purposes. Gains and losses on hedging transactions  are
offset by gains and losses on the underlying exposures being hedged.

Foreign  exchange  option  contracts and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  forward
contracts  are  used  to  hedge  anticipated transactions.  The  Company's
primary foreign currency exposures in relation to the U.S. dollar are  the
European currencies and the Japanese yen.

The  table  below  summarizes the Company's outstanding  foreign  exchange
option  contracts  as  of  December 31, 1999. The  fair  value  of  option
contracts,  which  will change over time, is estimated based  on  currency
rates  and  other  relevant  market factors.  The  fair  value  of  option
contracts should be viewed in relation to the fair value of the underlying
hedged  transactions  and the overall reduction in   exposure  to  adverse
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

At December 31, 1998, the Company held right-to-sell option contracts with
an aggregate notional amount, carrying value and fair value of $1,042
million, $22 million and $18 million, respectively. These contracts
primarily related to option contracts with the right to sell French francs
and Deutsche marks. Other contracts at December 31, 1998 included right-to-
buy option contracts, primarily to buy Japanese yen for U.S. dollars and
British pounds for Deutsche marks, as well as other option contracts, that
include the right to buy and sell several currencies. These contracts had
an aggregate notional amount, carrying value and fair value of $265
million, $5 million and $13 million, respectively.

The  Company  maintains  cash  and  cash equivalents,  time  deposits  and
marketable securities with various financial institutions. These financial
institutions are located primarily in the U.S. and Europe. Company  policy
is designed to limit exposure to any one financial institution.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In June 1999, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial   Accounting  Standards  No.  137,  Accounting  for   Derivative
Instruments  and  Hedging Activities - Deferral of the effective  date  of
FASB  Statement No. 133. This statement defers the effective date of  SFAS
133,  Accounting  for  Derivative Instruments and Hedging  Activities,  to
fiscal  years beginning after June 15, 2000. This statement requires  that
companies recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the
balance  sheet  and measure these instruments at fair value.  The  Company
will  adopt  this statement on January 1, 2001 and is currently evaluating
its  impact  on  the Company's existing accounting policies and  financial
reporting disclosures.

Euro Conversion

On  January  1,  1999, certain members of the European  Union  established
fixed conversion rates between their
existing currencies and the European Union's common currency, known as the
euro. It is planned that by July 1, 2002, the participating countries will
withdraw all currencies and exclusively use the euro.

The  Company  has committed resources to conduct assessments and  to  take
corrective  actions to ensure it is prepared for the introduction  of  the
euro. The Company is actively addressing the many areas involved with  the
introduction of the euro, including information management, finance, legal
and  tax.  This review includes the conversion of information  technology,
business and financial systems, evaluating currency risk and the effect on
the  Company's financial instruments, as well as the impact on the pricing
and distribution of Company products.

The  Company believes the effect of the introduction of the euro, as  well
as  any related cost of conversion, will not have a material impact on the
results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Financial Position

Cash  and  cash  equivalents, time deposits and marketable  securities  at
December  31,  1999 were denominated primarily in U.S. dollar  instruments
with  near-term maturities. The average interest yield on  cash  and  cash
equivalents was 5.9% at December 31, 1999, while interest yields  on  time
deposits and marketable securities averaged 4.8% at December 31, 1999.

Short-term  borrowings  and  long-term  debt  at  December  31,  1999  are
denominated  primarily  in U.S. dollars; however,  the  Company  had  $177
million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 1999. This



commercial  paper has original maturities not exceeding 270  days  and  is
denominated in Euros and U.S. dollars. Also included is Japanese yen long-
term debt of $280 million.

Internally generated cash provided by operations was $4.5 billion in 1999,
$4.1 billion in 1998 and $2.5 billion in 1997. Cash provided by operations
continued to be the Company's primary source of funds to finance operating
needs  and  expenditures  for new plants and equipment.  As  part  of  the
Company's  ongoing  commitment to improve plant  efficiency  and  maintain
superior  research facilities, the Company has invested  $2.3  billion  in
capital  expansion  over the past three years. Cash flow  from  operations
also  included  product  liability payments, net of insurance  recoverable
receipts of $667 million in 1999, $519 million in 1998 and $561 million in
1997.

Cash provided by operations also was used over the past three years to pay
dividends of $4.8 billion, to finance $4.1 billion of the Company's  share
repurchase  program and to fund business acquisitions at a  cost  of  $613
million. The Company's share repurchase program authorizes the Company  to
purchase  common  stock from time to time in the open  market  or  through
private transactions as market conditions permit. During 1999, the Company
purchased  22.3 million shares of common stock at a cost of $1.4  billion,
bringing the total shares acquired since the program's inception to  299.6
million. In December 1999, the Company announced a $2 billion increase  in
the  stock repurchase program authorization. During the past three  years,
the Company has repurchased 86.5 million shares at a cost of $4.1 billion.
In  May  1999,  at  the annual meeting of stockholders,  the  stockholders
approved  the increase in the number of shares of common stock  authorized
to 4.5 billion shares.

Employment levels of 54,500 at December 1999 essentially remained at prior
year  levels  of 54,700. Sales per employee improved to $371  thousand  in
1999 from $335 thousand in 1998 and $310 thousand in 1997.

Return on Stockholders' Equity improved over the last three years and  was
51.4%  in 1999, 49.2% in 1998, excluding the special charge, and 46.5%  in
1997.

                        (dollars in millions)

Note 1  ACCOUNTING POLICIES
- ---------------------------

Basis  of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements  include
the   accounts  of  Bristol-Myers  Squibb  Company  and   all   of   its
subsidiaries.

Cash  and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents primarily include
securities  with  a  maturity of three months or less  at  the  time  of
purchase, recorded at cost, which approximates market.

Time  Deposits and Marketable Securities - Time deposits and  marketable
securities are available for sale and are recorded at fair value,  which
approximates cost.

Inventory Valuation - Inventories are generally stated at average  cost,
not in excess of market.

Capital  Assets and Depreciation - Expenditures for additions,  renewals
and  betterments  are  capitalized at cost.  Depreciation  is  generally
computed by the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives
of  the  related assets. The estimated useful lives of the major classes
of  depreciable assets are 50 years for buildings and 3 to 40 years  for
machinery, equipment and fixtures.

Excess  of Cost over Net Tangible Assets - The excess of cost  over  net
tangible assets received in business acquisitions is being amortized  on
a straight-line basis over periods not exceeding 40 years. The excess of
cost  over  net tangible assets is periodically reviewed for  impairment
based  on  an assessment of future operations (including cash flows)  to
ensure that the excess of cost over net tangible assets is appropriately
valued.

Product Liability - Accruals for product liability are recorded,  on
an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has been
incurred   and  the  amount  of  the  liability  can  be  reasonably
estimated,  based  on  existing  information.  These  accruals   are
adjusted   periodically  as  assessment  efforts  progress   or   as
additional  information becomes available. Receivables  for  related
insurance  or  other third party recoveries for product  liabilities
are  recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that  a
recovery  will  be realized. Insurance recoverable recorded  on  the
balance sheet has, in general, payment terms of three years or less.

Revenue Recognition - Revenue from product sales is recognized upon
shipment to customers.

Earnings  Per  Share  -  Basic earnings  per  common  share  are
computed using the weighted average number of shares outstanding
during the year.  Diluted earnings per common share are computed
using  the weighted average number of shares outstanding  during
the  year, plus the incremental shares outstanding assuming  the
exercise of dilutive stock options

Denmark-based  generic  drug business, and  Hexachimie,  a  specialty
chemical manufacturer based in France, resulting in a combined pretax
gain of $201 million.

In  1997, the Company completed the sale of Linvatec Corporation, its
arthroscopy and surgical powered instrument business, resulting in  a
pretax  gain  of  $225  million.  The Company acquired  Abeefe  S.A.,

range    of    prescription   and   nonprescription   anti-infective,
respiratory,  anti-inflammatory  and  dermatological  products.   The

The  Company has settled its United States Federal income tax returns
with the Internal Revenue Service through 1991.

United  States  Federal  income  taxes  have  not  been  provided  on
substantially   all   of   the  unremitted   earnings   of   non-U.S.
subsidiaries,  since  it  is  management's  practice  and  intent  to
reinvest  such earnings in the operations of these subsidiaries.  The
total  amount of the net unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries
was approximately $4.4 billion at December 31, 1999.

Each  share of the Company's preferred stock is convertible into  16.96
shares  of  common stock and is callable at the Company's  option.  The
reductions in the number of issued shares of preferred stock  in  1999,
1998 and 1997 were due to conversions into shares of common stock.

Dividends per common share were $.86 in 1999, $.78 in 1998  and  $.76
in 1997.

Stock Compensation Plans
- ------------------------

Under the Company's 1997 Stock Incentive Plan, officers, directors  and
key  employees may be granted options to purchase the Company's  common
stock  at no less than 100% of the market price on the date the  option
is granted. Options generally become exercisable in installments of 25%
per  year on each of the first through the fourth anniversaries of  the
grant date and have a maximum term of 10 years. Additionally, the  plan
provides  for  the  granting of stock appreciation rights  whereby  the
grantee  may  surrender exercisable options and  receive  common  stock
and/or  cash measured by the excess of the market price of  the  common
stock  over the option exercise price. The plan also provides  for  the
granting of performance-based stock options to certain key executives.

Under  the  terms  of  the  1997  Stock  Incentive  Plan,  as  amended,
additional  shares  are  authorized  in  the  amount  of  0.9%  of  the
outstanding  shares  per year through 2002. The plan  incorporates  the
Company's long-term performance awards.

In addition, the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan provides for the granting of
up  to  20,000,000 shares of common stock to key employees, subject  to
restrictions as to continuous employment except in the case of death or
normal  retirement.  Restrictions generally  expire  over  a  five-year
period from date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized over  the
restricted  period.  At  December  31,  1999,  a  total  of   2,135,524
restricted shares were outstanding under the plan.

Under  the  TeamShare  Stock  Option  Plan,  all  full-time  employees,
excluding key executives, meeting certain years of service requirements
are  granted  options  to purchase the Company's common  stock  at  the
market  price  on  the date the options are granted.  The  Company  has
authorized  62,000,000  shares  for issuance  under  the  plan.  As  of
December  31,  1999, a total of 23,579,400 shares have  been  exercised
under the plan.

The  Company  applies  Accounting  Principles  Board  Opinion  No.  25,
Accounting  for  Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations
in  accounting for its plans. Accordingly, no compensation expense  has
been  recognized for its stock-based compensation plans other than  for
restricted  stock  and performance-based awards. Had compensation  cost
for  the Company's other stock option plans been determined based  upon
the  fair  value  at  the  grant  date for  awards  under  these  plans
consistent with the methodology prescribed under Statement of Financial
Accounting  Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
the Company's net income and earnings per share would have been reduced
by  approximately  $198 million, or $.10 per common  share,  basic  and
diluted,  in  1999, $136 million, or $.07 per common share,  basic  and
diluted,  in 1998 and $85 million, or $.04 per common share, basic  and
diluted,  in  1997. The fair value of the options granted during  1999,
1998  and  1997  was estimated as $17.37 per common share,  $11.80  per
common  share and $6.41 per common share, respectively, on the date  of
grant  using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the  following
assumptions:

Note 10  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
- ------------------------------

Foreign  exchange  option  contracts and, to a  lesser  extent,  forward
contracts,  are used to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions,
primarily intercompany inventory purchases expected to occur within  the
next year.

The Company has exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and
liabilities,  which  approximated $2,179  million,  $2,310  million  and
$2,070  million  at  December  31, 1999, 1998  and  1997,  respectively,
primarily in Europe, Japan and Canada. The Company mitigates the  effect
of these exposures through third-party borrowings.

The  risk  of loss associated with the types of foreign exchange  option
contracts entered into by the Company is limited to premium amounts paid
for  the option contracts. Premiums are deferred in Prepaid Expenses and
amortized  in  the  consolidated statement of  earnings  (in  the  Other
caption) over the time frame of the underlying hedged transaction. Gains
related  to  the  option contracts, which qualify as hedges  of  foreign
currency  anticipated transactions, are recognized in earnings when  the
hedged transactions are recognized. Gains and losses on foreign exchange
forward  contracts  are  recognized  in  the  basis  of  the  underlying
transaction being hedged.

                NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                           (dollars in millions)


The  notional amounts of the Company's foreign exchange option contracts
at  December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 were $1,762 million, $1,307 million
and $1,279 million, respectively.

The  Company does not anticipate any material adverse effect  on  its
financial   position   resulting  from  its  involvement   in   these
instruments,  nor does it anticipate non-performance by  any  of  its
counterparties.

At  December  31,  1999,  1998 and 1997, the carrying  value  of  all
financial instruments, both short- and long-term, approximated  their
fair values.

amounts  to  provide  for current service and  to  fund  past  service
liability.  Plan  benefits are primarily based on  years  of  credited
service and on the participants' compensation. Plan assets principally
consist of equity and fixed income securities.

                           (dollars in millions)


The  projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation,  and
fair  value  of  plan  assets for the pension  plans  with  accumulated
benefit  obligations in excess of plan assets were $319  million,  $245
million  and $56 million, respectively, as of December 31,  1999,  $288
million, $230 million and $40 million, respectively, as of December 31,
1998  and $271 million, $208 million and $37 million, respectively,  as
of  December  31, 1997. This is primarily attributable to  an  unfunded
benefit equalization plan.

Savings and Investment Program.  The Company's contribution is based  on
employee  contributions  and  the  level  of  company  match.    Company
contributions to the plan were $49 million in 1999, $45 million in  1998
and $40 million in 1997.

For  measurement purposes, an annual rate of increase in the  per  capita
cost  of  covered health care benefits of 7% for participants was assumed
for 2000; the rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 5% in 2007 and to
remain at that level thereafter.

A  one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend  rates
would have the following effects:

Note 15  LITIGATION
- -------------------

Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings of a nature considered normal to
its businesses are pending against
the  Company  and  certain of its subsidiaries. The most  significant  of
these  are described below. Reference is made to Item 3 Legal Proceedings
in Part 1 of this Form 10-K Annual Report.

Breast Implant
- --------------

The   Company,   together  with  its  subsidiary,   Medical   Engineering
Corporation  (MEC),  and certain other companies, has  been  named  as  a
defendant  in  a  number  of  claims and lawsuits  alleging  damages  for
personal  injuries  of  various types resulting from polyurethane-covered
breast  implants and smooth-walled breast implants formerly  manufactured
by  MEC or a related Company. Of the more than 90,000 claims or potential
claims against the Company in direct lawsuits or through registration  in
the  nationwide class action settlement approved by the Federal  District
Court  in Birmingham, Alabama (the "Revised Settlement"), most have  been
dealt with through the  Revised Settlement, other settlements,  or trial.




                      BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY
               NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                          (dollars in millions)

As of December  31, 1999, the Company's contingent liability in  respect
of  breast  implant claims was limited  to  residual  unpaid Revised
Settlement  obligations and to roughly 1,700 remaining  opt-outs who have
pursued or may pursue their claims in court.

As  of  December  31,  1999, approximately 6,700 United  States  and  200
foreign breast implant recipients were plaintiffs in lawsuits pending  in
federal  and  state  courts in the United States and  certain  courts  in
Canada and Australia. These figures include the claims of plaintiffs that
are in the process of being settled and/or dismissed.In  these lawsuits,
about 3,660 U.S. and 49 foreign plaintiffs opted  out of the Revised
Settlement. The lawsuits of  the  3,040  U.S. plaintiffs who did not opt
out are  expected  to  be dismissed  since  these plaintiffs are among the
estimated  74,000  women with  MEC implants who chose to participate in the
nationwide settlement. Of  the  3,660  opt-out plaintiffs, an estimated
1,960 have claims  based upon products that were not manufactured or sold
by MEC or that have been or are in the process of being settled and/or
dismissed. Accordingly, the number  of  remaining  plaintiffs who have
pursued or  may  pursue  their claims  in court against the Company is
roughly 1,700, as stated  in  the preceding paragraph.

Under  the  terms  of  the  Revised Settlement, additional  opt-outs  are
expected to be minimal since the deadline for  U.S. class members to opt
out has passed. In addition, the Company's remaining  obligations under
the Revised Settlement Program  are  limited because  most payments to
"Current Claimants" have already been made, no additional  "Current  Claims"
may be filed without  court  approval,  and because  payments  of claims
to so-called "Other Registrants"  and  "Late Registrants" are limited by
the terms of the Revised Settlement. Separate class  action settlements
have been approved in the provincial courts  of Ontario  and Quebec, and
an agreement has been reached under which  other foreign  breast implant
recipients may settle their claims.  The  Company believes it will be able
to address remaining opt-out claims as  well  as expected  remaining
obligations  under the  Revised  Settlement  program within its reserves
described below.

In  the  fourth  quarter of 1993, the Company recorded a charge  of  $500
million  before  taxes ($310 million after taxes) in  respect  of  breast
implant  cases.  The  charge  consisted of  $1.5  billion  for  potential
liabilities  and  expenses, offset by $1.0 billion of expected  insurance
proceeds.  In the fourth quarters of 1994 and 1995, the Company  recorded
additional  special  charges of $750 million before taxes  ($488  million
after  taxes)  and $950 million before taxes ($590 million after  taxes),
respectively, related to breast implant product liability claims. In  the
fourth quarter of 1998, the Company recorded an additional special charge
to  earnings in the amount of $800 million before taxes and increased its
insurance receivable in the amount of $100 million, resulting  in  a  net
charge  to  earnings  of $433 million after taxes in  respect  of  breast
implant  product  liability  claims. During 1999,  1998  and  1997,  cash
payments,  net of insurance receipts, of $631 million, $551  million  and
$549  million,  respectively, were made related  to  the  breast  implant
product liability claims. At December 31, 1999, $354 million was included
in  current  and  other liabilities for breast implant product  liability
claims.

Prescription Drug
- -----------------

As  of  December  31,  1999, the Company remains a defendant  in  several
actions  challenging  pricing  on brand name  prescription  drugs.  These
actions  include several currently consolidated antitrust actions brought
against  the Company and more than 30 other pharmaceutical manufacturers,
drug   wholesalers  and  pharmacy  benefit  managers  by  certain   chain
drugstores,   supermarket  chains  and  independent   drugstores;   state
pharmaceutical  actions;  and  purported  class  actions  on  behalf   of
consumers. In the fourth quarter of 1998, the Company recorded a special




                      BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY
               NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                          (dollars in millions)

charge  to  earnings  in  the amount of $100 million  before  taxes  ($62
million after taxes) in respect of this prescription  drug  litigation.
The  Company  will  continue  to  defend vigorously its position in this
ongoing litigation and believes  it  will be able to address all remaining
claims within its reserves. During 1999, cash  payments of $59 million were
made related to the pricing litigation claims.

TAXOL*
- ------

There  is  no  composition of matter patent for  paclitaxel  (the  active
ingredient in TAXOL*). In the United States, the Company is presently the
only  manufacturer and marketer of a product containing  paclitaxel.   In
1997  and 1998, the Company filed several lawsuits alleging that a number
of  generic drug companies infringed its patents covering certain methods
of   administering  paclitaxel  when  they  filed  abbreviated  new  drug
applications  seeking  regulatory  approval  to  sell  paclitaxel.  These
actions  were  consolidated for discovery in the United  States  District
Court  for  the  District of New Jersey. The Company does  not  assert  a
monetary  claim against any of the defendants, but seeks to  prevent  the
defendants  from  marketing  paclitaxel in a  manner  that  violates  the
Company's patents. The defendants have asserted that they do not infringe
the   Company's   patents  and  that  these  patents  are   invalid   and
unenforceable.   Some  defendants  also  asserted  counterclaims  seeking
damages for alleged antitrust and unfair competition violations.

On  January 4, 2000, the District Court granted the Company's  motion  to
dismiss  certain  of the antitrust and unfair competition  counterclaims.
The  Company's motion for summary judgment on the remaining antitrust and
unfair competition counterclaims was denied on March 17, 2000.

On  February  29,  2000, the District Court granted in part  the  generic
companies' summary judgment motions for invalidity by finding all  claims
of the Company's patents in dispute invalid, except for claims limited to
the  treatment of ovarian cancer. As a result of this ruling, the generic
companies may obtain U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to market
paclitaxel solely for treatment of metastatic breast cancer after failure
of  combination  chemotherapy.  The District  Court's  opinion  left  for
determination  at  trial  the validity of the  claims  of  the  Company's
patents directed to the low dose, three-hour administration of paclitaxel
for  ovarian  cancer and denied the generic companies'  summary  judgment
motion arguing non-infringement of the Company's patents. The Company may
pursue its appeal rights in the future.

The claims remaining in the lawsuits are currently scheduled for trial in
May 2000.  It is not possible at this time to make a reasonable
assessment of the outcome of the remaining claims in these actions nor to
reasonably estimate the impact on TAXOL* sales or the amount of damages
were the Company not to prevail.


While  it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of  these
cases, it is the opinion of management that they will not have a material
adverse   effect  on  the  Company's  operating  results,  liquidity   or
consolidated financial position.

conformity  with accounting principles generally accepted in  the  United
States.  In  addition, in our opinion, the financial  statement  schedule
