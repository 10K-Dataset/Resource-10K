Overview

Akamai® is the global leader in distributed
computing solutions and services, offering solutions designed to
make the Internet predictable, scalable, and secure for
customers seeking to conduct business over the Internet. The
Akamai on demand platform enables customers to easily extend
their Internet-facing operations without the cost of building
out infrastructure. Akamai serves hundreds of today’s most
successful enterprises and government agencies around the globe.

We began selling our content delivery services in
1999 under the trade name FreeFlow®. Later that year, we
added streaming media delivery services to our portfolio and
introduced traffic management services that allow customers to
monitor traffic patterns on their websites both on a continual
basis and for specific events. In 2000, we began offering a
software solution that identifies the geographic location and
network origin from which end users access our customers’
websites, enabling content providers to customize content
without compromising user privacy. In 2001, we commenced
commercial sales of our EdgeSuite® offering, a suite of
services that allows for high-performance and dynamic delivery
of web content. In 2003, we began offering on a commercial basis
our EdgeComputing

SM

service, which allows for
delivery of applications, such as store/dealer locators,
promotional contests, search functionalities and user
registration, over our network.

Our services are easy to implement and are highly
scalable. Historically, our FreeFlow customers selected
bandwidth-intensive content, typically media-rich non-text
objects such as photographs, banner advertisements and graphics,
for delivery over our network. With the introduction of our
EdgeSuite service, customers may dynamically deliver a broader
range of content and applications — such as customer
relationship management tools, pay-per-view video, software
updates and entire websites — over our platform. The
technology underlying our EdgeSuite service enables us to locate
applications and content geographically closer to end-users.
Customers of our EdgeComputing service are able to deploy
applications that scale on demand and perform more reliably
while reducing the demands on their own infrastructures. Using
the proprietary algorithms we have developed that continuously
monitor and load-balance our network in real-time, we determine
the most efficient methods and routes available for delivering
the applications and content to our customers’ end users.

We were incorporated in Delaware in 1998 and have
our corporate headquarters at 8 Cambridge Center, Cambridge,
Massachusetts, 02142. Our Internet website address is
www.akamai.com. We are not including the information contained
on our website as part of, or incorporating it by reference
into, this annual report on Form 10-K.

We are registered as a reporting company under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which we refer
to as the Exchange Act. Accordingly, we file or furnish with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, or the Commission, annual
reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q
and current reports on Form 8-K as required by the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission. We refer to
these reports as Periodic Reports. The public may read and copy
any Periodic Reports or other materials we file with the
Commission at the Commission’s Public Reference Room at 450
Fifth Street, NW, Washington, DC 20549. Information on the
operation of the Public Reference Room is available by calling

maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and
information statements and other information regarding issuers,
such as Akamai, that file electronically with the Commission.
The address of this website is http://www.sec.gov.

We make available, free of charge, on or through
our Internet website our Periodic Reports and amendments to
those Periodic Reports as soon as reasonably practicable after
we electronically file them with the Commission.

Industry Background

The end of the 20th century witnessed the
explosive growth of the Internet and the emergence of
e-business. E-business is the use of the Internet to streamline
processes, improve productivity and increase efficiencies,
enabling enterprises to communicate more effectively with
customers, vendors and partners, connect back-end data systems
and transact commerce in a secure manner. The Internet, however,
is a complex system of networks that was not originally created
to accommodate the volume or sophistication of today’s
business communication demands. As a result, information is
frequently delayed or lost on its way through the Internet as a
result of many potential bottlenecks, including:

Driven by competition, globalization and
cost-containment strategies, e-business is becoming a critical
component for corporate enterprises. These trends require
enterprises to rely on an agile e-business infrastructure to
meet their real-time strategic and business objectives. We
expect enterprises to favor a more decentralized information
technology architecture to support their goals of disaster
recovery, high availability, denial-of-service mitigation and
back up. We also anticipate that enterprises will continue to
expand their use of technologies that allow an enterprise to
conduct business over the Internet, which are referred to as
Internet Protocol, or IP, technologies.

In recent years, government agencies have begun
to migrate more and more of their processes from in-person,
mail, or phone services to Internet-based applications. As a
result, it has become essential to many public sector bodies
that their websites be more reliable and that they deliver their
content and applications more efficiently to their constituents.
At the same time, budget cuts preclude development of an
expensive self-managed infrastructure. We expect that an
increasing number of public sector entities will look to third
party content and application delivery providers like Akamai to
solve these challenges.

Our Solutions

Akamai provides proven services and solutions for
predictable, scalable and secure e-business transactions,
without the cost of building out infrastructure. Built on the
globally distributed Akamai EdgePlatform, Akamai solutions
extend Web operations anywhere, anytime, and improve insight and
management of applications and content through our
EdgeControl

SM

technology.

These services and solutions enable customers to
reduce the complexity and cost of deploying and operating a
uniform IP infrastructure while ensuring superior performance,
reliability, scalability and manageability. Forming the core of
these services are our EdgeSuite and EdgeComputing offerings,
suites of services that allows enterprises to maximize
performance and minimize cost while distributing their
Internet-related content and applications using IP technology.

Akamai also offers a set of solutions aimed at
solving customers’ business problems, including online
commerce, Web site security, e-business continuity and optimized
extranets. These solutions combine various



features and capabilities of the EdgeSuite and
EdgeComputing services in a way that uniquely addresses each of
these problem sets.

EdgeSuite

By moving electronic content and applications
closer to our customers’ end users, our EdgeSuite service
allows enterprises to improve the end-user experience, boost
reliability and scalability and reduce the cost of their
e-business infrastructure. We believe that our EdgeSuite
offering is the only service available in the industry capable
of providing the benefits of distributed performance to an
enterprise’s entire website and all aspects of its
applications. Our EdgeSuite service reduces the amount of IP
infrastructure that our customers must implement to maintain a
global Internet presence. While, site owners maintain a control
copy of their applications and content, our EdgeSuite service
provides global delivery, load balancing and storage of these
applications and content, enabling businesses to focus valuable
resources on strategic matters, rather than tactical
infrastructure issues.

Customers of our EdgeSuite service have access to
the following service features:

•

Secure Content

Enterprises are increasingly aware that having
    the ability to transmit content securely over the Internet is a
    crucial component of their e-business program. Our services
    offer support for the distribution of secure Internet-related
    content. Using Secure Sockets Layer, or SSL, transport, our
    EdgeSuite offering ensures that content is distributed privately
    and reliably between two communicating applications.

•

Tiered Distribution

As their websites and interactions become more
    complex, enterprises are seeking tools to manage their Internet
    presence. Tiered distribution is a hierarchical content
    distribution method that we use on behalf of participating
    customers. With this approach, we make available a set of
    well-connected “core” server regions to store given
    content and, thus, to alleviate the load on the customer’s
    origin servers. Akamai’s edge servers can obtain content
    from these core server regions in lieu of going to the
    customer’s origin servers. As a result, we are able to
    efficiently distribute our customers’ content so that our
    customers can significantly reduce the load on their IP
    infrastructure and protect their online business from unexpected
    spikes in demand.

•

Site Fail Over

It is essential that e-businesses maintain
    constant availability of their websites. Our EdgeSuite service
    guarantees delivery of default content in the event that the
    primary, or source, version of the website of an enterprise
    customer becomes unavailable. Our EdgeSuite offering’s
    default content capabilities provide a solution for:

•

Site
    mirroring

— we provide an
    economical way to mirror a website without the expense of
    investing in additional data centers to achieve redundancy.

•

E-business
    continuity

— we ensure
    content availability if an unforeseen event causes a
    customer’s website to crash.

•

Site
    maintenance

— we deliver
    fail-over service so that a website remains available to end
    users during updates and maintenance.

•

Net Storage

For an enterprise to most effectively utilize the
    Internet, it must have available efficient content storage
    solutions from which to access content for delivery to site
    visitors. Our EdgeSuite service provides a complete solution for
    digital storage needs for all content types. Our
    EdgeSuite Net Storage feature uses multiple terabytes of
    storage capacity, geographical replication, a scalable
    architecture and proprietary mapping and routing technology to
    ensure that content is consistently available.

•

Global Traffic Management

Our EdgeSuite service substantially reduces the
    amount of Internet infrastructure required to maintain a global
    Internet presence by providing geographically distributed IP
    infrastructures that reduce



reliance on an origin site for presentation and
    application processing and enable site owners to maintain only a
    source copy of the website. Enterprises with geographically
    distributed IP infrastructures can use EdgeSuite Global
    Traffic Management to improve the availability, responsiveness
    and reliability of a multi-location website. When we need to
    access a customer’s origin site that has been mirrored
    elsewhere, we rely on our Global Traffic Management feature to
    choose the optimal mirrored site. Global Traffic Management
    frees enterprises from managing complex hardware and allows them
    to concentrate on their core business. Global Traffic Management
    reduces the need for enterprises to purchase, maintain or house
    hardware that can rapidly become obsolete and provides
    continuous monitoring and support from our Network Operations
    Command Center.

•

Content Targeting

Content targeting allows our customers to
    customize content by accurately identifying the visiting
    user’s geographic location, connection speed, device type
    or other specified information so that content can be targeted
    for each visitor in real time and be delivered from our servers
    located in networks throughout the Internet. Content targeting
    enables content providers to deliver localized content,
    customized store-fronts, targeted advertising and adaptive
    marketing. We believe that these site attributes encourage
    individuals to visit sites with these features more frequently
    and for longer periods of time.

•

Digitized Downloads

Digitized downloads consist of software
    applications and documents that may be downloaded onto the
    computers of permitted recipients. Our EdgeSuite service
    provides a solution for digital file distribution that offers
    our customers the ability to leverage the Internet as a
    distribution channel, resulting in expanded customer reach,
    significant cost efficiencies and time-to-market advantage. The
    unique, globally distributed network architecture on which the
    Akamai platform is based enhances the security and reliability
    of downloads while reducing infrastructure and bandwidth
    requirements at the origin site.

•

Business Intelligence

The Akamai EdgeControl Management Center provides
    detailed real-time and historical information about site
    visitors, their activities while visiting a customer’s
    site. This can help our customers understand the effectiveness
    of a website’s content in meeting their goals. It also
    provides IP infrastructure information with details on website
    performance, site visitors’ access points, traffic patterns
    and automated delivery of logs containing information about
    website traffic and usage in industry-standard formats.
    Companies use Business Intelligence’s comprehensive tools
    to evaluate their strategic investments in website functionality.

•

Streaming Services

Our streaming services provide for the delivery
    of streaming audio and video content to Internet users. We offer
    streaming services in all major formats. We principally focus on
    enterprise streaming applications such as video broadcasting of
    large events over IP networks and video archives of corporate
    events or public news events. We believe that we have
    demonstrated superior streaming network performance and quality,
    particularly for broadband users.

•

Edge Side Includes and Dynamic Content
    Assembly

Edge Side Includes (ESI) accelerates dynamic
    web-based applications by identifying cacheable and
    non-cacheable website page components that can be aggregated,
    assembled and delivered at the network edge.
    EdgeSuite Dynamic Content Assembly gives enterprises the
    ability to deliver rich, dynamically-rendered pages without any
    performance penalty. EdgeSuite Dynamic Content Assembly
    allows companies to assemble and customize website pages at an
    optimal location within the Akamai’s global network of
    servers. Customized content is delivered quickly and reliably to
    each user without forcing interaction with a centralized
    application server.



EdgeComputing

Enterprises can position themselves to grow
revenue and market share, compete more effectively and reduce
business costs by enabling World Wide Web applications that
improve promotion and sales, customer service, and vendor and
partner management. However, most enterprise IT infrastructures
are not equipped to handle these applications, which can include
store/ dealer locators, promotional contests, search
functionality, user registration, product/ pricing configurators
and other key tools. Akamai EdgeComputing enables enterprises to
deliver Java (J2EE) Web applications that scale on demand and
perform faster and more reliably worldwide than they could
relying on their internal IT infrastructures. At the same time,
we help them reduce the demands on their own IT infrastructures
and simplify their support requirements.

EdgeComputing allows enterprises to extend more
of their applications into the network, closer to end users,
including customers, partners, suppliers, and employees. By
adding application server capabilities and support for
application and development frameworks, such as Java (J2EE) and
Microsoft .NET, we are striving to become a pervasive,
distributed, and standards-based high performance deployment
platform for enterprise applications, Internet-based services
and website content of all kinds.

In May 2003, we launched Akamai
EdgeComputing

SM

Powered by IBM WebSphere®, a new
solution that enables enterprises to deploy Java-based software
applications over the Akamai network on a
“pay-as-you-go” basis. Our customers can now extend
applications built on IBM’s WebSphere Internet
infrastructure software to Akamai’s distributed network of
servers to handle everyday Web application traffic and spikes in
demand. Specific application functions, such as creating and
viewing a personalized portal, can now be securely
“pushed” to the edge of our network and executed
closer to the user.

Akamai Solutions

Akamai Online Commerce is a highly secure, on
demand business solution that helps customers more efficiently
conduct e-business transactions by meeting peak performance
needs to deliver a positive customer experience, increasing
conversion rates and ensuring transaction completion while
reducing infrastructure build-out costs.

Akamai e-Business Continuity is an e-business
solution designed to provide Internet-enabled enterprises with
100% availability of their most critical Web operations,
providing online business continuity by distributing
applications over a global network.

Akamai Site Security is a set of controls that
help protect e-businesses against malicious and random traffic
from hackers, worms, and viruses, while providing insight into
the effectiveness of their security systems.

Akamai Optimized Extranets is an e-business
solution that improves the performance, scalability and security
of extranet business applications, without requiring expensive
build-outs.

EdgeControl

Underlying all of Akamai’s services and
solutions is our

Edge

Control technology which provides
comprehensive reporting and management capabilities. Often
businesses use outsourced services to extend the reach and scope
of their e-business initiatives and achieve the performance and
reliability benefits that these services can deliver. However,
for many enterprises, outsourcing also means handing over the
control of their e-business infrastructure to a third party.
Typically, relying on outside organizations forces a difficult
choice: gain the significant advantages of third-party content
delivery services or maintain visibility and control of your own
infrastructure and the flow of your own information.

Our

Edge

Control technology offers a suite
of enterprise-class management services for content and
applications across the Internet that help eliminate the need to
make this choice by:

•

providing our customers with unprecedented
    visibility and control over their content and infrastructure
    across the Internet;



•

enabling companies to optimize, monitor and
    manage the performance of their e-business infrastructure; and

•

ensuring the effectiveness of information and
    applications.

Our

Edge

Control offering seamlessly
integrates with existing enterprise management systems, allowing
customers to manage their distributed content and applications
via a common interface.

Edge

Control provides integration
with third party network management tools, including those
offered by IBM, Hewlett-Packard and BMC Software. Having created
one of the industry’s first examples of a commercially
proven utility computing platform, we now provide a global
network of servers that can be utilized “on demand,”
allowing customers to view and manage usage, billing,
troubleshooting, monitoring, and reporting, based on their
individual business requirements.

Business Segments and Geographic
Information

We operate in one business segment: providing
e-business infrastructure services and solutions. For the years
ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, approximately 16% and
13%, respectively, of revenue was derived from our operations
outside the United States, of which 13% and 10%, respectively,
relate to Europe. No single country accounted for 10% or more of
revenue derived outside of the United States. For all other
years, less than 10% of revenue was derived from sources outside
of the United States. Revenue from services accounted for 98%,
89% and 83%, respectively, of our total revenue for the years
ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. For more
information on our segments and geographic areas, including
revenues from customers, see our consolidated financial
statements appearing in our annual report on Form 10-K,
including Note 19 thereto.

The Akamai EdgePlatform

The EdgePlatform is the foundation of
Akamai’s business solutions. We believe it is the
world’s largest globally distributed computing platform,
with over 14,000 servers deployed in over 1,000 networks in 71
countries. It includes specialized technologies, including
advanced routing, load balancing, data collection and monitoring
that lay over the Internet, making it a predictable, scalable,
and secure platform for conducting profitable e-business.

Our servers are deployed in over 1,000 networks
including Tier 1 providers, medium and small ISPs, cable
modem and satellite providers, universities and other networks.
We also deploy our servers at smaller and medium-sized domestic
and international ISPs through our Akamai Accelerated Network
Program. Under this program, we typically do not pay for rack
space to house our servers or bandwidth to deliver content from
our servers to Internet users. In exchange, ISPs host our
servers and obtain access to popular content from the Internet
that is served from our platform. As a result, when this content
is requested by an enduser, the ISP does not need to pay for the
bandwidth otherwise necessary to retrieve the content from the
originating website.

The key to the EdgePlatform’s effectiveness
is its use of a distributed computing model in which both
content and computing applications are exchanged in a system of
widely distributed networks of servers, and processed at the
most efficient places within the network. Through a combination
of architecture and services, Akamai’s EdgePlatform helps
organizations maximize e-business efforts quickly, without
adding equipment, cost, or complexity to existing IT
infrastructure.

Akamai’s EdgePlatform is also the first
e-business platform to support Edge Side Includes (ESI), an open
specification for dynamic assembly and delivery of highly
dynamic Web content at the edge of the Internet. Using ESI and
the Akamai EdgePlatform, companies can accelerate e-business
applications while reducing complexity, development time and
deployment costs. As the first application server to support
ESI, the Oracle9i Application Server allows customers to
seamlessly write and deploy applications that are optimized to
deliver dynamic Web content at top speed across the Akamai
EdgePlatform and Oracle9iAS.

Our EdgePlatform is designed so that sites
download and run more quickly, deflect security threats and
reliably process applications and deliver content —
anywhere in the world. Customers are also able to control



the extent of their use of Akamai services to
scale on demand, using as much or as little capacity of the
global platform as is required, to support widely varying
traffic and rapid e-business growth without expensive and
complex infrastructure build-out.

We monitor the EdgePlatform through our Network
Operations Command Center, or NOCC, located at our corporate
headquarters, with a back-up facility in California. Our
experienced network operations personnel staff the NOCC
24 hours per day, seven days a week. We perform real-time
monitoring of our own servers and of the Internet to make
certain that content is delivered to users with the best
possible performance and reliability. A key design principle of
our system is the use of a distributed network of servers with
no single point of failure. As a result, if any computer, data
center or portion of the Internet fails, our services will
continue operating. We constantly monitor the performance of
connections between various locations around the Internet and
our regions using numerous types of network information to
determine the performance of these connections. The result is a
“map” of the optimal Akamai region for each location
at that point in time. We rebuild this map periodically to
reflect changing conditions.

Our technology is designed so that our servers
maintain redundancy with other servers in our network to ensure
the highest level of performance and reliability for our
customers. This is increasingly important for reliably
delivering the mission-critical content and applications of an
enterprise over IP networks that, on their own, are often
unreliable.

Customers

Our customer base is centered on enterprises. As
of December 31, 2003, our customers included many of the
world’s leading enterprises, including Apple Computer,
Inc., Best Buy.com, Inc., FedEx Corporation, General Motors
Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, NASDAQ, MTV Networks, Sony
Ericsson Mobile Communications and Victoria’s Secret. We
have also begun to address the needs of the government market
and, as of December 31, 2003, had customers such as the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of
Defense, the Department of Education, the Food and Drug
Administration, the U.S. Army Recruitment, the U.S. Geological
Survey’s Earthquake Hazards Program and the Voice of
America. For the year ended December 31, 2003, Microsoft
Corporation accounted for 15% of total revenue. No customer
accounted for 10% or more of total revenue for the years ended
December 31, 2001 or 2002.

Sales, Services and Marketing

Our sales and service professionals are located
in eight offices in the United States with additional locations
in Europe and Japan. We market and sell our services and
solutions domestically and internationally through our direct
sales and services organization and through more than
25 active resellers including Electronic Data Systems
Corporation, IBM, InterNap Network Services Corporation MCI,
Telefonica Group and others. In addition to entering into
agreements with reseller partners, we have several other types
of alliances, including: Edge Architecture Design Partners,
ASP Partners, Agency Partners, Technology Partners and
Network Partners. By aligning with these companies, we are
better able to market our services and adoption of our
technology throughout the industry.

Our sales and support organization includes
employees in direct and channel sales, professional services,
account management and technical consulting. As of
December 31, 2003, we had 212 employees in our sales
and support organization, including 98 sales representatives
whose performance is measured on the basis of achievement of
quota objectives. Our ability to achieve significant revenue
growth in the future will depend in large part on whether we
successfully recruit, train and retain sufficient direct sales,
technical and global services personnel, and how well we
establish and maintain relationships with our strategic
partners. We believe that the complexity of our services will
continue to require a number of highly trained global sales and
services personnel.

To support our sales efforts and promote the
Akamai name, we conduct comprehensive marketing programs. Our
marketing strategies include an active public relations
campaign, print advertisements, on-line advertisements, trade
shows, strategic partnerships and on-going customer
communication programs. As of December 31, 2003, we had 20
employees in our global marketing organization.



Research and Development

Our research and development organization is
continuously enhancing and improving our existing services,
strengthening our network and creating new services in response
to our customers’ needs and market demand. As of
December 31, 2003, we had 146 employees in our research and
development organization, many of whom hold advanced degrees in
their field. Our research and development expenses were
$13.0 million, $21.8 million and $44.8 million
for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

Competition

The market for our services remains relatively
new, intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing
technology, evolving industry standards and frequent new product
and service installations. We expect competition for our
services to increase both from existing competitors and new
market entrants. We compete primarily on the basis of:

We compete primarily with companies offering
products and services that address Internet performance
problems, including companies that provide Internet content
delivery and hosting services, streaming content delivery
services and equipment-based solutions to Internet performance
problems, such as load balancers and server switches. Some of
these companies resell our services. We also compete with
companies that host online conferences using proprietary
conferencing applications. We do not believe that any other
company currently offers the range of solutions that we offer
through our EdgeSuite service.

Proprietary Rights and Licensing

Our success and ability to compete are dependent
on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects
of our technology and operate without infringing on the
proprietary rights of others. We rely on a combination of
patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright laws and
contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of
our technology. We currently have numerous issued United States
patents covering our content delivery technology, and we have
numerous additional patent applications pending. Our issued
patents extend to various dates between approximately 2015 and
2020. In October 1998, we entered into a license agreement with
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT, under which
we were granted a royalty-free, worldwide right to use and
sublicense the intellectual property rights of MIT under various
patent applications and copyrights relating to Internet content
delivery technology. Two of these patent applications have now
been issued. These patents will expire in 2018. We seek to limit
disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees
and consultants with access to our proprietary information to
execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting
access to our source code.

Employees

As of December 31, 2003, we had a total of
535 full-time and part-time employees. Our future success will
depend in part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate
highly qualified technical and management personnel for whom
competition is intense. Our employees are not represented by any
collective bargaining unit. We believe our relations with our
employees are good.



Factors Affecting Future Operating
Results

The following important factors, among other
things, could cause our actual operating results to differ
materially from those indicated or suggested by forward-looking
statements made in this annual report on Form 10-K or
presented elsewhere by management from time to time.

Failure to increase our revenue and keep
    our expenses consistent with revenues could prevent us from
    achieving and maintaining profitability.

We have never been profitable under generally
accepted accounting principles. We have incurred significant
losses since inception in 1998 and expect to continue to incur
losses through at least the first half of 2004. We have large
fixed expenses, and we expect to continue to incur significant
bandwidth, sales and marketing, product development,
administrative, interest and other expenses. Therefore, we will
need to generate higher revenue to achieve and maintain
profitability. There are numerous factors that could, standing
alone or combined with other factors, impede our ability to
increase revenue and/or moderate expenses, including:

The market for our services remains
    relatively new, and our business will suffer if the market does
    not develop as we expect.

The market for our Internet-related services is
relatively new. We cannot be certain that a broad-based market
for our services will emerge or be sustainable. Many of our
customers are early adopters of new technologies such as those
we offer. If we are unable to maintain pricing levels or our
market share among these companies, our revenues will not grow
and may decrease. If enterprises that are less aggressive in
adopting new technologies are reluctant to purchase our
services, we will have fewer opportunities to sell our services
and will have difficulty generating growth and profits.

Our substantial leverage may harm our
    financial condition and results of operations, and our failure
    to increase our revenue would seriously harm our business and
    operating results and could cause us to fail to make interest or
    principal payments or pay our outstanding
    indebtedness.

We have significant long-term debt, and we may
not be able to make interest or principal payments when due. As
of December 31, 2003, our total long-term debt was
approximately $386.0 million and our stockholders’
deficit was approximately $175.4 million. In January 2004,
we issued an additional $25.0 million of our 1.0%
convertible senior notes due December 15, 2033. Our
substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our
future operations, by increasing our vulnerability to adverse
changes in general economic



and industry conditions and by limiting or
prohibiting our ability to obtain additional financing for
capital expenditures, acquisitions, and general corporate and
other purposes.

Neither our existing 5 1/2% convertible
subordinated notes due 2007, nor our 1.0% convertible senior
notes due in 2033, restrict our ability or our
subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional indebtedness. Our
ability to satisfy our obligations will depend upon our future
performance, which is subject to many factors, including factors
beyond our control.

In December 2003 and January 2004, we repurchased
$99.0 million in principal amount of our 5 1/2%
convertible subordinated notes. In February 2004, we announced a
tender offer to repurchase up to an additional
$101.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the
5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes. The tender offer
period is scheduled to expire on March 10, 2004. There can
be no assurance, however, that we will complete the tender offer
in whole or in part. In order to reduce further future cash
interest payments, as well as future payments due at maturity,
we may, from time to time, depending on market conditions,
repurchase or redeem additional outstanding 5 1/2%
convertible subordinated notes for cash; exchange 5 1/2%
convertible subordinated notes for shares of our common stock,
warrants, preferred stock, debt or other consideration; or a
combination of any of the foregoing. If we exchange shares of
our capital stock, or securities convertible into or exercisable
for our capital stock, for outstanding 5 1/2% convertible
subordinated notes, the number of shares that we might issue as
a result of such exchanges could significantly exceed the number
of shares originally issuable upon conversion of the 5 1/2%
convertible subordinated notes. We cannot assure you that we
will repurchase, redeem or exchange any additional 5 1/2%
convertible subordinated notes.

Historically, we have had negative cash flow from
operations. For the year ended December 31, 2003, net cash
used in operating activities was approximately
$18.0 million. As of March 9, 2004, we had
$201.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our
5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes outstanding. Assuming
no additional 5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes are
converted or redeemed our annual interest payments on our
5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes will be approximately
$11.1 million and annual interest payment on our 1.0%
convertible senior notes will be approximately
$2.0 million. In addition, if our 5 1/2% convertible
subordinated notes are converted or if we do not repurchase,
redeem, exchange or otherwise repay our outstanding 5 1/2%
convertible subordinated notes prior to 2007, they will become
due. The holders of our 1.0% convertible senior notes have the
right to require us to redeem such notes in December 2010.
Unless we are able to generate sufficient operating cash flow to
service and, in 2007, pay the 5 1/2% convertible
subordinated notes and service the 1.0% convertible senior
notes, we will be required to raise additional funds or default
on our obligations under our 5 1/2% convertible
subordinated notes and 1.0% convertible senior notes.

The conversion price of our 5 1/2%
    convertible subordinated notes could deter holders of such notes
    from converting their securities and we will be required to
    repay these notes.

The holders of our 5 1/2% convertible
subordinated notes have the right to convert those notes into
our common stock. The conversion price for the 5 1/2%
convertible subordinated notes is $115.47 per share. The current
market price for shares of our common stock is significantly
below the conversion price of the 5 1/2% convertible
subordinated notes. If the market price for our common stock
does not exceed the conversion price, the holders of the notes
are unlikely to convert their securities into common stock and
we will be required instead to pay the holders of such notes.

Conversion of our 1% convertible senior
    notes may adversely affect the trading price of our common
    stock.

Our 1% convertible senior notes are convertible
into shares of our common stock at the option of the holder
under certain circumstances at an initial conversion price of
$15.45 per share. The conversion of some or all of the 1%
convertible senior notes and any sales in the public market of
our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely
affect the prevailing market price of our common stock. In
addition, the existence of the 1% convertible senior notes may
encourage short selling by market participants because the
conversion of the notes could depress our common stock price.



If we are required to seek additional
    funding, such funding may not be available on acceptable terms
    or at all.

If our revenue decreases or grows more slowly
than we anticipate or if our operating expenses increase more
than we expect or cannot be reduced in the event of lower
revenue, we may need to obtain funding from outside sources. If
we are unable to obtain this funding, our business would be
materially and adversely affected. In addition, even if we were
to find outside funding sources, we might be required to issue
securities with greater rights than the securities we have
outstanding today. We might also be required to take other
actions that could lessen the value of our common stock,
including borrowing money on terms that are not favorable to us,
if at all.

The markets in which we operate are highly
    competitive and we may be unable to compete successfully against
    new entrants and established companies with greater
    resources.

We compete in markets that are new, intensely
competitive, highly fragmented and rapidly changing. We have
experienced and expect to continue to experience increased
competition. Many of our current competitors, as well as a
number of our potential competitors, have longer operating
histories, greater name recognition, broader customer
relationships and industry alliances and substantially greater
financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. Our
competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to
new or emerging technologies and changes in customer
requirements. Some of our current or potential competitors may
bundle their services with other services, software or hardware
in a manner that may discourage website owners from purchasing
any service we offer or ISPs from installing our servers.
Increased competition could result in price and revenue
reductions, loss of customers and loss of market share, which
could materially and adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

If the prices we charge for our services
    decline over time, our business and financial results are likely
    to suffer.

Prices we have been charging for some of our
services have declined in recent years. We expect that this
decline may continue in the future as a result of, among other
things, existing and new competition in the markets we address.
Consequently, our historical revenue rates may not be indicative
of future revenue based on comparable traffic volumes. If we are
unable to sell our services at acceptable prices relative to our
costs or if we are unsuccessful with our strategy of
“upselling” our higher-priced services to our
EdgeSuite delivery customers, our revenue and gross margins will
decrease, and our business and financial results will suffer.

Reduction of revenue from Microsoft would
    cause our business and financial results to
    suffer.

For the year ended December 31, 2003,
Microsoft accounted for more than 10% of our revenue. In
September 2003, we entered into an amendment to our content
delivery services customer agreement with Microsoft that has a
two-year term and includes a minimum usage commitment. Microsoft
will have the right to reduce its commitment levels by 50% for
the second year of the term and convert the contract to a
month-to-month term after the first year if the parties fail to
reach agreement as to appropriate price changes after the first
year of the term. While we expect revenue from Microsoft to be
greater than 10% of our total revenue in 2004, an
unexpected, significant decline in sales to Microsoft would
reduce our revenue and cause our business and financial results
to suffer.

Our stock price has been
    volatile.

The market price of our common stock has been
volatile. Trading prices may continue to fluctuate in response
to a number of events and factors, including the following:

•

quarterly variations in operating results and
    announcements of innovations;

•

new products, services and strategic developments
    by us or our competitors;

•

business combinations and investments by us or
    our competitors;



Any of these events may cause the price of our
shares to fall. In addition, the stock market in general and the
market prices for technology companies in particular have
experienced significant volatility that often has been unrelated
to the operating performance of such companies. These broad
market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market
price of our shares, regardless of our operating performance.

Any unplanned interruption in our network
    or services could lead to significant costs and disruptions that
    could reduce our revenue and harm our business, financial
    results and reputation.

Our business is dependent on providing our
customers with fast, efficient and reliable distribution of
application and content delivery services over the Internet. For
our core services, we currently provide a guarantee that our
networks will deliver Internet content 24 hours a day,
seven days a week, 365 days a year. If we do not meet this
standard, our customer does not pay for all or a part of its
services on that day. Our network or services could be disrupted
by numerous events, including natural disasters, failure or
refusal of our third-party network providers to provide the
capacity, power losses, and intentional disruptions of our
services, such as disruptions caused by software viruses or
attacks by unauthorized users. Any widespread loss or
interruption of our network or services would reduce our revenue
and could harm our business, financial results and reputation.

We may have insufficient transmission
    capacity which could result in interruptions in our services and
    loss of revenue.

Our operations are dependent in part upon
transmission capacity provided by third-party telecommunications
network providers. We believe that we have access to adequate
capacity to provide our services; however, there can be no
assurance that we are adequately prepared for unexpected
increases in bandwidth demands by our customers. In addition,
the bandwidth we have contracted to purchase may become
unavailable for a variety of reasons. For example, a number of
these network providers are operating under the protection of
the federal bankruptcy laws. As a result, there is uncertainty
about whether such providers, or others that enter into
bankruptcy, will be able to continue to provide services to us.
Any failure of these network providers to provide the capacity
we require, due to financial or other reasons, may result in a
reduction in, or interruption of, service to our customers. If
we do not have access to third-party transmission capacity, we
could lose customers. If we are unable to obtain transmission
capacity on terms commercially acceptable to us, our business
and financial results could suffer. In addition, our
telecommunications and network providers typically provide rack
space for our servers. Damage or destruction of, or other denial
of access to, a facility where our servers are housed could
result in a reduction in, or interruption of, service to our
customers.

Because our services are complex and are
    deployed in complex environments, they may have errors or
    defects that could seriously harm our business.

Our services are highly complex and are designed
to be deployed in and across numerous large and complex
networks. From time to time, we have needed to correct errors
and defects in our software. In the future, there may be
additional errors and defects in our software that may adversely
affect our services. If we are unable to efficiently fix errors
or other problems that may be identified, we could experience
loss of revenues and market share, damage to our reputation,
increased expenses and legal actions by our customers.



If the estimates we make, and the
    assumptions on which we rely, in preparing our financial
    statements prove inaccurate, our actual results may be adversely
    affected.

Our financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. The preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments about,
including without limitation taxes, revenue recognition,
capitalization of internal-use software, contingent obligations,
doubtful accounts and restructuring charges, that affect the
reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses, the amounts of charges accrued by us, such as those
made in connection with our restructuring charges, and related
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our
estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the
circumstances. If our estimates or the assumptions underlying
them are not correct, we may need to accrue additional charges
which could adversely affect our results of operations, which in
turn could adversely affect our stock price.

If our license agreement with MIT
    terminates, our business could be adversely
    affected.

We have licensed technology from MIT covered by
various patents, patent applications and copyrights relating to
Internet content delivery technology. Some of our technology is
based in part on the technology covered by these patents, patent
applications and copyrights. Our license is effective for the
life of the patents and patent applications; however, under
limited circumstances, such as a cessation of our operations due
to our insolvency or our material breach of the terms of the
license agreement, MIT has the right to terminate our license. A
termination of our license agreement with MIT could have a
material adverse effect on our business.

We have incurred and could continue to
    incur substantial costs defending our intellectual property from
    infringement or a claim of infringement.

Other companies or individuals, including our
competitors, may obtain patents or other proprietary rights that
would prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use
or sell our services. As a result, we may be found to infringe
the proprietary rights of others. In the event of a successful
claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to
license the infringed technology, our business and operating
results would be significantly harmed. Companies in the Internet
market are increasingly bringing suits alleging infringement of
their proprietary rights, particularly patent rights. We have
been named as a defendant in several lawsuits alleging that we
have violated other companies’ intellectual property
rights. Any litigation or claims, whether or not valid, could
result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and
require us to do one or more of the following:

If we are forced to take any of these actions,
our business may be seriously harmed.

Our business will be adversely affected if
    we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from
    third-party challenges.

We rely on a combination of patent, copyright,
trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure
to protect our intellectual property rights. We have brought
numerous lawsuits against entities that we believe are
infringing on our intellectual property rights. These legal
protections afford only limited protection. Monitoring
unauthorized use of our services is difficult and we cannot be
certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized
use of our technology, particularly in foreign countries where
the laws



may not protect our proprietary rights as fully
as in the United States. Although we have licensed from other
parties proprietary technology covered by patents, we cannot be
certain that any such patents will not be challenged,
invalidated or circumvented. Furthermore, we cannot be certain
that any pending or future patent applications will be granted,
that any future patent will not be challenged, invalidated or
circumvented, or that rights granted under any patent that may
be issued will provide competitive advantages to us.

If we are unable to retain our key
    employees and hire qualified sales and technical personnel, our
    ability to compete could be harmed.

Our future success depends upon the continued
services of our executive officers and other key technology,
sales, marketing and support personnel who have critical
industry experience and relationships that they rely on in
implementing our business plan. None of our officers or key
employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific
term. We have a “key person” life insurance policy
covering only the life of F. Thomson Leighton, our Chief
Scientist and a member of our Board of Directors. The loss of
the services of any of our key employees could delay the
development and introduction of and negatively impact our
ability to sell our services.

We face risks associated with international
    operations that could harm our business.

We have operations in several foreign countries
and may continue to expand our sales and support organizations
internationally. Such expansion could require us to make
significant expenditures. We are increasingly subject to a
number of risks associated with international business
activities that may increase our costs, lengthen our sales cycle
and require significant management attention. These risks
include:

As part of our business strategy, we have
    entered into and may enter into or seek to enter into business
    combinations and acquisitions that may be difficult to
    integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value or
    divert management attention.

We have made acquisitions of other companies in
the past and may enter into additional business combinations and
acquisitions in the future. Acquisitions are typically
accompanied by a number of risks, including the difficulty of
integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired
companies, the potential disruption of our ongoing business, the
potential distraction of management, expenses related to the
acquisition and potential unknown liabilities associated with
acquired businesses. If we are not successful in completing
acquisitions that we may pursue in the future, we may be
required to reevaluate our business strategy, and we may have
incurred substantial expenses and devoted significant management
time and resources without a productive result. In addition,
with future acquisitions, we could use substantial portions of
our available cash or make dilutive issuances of securities.
Future acquisitions or attempted acquisitions could have an
adverse effect on our ability to achieve and maintain
profitability.

Internet-related and other laws could
    adversely affect our business.

Laws and regulations that apply to communications
and commerce over the Internet are becoming more prevalent. In
particular, the growth and development of the market for online
commerce has prompted calls



for more stringent tax, consumer protection and
privacy laws, both in the United States and abroad, that may
impose additional burdens on companies conducting business
online. This could negatively affect the businesses of our
customers and reduce their demand for our services. Tax laws
that might apply to our servers which are located in many
different jurisdictions could require us to pay additional taxes
that would adversely affect our profitability. Internet-related
laws, however, remain largely unsettled, even in areas where
there has been some legislative action. The adoption or
modification of laws or regulations relating to the Internet or
our operations, or interpretations of existing law, could
adversely affect our business.

Terrorist activities and resulting military
    and other actions could adversely affect our
    business.

Terrorist attacks in New York, Pennsylvania and
Washington, D.C. in September 2001 disrupted commerce throughout
the United States and other parts of the world. The continued
threat of terrorism within the United States and abroad, and the
potential for military action and heightened security measures
in response to such threat, may cause significant disruption to
commerce throughout the world. To the extent that such
disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer
orders, a general decrease in corporate spending on information
technology, or our inability to effectively market, sell or
operate our services and software, our business and results of
operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Provisions of our charter documents, our
    stockholder rights plan and Delaware law may have anti-takeover
    effects that could prevent a change in control even if the
    change in control would be beneficial to our
    stockholders.

Provisions of our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation, by-laws and Delaware law could
make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if
doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. In addition,
our Board of Directors has adopted, and recently amended, a
shareholder rights plan the provisions of which could make it
more difficult for a potential acquirer of Akamai to consummate
an acquisition transaction. See “Description of Capital
Stock.”

A class action lawsuit has been filed
    against us that may be costly to defend and the outcome of which
    is uncertain and may harm our business.

We are named as a defendant in a purported class
action lawsuit filed in 2001 alleging that the underwriters of
our initial public offering received undisclosed compensation in
connection with our initial public offering of common stock in
violation of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, which we refer to as the Exchange Act. This
litigation could be expensive and divert the attention of our
management and other resources. We can provide no assurance as
to the outcome of this action. Any conclusion of these matters
in a manner adverse to us could have a material adverse affect
on our financial position and results of operations.

We may become involved in other litigation
    that may adversely affect us.

In the ordinary course of business, we may become
involved in litigation, administrative proceedings and
governmental proceedings. Such matters can be time-consuming,
divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to
incur significant expenses. Furthermore, there can be no
assurance that the results of any of these actions will not have
a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
or financial condition.

Item 2.

Properties

Our headquarters are located in approximately
89,000 square feet of leased office space in Cambridge,
Massachusetts. Our primary west coast office is located in
approximately 25,000 square feet of leased office space in
San Mateo, California. We maintain leased office space in
several other locations in the United States, including in or
near Los Angeles, California; Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago,
Illinois; New York, New York; Fairfax, Virginia and Seattle,
Washington. We also maintain leased office space in Europe and
Asia in or near the following cities: Munich, Germany; Paris,
France; London, England; Tokyo, Japan; and Singapore.



Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

We are subject to legal proceedings, claims and
litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. We do not
expect the ultimate costs to resolve these matters to have a
material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

Between July 2, 2001 and August 31,
2001, purported class action lawsuits seeking monetary damages
were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York against us as well as against the
underwriters of our October 28, 1999 initial public
offering of common stock. The complaints were filed allegedly on
behalf of persons who purchased our common stock during
different time periods, all beginning on October 28, 1999
and ending on various dates. The complaints are similar and
allege violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 primarily based on the
allegation that the underwriters received undisclosed
compensation in connection with our initial public offering. On
April 19, 2002, a single consolidated amended complaint was
filed, reiterating in one pleading the allegations contained in
the previously filed separate actions. The consolidated amended
complaint defines the alleged class period as October 28,
1999 through December 6, 2000. Although we believe that we
have meritorious defenses to the claims made in the complaint,
an adverse resolution of the action could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
operations in the period in which the lawsuit is resolved. We
are not presently able to estimate potential losses, if any,
related to this lawsuit.

In February 2002, we filed suit against Speedera
Networks, Inc., or Speedera, in federal court in Massachusetts,
alleging patent infringement and false advertising by Speedera.
In April 2003, we amended our complaint to include an allegation
that Speedera infringes a newly-issued content delivery patent
held by MIT and licensed to Akamai. In response, Speedera filed
a counterclaim in this case alleging that Akamai has infringed a
Speedera patent relating to the combined provision of traffic
management and content delivery services. We believe that we
have meritorious defenses to the claims made in the counterclaim
and intend to contest them vigorously; however, there can be no
assurance that we will be successful. We are not presently able
to reasonably estimate potential losses, if any, related to this
counterclaim.

In June 2002, we filed suit against Speedera in
California Superior Court alleging theft of Akamai trade secrets
from an independent company that provides website performance
testing services. In connection with this suit, in September
2002, the Court issued a preliminary injunction to restrain
Speedera from continuing to access our confidential information
from the independent company’s database and from using any
data obtained from such access. In October 2002, Speedera filed
a cross-claim against us seeking monetary damages and injunctive
relief and alleging that we engaged in various unfair trade
practices, made false and misleading statements and engaged in
unfair competition. We believe that we have meritorious defenses
to the claims made in Speedera’s cross-claim and intend to
contest the allegations vigorously; however, there can be no
assurance that we will be successful. We are not presently able
to reasonably estimate potential losses, if any, related to this
cross-claim.

In September 2002, Teknowledge Corporation, or
Teknowledge, filed suit in the United States District Court for
the District of Delaware against Akamai, C&W and Inktomi
Corporation alleging that certain services offered by each
company infringe a Teknowledge patent relating to automatic
retrieval of changed files by a network software agent. We
believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims made in
the complaint and intend to contest the lawsuit vigorously;
however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful.
We are not presently able to reasonably estimate potential
losses, if any, related to this lawsuit.

In November 2002, we filed suit against Speedera
in federal court in Massachusetts for infringement of a patent
held by Akamai. In January 2003, Speedera filed a counterclaim
in this case alleging that Akamai has infringed a patent held by
Speedera. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the
claims made in the counterclaim and intend to contest them
vigorously; however, there can be no assurance that we will be
successful. We are not presently able to reasonably estimate
potential losses, if any, related to this counterclaim.

Item 5.

Market
For Registrant’s Common Equity and Related Stockholder
Matters

Our common stock trades under the symbol
“AKAM.” From the time that public trading of our
common stock commenced on October 29, 1999 until
September 3, 2002 and since May 5, 2003, our common
stock was listed on The NASDAQ National Market. Our common stock
was listed on The NASDAQ SmallCap Market between
September 3, 2002 and May 2, 2003. Prior to
October 29, 1999, there was no public market for our common
stock. The following table sets forth, for the periods
indicated, the high and low sale price per share of the common
stock on The NASDAQ National Market and The NASDAQ SmallCap
Market, as applicable:

As of March 4, 2004, there were
589 holders of record of our common stock.

We have never paid or declared any cash dividends
on shares of our common stock or other securities and do not
anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
We currently intend to retain all future earnings, if any, for
use in the operation of our business.

Item 6.

Selected
Consolidated Financial Data

The following selected consolidated financial
data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated
financial statements and related notes and with
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” and other financial
data included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.
The statement of operations data and balance sheet data for all
periods presented is derived from audited consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this annual report on
Form 10-K or on file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. In 2002, the Company modified the presentation of
the consolidated statement of operations to include in cost of
revenue equity-related compensation expense, based on the
functional role of the related employee, and depreciation and
amortization on its network equipment.

We acquired several businesses in 2000 that were
recorded under the purchase method of accounting. We allocated
$3 billion of the cost of these acquisitions to goodwill
and other intangible assets. As a result, loss from operations
for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 includes
$255.8 million and $676.1 million, respectively, for
the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets related
to these acquisitions. In 2001, loss from operations includes a
$1.9 billion impairment of goodwill. On January 1,
2002, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards, or SFAS, No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets,” we discontinued the amortization of
goodwill and reclassified our assembled workforce of
$1.0 million to goodwill. Loss from continuing operations
for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 includes



restructuring charges of $45.8 million and
$40.5 million, respectively, for actual and estimated
termination and modification costs related to non-cancelable
facility leases and employee severance. Loss from continuing
operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 includes a
restructuring credit of $8.5 million for the reversal of
previously accrued restructuring liabilities and loss on early
extinguishment of debt of $2.1 million.

In accordance with SFAS No. 145,
“Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64,
Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13 and Technical
Corrections,” losses on the early extinguishment of debt
are no longer required to be classified as extraordinary items,
as previously required by SFAS No. 4, “Reporting Gains
and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt.” Accordingly, for
the year ended December 31, 1999, we reclassified the loss
resulting from the early extinguishment of debt of
$3.3 million from extraordinary loss to a loss from
continuing operations.



Item 7.

Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

Overview

We primarily derive revenue from recurring Akamai
services sold to customers under contracts of a duration of more
than one year, which we refer to as recurring revenue or
long-term contracts. These contracts generally commit the
customer to a minimum monthly level of usage with additional
charges applicable for actual usage above the monthly minimum.
Having a consistent and predictable base level of revenue is
important to our financial success. Accordingly, to be
successful, we must eliminate or reduce loss of monthly
recurring revenue due to customer cancellations of terminations,
increase our base level of recurring revenue contracts on a
quarter-over-quarter basis and build on that base by adding new
customers in the future and increasing the number of features
and functions our customers purchase. At the same time, we must
ensure that our expenses do not substantially exceed our
revenue. Accomplishing these goals requires that we compete
effectively in the marketplace on the basis of price, quality
and the attractiveness of our services and technology. See
“Factors Affecting Future Operating Results” elsewhere
in the annual report on Form 10-K.

Our improved financial results in 2003 as
compared to 2002 and 2001 reflect our ability to increase our
monthly recurring revenue while reducing the expenses needed to
support such growth. The following sets forth, as a percentage
of revenue, consolidated statements of operations data for the
years indicated:

Since our inception, we have incurred significant
costs to develop our technology, build our worldwide network,
sell and market our services and software and support our
operations. In recent years, we have incurred significant
restructuring expenses related to employee severance payments
and facility lease settlements. We have not yet achieved
profitability on a quarterly or annual basis; however, we have
observed the following known trends and events that are likely
to have an impact on our financial condition and results of
operation in the future:

•

During each quarter in 2003, the dollar volume of
    the recurring revenue contracts that we have booked exceeded the
    dollar volume of the contracts we lost through cancellations,
    terminations and non-payment. A continuation of this trend would
    lead to increased revenue for us.





Based on our analysis of the aforementioned known
trends and events, we expect to generate net income during 2004;
however, our future results will be affected by many factors
identified below in “Factors Affecting Future Operating
Results,” including our ability to:

As a result, there is no assurance that the
aforementioned trends will continue or that we will achieve our
expected financial objectives.

Recent Events

In November 2003, we entered into an agreement
with Cable and Wireless Internet Services, or CWIS, leading to
the dismissal of lawsuits filed by CWIS against us in Boston,
San Francisco and London alleging that our services infringe
several different CWIS patents. We did not admit liability or
make any payments in connection with these dismissals. As part
of the settlement, we also agreed to dismiss several lawsuits
that we had brought against CWIS. In addition, Akamai and CWIS
agreed not to sue each other for a period of five years with
respect to the patents and their respective service offerings
that had been at issue in these cases.

In December 2003, we forgave $247,000 of $778,000
due under a note receivable that had been issued to us by an
employee that enabled this employee in 1999, to purchase shares
of our common stock. We recorded the forgiveness of $247,000 as
equity-related compensation. The remaining $531,000 due on the
note was paid in full in December 2003.

In December 2003, we issued $175.0 million
in aggregate principal amount of 1% convertible senior notes in
exchange for $169.8 million in cash, which reflected a
purchase discount of 2.75% to the initial purchaser of the notes
and other offering expenses. The notes are due in December 2033;
however, we have the right to redeem the notes at par value in
December 2010 and the holders of these notes have the right to
require us to redeem the notes in December 2010. The 1%
convertible senior notes accrue interest at the rate of 1% per
year, which is payable semi-annually. Under certain
circumstances, holders of these notes may convert them into
shares of our common stock at the price of $15.45 per share. As
a result of this transaction, we recorded interest expense,
including deferred financing amortization costs, totaling
$125,000 in 2003.

In January 2004, the initial purchaser of the 1%
convertible senior notes exercised its option to purchase an
additional $25.0 million in principal amount of the notes
for a payment of $24.3 million, net of the initial
purchaser’s discount.

In December 2003 and January 2004, in a limited
number of individually negotiated transactions, we repurchased
an aggregate of $99.0 million in principal amount of our
outstanding 5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes for an
aggregate cash payment of $98.9 million, net of interest
paid or payable to the holders.

In February 2004, we commenced a tender offer to
repurchase up to an additional $101.0 million in aggregate
principal amount of our outstanding 5 1/2% convertible
subordinated notes. Under the modified Dutch Auction structure
of the tender offer, we offered to repurchase up to
$101.0 million in principal amount of validly tendered
5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes at a purchase price
between $1,000 and $1,005 for each $1,000 in principal amount
tendered. The tender offer is subject to numerous conditions.
The tender offer period is scheduled to expire on March 10,
2004.



Application of Critical Accounting Policies
and Estimates

Overview

Our discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations are based upon our
consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated
financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue
and expenses, cash flow and related disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities. Our estimates include those related to
revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts,
investments, capitalization of internal-use software, intangible
assets, income taxes, depreciable lives of property and
equipment, restructuring accruals and contingent obligations. We
base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the
circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
For a complete description of our accounting policies, see Note
2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this
annual report on Form 10-K.

Definitions

We define our “critical accounting
policies” as those accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America that require us to make critical
accounting estimates about matters that are uncertain and have a
material impact on our financial position and results of
operations and the specific manner that we apply those
principles. We define a “critical accounting estimate”
as an estimate that requires us to make assumptions about
matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting
estimate is made and either the estimate is derived from a range
of potential outcomes or changes in the estimate would have a
material impact on our financial condition or results of
operations.

Review of Critical Accounting Policies and
    Estimates

Revenue Recognition:

We recognize revenue from our services and
software when:

At the inception of a long-term customer contract
for service, we make a critical estimate as to whether
collection is reasonably assured. We base our estimate on the
successful completion of a credit check, financial review, the
receipt of a deposit from the customer and our payment history
with the customer. Upon the completion of these steps, we
recognize revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue
recognition policy, assuming the other criteria are met. If we
subsequently determine that collection is not reasonably
assured, we cease recognizing revenue until cash is received. We
also record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt
expense for all other unpaid invoices for the related customer.
Changes in our estimates of whether collection is reasonably
assured would change the amount of revenue or bad debt expense
that we recognize.

When we provide professional services such as
custom applications and other services considered essential to
the functionality of software for a fixed fee, we recognize
revenue from the fees for such services and any related software
licenses as we complete the project using the
percentage-of-completion method. We generally determine the
percentage-of-completion by comparing the labor hours we have
incurred to date to the estimate of the total labor hours
required to complete the project based on regular discussions
with our project managers. This method is used because we
consider expended labor hours to be the most reliable, available
measure of progress on these projects. Adjustments to contract
estimates are made in the periods in which facts resulting in a
change become known. When the estimate indicates a loss, such
loss is provided for



in its entirety. Significant judgments and
estimates are involved in determining the
percentage-of-completion of each contract. Different assumptions
could yield materially different results.

Other professional services not considered
essential to the functionality of the software are limited and
primarily include integration fees. We recognize revenue from
these professional services monthly, along with the related
long-term customer contract. When we provide services on a time
and materials basis, we recognize revenue as we perform the
services based on actual time incurred. When we provide support
and maintenance services, we recognize the revenue ratably over
the term of the related contracts, typically one year.

Concurrent Transactions:

From time to time, we enter into contracts to
sell our services or license our technology with unrelated
companies at or about the same time we enter into contracts to
purchase products or services from the same companies. If we
conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently, we
record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor,
unless the fair value to us of the vendor’s product or
service can be established objectively and realization of such
value is believed to be probable.

Investments:

We periodically review all investments for
reduction in fair value that is other-than-temporary. We
consider several factors that may trigger an
other-than-temporary decline in value, such as the length of
time the investment’s value has been below cost and the
financial results of the entity in which we invest. When we
conclude that the reduction is other-than-temporary, the cost of
the investment is adjusted to its fair value through a charge to
loss on investments on the consolidated statement of operations.
Changes in our judgment as to whether a reduction in the value
of an investment is other-than-temporary could increase loss on
investments.

Impairment and Useful Lives of Long-Lived
    Assets:

We review our long-lived assets, such as fixed
assets and intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
the assets may not be recoverable. Events that would trigger an
impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or
forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset. When such a
triggering event occurs, we compare the carrying amount of the
long-lived asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows
related to the asset. If the carrying amount is greater than the
sum of the undiscounted cash flows, we adjust the asset to its
fair value through an impairment charge included in loss from
operations. We determine fair value based upon a quoted market
price or a discounted cash flow analysis. The critical
accounting estimates required for this accounting policy include
forecasted usage of the long-lived assets and the useful lives
of these assets. Changes in these estimates could increase loss
from operations materially.

Restructuring Liabilities Related to Facility
    Leases:

When we vacate a facility subject to a
non-cancelable long-term lease, we record a restructuring
liability for either the estimated costs to terminate the lease
or the estimated costs that will continue to be incurred under
the lease for its remaining term where there is no economic
benefit to us. In the latter case, we measure the amount of the
restructuring liability as the amount of contractual future
lease payments reduced by an estimate of sublease income. To
date, we have recorded a restructuring liability when our
management approves and commits us to a plan to terminate a
lease, the plan specifically identifies the actions to be taken,
and the actions are scheduled to begin soon after management
approves the plan. Beginning in 2003, in accordance with SFAS
No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or
Disposal Activities,” we record restructuring liabilities,
discounted at the appropriate rate, for a facility lease only
when we have both vacated the space and completed all actions
needed to make the space readily available for sublease.



As of December 31, 2003, we had
$5.2 million in accrued restructuring liabilities related
to vacated facilities. In 2003, we were able to renegotiate two
of our previously restructured facility leases to reduce rents
payable under the leases to current market rates, resulting in a
reversal of previously recorded restructuring liabilities of
$9.6 million. We expect that approximately
$1.6 million of the amount accrued as of December 31,
2003 will be paid within twelve months. In the event that we are
able to sublease our restructured space, we will record an
adjustment to the restructuring liability in the period in which
the adjustment becomes probable and estimable.

Loss Contingencies:

We define a loss contingency as a condition
involving uncertainty as to a possible loss related to a
previous event that will not be resolved until one or more
future events occur or fail to occur. Our primary loss
contingencies relate to pending or threatened litigation and the
collectibility of accounts receivable. We record a liability for
a loss contingency when we believe that it is probable that a
loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be
reasonably estimated. When we believe the likelihood of a loss
is less than probable and more than remote, we do not record a
liability but we disclose material loss contingencies in the
notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Tax Accruals and Valuation Allowance for
    Deferred Income Taxes:

We have recorded certain tax accruals to address
potential exposures involving our sales and use and property tax
positions. These potential exposures result from the varying
application of statutes, rules, regulations and interpretations.
Our estimate of the value of our tax accruals contains
assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about
potential actions by taxing jurisdictions. It is possible that
the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less
than the amount that we estimated.

The preparation of consolidated financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amount of tax-related assets and liabilities
and the provision for income taxes. We assess the recoverability
of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis. In making this
assessment we are required to consider all available positive
and negative evidence to determine whether, based on such
evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
our net deferred assets will be realized in future periods. This
assessment requires significant judgment. In addition, we have
made significant estimates involving current and deferred income
taxes, tax attributes relating to the interpretation of various
tax laws, historical bases of tax attributes associated with
certain tangible and intangible assets and limitations
surrounding the realizability of our deferred tax assets. We do
not recognize current and future tax benefits until it is deemed
probable that certain tax positions will be sustained.

Capitalization of Internal-Use Software
    Costs:

We capitalize the salaries and payroll-related
costs of employees who devote time to the application
development stage of internal-use software projects. If the
project is an enhancement to previously developed software, we
must assess whether the enhancement is significant and creates
additional functionality to the software, thus qualifying the
work incurred during the application development stage for
capitalization. We must gather employee data for the amount of
time incurred during the application development phase. Once the
project is complete, we must estimate the useful life of the
internal-use software, and we must periodically assess whether
the software is impaired. Changes in our estimates related to
internal-use software would increase or decrease operating
expenses or amortization recorded during the period.

Results of Operations

Revenue.

Total revenue increased 11%, or
$16.3 million, to $161.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003 as compared to $145.0 million for
the year ended December 31, 2002. Total revenue decreased
11%, or $18.2 million, to $145.0 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $163.2 million
for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase in total
revenue for 2003 as compared to



2002 was attributable to an increase in service
revenue of $28.7 million, partially offset by reductions in
software and software-related revenue of $2.8 million and
related party revenue of $9.7 million. The increase in
service revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in
monthly committed revenue, along with usage-based customer
revenue due to an increase in customer traffic delivered during
the year. Microsoft Corporation was the largest contributor to
the increase in revenue attributable to usage that was not
pre-committed by our customers. Service revenue also increased
due to an increase in the number of customers under recurring
revenue contracts. As of December 31, 2003, we had 1,126
customers under recurring revenue contracts as compared to 955
as of December 31, 2002, and 1,078 as of December 31,
2001. Revenue decreased in 2002 as compared to 2001 due to a
reduction in service revenue of $6.7 million attributable
to a decrease in the number of customers under recurring revenue
contracts, a reduction in software and software-related revenue
of $5.9 million due to a decrease in the amount of software
and other technology licensed to customers, as well as a
decrease in related party revenue primarily due to the reduction
in the monthly commitment of Sockeye Networks, Inc., or Sockeye.

For 2003 and 2002, 16% and 13%, respectively, of
our total revenue was derived from our operations located
outside of the United States, of which 13% and 10%,
respectively, was derived from operations in Europe. No single
country accounted for 10% or more of revenue derived outside of
the United States. For 2001, less than 10% of our total revenue
was derived from our operations located outside of the United
States. Resellers accounted for 25% of revenue in 2003, 24% in
2002 and 20% in 2001. For 2003, Microsoft Corporation accounted
for 15% of revenue. For 2002 and 2001, no single customer
accounted for more than 10% of revenue.

In September 2003, we executed an amendment to
our content delivery services customer agreement with Microsoft
Corporation. The amended agreement has a two-year term with a
minimum usage commitment of $1.3 million. The parties have
agreed that, in August 2004, they will negotiate in good faith
appropriate changes, if any, to the pricing levels then in
effect. If Akamai and Microsoft Corporation are unable to reach
agreement on requested pricing changes, the pricing will not
change; however, Microsoft Corporation will have the right to
reduce its commitment levels by 50% for the second year of the
term, and the services shall thereafter be provided on a
month-to-month basis subject to termination by either party on
ten days notice.

Service revenue, which consists of revenues from
our content and application delivery services, increased 22%, or
$28.7 million, to $157.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003 as compared to $128.7 million for
the year ended December 31, 2002. Service revenue was
$135.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001.
The increase in service revenue in 2003 as compared to 2002 was
primarily attributable to an increase in monthly committed
revenue, an increase in customer traffic delivered during the
year and an increase in the number of customers under recurring
revenue contracts. The decrease in service revenue in 2002 as
compared to 2001 was attributable to a decrease in customers
under recurring revenue contracts, partially offset by an
increase in average monthly recurring revenue per customer. We
expect service revenue to continue to increase in 2004 as
companies continue to choose to outsource some of their IT
spending.

Software and software-related revenue decreased
43%, or $2.8 million, to $3.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $6.5 million
for the year ended December 31, 2002. Software and
software-related revenue was $12.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2001. Software and software-related
revenue includes sales of customized technology solutions sold
as perpetual licenses or delivered under long-term contracts.
The continual decrease in software and software-related revenue
for the periods presented reflects a reduction in the amount of
customized software projects and other technology licensed to
customers and a decrease in the number of perpetual licenses
executed as we focus on our core services business.

Service and software revenue from related parties
decreased 99%, or $9.7 million, to $137,000 for the year
ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $9.8 million
for the year ended December 31, 2002. Service and software
revenue from related parties was $15.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2001. The reduction in revenue in 2003
as compared to 2002 from related parties was primarily
attributable to revenue in 2002 from Sockeye, Akamai
Technologies Japan KK, or Akamai Japan, and SOFTBANK, or SBBM, a
co-investor in Akamai Japan, with no associated revenue in 2003.
Related party revenue in 2003 represents revenue from



Akamai Australia, a joint venture with ES Group
Ventures Pty Ltd, relating to resale commitments. In December
2002 and June 2003, the joint ventures of Akamai Japan and
Akamai Australia, respectively, were terminated. In 2003, Akamai
formed a wholly-owned subsidiary in Japan. The decrease in
revenue from related parties in 2002 as compared to 2001 was a
result of the reduction in Sockeye’s minimum monthly
revenue commitment in 2001 and the cancellation in November 2002
of Sockeye’s contract with us. We expect no revenue from
related parties during 2004.

Cost of Revenue.

Cost of revenue includes fees paid to
network providers for bandwidth and co-location of our network
equipment. Cost of revenue also includes payroll and related
costs and equity-related compensation for network operations
personnel, cost of licenses, depreciation of network equipment
used to deliver our services and amortization of internal-use
software costs.

Cost of revenue decreased 28%, or
$24.2 million, to $61.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003 as compared to $85.3 million for the
year ended December 31, 2002. Cost of revenue decreased
21%, or $23.0 million, to $85.3 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $108.3 million
for the year ended December 31, 2001. Traffic delivered
over our network increased during 2003 compared to 2002. Despite
this increase in traffic, cost of revenue decreased in 2003 as
compared to 2002 primarily due to lower bandwidth costs, which
we achieved by entering into new, competitively priced network
contracts, renegotiating existing network contracts to achieve
more favorable pricing and continued improved management of our
network traffic. During 2003, depreciation of network equipment
continued to decrease as our network assets became fully
depreciated. Payroll and payroll-related costs, including equity
compensation, also decreased in 2003 due to a reduction in
headcount. Cost of revenue decreased in 2002 as compared to 2001
by $23.0 million primarily as a result of a reduction in
traffic delivered over our network, lower bandwidth costs per
unit and improved management of our network traffic.

Cost of revenue during 2003 and 2002 also
included credits received of approximately $3.0 million and
$5.6 million, respectively, as a result of entering into
new, competitively priced network contracts and renegotiation of
existing network contracts. We expect that credits of this
nature may occur in the future as a result of our efforts to
lower our network costs; however, the timing and amount of these
credits, if any, will vary.

Cost of revenue is comprised of the following (in
millions):

We believe cost of revenue will slightly increase
in 2004 as compared to 2003 because we expect to deliver more
traffic on our network and that amortization of internal-use
software development costs will increase. We anticipate that
these increases will be offset by a decline in depreciation of
our network equipment. In addition, higher expenses associated
with increased traffic on our network would be mitigated by
lower bandwidth costs per unit, if we are successful at
continuing to improve our management of our network.

Research and Development.

Research and development expenses
consist primarily of payroll and related costs and
equity-related compensation for research and development
personnel who design, develop, test and enhance our services and
our network. Research and development costs are expensed as
incurred, except certain software development costs required to
be capitalized. During the year ended December 31,



2003 and 2002, we capitalized $7.5 million
and $6.0 million, respectively, net of impairments, of
payroll and payroll-related costs related to the development of
internal-use software used to deliver our services and operate
our network. We did not capitalize any payroll costs in 2001.
These capitalized internal-use software costs are amortized to
cost of revenue over their useful lives of two years.

Research and development expenses decreased 40%,
or $8.8 million, to $13.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003 as compared to $21.8 million for the
year ended December 31, 2002. Research and development
expenses decreased 51%, or $23.1 million, to
$21.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as
compared to $44.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2001. The decrease in 2003 as compared to
2002, as well as 2002 as compared to 2001, was primarily due to
an increase in capitalization of internal-use software costs and
a decrease in payroll and related costs, including
equity-related compensation, as a result of workforce reductions
in 2002. The decreases in research and development expenses over
these years is quantified as follows (in millions):

We believe that research and development expenses
will increase slightly in 2004 as compared to 2003, as we
continue to make development investments.

Sales and Marketing.

Sales and marketing expenses consist
primarily of payroll and related costs, equity-related
compensation and commissions for personnel engaged in marketing,
sales and service support functions, as well as advertising and
promotional expenses.

Sales and marketing expenses decreased 27%, or
$17.2 million, to $47.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003 as compared to $64.8 million for the
year ended December 31, 2002. Sales and marketing expenses
decreased 30%, or $28.1 million, to $64.8 million for
the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to
$92.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001.
The decrease in sales and marketing expenses in 2003 as compared
to 2002, as well as 2002 as compared to 2001, was primarily due
to a reduction in payroll and payroll-related costs, including
decreases in equity-related compensation attributable to
reductions in headcount in 2002. Sales and marketing during 2003
also decreased as a result of reductions in advertising costs
associated with an agreement between CNN News Group and Akamai,
which expired in the fourth quarter of 2002. The decreases in
sales and marketing expenses over these years is quantified as
follows (in millions):

We believe sales and marketing expenses will
increase modestly in 2004 as compared to 2003 due to an expected
increase in commissions and marketing costs.

General and Administrative.

General and administrative expenses
consist primarily of depreciation of property and equipment used
by us internally, payroll and related costs, equity-related
compensation and related expenses for executive, finance,
business applications, network management, human resources and



other administrative personnel, fees for
professional services, the provision for doubtful accounts and
rent and other facility-related expenditures for leased
properties.

General and administrative expenses decreased
42%, or $40.9 million, to $57.0 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $97.9 million
for the year ended December 31, 2002. General and
administrative expenses decreased 20%, or $24.0 million, to
$97.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, as
compared to $121.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2001. The decrease in general and
administrative expenses in 2003 as compared to 2002 was
primarily due to reduced payroll and related costs, including
equity-related compensation, and reduced rent expense as a
result of restructurings. In 2003, general and administrative
expenses also decreased due to a reduction in depreciation
expense as a result of assets becoming fully depreciated. The
decrease in general and administrative expenses in 2002 as
compared to 2001 was primarily due to a decrease in the
provision for doubtful accounts, reduced payroll and related
costs as a result of reductions in headcount and reduced rent
expense as a result of facility restructurings. The decrease in
the provision for doubtful accounts in 2002 compared to 2001
reflected an improvement in the financial health of our customer
base which had begun to include more customers that do not rely
solely on Internet-based commerce for their revenues. The
decrease in general and administrative over these years is
quantified as follows (in millions):

We do not expect significant further decreases in
general and administrative expenses in 2004 as compared to 2003,
rather we believe that these expenses will remain constant in
2004.

Amortization of Other Intangible Assets.

Amortization of other intangible
assets consists of the amortization of intangible assets
acquired in business combinations. Amortization of other
intangible assets decreased 81%, or $9.7 million, to
$2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 as
compared to $11.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2002. Amortization of other intangible assets
decreased 35%, or $6.6 million, to $11.9 million for
the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to
$18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001.
Intangible assets acquired in business combinations were fully
amortized as of the end of the first quarter of 2003; therefore,
there was no corresponding amortization of such intangibles
assets in the remainder of 2003. The decrease in amortization of
other intangible assets in 2002 as compared to 2001 was
primarily due to the discontinuation of assembled workforce
amortization in 2002, partially offset by an impairment to
intangible assets in 2002. We expect to amortize approximately
$48,000 of intangible assets in 2004 and in each year thereafter
through 2008, during which they will become fully amortized.

Amortization of Goodwill.

We no longer amortize goodwill as a
result of our adoption of SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets,” on January 1, 2002. In
accordance with SFAS No. 142, we reclassified
assembled workforce intangible assets of approximately
$1.0 million to goodwill. The resulting balance of goodwill
was $4.9 million on January 1, 2002. For purposes of
performing an impairment test, we determined that we had one
reporting unit, and we assigned the entire balance of goodwill
to this reporting unit as of January 1, 2004, 2003 and
2002. The fair value of the reporting unit was determined using
our market capitalization as of January 1, 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively. The fair value on January 1, 2004, 2003
and 2002 exceeded the net assets of the reporting unit,
including goodwill, as of these dates. Accordingly, we concluded
that no impairment existed on these dates. Unless changes in
events or



circumstances indicate that an impairment test is
required, we will next test goodwill for impairment as of
January 1, 2005. Amortization of goodwill was
$237.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001.

Restructuring Charges.

We recorded net restructuring benefits
of $8.5 million as a result of amendments to and
terminations of facility leases during the year ended
December 31, 2003. During the year ended December 31,
2002, we recorded restructuring charges of $45.8 million,
which represents $3.6 million for employee severance
benefits and $42.2 million attributable to facility leases
and long-lived asset impairments. During the year ended
December 31, 2001, we recorded restructuring charges of
$40.5 million, which represents $5.1 million for
employee severance benefits and $35.4 million attributable
to facility leases and long-lived asset impairments. Our
restructuring expenses are summarized as follows (in millions):

During 2002, in connection with the termination
of our facility leases for 500 and 600 Technology Square in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, we recorded restructuring charges of
$8.0 million for the difference between the actual
termination costs and the amount previously accrued. Also during
2002, we recorded restructuring charges of $29.7 million
representing the difference between the anticipated costs to
terminate or modify vacant facilities under non-cancelable lease
agreements and the previously recorded restructuring liabilities
for these properties. In addition, we impaired leasehold
improvements, furniture and fixtures, deposits, deferred rent
and other long-lived assets related to these facilities in the
amount of $4.5 million.

During 2003, we amended or terminated three
long-term leases in connection with which we paid our lessors a
total of $16.1 million in cash and restricted cash. As a
result of these lease amendments and terminations, we reversed
$9.6 million of previously accrued restructuring
liabilities and recorded $1.1 million for costs relating to
the restructuring of a facility in Europe. These three
transactions are as follows:

In April 2003, we amended our lease obligation
    for a substantially vacant facility in Santa Clara, California.
    Under the terms of the amendment, we made a payment of
    $9.4 million. The total payment also included the release
    of $5.7 million in restricted cash. As a result of this
    amended lease agreement, we reversed $9.2 million of
    previously accrued restructuring liabilities. We continued to
    pay rent at the previously contracted rate through the end of
    2003. Beginning in January 2004, rent will be reduced to a lower
    rate substantially aligned with market rates in the area. The
    amended lease is scheduled to terminate in August 2007. As of
    December 31, 2003, the remaining restructuring liability
    related to this facility was $5.0 million. As we make the
    remaining contractual rent payments allocable to the vacated
    space, this liability will be reduced. We are actively seeking a
    subtenant for this space. We have estimated no sublease income
    for this facility due to the market conditions in the area.

In May 2003, we terminated our lease for a
    facility located in the United Kingdom for a fee of
    approximately $700,000. In connection with this lease
    termination, we recorded a restructuring charge of
    $1.1 million for costs related to the termination fee and
    the write-off of long-lived assets and long-term deposits, of
    which $144,000 represents a non-cash restructuring charge for
    impairments of leasehold improvements and other long-lived
    assets. We have relocated our operations in the United Kingdom
    to a smaller facility.

In June 2003, we terminated our long-term lease
    for our San Mateo, California facility for a payment of
    $6.0 million and entered into a new lease for 60% less
    space in this facility. As a result of this terminated lease, we
    reversed $400,000 of previously recorded restructuring
    liabilities. Of the $6.0 million payment, $1.1 million
    was recorded as a prepayment for the remaining utilized space
    and is being amortized over the remaining term of the original
    lease. We have previously accrued a restructuring liability for
    the vacant portion of the original lease. The new lease is
    scheduled to expire in May 2008.



Rent payments under the new lease are lower than
    under the original lease, and are more in line with current
    market rates.

The following table summarizes the establishment
and usage of the restructuring liabilities related to real
estate leases (in millions):

We do not anticipate significant restructuring
charges in the future; however, we will continue to pursue
modifications or settlements on our long-term leases if we
believe it to be in the best interests of Akamai and our
stockholders. We have estimated the amount of restructuring
liabilities associated with real estate leases based on the most
recent available market data and discussions with our lessors
and real estate advisors.

Impairment of Goodwill.

During the first quarter of 2001, we
reviewed goodwill and other long-lived assets for impairment
under the guidance of SFAS No. 121, “Accounting for
the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
be Disposed Of.” We considered several factors in
determining whether an impairment may have occurred, including
our market capitalization compared to book value, the overall
business climate and recent estimates for operating results of
acquired businesses. A review of these factors as of
March 31, 2001 indicated that an impairment assessment was
required for long-lived assets of acquired businesses. We
grouped all long-lived assets for acquired businesses, including
goodwill and other intangible assets, and estimated the future
discounted cash flows related to these long-lived assets. The
discount rate used was based on the risks associated with the
acquired businesses. As a result of this analysis, we recorded
an impairment charge of $1,912.8 million during the first
quarter of 2001 to adjust the carrying amount of goodwill to its
fair value as of March 31, 2001.

Interest Income.

Interest income includes interest
earned on invested cash balances and interest earned on notes
receivable for stock. Interest income decreased 57%, or
$1.7 million, to $1.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003 as compared to $3.0 million for the
year ended December 31, 2002. Interest income decreased
75%, or $9.2 million, to $3.0 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $12.3 million
for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in
interest income for each of 2003 and 2002 as compared with prior
periods was a result of a decrease in our invested cash balance
and a decrease in the interest rates earned on our investments.
We expect our interest income in 2004 to be consistent with 2003
as our invested cash balance should remain constant or slightly
increase, assuming consummation of the tender offer to
repurchase $101.0 million of our outstanding 5 1/2%
convertible subordinated notes in March 2004, with no expected
change in the interest rates we expect to earn.

Interest Expense.

Interest expense includes interest paid on our debt obligations.
Interest expense was $18.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003 as compared to $18.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002 and $18.9 million for the year
ended December 31, 2001. Interest expense remained



relatively constant throughout the periods
presented. In December 2003 and January 2004, we repurchased
$99.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our
outstanding 5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes. In
February 2004, we commenced a tender offer to repurchase up to
an additional $101.0 million in principal amount of the
5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes. In December 2003 and
January 2004, we issued $200.0 million in principal amount
of our 1% convertible senior notes. If the tender offer is fully
successful, we believe that interest expense on our debt
obligations will not exceed $10.5 million in 2004.

Other Income.

We
received $1.0 million in proceeds on a key-person life
insurance policy as a result of the death in September 2001 of
Daniel M. Lewin, Akamai’s co-founder.

Gain (loss) on Investments,
net.

During 2003, we recorded a net
gain on investments of $1.6 million, of which
$1.7 million related to the sale of equity investments in
publicly-traded companies, offset by losses of $55,000 on
investments in a privately-held companies and sale of marketable
securities. Loss on investments in 2002 included a loss of
$4.3 million related to our investment in Netaxs, Inc., a
related party, which was realized as a result of a merger
transaction between Netaxs and FASTNET Corporation in April
2002. Loss on investments was partially offset by a gain of
$400,000 on our sale of our equity interest in Akamai Japan to
SBBM. In addition, loss on investments in 2002 consists of a
loss of $2.4 million to adjust the cost basis of equity
investments to fair value, partially offset by approximately
$149,000 of realized investment gains. For the year ended
December 31, 2001, loss on investments includes a loss of
$10.2 million for the adjustment to market value of equity
investments for impairment that was determined to be
other-than-temporary, realized losses of $2.8 million and a
related party loss of $2.0 million in an investment
accounted for under the equity method. We do not expect
significant gain or losses on investments, as our portfolio is
comprised primarily of high-grade debt instruments.

Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt.

During the year ended
December 31, 2003, we recorded a loss on early
extinguishment of debt of $2.1 million as a result of costs
incurred in connection with our repurchase of $74.0 million
in principal amount of our 5 1/2% convertible subordinated
notes during the year. This loss represents the reduction of
$1.2 million of deferred financing costs associated with
repurchases of notes and $890,000 of advisory services incurred
related to the repurchases. We expect to incur additional losses
on early extinguishment of debt in connection with additional
repurchases of our 5 1/2% convertible subordinated debt in
2004. See “Recent Events” above.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

To date, we have financed our operations
primarily through the following transactions:

As of December 31, 2003, cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities totaled
$208.4 million, of which $9.6 million is subject to
restrictions limiting our ability to withdraw or otherwise use
such cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. See
“Letters of Credit and Restricted Cash” below.



Cash used in operating activities decreased 73%,
or $47.8 million, to $18.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003 compared to $65.8 million for the
year ended December 31, 2002. Cash used in operating
activities decreased 45%, or $53.5 million, to
$65.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002
compared to $119.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2001. The decrease in cash used in operating
activities for 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily due to a
decrease of approximately $108.0 million, or 141%, in net
losses before non-cash expenses such as depreciation and
amortization, loss on investments, equity-related compensation
and loss on early extinguishment of debt. Cash used in operating
expense in 2002 as compared to 2001 decreased primarily due to a
decrease of approximately $54,000, or 41%, in net losses before
non-cash expenses.

Cash used in investing activities was
$36.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003,
compared to cash provided by investing activities of
$96.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.
Cash provided by investing activities was $39.6 million for
the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in cash
provided by investing activities for 2003 as compared to 2002
was primarily due to an increase in our net investment in
marketable securities year over year. Cash used in investing
activities for 2003 reflects net purchases, sales and maturities
of investments of $27.7 million and capital expenditures,
including capitalization of internal-use software development
costs of $8.9 million. Cash provided by investing
activities for 2002 reflects net purchases, sales and maturities
of investments of $116.5 million less capital expenditures
of $14.2 million, including capitalization of internal-use
software development costs. Cash provided by investing
activities during 2002 also includes a payment of
$6.5 million to CNN News Group to settle an obligation
resulting from our acquisition of InterVu, Inc., or InterVu, in
April 2000. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial
statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for
further discussion. We expect total capital expenditures, a
component of cash used in investing activities, will not exceed
10% of revenue in 2004.

Cash provided by financing activities was
$100.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003,
$1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 and
$8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001.
Cash provided by financing activities in 2003 reflects proceeds
received from the issuance of our 1% convertible senior notes,
net of financing costs, of $169.8 million, issuances of
common stock under our stock plans and employee stock purchase
plans of $8.6 million, settlement of notes receivable for
stock of $2.3 million, offset by payments for the
repurchase of $74.0 million in principal amount of our
5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes, an increase in
restricted cash to reflect a commitment to repurchase
$5.0 million in principal amount of our 5 1/2%
convertible subordinated notes in early 2004, and payments on
our capital leases of $1.4 million. We satisfied the
$5.0 million commitment to repurchase notes in January
2004. Cash provided by financing activities in 2002 reflects
proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans
of $2.8 million and payments on our capital lease
obligations of $1.6 million. Cash received from the
issuance of common stock under stock option and employee stock
purchase plans increased in 2003 as compared to prior years as a
result of more option exercises in 2003. Assuming consummation
of our announced tender offer for up to $101.0 million in
principal amount of our 5 1/2% convertible subordinated
notes, along with the issuance of an additional
$25.0 million in principal amount of our 1% convertible
senior notes and the repurchase of $25.0 million in
principal amount of our 5 1/2% convertible subordinated
notes, we expect our cash used for financing activities in 2004
to increase as compared to 2003.

We believe, based on our present business plan,
that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities of $208.4 million will be sufficient to meet our
cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at
least the next 24 months. If the assumptions underlying our
business plan regarding future revenue and expenses change or if
unexpected opportunities or needs arise, we may seek to raise
additional cash by selling equity or debt securities. If
additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt
securities, these securities could have rights, preferences and
privileges senior to those accruing to holders of common stock
and outstanding debt securities, and the terms of such debt
could impose restrictions on our operations. The sale of
additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in
additional dilution to our stockholders. See “Factors
Affecting Future Operating Results.”



Contractual Obligations and Commercial
Commitments

The following table presents our contractual
obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31,
2003 over the next five years and thereafter (in millions):

Letters of Credit and Restricted
Cash

As of December 31, 2003, we had issued
$4.6 million in irrevocable letters of credit in favor of
third-party beneficiaries, primarily related to long-term
facility leases. The letters of credit are collateralized by
restricted marketable securities, of which $3.9 million are
classified as long-term and $726,000 are classified as
short-term on our consolidated balance sheet. The restrictions
on these marketable securities lapse as we fulfill our
obligations as provided by the letters of credit.

As of December 31, 2003, we had
$5.0 million classified as restricted cash on the
consolidated balance sheet. This amount reflects our commitment
at December 31, 2003 to repurchase $5.0 million in
aggregate principal amount of our 5 1/2% convertible
subordinated notes. As of December 31, 2003, the related
debt is included in our current liabilities as current portion
of 5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes in our
consolidated balance sheet.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have entered into various indemnification
arrangements with third parties, including vendors, customers,
landlords, our officers and directors, stockholders of acquired
companies, joint venture partners and third parties to whom and
from whom we license technology. Generally, these
indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses
suffered by the third party due to various events, such as
lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our
negligence. These indemnification obligations are considered
off-balance sheet arrangements in accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Interpretation 45,
“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others.” We have not accrued a liability for any guarantee
identified because the likelihood of incurring a payment
obligation under the guarantees is remote. See Note 9 to our
consolidated financial statements included in this annual report
on Form 10-K for further discussion of these
indemnification agreements.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force,
or EITF, reached a consensus on Issue 00-21 “Revenue
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.” EITF 00-21
addresses revenue recognition for revenue arrangements with
multiple deliverables. The deliverables in these revenue
arrangements should be divided into separate units of accounting
when the individual deliverables have value to the customer on a
stand-alone basis, there is objective and reliable evidence of
the fair value of the undelivered elements, and, if the



arrangement includes a general right to return
the delivered element, delivery or performance of the
undelivered element is considered probable. The relative fair
value of each unit should be determined and the total
consideration of the arrangement should be allocated among the
individual units based on their fair value. The guidance on this
issue is effective for revenue arrangements entered into after
June 30, 2003. The adoption of EITF 00-21 did not have
a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation
46, or FIN 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities — An Interpretation of Accounting Research
Bulletin No. 51.” FIN 46 addresses consolidation
of variable interest entities where the equity investment at
risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its
activities without additional subordinated financial support
from other parties and the equity investors lack one or more
essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest.
FIN 46 applies immediately to variable interest entities
created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest
entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that
date. It applies in the first fiscal year or interim period
beginning after June 15, 2003, to variable interest
entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that
it acquired before February 1, 2003. We currently do not
hold any variable interest entities and therefore FIN 46
did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In October 2003, the FASB issued FASB Staff
Position, or FSP, 46-6, “Effective Date of FASB
Interpretation 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities.” This FSP deferred the effective date for
applying the provisions of FIN 46 for interests in variable
interest entities or potential variable interest entities
created before February 1, 2003. FSP 46-6 had no
effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2003, the FASB issued
Interpretation 46R, or FIN 46R, “A Revision to
FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.”
FIN 46R clarifies some of the provisions of FIN 46 and
exempts certain entities from its requirements. FIN 46R is
effective at the end of the first interim period ending after
March 15, 2004. Entities that have adopted FIN 46
prior to this effective date can continue to apply the
provisions of FIN 46 until the effective date of
FIN 46R. We currently do not hold any variable interest
entities and therefore FIN 46R is not expected to have an
effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149,
“Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities.” This statement amends SFAS
No. 133 to provide clarification on the financial
accounting and reporting of derivative instruments and hedging
activities and requires contracts with similar characteristics
to be accounted for on a comparable basis. This statement was
effective for contracts entered into or modified after
June 30, 2003 and for hedging relationships designated
after June 30, 2003. We adopted SFAS No. 149 on
July 1, 2003 and the adoption did not have a material
effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150,
“Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity.” SFAS
No. 150 clarifies the accounting for certain financial
instruments with characteristics of debt that, under previous
guidance, issuers could account for as equity. SFAS No. 150
requires that those instruments be classified as liabilities in
statements of financial position. SFAS No. 150 became
effective for financial instruments entered into or modified
after May 31, 2003, and otherwise became effective
July 1, 2003. The adoption of the SFAS No. 150 did not
impact our consolidated financial statements.

In August 2003, the EITF reached a consensus on
Issue 03-05, “Applicability of AICPA Statement of
Position 97-2 to Non-Software Deliverables in an
Arrangement Containing More-Than-Incidental Software.”
EITF 03-05 addresses the applicability of SOP 97-2 to
non-software deliverables in an arrangement containing
more-than-incidental software. In an arrangement that includes
software that is more than incidental to the products or
services as a whole, software and software-related elements are
included within the scope of SOP 97-2. Software-related
elements include software products and services, as well as any
non-software deliverables for which a software deliverable is
essential to its functionality. The adoption of EITF 03-05
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
results.

In December 2003, the SEC issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin, or SAB, No. 104, “Revenue Recognition”,
which supersedes No. 101, “Revenue Recognition in
Financial Statements.” SAB No. 104 rescinds



accounting guidance on SAB No. 101 related
to multiple-element arrangements as this guidance has been
superseded as a result of the issuance of EITF 00-21. The
adoption of SAB No. 104 did not have a material impact on
our consolidated financial statements.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
    About Market Risk.

Our exposure to market risk for changes in
interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. In
our investment portfolio we do not use derivative financial
instruments. We place our investments with high quality issuers
and, by policy, limit the amount of risk by investing primarily
in money market funds, United States Treasury obligations,
high-quality corporate obligations and certificates of deposit.

We may incur realized losses as a result of early
redemptions of our debt securities. Our 5 1/2% convertible
subordinated notes and 1% convertible senior notes are subject
to changes in market value. Under certain conditions, the
holders of our 1% convertible senior notes may require us to
redeem the notes on or after December 15, 2010. As of
December 31, 2003, the carrying amount and fair value of
the 5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes were
$226.0 million and $187.6 million, respectively. In
February 2004, we commenced a tender offer to repurchase up to
$101.0 million of the 5 1/2% convertible subordinated
notes. The carrying amount and fair value of the 1% convertible
senior notes were both $175.0 million as of
December 31, 2003.

We have operations in Europe and Asia. As a
result, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange
rates. Additionally, we may continue to expand our operations
globally and sell to customers in foreign locations, which may
increase our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations.

Statements



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Akamai Technologies, Inc.:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of
operations, of cash flows and of stockholders’ equity
(deficit) present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Akamai Technologies, Inc. and its
subsidiaries at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2003 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America, which require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company ceased amortization of
goodwill and reclassified its assembled workforce intangible
asset to goodwill as a result of the adoption of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets,” in January 2002.

2.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and
    Estimates:

Use of Estimates

The Company prepares its consolidated financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America that require management
to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses,
together with amounts disclosed in the related notes to the
consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ
from the recorded estimates. Significant estimates used in these
financial statements include, but are not limited to, accounting
for long-term contracts, allowance for doubtful accounts,
restructuring reserves, contingencies, amortization and
impairment of intangibles, goodwill, capitalized software,
depreciation and impairment of property and equipment, deferred
tax assets and other-than-temporary loss on investments.
Estimates are periodically reviewed in light of changes in
circumstances, facts and experience. The effects of material
revisions in estimates are reflected in the consolidated
financial statements prospectively from the date of the change
in estimate.

The Company has incurred net losses and negative
cash flows since inception. The Company’s cash used in
operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 was
$18.0 million, and the Company had accrued restructuring
costs, primarily related to vacated facilities, of
$5.2 million at December 31, 2003. The Company’s
cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities
and restricted marketable securities at December 31, 2003
were $208.4 million. In January 2004, the initial purchaser
of the Company’s 1% convertible senior notes exercised its
option to purchase an additional $25.0 million in principal
amount of the notes for a payment of $24.3 million, net of
the initial purchaser’s discount and offering expenses. In
February 2004, the Company repurchased an aggregate of
$25.0 million in principal amount of its outstanding
5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes. The Company believes
that its existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities
and restricted marketable securities will be sufficient to meet
its working capital, capital expenditure and restructuring
requirements for at least the next 24 months.

Revenue Recognition

Akamai primarily derives revenue from recurring
services sold to customers under contracts having terms of one
year or longer. These contracts generally commit the customer to
a minimum monthly level of usage. The contract provides for the
rate at which the customer must pay for actual usage above the
monthly minimum. For these services, Akamai recognizes the
monthly minimum as revenue each month provided that an
enforceable contract has been signed by both parties, the
service has been delivered to the customer, the fee for the
service is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably
assured. Should a customer’s usage exceed the monthly
minimum, Akamai recognizes revenue for that excess in the period
of the usage. The Company



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

typically charges the customer an installation
fee when the services are first activated. The installation fees
are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue
ratably over the estimated life of the customer arrangement,
which is generally the term of the contract. The Company also
derives revenue from services sold as discrete events or based
solely on usage. For these services, the Company recognizes
revenue after an enforceable contract has been signed by both
parties, the fee is fixed or determinable, the event or usage
has occurred and collection is reasonably assured.

The Company periodically enters into
multi-element service arrangements. When the Company enters into
such arrangements, each element is accounted for separately over
its respective service period, provided that there is objective
evidence of fair value for the separate element. For example,
objective evidence of fair value would include the price charged
for the element when sold separately. If the fair value of each
element cannot be objectively determined, the total value of the
arrangement is recognized ratably over the entire service
period. For most multi-element service arrangements to date, the
fair value of each element has not been objectively
determinable. Therefore, all revenue under these arrangements
has been recognized ratably over the related service period.

The Company licenses software under perpetual and
term license agreements. The Company applies the provisions of
Statement of Position (“SOP”) 97-2, “Software
Revenue Recognition,” as amended by SOP 98-9,
“Modifications of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue
Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions.” As
prescribed by this guidance, the Company applies the residual
method of accounting. The residual method requires that the
portion of the total arrangement fee attributable to undelivered
elements, as indicated by vendor specific objective evidence of
fair value, is deferred and subsequently recognized in
accordance with SOP 97-2. The difference between the total
arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered
elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered
elements, if all other revenue recognition criteria of
SOP 97-2 are met.

The Company also sells its services through a
reseller channel. Assuming all other revenue recognition
criteria are met, the Company recognizes revenue from reseller
arrangements based on the resellers’ contracted
non-refundable minimum purchase commitments over the term of the
contract, plus amounts sold by the resellers to their customers
in excess of the minimum commitments.

Akamai recognizes revenue from fixed-fee
arrangements and software arrangements that require significant
customization or modification using the percentage-of-completion
method in accordance with Accounting Research Bulletin
(“ARB”) No. 45, “Long-Term Construction-Type
Contracts,” and with the applicable guidance provided by
SOP 81-1, “Accounting for Performance of
Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts”
based on the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to the
estimated total cost to complete the project. The impact of any
change in estimate is recorded prospectively from the date of
the change. At the outset of a fixed-fee arrangement, if the
Company is not able to estimate the total cost-to-complete, the
Company accounts for the arrangement using the
completed-contract method of accounting. Under this method, the
Company recognizes revenue when the contract is complete and
there are no remaining costs or deliverables. In the event that
the estimated total cost on a fixed-fee contract indicates a
loss, the Company will record the loss immediately.

From time to time, the Company enters into
contracts to sell its services or license its technology to
enterprises at or about the same time that it enters into
contracts to purchase products or services from the same
enterprise. If the Company concludes that these contracts were
negotiated concurrently, the Company records as revenue only the
net cash received from the vendor, unless the product or service
received has a separate identifiable benefit and the fair value
to the Company of the vendor’s product or service can be
established objectively.

The Company may from time to time resell licenses
or services of third parties. The Company records revenue for
these transactions when the Company has risk of loss related to
the amounts purchased from the third party and the Company adds
value to the license or service, such as by providing
maintenance or support



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

for such license or service. If these conditions
are present, the Company recognizes revenue when all other
revenue recognition criteria are satisfied.

Cost of Revenue

Cost of revenue consists primarily of fees paid
to network providers for bandwidth and for housing servers in
third-party network data centers. Cost of revenue also includes
network operation employee costs, network storage costs, cost of
professional services, cost of licenses, depreciation on network
equipment used to deliver the Company’s services,
amortization of network-related internal-use software, and costs
for the production of live on-line events. The Company enters
into contracts for bandwidth with third-party network providers
with terms typically ranging from one to three years. These
contracts generally commit Akamai to pay minimum monthly fees
plus additional fees for bandwidth usage above the contracted
level. In some circumstances, Internet service providers
(“ISPs”) make available to Akamai rack space for the
Company’s servers and access to their bandwidth at
discounted or no cost. In exchange, the ISP and its customers
benefit by receiving content through a local Akamai server
resulting in better content delivery. The Company does not
consider these relationships to represent the culmination of an
earnings process. Accordingly, the Company does not recognize as
revenue the value to the ISPs associated with the use of
Akamai’s servers nor does the Company recognize as expense
the value of the rack space and bandwidth received at discounted
or no cost.

Equity-Related Compensation

Akamai accounts for stock-based awards to
employees using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by
Accounting Principles Board Opinion (“APB”)
No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,” and related interpretations. Accordingly, no
compensation expense is recorded for stock-based awards issued
to employees in fixed amounts and with fixed exercise prices at
least equal to the fair market value of the Company’s
common stock at the date of grant. Akamai applies the provisions
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”) No. 123, as amended by SFAS
No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation — Transition and Disclosure, an amendment
of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,” through disclosure only for stock-based
awards issued to employees. All stock-based awards to
non-employees are accounted for at their fair value in
accordance with SFAS No. 123.

Equity-related compensation is comprised of the
following:

the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

Research and Development
    Costs

Research and development costs consist primarily
of payroll and related personnel costs for the design,
deployment, testing, operation and enhancement of the
Company’s services and network. Costs incurred in the
development of the Company’s services are expensed as
incurred, except certain software development costs eligible for
capitalization. Costs associated with the development of
software to be marketed externally are expensed prior to the
establishment of technological feasibility as defined by SFAS
No. 86, “Accounting for



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the Cost of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased,
or Otherwise Marketed,” and capitalized thereafter until
the general release of the software. To date, the Company’s
development of software to be sold externally has been completed
concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility
and, accordingly, all associated costs have been charged to
expense as incurred in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements.

Costs incurred during the application development
stage of internal-use software projects are capitalized in
accordance with SOP 98-1, “Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.”
Capitalized costs include payroll and payroll-related costs for
employees in the Company’s development and information
technology groups who are directly associated with, and who
devote time to, the Company’s internal-use software
projects during the application development stage.
Capitalization begins when the planning stage is complete and
the Company commits resources to the software project.
Capitalization ceases when the software has been tested and is
ready for its intended use. Amortization of the asset commences
when the software is complete and placed in service. The Company
amortizes completed internal-use software to cost of revenue
over an estimated life of two years. Costs incurred during the
planning, training and post implementation stages of the
software development life-cycle are expensed as incurred. Costs
related to upgrades and enhancements of existing internal-use
software that increase the functionality of the software are
also capitalized.

Concentrations of Credit Risk and Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The amounts reflected in the consolidated balance
sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair
value due to their short-term maturities. The fair value and
carrying value of the Company’s 5 1/2% convertible
subordinated notes were approximately $187.6 million and
$226.0 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2003.
In February 2004, the Company commenced a tender offer to
repurchase up to $101.0 million of the 5 1/2%
convertible subordinated notes. See Note 21. The carrying
value of the Company’s 1% convertible senior notes
approximated its fair value as of December 31, 2003.
Akamai’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
are held with financial institutions that the Company believes
to be of high credit standing. Akamai’s customer base
consists of a large number of geographically dispersed customers
diversified across several industries. For the year ended
December 31, 2003, one customer accounted for 15% of total
revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, no
customers accounted for more than 10% of total revenue. As of
December 31, 2003 and 2002, no customer had an accounts
receivable balance outstanding more than 10% of total accounts
receivable. As a result, concentration of credit risk related to
accounts receivable is not significant.

Income Taxes

The Company’s provision for income taxes is
comprised of a current and a deferred provision. The current
income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes
payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. The
deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated
future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and
carryforwards using expected enacted tax rates in effect in the
years during which the differences are expected to reverse.
Valuation allowances are provided if, based on the weight of
available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all
of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Advertising Expense

The Company recognizes advertising expense as
incurred. The Company acquired a prepaid advertising contract as
a result of its acquisition in April 2000 of InterVu, Inc.
(“InterVu”). See Note 18. The prepaid asset was
fully amortized to advertising expense in the amount of
$5.6 million in each of the years ended December 31,
2002 and 2001. The Company recognized total advertising expense
of $208,000, $7.5 million and $5.6 million for the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Foreign Currency Translation

Akamai has determined that the functional
currency of its foreign subsidiaries is the subsidiary’s
local currency. The assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries
are translated at the applicable exchange rate as of the balance
sheet date and revenue and expenses are translated at an average
rate over the period. Currency translation adjustments are
recorded as a component of other comprehensive loss. Gains and
losses on inter-company transactions are recorded in operating
expenses and have not been material for the periods presented.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable
    Securities

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash held in
bank deposit accounts and short-term, highly liquid investments
with original maturities of three months or less at the date of
purchase. Cash equivalents are carried at amortized cost, which
approximates fair value. Restricted cash consists of cash not
immediately available that is restricted or segregated for uses
other than current operations. As of December 31, 2003, the
Company had $5.0 million of restricted cash that was
restricted for the repurchase of long-term debt.

Short-term marketable securities consist of high
quality corporate and government securities with original
maturities of more than three months at the date of purchase and
less than one year from the date of the balance sheet, and
equity investments in publicly-traded companies. Long-term
marketable securities consist of high quality corporate and
government securities with maturities of more than one year from
the date of the balance sheet. Short-term and long-term
marketable securities include investments that are restricted as
to use. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had
$4.0 million of restricted marketable securities
representing irrevocable letters of credit related to long-term
facility leases.

The Company classifies all debt securities and
equity securities with readily determinable market values as
“available for sale” in accordance with SFAS
No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities.” These investments are classified as
marketable securities on the consolidated balance sheet and are
carried at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses
considered to be temporary in nature reported as a separate
component of other comprehensive loss. Investments in the
securities of private companies are initially carried at cost.
These investments are included in other long-term assets on the
consolidated balance sheet. The Company reviews all investments
for reductions in fair value that are other-than-temporary. When
such reductions occur, the cost of the investment is adjusted to
fair value through loss on investments on the consolidated
statement of operations. Gains and losses on investments are
calculated on the basis of specific identification.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost, net
of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation and amortization are
computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over
the shorter of related lease terms or their estimated useful
lives. Property and equipment acquired under capital leases are
depreciated over the shorter of the related lease terms or the
useful lives of the assets. The Company periodically reviews the
estimated useful lives of property and equipment. Changes to the
estimated useful lives are recorded prospectively from the date
of the change. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of the assets
disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are removed
from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in
loss from operations. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed
as incurred.

Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets

The Company has recorded goodwill and other
intangible assets as a result of several acquisitions. In
accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets,” which the Company adopted on
January 1, 2002, the Company has reclassified the balance
of unamortized assembled workforce intangible assets to goodwill
as of January 1, 2002. The Company performed an impairment
test of goodwill as of January 1, 2003 and 2004. These
tests did not result in an impairment to goodwill. See Note 7.
In accordance with SFAS No. 142, the Company discontinued
the amortization of goodwill as of January 2002. Other



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

intangible assets consist of completed technology
and trademarks and trade names arising from the acquisition of
businesses and acquired license rights. These intangible assets
are amortized using the straight-line method over their
estimated useful lives.

Impairment of Other Long-Lived
    Assets

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment
under the guidance of SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” Under
SFAS No. 144, long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as service
discontinuance, technological obsolescence, a change in the
Company’s market capitalization, facility closure or
work-force reductions indicate that the carrying amount of the
asset may not be recoverable. When such events occur, the
Company compares the carrying amount of the asset to the
undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset. If
this comparison indicates that an impairment is present, the
amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between
the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. If a
readily determinable market price does not exist, fair value is
estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to
the asset.

Restructuring Charges

A restructuring liability related to employee
terminations is recorded by the Company when a one-time benefit
arrangement is communicated to an employee who is involuntarily
terminated as part of a company-wide reorganization and the
amount of the termination benefit is known, provided that the
employee is not required to render future services in order to
receive the termination benefit.

The Company previously recorded restructuring
expenses and liabilities when management approved and committed
the Company to a plan to exit a facility lease, the plan related
to leased facilities specifically identifies the actions to be
taken and the actions were scheduled to begin soon after
management approves the plan. Beginning in 2003, in accordance
with SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities,” the Company records
restructuring liabilities, discounted at the appropriate rate,
for facility leases only when the space is both vacated and all
actions needed to make the space readily available for sublease
have been completed. The Company records restructuring
liabilities for estimated costs to terminate a facility lease
before the end of its contractual term or for estimated costs
that will continue to be incurred under the lease for its
remaining term when there is no economic benefit to the Company,
net of an estimate of sublease income.

Recent Accounting
    Pronouncements

In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force
(the “EITF”) reached a consensus on Issue 00-21
“Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.”
EITF 00-21 addresses revenue recognition for revenue
arrangements with multiple deliverables. The deliverables in
these revenue arrangements should be divided into separate units
of accounting when the individual deliverables have value to the
customer on a stand-alone basis, there is objective and reliable
evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements, and, if
the arrangement includes a general right to return the delivered
element, delivery or performance of the undelivered element is
considered probable. The relative fair value of each unit should
be determined and the total consideration of the arrangement
should be allocated among the individual units based on their
fair value. The guidance on this issue is effective for revenue
arrangements entered into after June 30, 2003. The adoption
of EITF 00-21 did not have a material impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Interpretation 46, or
FIN 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities — An Interpretation of Accounting Research
Bulletin No. 51.” FIN 46 addresses consolidation
of variable interest entities where the equity investment at
risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its
activities without additional subordinated financial support
from other parties and the equity investors lack one or more
essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest.
FIN 46 applies immediately to variable interest entities
created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest
entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that
date. It applies in the first fiscal



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

year or interim period beginning after
June 15, 2003, to variable interest entities in which an
enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before
February 1, 2003. The Company is not currently an investor
in any variable interest entities.

In October 2003, the FASB issued FASB Staff
Position (“FSP”), 46-6, “Effective Date of FASB
Interpretation 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities.” This FSP deferred the effective date for
applying the provisions of FIN 46 for interests in variable
interest entities or potential variable interest entities
created before February 1, 2003. FSP 46-6 had no
effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation
46R, or FIN 46R, “A Revision to FIN 46,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.” FIN 46R
clarifies some of the provisions of FIN 46 and exempts
certain entities from its requirements. FIN 46R is
effective at the end of the first interim period ending after
March 15, 2004. Entities that have adopted FIN 46
prior to this effective date can continue to apply the
provisions of FIN 46 until the effective date of
FIN 46R. The Company is not currently an investor in any
variable interest entities and therefore FIN 46R is not
expected to have an effect on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.

In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149,
“Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities.” This statement amends SFAS
No. 133 to provide clarification on the financial
accounting and reporting of derivative instruments and hedging
activities and requires contracts with similar characteristics
to be accounted for on a comparable basis. This statement was
effective for contracts entered into or modified after
June 30, 2003 and for hedging relationships designated
after June 30, 2003. The Company adopted SFAS No. 149
on July 1, 2003 and the adoption did not have a material
effect on its consolidated financial statements.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150,
“Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity.” SFAS
No. 150 clarifies the accounting for certain financial
instruments with characteristics of debt that, under previous
guidance, issuers could account for as equity. SFAS No. 150
requires that those instruments be classified as liabilities in
statements of financial position. SFAS No. 150 became
effective for financial instruments entered into or modified
after May 31, 2003, and otherwise became effective
July 1, 2003. The adoption of the SFAS No. 150 did not
impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In August 2003, the EITF reached a consensus on
Issue 03-05, “Applicability of AICPA Statement of
Position 97-2 to Non-Software Deliverables in an
Arrangement Containing More-Than-Incidental Software.”
EITF 03-05 addresses the applicability of SOP 97-2 to
non-software deliverables in an arrangement containing
more-than-incidental software. In an arrangement that includes
software that is more than incidental to the products or
services as a whole, software and software-related elements are
included within the scope of SOP 97-2. Software-related
elements include software products and services, as well as any
non-software deliverables for which a software deliverable is
essential to its functionality. The adoption of EITF 03-05
did not have a material impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial results.

In December 2003, the SEC issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 104, “Revenue
Recognition,” which supersedes No. 101, “Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements.” SAB No. 104
rescinds accounting guidance on SAB No. 101 related to
multiple-element arrangements as this guidance has been
superseded as a result of the issuance of EITF 00-21. The
adoption of SAB No. 104 did not have a material impact on
the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Net Loss per Share:

Basic net loss per share is computed using the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
year. Diluted net loss per share is computed using the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the year,
plus the dilutive effect of potential common stock. Potential
common stock consists of stock options, deferred stock units,
warrants, unvested restricted common stock, contingently
issuable common stock and convertible notes.

Available-for-sale securities by contractual
maturity were as follows (in thousands):

As of December 31, 2003, the Company had
$9.6 million of marketable securities and cash that were
classified as restricted. These primarily represent irrevocable
letters of credit related to facility leases and commitments on
repurchases of the Company’s 5 1/2% convertible
subordinated notes. The Company classifies marketable securities
according to the contractual maturity terms for which each
security is restricted against. As of December 31, 2003,
$4.6 million of the Company’s marketable securities,
of which $3.9 million are classified as long-term and
$726,000 are classified as short-term, are restricted by
irrevocable letters of credit issued in favor of third-party
beneficiaries. These restrictions lapse as the Company fulfills
its obligations under the letters of credit. As of
December 31, 2003, $5.0 million of the Company’s
cash was classified as restricted. The $5.0 million
represented cash that was restricted at December 31, 2003
reflecting a commitment by the Company to repurchase
$5.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its
5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes. The
$5.0 million cash payment was made in January 2004.

For the year ended December 31, 2003, the
Company recorded net gains on investments of $1.6 million,
which includes a gain of $1.7 million related to the sale
of equity investments in publicly-traded companies offset by
losses of $55,000 on the sales of investment in privately-held
companies and sales of marketable securities.

For the year ended December 31, 2002, the
Company recorded loss on investments of $6.1 million,
including $4.1 million of net investment losses for
investments in related parties. Loss on investments during 2002
includes a loss of $4.3 million for the Company’s
investment in Netaxs, Inc. (“Netaxs”), a related
party, which was realized as a result of a merger transaction
between Netaxs and FASTNET Corporation in April 2002. Loss on
investments also includes a related party investment gain of
$400,000 on the Company’s sale of its equity ownership in
Akamai Technologies Japan KK to Softbank Broadmedia Corporation
(“SBBM”).

In addition, in 2002, the Company recorded losses
of $1.4 million, including $150,000 for a related party
investment, to adjust the cost basis of its equity investments
in publicly-traded companies to fair value as a result of
reductions in the market values of such investments that, in the
opinion of management, were other-than-temporary. During 2002,
the Company also recorded a loss of $960,000 to adjust the
carrying amount of its investment in a privately-held company to
its estimated fair value. Loss on investments in 2002 also
included approximately $149,000 of realized investment gains.

For the year ended December 31, 2001, loss
on investments includes a loss of $10.2 million for the
adjustment to market value of equity investments for impairment
that was determined to be other-than-temporary, realized losses
of $2.8 million and a related party loss of
$2.0 million in an investment accounted for under the
equity method.

Depreciation and amortization expense on property
and equipment and capitalized software costs for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $47.5 million,
$78.5 million and $73.8 million, respectively.

During the year ended December 31, 2003, the
Company recorded impairment losses of approximately $853,000 for
the net book value of networking equipment that was deemed to
have no remaining fair value. The impairment loss was recorded
as additional depreciation expense and is included in cost of
revenue in the consolidated statements of operations for the
year ended December 31, 2003. During the year ended
December 31, 2002, the Company recorded an impairment
charge of $979,000, which is included in depreciation expense,
for certain impaired long-lived assets, consisting of computer
and network equipment, furniture and fixtures and licensed
software. Additionally, during the year ended December 31,
2002, the Company accelerated the amortization of leasehold
improvements at its headquarters facility located in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, as a result of the move to a new facility. The
acceleration of these leasehold improvements resulted in an
increase to amortization expense of $5.0 million for the
year ended December 31, 2002. During the year ended
December 31, 2001, the Company changed the estimated useful
lives of its internal use computers from three to two years. The
impact of the change in useful lives resulted in an increase to
depreciation expense of $2.4 million in 2001.

During the years ended December 31, 2003 and
2002, as a result of restructuring actions undertaken by the
Company, the Company impaired approximately $272,000 and
$3.2 million, respectively, of leasehold improvements and
furniture and fixtures. The Company recorded these impairments
as non-cash restructuring charges (Note 11).

The Company had equipment acquired under capital
leases as follows (in thousands):

During the years ended December 31, 2003 and
2002, the Company capitalized $7.6 million and
$7.2 million, respectively, of payroll and payroll-related
costs for the development and enhancement of

internal-use software applications. The
internal-use software is used by the Company primarily to
operate, manage and monitor its deployed network and deliver its
services. The Company impaired $105,000 and $285,000 of
in-process internal-use software previously capitalized for
projects that were cancelled during the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These impairments
are recorded in research and development expense. The Company
amortizes completed internal-use software over an estimated life
of two years. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company
had amortized approximately $5.1 million and $932,000 of
capitalized software costs, respectively. No costs were
capitalized in 2001.

In January 2003, the Company adopted SFAS
No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations.” SFAS No. 143 addresses the accounting
and reporting requirements for obligations associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets. As a result of
adopting this statement, the Company recorded an asset
retirement obligation and associated long-lived asset of
$109,000 as of January 1, 2003 for the fair value of a
contractual obligation to remove leasehold improvements at the
conclusion of the Company’s facility lease in Cambridge,
Massachusetts. The obligation and asset are classified on the
Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31, 2003 as non-current liabilities and property
and equipment, respectively. The Company is amortizing the asset
and accreting the obligation over the remaining life of the
associated leasehold improvements.

7.     Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets:

The Company acquired goodwill and other
intangible assets through business acquisitions during the year
ended December 31, 2000. The Company also acquired license
rights from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1999.
The Company reviews goodwill and other intangible assets for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of these assets may exceed their fair
value.

During the first quarter of 2001, the Company
reviewed goodwill and other long-lived assets for impairment
under the guidance of SFAS No. 121, “Accounting for
the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
Be Disposed Of.” The Company considered several factors in
determining whether an impairment may have occurred, including
the Company’s market capitalization compared to its book
value, the overall business climate and recent estimates for
operating results of acquired businesses. A review of these
factors as of March 31, 2001 indicated that an impairment
assessment was required for long-lived assets of acquired
businesses. The Company grouped all long-lived assets for
acquired businesses, including goodwill and other intangible
assets, and estimated the future discounted cash flows related
to these long-lived assets. The discount rate used was based on
the risks associated with the acquired businesses. As a result
of this analysis, the Company recorded an impairment charge of
$1,912.8 million during the first quarter of 2001 to adjust
the carrying amount of goodwill arising from the acquisitions of
Network


Communications, Inc.
(“Network


”) and InterVu to its fair value as
of March 31, 2001.

The Company adopted SFAS No. 142 in January
2002. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 142, the carrying
amount of goodwill was $4.0 million. In accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No. 142, the Company reclassified to
goodwill its assembled workforce intangible assets of
approximately $1.0 million. SFAS No. 142 requires the
Company to test goodwill for impairment at least annually. The
Company



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

concluded that it had one reporting unit and
assigned the entire balance of goodwill to this reporting unit
as of January 1, 2003 and 2004 for purposes of performing
an impairment test. The fair value of the reporting unit was
determined using the Company’s market capitalization as of
January 1, 2003 and 2004. The fair value on January 1,
2003 and 2004 exceeded the net assets of the reporting unit,
including goodwill, as of both dates. Accordingly, the Company
concluded that no impairment existed as of these dates. Unless
changes in events or circumstances indicate that an impairment
test is required, the Company will next test goodwill for
impairment on January 1, 2005. In accordance with SFAS
No. 142, the Company discontinued the amortization of
goodwill as of January 1, 2002.

The following table reconciles reported net loss
to adjusted net loss, which excludes amortization of goodwill
and assembled workforce, for the year ended December 31,
2001 (in thousands except loss per share amounts), as if the
non-amortization provisions of SFAS No. 142 had been
adopted by the Company as of the beginning of such year:

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 142, the
Company’s other intangible assets consisted of completed
technology, trademarks and trade names, assembled workforce and
acquired license rights. In 2002, the Company reclassified
assembled workforce to goodwill and concluded that the remaining
intangible assets had definite useful lives equivalent to their
original useful lives. During the first quarter of 2002, the
Company discontinued sales of a service line that utilized
technology acquired from Network


in February 2000 and
recorded an impairment loss of $2.3 million to adjust the
intangible assets related to the Network


technology to
their fair value. The impairment loss was included in
amortization of other intangible assets.

Other intangible assets subject to amortization
consist of the following (in thousands):



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Amortization expense for other intangible assets
was $2.2 million, $11.9 million and $18.5 million
for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The decline in intangible amortization expense is
due to the full amortization of completed technology and
trademarks and trade names. Amortization expense is expected to
be $48,000 in 2004 and in each year thereafter through 2008.

Commitments, Contingencies and
    Guarantees:

Operating and Capital Leases

The Company leases its facilities and certain
equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. These operating
leases expire at various dates through May 2009 and generally
require the payment of real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance
and operating costs. The Company also leases certain equipment
under capital leases, which expire at various dates through June
2005. However, the Company intends to buy out these capital
equipment leases in 2004. Accordingly, such leases are
classified as short-term on the consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31, 2003. The minimum aggregate future obligations
under non-cancelable leases as of December 31, 2003
(assuming buy out of capital equipment leases in 2004) are as
follows (in thousands):

Rent expense for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $6.0 million,
$9.6 million and $14.4 million, respectively. The
Company has entered into sublease agreements with tenants of
various properties previously vacated by the Company. The
contracted amounts payable to the Company by these sublease
tenants are approximately $190,000 for the year ending
December 31, 2004.

The Company has issued letters of credit in the
amount of $4.0 million related to certain of its real
estate leases. These letters of credit are collateralized by
marketable securities that have been restricted as to use (see
Note 5). The letters of credit expire as the Company
fulfills its operating lease obligations. Certain of the

Company’s facility leases include rent
escalation clauses. The Company normalizes rent expense on a
straight-line basis over the term of the lease for known changes
in lease payments over the life of the lease.

Purchase Commitments

The Company has long-term commitments for
bandwidth usage and co-location with various networks and ISPs.
For the years ending December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, the
minimum commitments are approximately $10.1 million,
$1.5 million and $53,000, respectively. The Company had
aggregate equipment purchase commitments of approximately
$500,000 as of December 31, 2003. This purchase commitment
expires in August 2004. Additionally, in connection with the
Company’s repurchase of a portion of its 5 1/2%
convertible subordinated notes, the Company entered into an
agreement with a financial advisory services provider. Under
this agreement, the Company agreed to pay a minimum fee of
$1.5 million. As of December 31, 2003, the remaining
unpaid commitment fee under this agreement is approximately
$600,000.

Litigation

Between July 2, 2001 and August 31,
2001, purported class action lawsuits seeking monetary damages
were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York against the Company as well as against the
underwriters of its October 28, 1999 initial public
offering of common stock. The complaints were filed allegedly on
behalf of persons who purchased the Company’s common stock
during different time periods, all beginning on October 28, 1999
and ending on various dates. The complaints are similar and
allege violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 primarily based on the
allegation that the underwriters received undisclosed
compensation in connection with the Company’s initial
public offering. On April 19, 2002, a single consolidated
amended complaint was filed, reiterating in one pleading the
allegations contained in the previously filed separate actions.
The consolidated amended complaint defines the alleged class
period as October 28, 1999 through December 6, 2000.
Although the Company believes that it has meritorious defenses
to the claims made in the complaint, an adverse resolution of
the action could have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s financial condition and results of operations in
the period in which the lawsuit is resolved. The Company is not
presently able to estimate potential losses, if any, related to
this lawsuit.

In February 2002, the Company filed suit against
Speedera Networks, Inc. (“Speedera”) in federal court
in Massachusetts, alleging patent infringement and false
advertising by Speedera. In April 2003, the Company amended its
complaint to include an allegation that Speedera infringes a
newly-issued content delivery patent held by M.I.T. and licensed
to Akamai. In response, Speedera filed a counterclaim in this
case alleging that Akamai has infringed a Speedera patent
relating to the combined provision of traffic management and
content delivery services. The Company believes that it has
meritorious defenses to the claims made in the counterclaim and
intends to contest them vigorously; however, there can be no
assurance that the Company will be successful. The Company is
not presently able to reasonably estimate potential losses, if
any, related to this counterclaim.

In June 2002, the Company filed suit against
Speedera in California Superior Court alleging theft of Akamai
trade secrets from an independent company that provides website
performance testing services. In connection with this suit, in
September 2002, the Court issued a preliminary injunction to
restrain Speedera from continuing to access the Company’s
confidential information from the independent company’s
database and from using any data obtained from such access. In
October 2002, Speedera filed a cross-claim against the Company
seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief and alleging that
the Company engaged in various unfair trade practices, made
false and misleading statements and engaged in unfair
competition. The Company believes that it has meritorious
defenses to the claims made in Speedera’s cross-claim and
intends to contest the allegations vigorously; however, there
can be no assurance that the Company will be successful. The
Company is not presently able to reasonably estimate potential
losses, if any, related to this cross-claim.

In September 2002, Teknowledge Corporation
(“Teknowledge”) filed suit in the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware against Akamai,
Cable & Wireless Internet Services and Inktomi
Corporation alleging that certain services offered by each
company infringe a Teknowledge patent relating to automatic
retrieval of changed files by a network software agent. The
Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims
made in the complaint and intends to contest the lawsuit
vigorously; however, there can be no assurance that the Company
will be successful. The Company is not presently able to
reasonably estimate potential losses, if any, related to this
lawsuit.

In November 2002, the Company filed suit against
Speedera in federal court in Massachusetts for infringement of a
patent held by Akamai. In January 2003, Speedera filed a
counterclaim in this case alleging that Akamai has infringed a
patent held by Speedera. The Company believes that it has
meritorious defenses to the claims made in the counterclaim and
intends to contest them vigorously; however, there can be no
assurance that the Company will be successful. The Company is
not presently able to reasonably estimate potential losses, if
any, related to this counterclaim.

Convertible Notes:

In June 2000, Akamai issued $300.0 million
of 5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes due July 1,
2007 for aggregate net proceeds of approximately
$290.2 million (net of initial purchaser fees and other
offering expenses of $9.8 million). The 5 1/2%
convertible subordinated notes are convertible at any time into
the Company’s common stock at a conversion price of $115.47
per share (equivalent to 8.6603 shares of common stock per
$1,000 principal amount of 5 1/2% convertible subordinated
notes), subject to adjustment in certain events. The Company may
redeem the 5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes on or
after July 3, 2003, at the Company’s option, at a
premium to par value that decreases over time. In the event of a
change of control, Akamai may be required to repurchase all or a
portion of the 5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes at a
repurchase price of 100% of the principal amount plus accrued
interest. Interest on the 5 1/2% convertible



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

subordinated notes began to accrue as of the
issue date and is payable semiannually on January 1 and
July 1 of each year, commencing on January 1, 2001.
The 5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes are unsecured
obligations and are subordinated to all existing and future
senior indebtedness of Akamai. Deferred financing costs of
$9.8 million, including underwriting fees and other
offering expenses, for the 5 1/2% convertible subordinated
notes are being amortized over the term of the notes.
Amortization of deferred financing costs was approximately
$1.4 million for each of the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

In December 2003, the Company repurchased
$74.0 million of the outstanding 5 1/2% convertible
subordinated notes for cash. Additionally, the Company signed
agreements to repurchase an additional $15.0 million of the
5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes as of
December 31, 2003. These repurchase transactions were
completed early in January 2004. (See Note 21 for further
discussion of note repurchases in 2004.) As a result of
repurchased 5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes, the
Company amortized the remaining deferred financing costs for the
repurchased $74.0 million 5 1/2% convertible
subordinated notes, totaling $1.2 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003, to loss on early extinguishment of
debt. Additionally, the Company incurred $890,000 of advisory
services in connection with the repurchases, which is included
in loss from early extinguishment of debt.

In December 2003, Akamai issued
$175.0 million of 1% convertible senior notes due
December 15, 2033 for aggregate net proceeds of
approximately $169.8 million (net of an initial purchaser
discount and other offering expenses of $5.2 million). The
1% convertible senior notes are convertible at certain times
into the Company’s common stock at an initial conversion
price of $15.45 per share (equivalent to 64.7249 shares of
common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 1% convertible
senior notes), subject to adjustment in certain events. The
Company may redeem the 1% convertible senior notes on or after
December 15, 2010 at the Company’s option at par
value. Conversely, holders of the 1% convertible senior notes
may require the Company to redeem the notes on or after
December 15, 2010. In the event of a change of control,
Akamai may be required to repurchase all or a portion of the 1%
convertible senior notes at a repurchase price of 100% of the
principal amount plus accrued interest. Interest on the 1%
convertible senior notes began to accrue as of the issue date
and is payable semiannually on June 15 and December 15
of each year, commencing on June 15, 2004. The 1%
convertible senior notes are senior unsecured obligations and
are the same rank as all existing and future senior indebtedness
of Akamai. The 1% convertible senior notes rank senior to all of
our subordinated indebtedness, including the 5 1/2%
convertible subordinated notes. Deferred financing costs of
$5.2 million, including a purchaser discount and other
offering expenses, for the 1% convertible senior notes are being
amortized over the term of the notes. Amortization of deferred
financing costs was approximately $37,000 for the period ended
December 31, 2003. The Company records the amortization of
deferred financing costs as interest expense in the consolidated
statement of operations. In January 2004, the initial purchaser
of the 1% convertible senior notes exercised an option to
purchase up to an additional $25.0 million in principal
amount of the 1% convertible senior notes at the offering price
less the initial purchase discount. The additional
$25.0 million issuance resulted in net proceeds of
$24.3 million, net of an initial purchaser discount of
approximately $700,000. (See Note 21.)

11.

Restructurings and Lease
    Terminations:

During the year ended December 31, 2003, the
Company recorded restructuring benefits of $8.5 million,
including a $9.6 million reversal of previously accrued
restructuring liabilities as a result of amendments to and
terminations of facility leases, offset by a restructuring
charge of $1.1 million for costs relating to the
restructuring of a facility located in Europe.

In April 2003, the Company amended its lease
obligation for a substantially vacant facility in Santa Clara,
California. Under the terms of the amendment, the Company made a
payment of $9.4 million. The total payment also included
the release of $5.7 million in restricted cash. As a result
of this amended lease agreement, the Company reversed
$9.2 million of previously accrued restructuring
liabilities. The Company continued to pay rent at the previously
contracted rate through the end of 2003. Beginning in January
2004,



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

rent will be reduced to a lower rate
substantially aligned with market rates in the area. The amended
lease is scheduled to terminate in August 2007. As of
December 31, 2003, the remaining restructuring liability
related to this facility was $5.0 million. As the Company
makes the remaining contractual rent payments allocable to the
vacated space, this liability will be reduced. The Company is
actively seeking a subtenant for this space. The Company has
estimated no sublease income for this facility due to the market
conditions in the area.

In May 2003, the Company terminated its lease for
a facility located in the United Kingdom for a fee of
approximately $700,000. In connection with this lease
termination, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of
$1.1 million for costs related to the termination fee and
the write-off of long-lived assets and long-term deposits, of
which $144,000 represents a non-cash restructuring charge for
impairments of leasehold improvements and other long-lived
assets. The Company has relocated its operations in the United
Kingdom to a smaller facility.

In June 2003, the Company terminated its
long-term lease for its San Mateo, California facility for a
payment of $6.0 million and entered into a new lease for
60% less space in this facility. As a result of this terminated
lease, the Company reversed $400,000 of previously recorded
restructuring liabilities. Of the $6.0 million payment,
$1.1 million was recorded as a prepayment for the remaining
utilized space and is being amortized over the remaining term of
the original lease. The Company had previously accrued a
restructuring liability for the vacant portion of the original
lease. The new lease is scheduled to expire in May 2008. Rent
payments under the new lease are lower than under the original
lease, and are more in line with current market rates.

During the year ended December 31, 2002, the
Company recorded restructuring charges of $45.8 million.
These charges included $3.6 million for employee severance
benefit costs and $42.2 million for facility leases;
representing restructuring charges of $39.0 million for the
actual and estimated termination and modification costs, less
estimated sublease income, for lease facilities and a
$3.2 million impairment of leasehold improvements and
furniture and fixtures related to the these facilities. During
the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recorded
restructuring charges of $40.5 million. These charges
included $5.1 million for severance benefit costs and
$35.4 million for facility leases.

The following table summarizes the accrual and
usage of the restructuring charges (in millions):



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The amount of restructuring liabilities
associated with facility leases has been estimated based on the
most recent available market data and discussions with the
Company’s lessors and real estate advisors as to the
likelihood that the Company will be able to partially offset its
obligations with sublease income.

Rights Plan and Series A Junior
    Participating Preferred Stock:

On September 10, 2002, the Board of
Directors of the Company declared a dividend of one preferred
stock purchase right for each outstanding share of the
Company’s common stock held by stockholders of record at
the close of business on September 23, 2002. To implement
the rights plan, the Board of Directors designated 700,000
shares of the Company’s 5.0 million authorized shares
of undesignated preferred stock as Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per share. Each
right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the
Company one one-thousandth of a share of preferred stock at a
purchase price of $9.00 in cash, subject to adjustment. No
shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock are
outstanding as of December 31, 2003. In January 2004, the
Board of Directors of the Company approved an amendment to the
rights plan in which the purchase price of each right issued
under the plan increased from $9.00 per share to $65.00 per
share.

13.

Stockholders’ Deficit:

Common Stock

Holders of the Company’s common stock are
entitled to one vote per share. At December 31, 2003, the
Company had reserved approximately 21.2 million shares of
common stock for issuance under its Employee Stock Purchase Plan
and upon the exercise of options, warrants and deferred stock
units under its other stock plans. At December 31, 2003,
the Company had reserved for issuance 13.3 million shares
of common stock for the potential conversion of its
5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes and
1% convertible senior notes.

Notes Receivable for Stock

restricted common stock, the Company received full recourse
notes from its former Chief Financial Officer and Vice President
of Business Development in the amounts of $2,620,000 and
$624,000, respectively. On December 31, 2001, the notes
issued by the Vice President of Business Development and the
former Chief Financial Officer were each amended and replaced
with new full recourse notes in the amounts of $721,000 and
$2,619,750. These new notes bore a rate of interest of 3.97% per

Development. The remaining $531,000 due on the note was paid in
full in December 2003. The Company recorded the forgiveness of
both of these notes receivable of $1.2 million as

Stock Plans:

In 1998, the Board of Directors adopted the 1998
Stock Incentive Plan (the “1998 Plan”) for the
issuance of incentive and nonqualified stock options and
restricted stock awards. Options to purchase common stock and
restricted stock awards are granted at the discretion of the
Board of Directors and in certain circumstances a committee
designated by the Board of Directors. In December 2001, the
Board of Directors adopted the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan (the
“2001 Plan”) for the issuance of nonqualified stock
options and restricted stock awards. The total number of shares
of common stock reserved for issuance under the 1998 Plan and
the 2001 Plan is 41,255,600 and 5,000,000 shares, respectively.
Equity incentives may not be issued to the Company’s
directors or executive officers under the 2001 Plan.



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Under the terms of the 1998 Plan, the exercise
price of incentive stock options granted must not be less than
100% (110% in certain cases) of the fair market value of the
common stock on the date of grant, as determined by the Board of
Directors. Incentive stock options may not be issued under the
2001 Plan. The exercise price of nonqualified stock options
issued under the 1998 Plan and the 2001 Plan may be less than
the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant,
as determined by the Board of Directors, but in no case may the
exercise price be less than the statutory minimum. Stock option
vesting is typically four years and is at the discretion of the
Board of Directors. The term of options granted may not exceed
ten years, or five years for incentive stock options granted to
holders of more than 10% of the voting stock of the Company.

Restricted stock awards may be issued under the
1998 Plan to directors, officers, advisors and employees at
prices determined by the Board of Directors. Participants’
unvested shares are subject to repurchase by the Company at the
original purchase price for between two and four years.
Generally, 25% of the shares vest between six months and one
year of the date of purchase and, thereafter, the remaining
shares vest on a quarterly basis through the fourth anniversary
date of purchase. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had
the right to repurchase up to 466,892 unvested shares at prices
ranging from $0.00 to $0.01 per share.

The Company has assumed certain stock option
plans and the outstanding stock options of companies that it has
acquired (“Assumed Plans”). Stock options under the
Assumed Plans have been converted into the Company’s stock
options and adjusted to effect the appropriate conversion ratio
as specified by the applicable acquisition agreement, but are
otherwise administered in accordance with the terms of the
Assumed Plans. Stock options under the Assumed Plans generally
vest over four years and expire ten years from the date of
grant. No additional stock options will be granted under the
Assumed Plans.

A summary of restricted stock award activity
under the 1998 Plan for the years ended December 31, 2001,
2002 and 2003 is presented below:

There were 31,282,100 and 20,458 shares of
restricted common stock issued outside of the 1998 Plan during

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In August 1999, the Board of Directors adopted
the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(“1999 ESPP”). The Company reserved
600,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the
1999 ESPP. In May 2001, the Company approved an increase to
the amount of shares reserved for issuance under the
1999 ESPP to 3,100,000. In May 2002, the stockholders of
the Company approved an amendment to the 1999 ESPP that allows
for an automatic increase in the number of shares of common
stock available under the 1999 ESPP each June 1 and
December 1 to restore the number of shares available for
issuance to 1.5 million shares, provided that the aggregate
number of shares issuable under the 1999 ESPP shall not
exceed 20,000,000. The 1999 ESPP provides for a two-year
offering period that includes four six-month purchase periods
and allows participating employees to purchase shares of common
stock at a 15% discount from the market value of the stock as
determined on specific dates at six-month intervals. As of
December 31, 2003, approximately $475,000 had been withheld
from employees for future purchases under the 1999 ESPP.

Equity-Related Compensation

For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002
and 2001, the Company recorded equity-related compensation of
$9.8 million, $21.2 million and $31.5 million,
respectively. These amounts are included in the consolidated
statement of operations as follows (in thousands):

Equity-related compensation is comprised of the
amortization of deferred compensation, equity award
modifications, equity bonuses, equity awards issued to
non-employees and employees and the forgiveness of notes
receivable issued in connection with the sale of restricted
common stock (see Note 13).

(a)     Deferred
Compensation:

Deferred compensation is recorded for the grant
of stock awards or shares of restricted stock to employees or
non-employees at exercise or sale prices deemed to be less than
the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the grant
date. Deferred compensation is adjusted to reflect cancellations
and forfeitures due to employee terminations. For the years
ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, equity-related
compensation includes $7.9 million, $18.1 million and
$23.2 million, respectively, of deferred compensation
amortization. Equity-related compensation for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was affected by the
following:

Exchange Offer

In April 2001, the Company communicated to its
employees an offer to exchange (the “Exchange Offer”)
certain eligible employee stock options previously granted to
them in return for restricted shares of Akamai common stock at
an exchange ratio of two stock options for one share of
restricted stock. In addition, certain stock options granted in
February 2001 were eligible to be exchanged at a ratio of one
stock option for two shares of restricted stock. Employees who
accepted the Exchange Offer were required to exchange any stock
option granted to them after November 3, 2000 (regardless
of the exercise price of any such stock option) and to forfeit
certain stock options granted to them in October 2000. Until the
restricted stock vests, such shares are subject to forfeiture
for up to three years from May 2001 in the event the employee
leaves the Company. Generally, 25% of the shares vested after
six months and the remaining 75% of the shares vest



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

quarterly thereafter until the third anniversary
of the effective date of the Exchange Offer. On April 4,
2001, the Company filed the Exchange Offer as a tender offer
with the Securities and Exchange Commission in accordance with
Rule 13e-4 of the Securities Act of 1934, as amended. The
Exchange Offer was effective on May 5, 2001, and the
Company accepted all stock options tendered.

As a result of the Exchange Offer, stock options
to purchase approximately 6.6 million shares of Akamai
common stock were exchanged for approximately 3.4 million
shares of restricted stock. In accordance with FASB
Interpretation No. 44, “Accounting for Certain
Transactions Involving Stock Compensation, an Interpretation of
APB Opinion No. 25,” the Company recorded
$36.1 million as deferred compensation for the intrinsic
value of the restricted stock issued to employees who accepted
the Exchange Offer. The deferred compensation is being amortized
over the vesting period of the restricted stock. For the years
ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, $3.9 million,
$5.9 million and $10.2 million, respectively, were
amortized to equity-related compensation. As of
December 31, 2003, 1.4 million shares had been
forfeited and retired as a result of employee terminations,
resulting in a reduction in deferred compensation of
$14.4 million.

Restricted Stock and Stock Option
    Awards

During the year ended December 31, 2002, the
Company issued 275,000 shares of restricted stock to officers in
exchange for the cancellation of previously issued stock
options. The Company recorded deferred compensation of $278,000
for the intrinsic value of the restricted stock, which will be
amortized over the vesting period. The Company had amortized
$136,000 and $26,000 to equity-related compensation for these
awards during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

During the year ended December 31, 2001,
deferred compensation was increased by $15.1 million as a
result of the issuance of 2.2 million shares of restricted
common stock at a purchase price of $0.01 per share and the
grant of options to purchase 53,000 shares of common stock at an
exercise price of $1.17 per share. The deferred
compensation will be amortized over the vesting periods of the
equity awards. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002
and 2001, $1.1 million, $5.0 million and
$3.7 million, respectively, have been amortized to
equity-related compensation for these awards. As of
December 31, 2003, 855,000 shares had been repurchased and
retired by the Company as a result of employee terminations,
resulting in a reduction in deferred compensation of
approximately $185,000, $1.4 million and $452,000,
respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002
and 2001, respectively.

(b)     Equity Award
Modifications:

Equity-related compensation includes the
intrinsic value of modified stock options or restricted stock
awards that would have expired as unexercisable had the
associated vesting of the awards not been accelerated upon the
termination of the employee. For the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, equity-related
compensation includes approximately $107,000, $3.2 million
and $5.2 million, respectively, for equity award
modifications.

(c)     Equity Bonus
Awards:

Equity-related compensation includes the
intrinsic value of equity awards issued to employees as
incentive bonuses. These awards are issued quarterly and
annually in accordance with incentive bonus plans. No equity
bonus awards were granted in 2003. For the years ended
December 31, 2002 and 2001, equity-related compensation
includes $1.4 million and $3.1 million, respectively,
for equity bonuses. Equity bonuses in 2002 consisted of the
grant of options to purchase 1.4 million shares of common
stock at a weighted average exercise price of $0.47. Equity
bonuses in 2001 consisted of the issuance of 284,000 shares of
restricted common stock at a purchase price of $0.01 per share
and the grant of options to purchase 175,000 shares of common
stock at a weighted average exercise price of $1.09.



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(d)     Equity Awards
Issued to Non-Employees:

The Company has issued equity awards to advisors
and other non-employees. The Company recognizes the fair value
of these awards in equity-related compensation over the vesting
period for the awards pursuant to the requirements of SFAS
No. 123.

In August 2003, the Company granted 30,000
deferred stock units (“DSUs”) under the Company’s
1998 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, to each of the five
non-employee members of its Board of Directors. Each DSU
represents the right to receive one share of the Company’s
common stock upon vesting. The DSUs vest in three equal annual
installments over the three-year period following the grant
date, so long as the holder continues to provide service as a
director of the Company. The holder may elect to defer receipt
of all or a portion of the vested shares of stock represented by
the DSU for a period for at least one year, but not more than
ten years from the grant date. During 2003, the Company has
recorded deferred compensation of $615,000 for the intrinsic
value of the DSUs. The deferred compensation will be recognized
as compensation expense over the expected three-year vesting
period. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had amortized
approximately $70,000 to equity-related compensation for these
awards.

During 2003, certain employees terminated their
employment with Akamai but continued to provide services to the
Company as consultants. Despite the employees’ change in
status, outstanding equity awards held by such individuals will
vest in accordance with the terms of their original agreements
or amendments thereto. The Company began measuring and
recognizing the fair value of the outstanding awards commencing
upon the change in the individual’s employment status.
During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company
recorded $503,000 of compensation expense related to equity
awards held by all non-employees. Additionally, during 2003, the
Company recorded $244,000 of compensation expense for modified
restricted stock awards that would have expired as unexercisable
had the associated vesting of the awards not been accelerated
upon the termination of the non-employee’s service contract.

Warrants

Prior to its initial public offering in October
1999, the Company issued warrants to investors in connection
with borrowings. The Company also became obligated to honor
warrants that had been issued by acquired businesses.

During 2003, warrant holders acquired
506,736 shares of common stock through warrant exercises.
In lieu of the exercise price of these warrants, the holders
surrendered to Akamai additional warrants to purchase 447,462
shares of common stock as consideration. These transactions were
in accordance with the terms of the original warrant agreements.
The Company recorded the exercise price of these warrants to
common stock and additional paid-in capital at par value of
$0.01. As of December 31, 2003, there were 76,638
outstanding warrants to purchase common stock at a per share
exercise price range of $2.50 to $151.08 exercisable through
December 2004. These outstanding warrants are fully vested.

15.     Employee
Benefit Plan:

In January 1999, the Company established a
savings plan for its employees that is designed to be qualified
under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Eligible
employees are permitted to contribute to the 401(k) plan through
payroll deductions within statutory and plan limits.
Participants may select from a variety of investment options.
Investment options do not include Akamai common stock. The
Company, at its discretion, provides limited matching of
employee contributions to the 401(k) plan. The Company did not
make any matching contributions to the 401(k) plan for the year
ended December 31, 2003. The Company contributed
approximately $586,000 and $826,000 of cash to the savings plan
for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The Company’s contributions vest 25% per
annum. The Company does not expect to make a matching
contribution for the year ending December 31, 2004.

Taxes:

The provision for income taxes consists of the
following (in thousands):

The Company’s effective rate varies from the
statutory rate as follows:

Significant components of the Company’s
deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 are
shown below. In accordance with SFAS No. 109,
“Accounting for Income Taxes”, a valuation allowance

uncertainty surrounding its realization. The components of the
net deferred tax asset and the related valuation allowance are
as follows (in thousands):

As of December 31, 2003, the Company had
federal and state net operating losses of $1,195 million
that expire at various dates through 2023. The Company also had
foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$11.2 million; of these, $8.3 million have no

carryforwards of $8.5 million; of these,
$6.8 million have no expiration and $1.7 million will
expire at various dates through 2007. The Company also has
federal and state tax credit carryforwards as of
December 31, 2003 and 2002 of approximately
$10.5 million and $9.3 million, respectively, that
expire at various dates through 2023. Pursuant to Internal
Revenue Code Sections 382 and 383, use of the
Company’s acquired net operating loss and credit
carryforwards may be subject to annual limitation due to a
change in ownership of more than 50%.

Approximately $174 million of the net
operating loss carryforwards available for federal income tax
purposes relate to the exercises of non-qualified stock options
and disqualifying disposition of incentive stock options and
employee stock purchase plan options, the tax benefit from
which, if realized, will be credited to additional paid-in
capital.

17.     Transactions
with Related Parties:

During the years ended December 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001, the Company recognized revenue from related
parties as follows (in thousands):

The Company formed Akamai Australia in August
2002 as a joint venture with ES Group Ventures Pty Ltd
(“ES Ventures”). The Company owned 40% of Akamai
Australia and accounted for its investment under the equity
method. No losses of the joint venture were recognized because
Akamai’s basis in its investment in Akamai Australia was
zero. Upon inception of the joint venture, the Company entered
into a five-year distribution agreement with Akamai Australia
under which Akamai Australia was required to make quarterly
payments to the Company in accordance with minimum resale
commitments. In June 2003, Akamai and ES Ventures
terminated the joint venture. In accordance with the termination
agreement, Akamai removed its representatives from the joint
venture’s board of directors and surrendered its 40%
interest in the entity. ES Ventures agreed to wind down the
affairs of the joint venture and was responsible for settling
all of the joint venture’s obligations. The distribution
agreement was terminated, and Akamai forgave all amounts due
under the agreement. The Company purchased all customer
contracts from the former joint venture for a fee of $472,000
and will continue to service these customers. The fee was
recorded as an asset and was fully amortized against the revenue
of these customers during fiscal year 2003.

In December 2002, Akamai sold its 40% equity
interest in Akamai Technologies Japan K.K., formerly a joint
venture between Akamai and SBBM. For the year ended
December 31, 2002, the Company recognized $4.1 million
under a reseller agreement with Akamai Technologies Japan K.K.
Akamai also recognized $4.8 million under a technology
license agreement with SBBM during the year ended
December 31, 2002 which was considered a related party at
the time the revenue was recognized due to SBBM’s
relationship with Akamai Technologies Japan K.K. In January
2003, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary in Japan
through which it sells Akamai services and supports its reseller
relationships. As of December 31, 2002, $1.1 million
was due from Akamai Technologies Japan K.K. and is included in
due from related parties on the consolidated balance sheet as of
that date. This amount was paid in January 2003.

From January 2001 to November 2002, the Company
held a 40% equity interest in Sockeye Networks, Inc., which was
accounted for under the equity method. During this period, the
Company recognized $2.0 million of equity method losses,
which are included in loss on investments for the year ended
December 31, 2001. In November 2002, the Company significantly
reduced its equity interest in Sockeye and, as of



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

March 31, 2003, there was no longer an
Akamai representative serving on Sockeye’s board of
directors. As of September 30, 2003, the Company accounted
for this investment under the cost method due to the significant
reduction in ownership interest. In October 2003, Sockeye was
acquired by Internap Network Services Corporation. Akamai did
not receive any cash or other consideration as a result of the
merger and no longer holds any equity interest in Sockeye or its
successor.

18.     CNN
Advertising Agreement:

In November 1999, InterVu, which was acquired by
Akamai in April 2000, entered into an advertising agreement with
the CNN News Group (“CNN”). Under the terms of such
agreement, InterVu issued common stock valued at
$20.0 million to CNN. In return, CNN agreed to provide
InterVu with three years of on-air and online advertising and
promotional opportunities across CNN’s properties. As part
of the purchase price allocation for its acquisition of InterVu,
Akamai estimated the fair value of these services to be
$18.4 million. This prepaid asset has been amortized over
the life of the advertising agreement to advertising expense in
the amounts of $5.6 million for each of the years ended
December 31, 2002 and 2001. This prepaid asset was fully
amortized as of December 31, 2002.

In connection with its acquisition of InterVu,
Akamai issued shares of its common stock to CNN in exchange for
shares of InterVu common stock held by CNN and assumed certain
obligations relating to such shares, including a guarantee that
the price of the shares of Akamai common stock would be above a
specified price on the third anniversary of the advertising
agreement. At the time of the acquisition of InterVu, the
Company estimated the fair value of the price guarantee and
included the estimated value of the guarantee in the purchase
price of InterVu. In November 2002, the Company satisfied the
price guarantee through a cash payment to CNN of
$2.7 million and by allowing CNN to draw on a
$3.8 million letter of credit. The $6.5 million
payment is considered a component of the purchase price of
InterVu and was accounted for as an adjustment, through a
reduction in additional paid-in capital, to the fair value of
the common stock issued.

19.     Segment
Disclosure:

Akamai’s chief decision-maker, as defined
under SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures About Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information,” is the Chief Executive
Officer and the executive management team. As of
December 31, 2003, Akamai operated in one business segment:
providing e-business infrastructure services and software.

The Company deploys its servers into networks
worldwide. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had
approximately $21.3 million and $2.6 million of
property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, located
in the United States and foreign locations, respectively. As of
December 31, 2002, the Company had approximately
$49.5 million and $13.7 million of net property and
equipment located in the United States and foreign locations,
respectively. Akamai sells its services and licenses through a
direct sales force located both domestically and abroad. For the
years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, approximately 16%
and 13%, respectively, of revenue was derived from the
Company’s operations outside the United States, of which
13% and 10%, respectively, relates to Europe. No single country
accounted for 10% or more of revenue derived outside of the
United States. For 2001, less than 10% of revenue was derived
from sources outside of the United States.

20.     Quarterly
Financial Results (unaudited):

The following table sets forth certain unaudited
quarterly results of operations of the Company for the years
ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. In the opinion of
management, this information has been prepared on the same basis

necessary adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring
adjustments, have been included in the amounts stated below for
a fair presentation of the quarterly information when read in

operations to include in cost of revenue equity-related
compensation expense, based on the functional role of the
related employee, and depreciation and amortization on its
network equipment. All quarterly amounts presented below reflect
this modification. In addition, in accordance with SFAS
No. 142, the Company discontinued the amortization of
goodwill as of January 1, 2002.

21.     Subsequent
Events

In January 2004, the initial purchaser of the 1%
convertible senior notes exercised its option to purchase an
additional $25.0 million in principal amount of the notes
for a payment of $24.3 million, which reflected a purchase
discount of 2.75% to the initial purchaser of the notes.

In January 2004, in a limited number of
individually negotiated transactions, the Company repurchased an
aggregate of $25.0 million in principal amount of its
outstanding 5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes. As of
December 31, 2003, the Company had entered into agreements
for the repurchase of $15.0 million in principal amount of
these repurchased notes. As a result, as of December 31,
2003, the Company has recorded $15.0 million of these notes
as current portion of 5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes.

In February 2004, the Company commenced a tender
offer to repurchase up to an additional $101.0 million in
aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 5 1/2%
convertible subordinated notes. Under the modified Dutch Auction
structure of the tender offer, the Company will repurchase up to
$101.0 million in principal amount of validly tendered
5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes at a purchase price
between $1,000 and $1,005 for each $1,000 in principal amount
tendered. The tender offer is subject to numerous conditions.
The tender offer period is expected to expire on March 10,
2004.
