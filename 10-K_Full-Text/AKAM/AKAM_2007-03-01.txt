Overview

Akamai provides services for accelerating and improving the
    delivery of content and applications over the Internet from live
    and on-demand streaming videos to conventional content on web
    pages to tools that help people transact business. Our solutions
    are designed to help businesses, government agencies and other
    enterprises enhance their revenue streams and reduce costs by
    maximizing the performance of their online businesses. By
    advancing the performance and reliability of their websites, our
    customers can improve visitor experiences and increase the
    effectiveness of their Web-based campaigns and operations.
    Through the Akamai EdgePlatform, the technological platform for
    Akamai’s business solutions, our customers are able to
    utilize Akamai’s infrastructure and reduce expenses
    associated with internal infrastructure

build-ups.

We were incorporated in Delaware in 1998 and have our corporate
    headquarters at 8 Cambridge Center, Cambridge, Massachusetts. We
    have been offering content delivery services and streaming media
    services since 1999. In subsequent years, we have introduced
    technology that enables Web-based delivery of applications, such
    as

store/dealer

locators and user registration, over our network; content
    targeting technology; enhanced security features; and analytical
    tools that provide our customers with information about visitors
    to their websites. During 2005, we began commercial sales of our
    Web Application Accelerator service, which is designed to
    improve the performance of Web- and

IP-based

applications through a combination of dynamic caching,
    compression of large packets, routing and connection
    optimization.

Significant developments for us in 2006 included J.D. Sherman
    becoming our Chief Financial Officer in March. In June 2006, we
    formally introduced our suite of Dynamic Site Solutions, which
    are designed to accelerate delivery of

business-to-consumer

websites that integrate rich, collaborative content and
    applications into their online architecture. In December 2006,
    we acquired Nine Systems Corporation, or Nine Systems, which has
    allowed us to offer additional rich media management tools such
    as publishing and digital rights management.

We are registered as a reporting company under the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which we refer to as the
    Exchange Act. Accordingly, we file or furnish with the
    Securities and Exchange Commission, or the Commission, annual
    reports on

Form 10-K,

quarterly reports on

Form 10-Q

and current reports on

Form 8-K

as required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of
    the Commission. We refer to these reports as Periodic Reports.
    The public may read and copy any Periodic Reports or other
    materials we file with the Commission at the Commission’s
    Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549.
    Information on the operation of the Public Reference Room is
    available by calling

1-800-SEC-0330.

In addition, the Commission maintains an Internet website that
    contains reports, proxy and information statements and other
    information regarding issuers, such as Akamai, that file
    electronically with the Commission. The address of this website
    is

http://www.sec.gov.

Our Internet website address is www.akamai.com. We make
    available, free of charge, on or through our Internet website
    our Periodic Reports and amendments to those Periodic Reports as
    soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file them
    with the Commission. We are not, however, including the
    information contained on our website, or information that may be
    accessed through links on our website, as part of, or
    incorporating it by reference into, this annual report on

Form 10-K.



Meeting
    the Challenges of the Internet

The Internet plays a crucial role in the way companies,
    government agencies and other entities conduct business and
    reach the public. The Internet, however, is a complex system of
    networks that was not originally created to accommodate the
    volume or sophistication of today’s communication demands.
    As a result, information is frequently delayed or lost on its
    way through the Internet due to many challenges, including:

•

bandwidth constraints between an end user and the end
    user’s network provider, such as an Internet Service
    Provider, or ISP, cable provider or digital subscriber line
    provider;

•

Internet traffic exceeding the capacity of routing equipment;

•

the increase in the transmission of rich content due to the
    increasingly widespread use of broadband connectivity to the
    Internet for videos, music and games;

•

inefficient or nonfunctioning peering points, or points of
    connection, between ISPs; and

•

traffic congestion at data centers.

In addition to the challenges inherent in the Internet,
    companies and other entities face internal technology
    challenges. Driven by competition, globalization and
    cost-containment strategies, companies need an agile
    Internet-facing infrastructure that cost-effectively meets
    real-time strategic and business objectives. For example, many
    companies use the Internet as a key marketing tool for product
    launches, distribution of promotional videos or contests. These
    one-time events may draw millions of visitors to a
    company’s website over a brief period of time so the
    enterprise must have in place the capacity to deal with a flood
    of visitors seeking to view content or use applications. At the
    same time, budget limitations may preclude a company from
    putting in place extensive internal infrastructure knowing that
    it will handle less traffic during the rest of the year.

To address these challenges, we have developed solutions that
    are designed to help companies, government agencies and other
    enterprises increase revenues and reduce costs by improving the
    performance, reliability and security of their Internet-facing
    operations. We particularly seek to address the following market
    needs:

Superior Performance.

Commercial enterprises
    invest in websites to attract customers, transact business and
    provide information about themselves. If, however, a
    company’s Internet site fails to provide visitors with a
    fast and dependable experience, they will likely abandon that
    site, potentially leading to lost revenues and damage to the
    enterprise’s reputation. Our solutions are designed to
    reduce or eliminate downtime and poor performance of a
    customer’s Website, digital media and applications. Through
    a combination of people, processes and technology, we help our
    customers improve the reliability, scalability and
    predictability of their sites without the need for our customers
    to spend a lot of money to develop their own Internet-related
    infrastructure. Instead, we have a presence in nearly 1,000
    networks around the world so that content can be delivered from
    Akamai servers located closer to website visitors —
    from what we call, the “edge” of the Internet. We are
    thus able to reduce the impact of traffic congestion, bandwidth
    constraints and capacity limitations. At the same time, our
    customers have access to control features to enable them to
    provide content to end users that is current and customized for
    visitors accessing the site from different parts of the world.

Scalability.

We believe that scalability is
    one of the keys to reliability. Many Akamai customers experience
    seasonal or erratic demand for access to their websites and
    almost all websites experience demand peaks at different points
    during the day. With the proliferation of Internet video,
    enterprises of all types must be able to cope with rapidly
    increasing numbers of requests for bandwidth-intensive digital
    media assets and the storage of them. In all of these instances,
    it can be difficult and expensive to plan for, and deploy
    solutions to meet such peaks and valleys. Leveraging more
    than 20,000 servers deployed worldwide, our network is
    designed with the robustness and flexibility to handle planned
    and unplanned traffic peaks and related storage needs, without
    additional hardware investment and configuration on the part of
    our customers. As a result, we are able to provide an on demand
    solution to address our customers’ capacity needs in the
    face of unpredictable traffic spikes, which helps them avoid
    expensive investment in a centralized infrastructure.

Security.

Security may be the most significant
    challenge facing use of the Internet for business and government
    processes because security threats — in the form of
    attacks, viruses, worms and intrusions — can



impact every measure of performance, including information
    security, speed, reliability and customer confidence. Unlike
    traditional security strategies that can negatively impact
    performance, Akamai’s EdgePlatform is designed to allow for
    proactive monitoring and rapid response to security incidents
    and anomalies. We rely on both built-in defense mechanisms and
    the ability to route traffic around potential security issues so
    performance is not compromised. Perhaps most significantly, our
    distributed network of thousands of servers is designed to
    eliminate a single point of failure and can reduce the impact of
    security attacks.

Our
    Solutions

We offer services and solutions for digital media distribution
    and storage, content and application delivery, application
    performance services, on demand managed services and website
    intelligence. We have developed three business solutions to
    offer our customers a comprehensive suite of services and to
    meet their specific Internet-related goals: Digital Asset
    Solutions, Dynamic Site Solutions and Application Performance
    Solutions. In addition, our customers can also purchase
    on-demand managed services, site intelligence offerings and
    custom solutions designed for individual customer needs.

Digital
    Asset Solutions

Akamai’s Digital Asset Solutions leverage the core content
    delivery services that we have offered since the company was
    formed. These services are designed to enable enterprises to
    improve the end-user experience, boost reliability and
    scalability and reduce the cost of Internet-related
    infrastructure. Within the Digital Asset Solutions, customers
    can choose from the following:

Akamai
    Media Delivery Solution

We believe that the demand for Internet access to media of all
    types — music, movies, games, streaming news, sports
    events, and social networking communities — is growing
    rapidly; however, there are many challenges to profitably
    offering media assets online, particularly with respect to
    user-generated content. In particular, media companies need
    cost-effective means to deliver large files to millions of users
    in different formats compatible with multiple end-user devices
    and platforms. The Akamai Media Delivery Solution is designed to
    provide a solution to many of the challenges of media delivery
    over the Internet by helping media industry companies bypass
    traditional server and bandwidth limitations to better handle
    peak traffic conditions and large file sizes. We support all
    major streaming formats, and our EdgePlatform provides capacity
    levels that individual enterprises may not be able to
    cost-effectively replicate on their own.

Our Akamai Media Delivery Solution is primarily used by
    companies in the following industries: entertainment, including
    television, radio, sports, music and media; gaming and social
    networking; and Internet search/portal access. The solution can
    accommodate the many different business models used by our
    customers including

pay-per-view,

subscription, advertising and syndication.

Akamai
    Electronic Software Delivery Solution

Due to the expanding prevalence of broadband access,
    distribution of computer software is increasingly occurring over
    the Internet. Internet traffic conditions and high loads can
    dramatically impact software download speed and reliability.
    Furthermore, surges in traffic from product launches or
    distribution of security updates can overwhelm traditional
    centralized software delivery infrastructure, impacting website
    performance and causing users to be unable to download software.
    Our Electronic Software Delivery Solution is designed to
    leverage the Akamai EdgePlatform to provide capacity for large
    surges in traffic related to software launches and other
    distributions with a goal of improved customer experiences,
    increased use of electronic delivery and successful product
    launches. This solution is appropriate for software companies of
    all types including consumer, enterprise, anti-virus and gaming.

Akamai
    EdgeSuite Delivery Solution

Through our
    EdgeSuite

®

delivery service, we can accelerate the delivery of our
    customers’ websites over the Internet by making their
    content accessible across our international network of servers.
    This distributed



performance model is intended to provide our customers with a
    more efficient way to implement and maintain a global Internet
    presence. While site owners maintain a source copy of their
    content and applications, EdgeSuite provides global delivery,
    load balancing and storage of content and applications, enabling
    businesses to focus valuable resources on strategic matters,
    rather than technical infrastructure issues. This solution is
    appropriate for any enterprise that has a website.

Customers of our Digital Asset Solutions also have access to
    advanced service features such as:

•

Secure Content Distribution

— distribution of
    secure Internet-related content using Secure Sockets Layer
    transport, a protocol to secure transmission of content over the
    Internet, to ensure that content is distributed privately and
    reliably between two communicating applications.

•

Site Failover

— delivery of default content in
    the event that the primary, or source, version of the website of
    a customer becomes unavailable.

•

Disaster Recovery

— a backup web presence if an
    unforeseen event causes a website to crash.

•

Net Storage

— an efficient solution for digital
    storage needs for all content types.

•

Content Targeting

— a feature that enables
    content providers to deliver localized content, customized
    store-fronts, targeted advertising and adaptive marketing.

Dynamic
    Site Solutions

Akamai’s Dynamic Site Solutions are designed for
    accelerating

business-to-consumer

websites that integrate rich, collaborative content and
    applications into their online architecture. In particular, our
    services inter-operate with dynamic software applications such
    as AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) and Macromedia
    Flash

®

.
    Significant features of the Dynamic Site Solutions offering
    include:

•

Cache Optimization

— these features are
    designed to enhance the cacheability of content including
    setting

time-to-live

values, header modification, path modification and downstream
    caching.

•

Compression

— compression of content before it
    is sent to an end user so as to reduce transfer times for users
    on slow connections, particularly for transactional content.

•

Capacity On-Demand

— offers dynamic
    load-balancing decisions that are based on real-time analysis of
    an end user’s location, Internet conditions and server and
    data center infrastructure capacity and load.

Our Dynamic Site Solutions are primarily purchased by retail and
    travel companies for their commerce-related websites as well as
    enterprises that rely on the Internet for brand-building through
    research and discussion tools for their current and potential
    customers.

Application
    Performance Solutions

Akamai’s Application Performance Solutions combine services
    and features that are designed to improve the performance of
    highly dynamic content common on corporate extranets and wide
    area networks. Traditionally, this market has been addressed
    primarily by hardware and software products. We believe our
    managed service approach offers a more cost-effective and
    comprehensive solution in this area without requiring customers
    to make significant infrastructure investments. In addition to
    reducing infrastructure costs, our Application Performance
    Solutions are designed to allow our customers to offer more
    effective and reliable portal applications and other Web-based
    systems for communicating with their customers, employees and
    business partners.

Our Web Application Accelerator service is designed to improve
    the performance of Web- and

IP-based

applications through a combination of dynamic caching,
    compression, routing and connection optimization. This service
    is appropriate for companies involved in technology, business
    services, travel and leisure, manufacturing and other industries
    where there is a movement to Internet-based communication with
    remote customers, suppliers and franchisees. Enterprise
    customers are using the Web Application Accelerator services to
    run applications such as online airline reservations systems,
    course planning tools, customer order processing and human
    resources applications. By tying such applications to the Akamai
    EdgePlatform, enterprise customers and their remote



customers, suppliers and franchisees can enjoy improved
    performance through connection and route optimization techniques
    that avoid problem spots on the Internet and otherwise
    accelerate delivery of applications without having to undertake
    significant internal infrastructure build-out.

Other
    Solutions

On
    Demand Managed Services

Akamai’s on demand managed services, including our
    EdgeComputing and on demand application offerings, enable
    enterprises to reduce the need for an internal infrastructure to
    handle unpredictable levels of Internet traffic. With access to
    our network, customers are able to rapidly launch and deploy new
    applications worldwide, with on demand availability and
    scalability on a cost-effective basis. For example, Akamai On
    Demand Events provides an on demand platform for running
    promotional websites — through Macromedia
    Flash

®

promotions, site search, sweepstakes, polls, regional offers or
    other innovative applications that create a positive brand
    experience.

Akamai’s EdgeComputing service enables enterprises to
    deliver Java (J2EE) Web applications that scale on demand and
    are designed to perform faster and more reliably worldwide than
    a customer’s own internal information technology, or IT,
    infrastructure. At the same time, our on demand services are
    designed to accelerate the performance of customers’
    applications, which reduces the demands on our customers’
    IT infrastructures and simplifies their support requirements. By
    enabling our customers’ Internet-based applications that
    they rely on to improve promotion and sales, customer service,
    and vendor and partner management, we can help them to be better
    positioned to compete more effectively online and reduce
    business costs.

Site
    Intelligence Offerings

Akamai’s offerings in this area include our network data
    feeds and our Web analytics offering, which provide customers
    with real time data about the performance of their content and
    applications over the Internet and on the EdgePlatform. In
    addition, our business performance management services help
    customers better understand their Web operations through
    relevant, timely information with tools that measure all aspects
    of an application’s performance. For example, a customer
    could use website data feeds from Akamai’s customer portal
    to assist in managing costs and budget. The core of these
    offerings lies in our EdgeControl tools, which provide
    comprehensive reporting and management capabilities.

EdgeControl tools are web-portal based and can be integrated
    with existing enterprise management systems, allowing our
    customers to manage their distributed content and applications
    via a common interface. EdgeControl also provides integration
    with third party network management tools, including those
    offered by IBM, Hewlett-Packard and BMC Software. Having created
    one of the industry’s first examples of a commercially
    proven utility computing platform, Akamai now provides a global
    network of servers that can be utilized by customers for
    troubleshooting, monitoring and reporting, based on their
    individual business requirements.

Custom
    Solutions

In addition to our core commercial services, we are able to
    leverage the expertise of our technology, networks and support
    personnel to provide custom solutions to both commercial and
    government customers. These solutions include replicating our
    core technologies to facilitate content delivery behind the
    firewall, combinations of our technology with that of other
    providers to create unique solutions for specific customers and
    support for mission-critical applications that rely on the
    Internet and intranets. Additionally, numerous federal
    government agencies rely on Akamai for information about traffic
    conditions and activity on the Internet and tailored solutions
    to their content delivery needs.

Our Core
    Technology and Network

Our expansive network infrastructure and sophisticated
    technology are the foundation of our services. We believe Akamai
    has deployed the world’s largest globally distributed
    computing platform, with more than 20,000 servers located in
    nearly 1,000 networks around the world. Applying our proprietary
    technology, we deliver our customers’ content and computing
    applications across a system of widely distributed networks of
    servers; the



content and applications are then processed at the most
    efficient places within the network. Servers are deployed in
    networks ranging from large, backbone network providers to
    medium and small ISPs to cable modem and satellite providers to
    universities and other networks. We also have more than 500
    peering relationships that provide us with direct paths to end
    user networks, reducing data loss, while also giving us more
    options for delivery during network congestion or failures.

To make this wide-reaching deployment effective, we use
    specialized technologies, such as advanced routing, load
    balancing, data collection and monitoring. Our intelligent
    routing software is designed to ensure that website visitors
    experience fast page loading, access to applications and content
    assembly wherever they are on the Internet, regardless of global
    or local traffic conditions. Dedicated professionals staff our
    Network Operations Control Center on a 24/7 basis to monitor and
    react to Internet traffic patterns and trends. We deploy
    frequent enhancements to our software globally to introduce new
    service offerings and to ensure that our network continues to
    run effectively. Technology updates are replicated across the
    system. Customers are also able to control the extent of their
    use of Akamai services to scale on demand, using as much or as
    little capacity of the global platform as they require, to
    support widely varying traffic and rapid

e-business

growth without expensive and complex infrastructure build-out.

Business
    Segments and Geographic Information

We operate in one business segment: providing services for
    accelerating delivery of content and applications over the
    Internet. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and
    2004, approximately 22%, 21% and 19%, respectively, of our total
    revenues was derived from our operations outside the United
    States, of which 18%, 16% and 14% of overall revenues,
    respectively, was derived from Europe. No single country outside
    of the United States accounted for 10% or more of our revenues
    in any of such years. For more segment and geographic
    information, including revenue from customers, a measure of
    profit or loss and total assets for each of the last three
    fiscal years, see our consolidated financial statements included
    in this annual report on

Form 10-K,

including Note 19 thereto.

Customers

Our customer base is centered on enterprises. As of
    December 31, 2006, our customers included many of the
    world’s leading corporations, including Apple Inc., Best
    Buy.com, Inc., Clear Channel, FedEx Corporation, L’Oreal,
    Microsoft Corporation, MTV Networks, Nintendo, Qantas Airways
    Limited, Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications, Victoria’s
    Secret and XM Satellite Radio. We also actively sell to
    government agencies. As of December 31, 2006, our public
    sector customers included American Red Cross, the Federal
    Emergency Management Agency, the U.S. Air Force, the
    U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Department of Labor,
    the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the
    U.S. Geological Survey’s Earthquake Hazards Program.
    No customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenues for the
    years ended December 31, 2006 or 2005. For the year ended
    December 31, 2004, Microsoft Corporation accounted for 10%
    of total revenues. Less than 10% of our total revenues in each
    of the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was derived
    from contracts or subcontracts terminable at the election of the
    federal government, and we do not expect such contracts to
    account for more than 10% of our total revenues in 2007.

Sales,
    Service and Marketing

Our sales and service professionals are located in 11 offices in
    the United States with additional locations in Europe and Asia.
    We market and sell our services and solutions domestically and
    internationally through our direct sales and services
    organization and through more than 50 active resellers including
    Electronic Data Systems Corporation, IBM Corporation, Verizon
    and Telefonica Group. In addition to entering into agreements
    with resellers, we have several other types of sales- and
    marketing-focused alliances, with entities such as system
    integrators, application service providers, sales agents and
    referral partners. By aligning with these companies, we believe
    we are better able to market our services and encourage
    increased adoption of our technology throughout the industry.

Our sales and service organization includes employees in direct
    and channel sales, professional services, account management and
    technical consulting. As of December 31, 2006, we had
    approximately 500   employees in



our sales and support organization, including 103 direct sales
    representatives whose performance is measured on the basis of
    achievement of quota objectives. Our ability to achieve revenue
    growth in the future will depend in large part on whether we
    successfully recruit, train and retain sufficient sales,
    technical and global services personnel, and how well we
    establish and maintain our strategic alliances. We believe that
    the complexity of our services will continue to require a number
    of highly trained global sales and services personnel.

To support our sales efforts and promote the Akamai brand, we
    conduct comprehensive marketing programs. Our marketing
    strategies include an active public relations campaign, print
    advertisements, on-line advertisements, participation at trade
    shows, strategic alliances and on-going customer communication
    programs. As of December 31, 2006, we had 52 employees in
    our global marketing organization, which is a component of our
    sales and support organization.

Research
    and Development

Our research and development personnel are continuously
    undertaking efforts to enhance and improve our existing
    services, strengthen our network and create new services in
    response to our customers’ needs and market demand. As of
    December 31, 2006, we had approximately 250 research and
    development engineers, many of whom hold advanced degrees in
    their field. Our research and development expenses were
    $33.1 million, $18.1 million and $12.1 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively. In addition, for each of the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we capitalized
    $11.7 million, $8.5 million and $7.5 million,
    respectively, net of impairments, of external consulting and
    payroll and payroll-related costs related to the development of
    internal-use software used to deliver our services and operate
    our network. Additionally, during the year ended
    December 31, 2006, we capitalized $4.3 million of
    stock-based compensation in connection with our adoption of
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R).

Competition

The market for our services is intensely competitive and
    characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry
    standards and frequent new product and service installations. We
    expect competition for our services to increase both from
    existing competitors and new market entrants. We compete
    primarily on the basis of:

•

performance of services;

•

return on investment in terms of cost savings and new revenue
    opportunities for our customers;

•

reduced infrastructure complexity;

•

scalability;

•

ease of implementation and use of service;

•

customer support; and

•

price.

We compete primarily with companies offering products and
    services that address Internet performance problems, including
    companies that provide Internet content delivery and hosting
    services, streaming content delivery services and
    equipment-based solutions to Internet performance problems, such
    as load balancers and server switches. Some of our competitors
    also resell our services. Other companies have recently emerged
    that offer online distribution of digital media assets through
    advertising-based billing or revenue-sharing models that may
    represent an alternative to our services. In addition, potential
    customers may decide to purchase or develop their own hardware,
    software and other technology solutions rather than rely on an
    external managed services provider like Akamai.

We believe that we compete favorably with other companies in our
    industry, as well as alternative approaches to content and
    application delivery over the Internet, on the basis of price,
    the quality of our offerings and our customer service.



Proprietary
    Rights and Licensing

Our success and ability to compete are dependent on our ability
    to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our
    technology and operate without infringing on the proprietary
    rights of others. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark,
    trade secret and copyright laws and contractual restrictions to
    protect the proprietary aspects of our technology. We currently
    have numerous issued United States and foreign-country patents
    covering our content delivery technology, and we have numerous
    additional patent applications pending. Our issued patents
    extend to various dates between approximately 2015 and 2020. In
    October 1998, we entered into a license agreement with the
    Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT, under which we
    were granted a royalty-free, worldwide right to use and
    sublicense the intellectual property rights of MIT under various
    patent applications and copyrights relating to Internet content
    delivery technology. Two of these patent applications have now
    been issued. These patents will expire in 2018. We seek to limit
    disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees
    and consultants with access to our proprietary information to
    execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting
    access to our source code.

Employees

As of December 31, 2006, we had a total of
    1,058 full-time and part-time employees. Our future success
    will depend in part on our ability to attract, retain and
    motivate highly qualified technical and management personnel for
    whom competition is intense. Our employees are not represented
    by any collective bargaining unit. We believe our relations with
    our employees are good.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

The following are certain of the important factors that could
    cause our actual operating results to differ materially from
    those indicated or suggested by forward-looking statements made
    in this annual report on

Form 10-K

or presented elsewhere by management from time to time.

The
    markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we may
    be unable to compete successfully against new entrants with
    innovative approaches and established companies with greater
    resources.

We compete in markets that are intensely competitive, highly
    fragmented and rapidly changing. We have experienced and expect
    to continue to experience increased competition. Many of our
    current competitors, as well as a number of our potential
    competitors, have longer operating histories, greater name
    recognition, broader customer relationships and industry
    alliances and substantially greater financial, technical and
    marketing resources than we do. Some of our existing resellers
    are potential competitors. If one or more resellers that
    generate substantial revenues for us were to terminate our
    relationship and become a competitor or a reseller for a
    competitor, our business could be adversely affected. Other
    competitors may attract customers by offering less-sophisticated
    versions of services than we provide at lower prices than those
    we charge. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly
    than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in
    customer requirements. Some of our current or potential
    competitors may bundle their offerings with other services,
    software or hardware in a manner that may discourage website
    owners from purchasing any service we offer. Increased
    competition could result in price and revenue reductions, loss
    of customers and loss of market share, which could materially
    and adversely affect our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

In addition, potential customers may decide to purchase or
    develop their own hardware, software and other technology
    solutions rather than rely on an external provider like Akamai.
    As a result, our competitors include hardware manufacturers,
    software companies and other entities that offer Internet-
    related solutions that are not service-based. It is an important
    component of our growth strategy to educate enterprises and
    government agencies about our services and convince them to
    entrust their content and applications to an external service
    provider, and Akamai in particular. If we are unsuccessful in
    such efforts, our business, financial condition and results of
    operations could suffer.



If we
    are unable to sell our services at acceptable prices relative to
    our costs, our business and financial results are likely to
    suffer.

Prices we have been charging for some of our services have
    declined in recent years. We expect that this decline may
    continue in the future as a result of, among other things,
    existing and new competition in the markets we serve.
    Consequently, our historical revenue rates may not be indicative
    of future revenues based on comparable traffic volumes. In
    addition, our operating expenses have increased on an absolute
    basis in each of 2004, 2005 and 2006. If we are unable to sell
    our services at acceptable prices relative to our costs or if we
    are unsuccessful with our strategy of selling additional
    services and features to our existing content delivery
    customers, our revenues and gross margins will decrease, and our
    business and financial results will suffer.

Failure
    to increase our revenues and keep our expenses consistent with
    revenues could prevent us from maintaining profitability at
    recent levels or at all.

The year ended December 31, 2004 was the first fiscal year
    during which we achieved profitability as measured in accordance
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States of America. We have large fixed expenses, and we expect
    to continue to incur significant bandwidth, sales and marketing,
    product development, administrative and other expenses.
    Therefore, we will need to generate higher revenues to maintain
    profitability at recent levels or at all. There are numerous
    factors that could, alone or in combination with other factors,
    impede our ability to increase revenues

and/or

moderate expenses, including:

•

failure to increase sales of our core services;

•

significant increases in bandwidth costs or other operating
    expenses;

•

market pressure to decrease our prices;

•

any failure of our current and planned services and software to
    operate as expected;

•

loss of any significant customers or loss of existing customers
    at a rate greater than we increase our number of new customers
    or our sales to existing customers;

•

unauthorized use or access to content delivered over our network
    or network failures;

•

failure of a significant number of customers to pay our fees on
    a timely basis or at all or failure to continue to purchase our
    services in accordance with their contractual commitments; and

•

inability to attract high-quality customers to purchase and
    implement our current and planned services.

As
    part of our business strategy, we have entered into and may
    enter into or seek to enter into business combinations and
    acquisitions that may be difficult to integrate, disrupt our
    business, dilute stockholder value or divert management
    attention.

On December 13, 2006, we completed our acquisition of Nine
    Systems Corporation, or Nine Systems, and in June 2005, we
    completed our acquisition of Speedera Networks, Inc., or
    Speedera. On February 5, 2007, we announced  that we had
    entered into an agreement to acquire Netli, Inc., or Netli. If
    attractive acquisition opportunities arise in the future, we may
    seek to enter into additional business combinations or
    purchases. Acquisitions are typically accompanied by a number of
    risks, including the difficulty of integrating the operations
    and personnel of the acquired companies, the potential
    disruption of our ongoing business, the potential distraction of
    management, expenses related to the acquisition and potential
    unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses. Any
    inability to integrate completed acquisitions in an efficient
    and timely manner could have an adverse impact on our results of
    operations. If we are not successful in completing acquisitions
    that we may pursue in the future, we may incur substantial
    expenses and devote significant management time and resources
    without a productive result. In addition, future acquisitions
    could require use of substantial portions of our available cash
    or, as in the Nine Systems and Speedera acquisitions, dilutive
    issuances of securities.



Future
    changes in financial accounting standards may adversely affect
    our reported results of operations.

A change in accounting standards can have a significant effect
    on our reported results. New accounting pronouncements and
    interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and
    may occur in the future. These new accounting pronouncements may
    adversely affect our reported financial results. For example,
    beginning in 2006, under Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 123(R) “Share Based Payment”, or
    SFAS No. 123(R), we are required to account for our
    stock-based awards as a compensation expense and, as a result,
    our net income and net income per share in subsequent periods
    has been significantly reduced. Previously, we recorded
    stock-based compensation expense only in connection with option
    grants that have an exercise price below fair market value at
    the time they were granted.

For option grants that have an exercise price at fair market
    value, we calculated compensation expense and disclosed its
    impact on net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share, as
    well as the impact of all stock-based compensation expense in a
    footnote to the consolidated financial statements.
    SFAS No. 123(R) required us to adopt the new
    accounting provisions beginning in our first quarter of 2006,
    and requires us to expense stock-based awards, including shares
    issued under our employee stock purchase plan, stock options,
    restricted stock, deferred stock units and restricted stock
    units, as compensation cost. As a result, our earnings per share
    is likely to be significantly lower in the future even if our
    revenues increase.

If we
    are unable to develop new services and enhancements to existing
    services, and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging
    technological trends and customers’ changing needs, our
    operating results may suffer.

The market for our services is characterized by rapidly changing
    technology, evolving industry standards and new product and
    service introductions. Our operating results depend on our
    ability to develop and introduce new services into existing and
    emerging markets. The process of developing new technologies is
    complex and uncertain; we must commit significant resources to
    developing new services or enhancements to our existing services
    before knowing whether our investments will result in services
    the market will accept. Furthermore, we may not execute
    successfully our technology initiatives because of errors in
    planning or timing, technical hurdles that we fail to overcome
    in a timely fashion, misunderstandings about market demand or a
    lack of appropriate resources. Failures in execution or market
    acceptance of new services we introduce could result in
    competitors providing those solutions before we do and,
    consequently, loss of market share, revenues and earnings.

Any
    unplanned interruption in the functioning of our network or
    services could lead to significant costs and disruptions that
    could reduce our revenues and harm our business, financial
    results and reputation.

Our business is dependent on providing our customers with fast,
    efficient and reliable distribution of application and content
    delivery services over the Internet. For our core services, we
    currently provide a standard guarantee that our networks will
    deliver Internet content 24 hours a day, 7 days a
    week, 365 days a year. If we do not meet this standard, our
    customer does not pay for all or a part of its services on that
    day. Our network or services could be disrupted by numerous
    events, including natural disasters, unauthorized access to our
    servers, failure or refusal of our third-party network providers
    to provide the necessary capacity, power losses and intentional
    disruptions of our services, such as disruptions caused by
    software viruses or attacks by unauthorized users. Although we
    have taken steps to prevent such disruptions, there can be no
    assurance that attacks by unauthorized users will not be
    attempted in the future, that our enhanced security measures
    will be effective or that a successful attack would not be
    damaging. Any widespread interruption of the functioning of our
    network or services would reduce our revenues and could harm our
    business, financial results and reputation.

Because
    our services are complex and are deployed in complex
    environments, they may have errors or defects that could
    seriously harm our business.

Our services are highly complex and are designed to be deployed
    in and across numerous large and complex networks. From time to
    time, we have needed to correct errors and defects in our
    software. In the future, there may be additional errors and
    defects in our software that may adversely affect our services.
    We may not have in place adequate quality assurance procedures
    to ensure that we detect errors in our software in a timely
    manner. If we are



unable to efficiently fix errors or other problems that may be
    identified, or if there are unidentified errors that allow
    persons to improperly access our services, we could experience
    loss of revenues and market share, damage to our reputation,
    increased expenses and legal actions by our customers.

We may
    have insufficient transmission and server capacity, which could
    result in interruptions in our services and loss of
    revenues.

Our operations are dependent in part upon transmission capacity
    provided by third-party telecommunications network providers. In
    addition, our distributed network must be sufficiently robust to
    handle all of our customers’ traffic. We believe that we
    have access to adequate capacity to provide our services;
    however, there can be no assurance that we are adequately
    prepared for unexpected increases in bandwidth demands by our
    customers. In addition, the bandwidth we have contracted to
    purchase may become unavailable for a variety of reasons,
    including payment disputes or network providers going out of
    business. Any failure of these network providers to provide the
    capacity we require, due to financial or other reasons, may
    result in a reduction in, or interruption of, service to our
    customers. If we do not have access to third-party transmission
    capacity, we could lose customers. If we are unable to obtain
    transmission capacity on terms commercially acceptable to us or
    at all, our business and financial results could suffer. We may
    not be able to deploy on a timely basis enough servers to meet
    the needs of our customer base or effectively manage the
    functioning of those servers. In addition, damage or destruction
    of, or other denial of access to, a facility where our servers
    are housed could result in a reduction in, or interruption of,
    service to our customers.

If the
    estimates we make, and the assumptions on which we rely, in
    preparing our financial statements prove inaccurate, our actual
    results may be adversely affected.

Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. The preparation of these financial statements requires
    us to make estimates and judgments about, among other things,
    taxes, revenue recognition, stock-based compensation costs,
    capitalization of internal-use software, contingent obligations,
    doubtful accounts, intangible assets and restructuring charges.
    These estimates and judgments affect the reported amounts of our
    assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the amounts of
    charges accrued by us, such as those made in connection with our
    restructuring charges, and related disclosure of contingent
    assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical
    experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to
    be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are
    made. If our estimates or the assumptions underlying them are
    not correct, we may need to accrue additional charges that could
    adversely affect our results of operations, which in turn could
    adversely affect our stock price.

If we
    are unable to retain our key employees and hire qualified sales
    and technical personnel, our ability to compete could be
    harmed.

Our future success depends upon the continued services of our
    executive officers and other key technology, sales, marketing
    and support personnel who have critical industry experience and
    relationships that they rely on in implementing our business
    plan. There is increasing competition for talented individuals
    in the areas in which our primary offices are located. This
    affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire new
    ones. None of our officers or key employees is bound by an
    employment agreement for any specific term. The loss of the
    services of any of our key employees could delay the development
    and introduction of, and negatively impact our ability to sell,
    our services.

If our
    license agreement with MIT terminates, our business could be
    adversely affected.

We have licensed technology from MIT covered by various patents,
    patent applications and copyrights relating to Internet content
    delivery technology. Some of our core technology is based in
    part on the technology covered by these patents, patent
    applications and copyrights. Our license is effective for the
    life of the patents and patent applications; however, under
    limited circumstances, such as a cessation of our operations due
    to our insolvency or our material breach of the terms of the
    license agreement, MIT has the right to terminate our license. A
    termination of our license agreement with MIT could have a
    material adverse effect on our business.



We may
    need to defend our intellectual property and processes against
    patent or copyright infringement claims, which would cause us to
    incur substantial costs.

Other companies or individuals, including our competitors, may
    hold or obtain patents or other proprietary rights that would
    prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use or
    sell our services or develop new services, which could make it
    more difficult for us to increase revenues and improve or
    maintain profitability. Companies holding Internet-related
    patents or other intellectual property rights are increasingly
    bringing suits alleging infringement of such rights. Any
    litigation or claims, whether or not valid, could result in
    substantial costs and diversion of resources and require us to
    do one or more of the following:

•

cease selling, incorporating or using products or services that
    incorporate the challenged intellectual property;

•

pay substantial damages;

•

obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual
    property right, which license may not be available on reasonable
    terms or at all; or

•

redesign products or services.

If we are forced to take any of these actions, our business may
    be seriously harmed. In the event of a successful claim of
    infringement against us and our failure or inability to obtain a
    license to the infringed technology, our business and operating
    results could be materially adversely affected.

Our
    business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect
    our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or
    infringement by third parties.

We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and
    trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our
    intellectual property rights. We have previously brought
    lawsuits against entities that we believe are infringing on our
    intellectual property rights. Such lawsuits can be expensive and
    require a significant amount of attention of our management and
    technical personnel, and the outcomes are unpredictable. These
    legal protections afford only limited protection. Monitoring
    unauthorized use of our services is difficult and we cannot be
    certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized
    use of our technology, particularly in foreign countries where
    the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in
    the United States. Although we have licensed from other parties
    proprietary technology covered by patents, we cannot be certain
    that any such patents will not be challenged, invalidated or
    circumvented. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that any pending
    or future patent applications will be granted, that any future
    patent will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or
    that rights granted under any patent that may be issued will
    provide competitive advantages to us.

We
    face risks associated with international operations that could
    harm our business.

We have operations in several foreign countries and may continue
    to expand our sales and support organizations internationally.
    Such expansion could require us to make significant
    expenditures. We are increasingly subject to a number of risks
    associated with international business activities that may
    increase our costs, lengthen our sales cycle and require
    significant management attention. These risks include:

•

increased expenses associated with marketing services in foreign
    countries;

•

currency exchange rate fluctuations;

•

unexpected changes in regulatory requirements resulting in
    unanticipated costs and delays; interpretations of laws or
    regulations that would subject us to regulatory supervision or,
    in the alternative, require us to exit a country, which could
    have a negative impact on the quality of our services or our
    results of operations;

•

longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in
    collecting accounts receivable; and

•

potentially adverse tax consequences.



Any
    failure to meet our debt obligations would damage our
    business.

We have long-term debt. As of December 31, 2006, our total
    long-term debt was $200.0 million. If we are unable to
    remain profitable or if we use more cash than we generate in the
    future, our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our
    future operations by increasing our vulnerability to adverse
    changes in general economic and industry conditions and by
    limiting or prohibiting our ability to obtain additional
    financing for future capital expenditures, acquisitions and
    general corporate and other purposes. In addition, if we are
    unable to make interest or principal payments when due, we would
    be in default under the terms of our long-term debt obligations,
    which would result in all principal and interest becoming due
    and payable which, in turn, would seriously harm our business.

Internet-related
    and other laws could adversely affect our
    business.

Laws and regulations that apply to communications and commerce
    over the Internet are becoming more prevalent. In particular,
    the growth and development of the market for online commerce has
    prompted calls for more stringent tax, consumer protection and
    privacy laws, both in the United States and abroad, that may
    impose additional burdens on companies conducting business
    online or providing Internet-related services such as ours. This
    could negatively affect both our business directly as well as
    the businesses of our customers, which could reduce their demand
    for our services. Tax laws that might apply to our servers,
    which are located in many different jurisdictions, could require
    us to pay additional taxes that would adversely affect our
    continued profitability. We have recorded certain tax reserves
    to address potential exposures involving our sales and use and
    franchise tax positions. These potential tax liabilities result
    from the varying application of statutes, rules, regulations and
    interpretations by different jurisdictions. Our reserves,
    however, may not be adequate to reflect our total actual
    liability. Internet-related laws remain largely unsettled, even
    in areas where there has been some legislative action. The
    adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the
    Internet or our operations, or interpretations of existing law,
    could adversely affect our business.

Provisions
    of our charter documents, our stockholder rights plan and
    Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could prevent a
    change in control even if the change in control would be
    beneficial to our stockholders.

Provisions of our amended and restated certificate of
    incorporation, amended and restated by-laws and Delaware law
    could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us,
    even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. In
    addition, our Board of Directors has adopted a stockholder
    rights plan the provisions of which could make it more difficult
    for a potential acquirer of Akamai to consummate an acquisition
    transaction without the approval of our Board of Directors.

Our
    stock price has been volatile.

The market price of our common stock has been volatile. Trading
    prices may continue to fluctuate in response to a number of
    events and factors, including the following:

•

quarterly variations in operating results and announcements of
    innovations;

•

new products, services and strategic developments by us or our
    competitors;

•

business combinations and investments by us or our competitors;

•

variations in our revenue, expenses or profitability;

•

changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities
    analysts;

•

failure to meet the expectations of public market analysts;

•

performance by other companies in our industry; and

•

geopolitical conditions such as acts of terrorism or military
    conflicts.



Any of these events may cause the price of our shares to fall.
    In addition, the stock market in general and the market prices
    for technology companies in particular have experienced
    significant volatility that often has been unrelated to the
    operating performance of such companies. These broad market and
    industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of
    our shares, regardless of our operating performance.

If we
    are required to seek additional funding, such funding may not be
    available on acceptable terms or at all.

If our revenues decrease or grow more slowly than we anticipate,
    if our operating expenses increase more than we expect or cannot
    be reduced in the event of lower revenues, or if we seek to
    acquire significant businesses or technologies, we may need to
    obtain funding from outside sources. If we are unable to obtain
    this funding, our business would be materially and adversely
    affected. In addition, even if we were to find outside funding
    sources, we might be required to issue securities with greater
    rights than the securities we have outstanding today. We might
    also be required to take other actions that could lessen the
    value of our common stock, including borrowing money on terms
    that are not favorable to us. In addition, we may not be able to
    raise any additional capital.

A
    class action lawsuit has been filed against us and an adverse
    resolution of such action could have a material adverse effect
    on our financial condition and results of operations in the
    period in which the lawsuit is resolved.

We are named as a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit
    filed in 2001 alleging that the underwriters of our initial
    public offering received undisclosed compensation in connection
    with our initial public offering of common stock in violation of
    the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. See Item 3 of Part I
    of this annual report on

Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2006 for more information.
    Any conclusion of these matters in a manner adverse to us could
    have a material adverse affect on our financial position and
    results of operations.

We may
    become involved in other litigation that may adversely affect
    us.

In the ordinary course of business, we are or may become
    involved in litigation, administrative proceedings and
    governmental proceedings. Such matters can be time-consuming,
    divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to
    incur significant expenses. Furthermore, there can be no
    assurance that the results of any of these actions will not have
    a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
    or financial condition.

Properties

Our headquarters are located in approximately
    131,000 square feet of leased office space in Cambridge,
    Massachusetts. Of this space, we have subleased approximately
    12,000 square feet to another company. Our primary west
    coast office is located in approximately 28,000 square feet
    of leased office space in San Mateo, California. We
    maintain offices in several other locations in the United
    States, including in or near each of Los Angeles and
    San Diego, California; Denver, Colorado; Atlanta, Georgia;
    Chicago, Illinois; New York, New York; Dallas, Texas; Reston,
    Virginia and Seattle, Washington. We also maintain offices in
    Europe and Asia in or near the following cities: Bangalore,
    India; Beijing, China; Munich, Germany; Paris, France; London,
    England; Tokyo, Japan; Singapore; Madrid, Spain; and Sydney,
    Australia. All of our facilities are leased. We believe our
    facilities are sufficient to meet our needs for the foreseeable
    future and, if needed, additional space will be available at a
    reasonable cost.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

We are subject to legal proceedings, claims and litigation
    arising in the ordinary course of business. We do not expect the
    ultimate costs to resolve these matters to have a material
    adverse effect on our consolidated financial



position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition to
    ordinary-course litigation, we are a party to the lawsuit
    described below.

Between July 2, 2001 and November 7, 2001, purported
    class action lawsuits seeking monetary damages were filed in the
    United States District Court for the Southern District of New
    York against us as well as against the underwriters of our
    October 28, 1999 initial public offering of common stock.
    The complaints were filed allegedly on behalf of persons who
    purchased our common stock during different time periods, all
    beginning on October 28, 1999 and ending on various dates.
    The complaints are similar and allege violations of the
    Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange
    Act of 1934 primarily based on the allegation that the
    underwriters received undisclosed compensation in connection
    with our initial public offering. On April 19, 2002, a
    single consolidated amended complaint was filed, reiterating in
    one pleading the allegations contained in the previously filed
    separate actions. The consolidated amended complaint defines the
    alleged class period as October 28, 1999 through
    December 6, 2000. A Special Litigation Committee of
    Akamai’s Board of Directors authorized management to
    negotiate a settlement of the pending claims substantially
    consistent with a Memorandum of Understanding that was
    negotiated among class plaintiffs, all issuer defendants and
    their insurers. The parties negotiated a settlement that is
    subject to approval by the Court. On February 15, 2005, the
    Court issued an Opinion and Order preliminarily approving the
    settlement, provided that the defendants and plaintiffs agree to
    a modification narrowing the scope of the bar order set forth in
    the original settlement agreement. The parties agreed to a
    modification narrowing the scope of the bar order and, on
    August 31, 2005, and the Court issued an order
    preliminarily approving the settlement. On December 5,
    2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
    overturned the District Court’s certification of the class
    of plaintiffs who are pursuing the claims that would be settled
    in the settlement against the underwriter defendants. Plaintiffs
    filed a Petition for Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc with the
    Second Circuit on January 5, 2007 in response to the Second
    Circuit’s decision and have informed the District Court
    that they would like to be heard as to whether the settlement
    may still be approved even if the decision of the Court of
    Appeals is not reversed. The District Court indicated that it
    would defer consideration of final approval of the settlement
    pending plaintiffs’ request for further appellate review.
    We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims made
    in the complaint and, if the settlement is not finalized and
    approved, we intend to contest the lawsuit vigorously. An
    adverse resolution of the action could have a material adverse
    effect on our financial condition and results of operations in
    the period in which the lawsuit is resolved. We are not
    presently able to estimate potential losses, if any, related to
    this lawsuit if the settlement is not finalized and approved.

As of February 23, 2007, there were 713 holders of record
    of our common stock.

We have never paid or declared any cash dividends on shares of
    our common stock or other securities and do not anticipate
    paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We
    currently intend to retain all future earnings, if any, for use
    in the operation of our business. We did not repurchase any
    equity securities in 2006.

On December 13, 2006, we completed our acquisition of Nine
    Systems by acquiring all of the outstanding common and preferred
    stock, including vested and unvested stock options, of Nine
    Systems in exchange for approximately 2.7 million shares of
    our common stock, approximately $4.5 million in cash and
    the assumption of options to purchase approximately
    400,000 shares of our common stock. We issued the shares of
    our common stock in the merger to persons who qualified as
    “accredited investors” within the meaning of
    Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act
    of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. Each such person
    represented to us that it was the intent to acquire the shares
    of Akamai common stock for investment purposes for their own
    account and that such person had adequate opportunity to obtain
    from representatives of Akamai such information about us as was
    necessary for such person to evaluate the merits and risks of
    the acquisition of shares of Akamai common stock. No general
    solicitation or general advertising was undertaken in connection
    with the offering. All securities issued were endorsed with a
    restrictive legend confirming that the securities could not be
    resold without registration under the Act or an applicable
    exemption from the registration requirements of the Act. We also
    agreed to assume all outstanding vested and unvested options to
    purchase common stock of Nine Systems. The options are now
    exercisable for shares of our common stock pursuant to the terms
    of the existing agreements governing such options after giving
    effect to the common stock exchange ratio set forth in the
    agreement and plan of merger between the parties.

On February 2, 2007, we entered into an agreement and plan
    of merger for the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital
    stock, options and warrants of Netli. Under the terms of the
    agreement, we have agreed to issue approximately
    3.2 million shares of our common stock to investors who
    will qualify as “accredited investors” within the
    meaning of Rule 501(a) of Regulation D and to fewer
    than 35 unaccredited investors such that the securities will be
    issued without registration under the Securities Act pursuant to
    the exemptions set forth in Section 4(2) of the Securities
    Act and Rule 506 of Regulation D. With respect to each
    person considered to be an accredited investor, such person will
    represent to us that it is the intent to acquire the shares of
    Akamai common stock for investment purposes for their own
    account and that such person had adequate opportunity to obtain
    from representatives of Akamai such information about us as is
    necessary for such person to evaluate the merits and risks of
    the acquisition of shares of Akamai common stock. No general
    solicitation or general advertising has or will be undertaken in
    connection with the offering. All securities issued will be
    endorsed with a restrictive legend confirming that the
    securities could not be resold without registration under the
    Act or an applicable exemption from the registration
    requirements of the Act. We also agreed to assume all
    outstanding vested and unvested options and warrants to purchase
    shares of common stock of Netli. The options and warrants will
    be exercisable for shares of our common stock pursuant to the
    terms of the existing agreements governing such options and
    warrants after giving effect to the common stock exchange ratio
    set forth in the agreement and plan of merger between the
    parties.

Selected
    Consolidated Financial Data

The following selected consolidated financial data should be
    read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements
    and related notes and with “Management’s Discussion
    and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations” and other financial data included elsewhere in
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

The consolidated statement of operations data and balance sheet
    data for all periods presented is derived from audited
    consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K

or in Annual Reports on

Form 10-K

for prior years on file with the Securities and Exchange
    Commission.

Loss from continuing operations for the year ended
    December 31, 2002 includes restructuring charges of
    $45.8 million for actual and estimated termination and
    modification costs related to non-cancelable facility leases and
    employee severance.

Loss from continuing operations for the year ended
    December 31, 2003 includes a restructuring credit of
    $8.5 million for the reversal of previously accrued
    restructuring liabilities and a loss on early extinguishment of
    debt of $2.1 million. Income from continuing operations for
    the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 includes a loss
    on early extinguishment of debt of $1.4 million and
    $6.8 million, respectively.

In 2005, we acquired Speedera Networks, Inc., which was
    accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, for a
    purchase price of $142.2 million, comprised primarily of
    our common stock. We allocated $138.1 million of the cost
    of this acquisition to goodwill and other intangible assets.
    Income from continuing operations for the year ended
    December 31, 2005 includes $5.1 million for the
    amortization of other intangible assets related to this
    acquisition.

In 2005, we released nearly all of our United States and foreign
    deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Based upon our
    cumulative operating results and an assessment of our expected
    future results, we determined that is was more likely than not
    that our deferred tax assets will be realized. During 2005, the
    total valuation allowance release recorded as an income tax
    benefit in the statement of operations was $285.8 million.

Additionally, in 2005, we completed an equity offering of
    12,000,000 shares of our common stock at a price of
    $16.855 per share for proceeds of $202.1 million, net
    of offering expenses. We also redeemed all $56.6 million in
    principal amount of our then-remaining outstanding


/


% convertible
    subordinated notes for total cash payments of $58.1 million
    in 2005.

On January 1, 2006, we adopted, on a modified prospective
    basis, the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), which
    requires us to record compensation expense for employee stock
    awards at fair value at the time of grant. As a result, our
    stock-based compensation expense increased in 2006, causing our
    net income to decrease significantly. For the year ended
    December 31, 2006, our pre-tax stock compensation expense
    was $49.6 million.

In 2006, we acquired Nine Systems for a purchase price of
    $157.7 million, comprised primarily of our common stock.
    This acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of
    accounting. We allocated $171.4 million of the cost of this
    acquisition to goodwill and other intangible assets. Net income
    from continuing operations for the



year ended December 31, 2006 includes $104,000 for the
    amortization of other intangible assets related to this
    acquisition.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Overview

We provide services for accelerating and improving the delivery
    of content and applications over the Internet. We primarily
    derive income from the sale of services to customers executing
    contracts with terms of one year or longer, which we refer to as
    recurring revenue contracts or long-term contracts. These
    contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly
    level of usage with additional charges applicable for actual
    usage above the monthly minimum. In recent years, however, we
    have entered into increasing numbers of customer contracts that
    have minimum usage commitments that are based on twelve-month or
    longer periods. Our goal of having a consistent and predictable
    base level of income is important to our financial success.
    Accordingly, to be successful, we must maintain our base of
    recurring revenue contracts by eliminating or reducing lost
    monthly or annual recurring revenue due to customer
    cancellations or terminations and build on that base by adding
    new customers and increasing the number of services, features
    and functions our existing customers purchase. At the same time,
    we must ensure that our expenses do not increase faster than, or
    at the same rate as, our revenues. Accomplishing these goals
    requires that we compete effectively in the marketplace on the
    basis of price, quality and the attractiveness of our services
    and technology.

This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations should be read in
    conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes
    thereto which appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

See “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business.
    The following discussion contains forward-looking statements.
    The forward-looking statements do not include the potential
    impact of any mergers, acquisitions, or divestitures of business
    combinations that may be announced after the date hereof.

Recent
    Events

On December 13, 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding
    equity of Nine Systems in exchange for approximately
    2.7 million shares of Akamai common stock and approximately
    $4.5 million in cash, and we assumed options that had been
    issued by Nine Systems Corporation that are exercisable for
    approximately 400,000 shares of Akamai common stock. The
    revenues and expenses generated from the acquisition date,
    December 13, 2006, to December 31, 2006 were not
    significant to our fiscal 2006 financial results reported in our
    consolidated statement of operations included elsewhere in this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

On February 5, 2007, we announced that we had entered into
    an Agreement and Plan of Merger to acquire Netli. Under the
    terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, upon consummation, we
    will acquire all of the outstanding equity of Netli in exchange
    for approximately 3.2 million shares of Akamai’s
    common stock, subject to certain closing adjustments.



Our improved financial results in 2006 as compared to 2005 and
    2004 reflect the success of our efforts to increase our monthly
    and annual recurring revenues while limiting the expenses needed
    to support such growth. The following sets forth, as a

We were profitable for fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004;
    however, we cannot guarantee continued profitability for any
    period in the future. We have observed the following trends and
    events that are likely to have an impact on our financial
    condition and results of operations in the foreseeable future:

•

During each quarter in 2006 and 2005, the dollar volume of new
    recurring revenue contracts exceeded the dollar volume of the
    contracts we lost through cancellations, terminations and
    non-payment. A continuation of this trend would lead to
    increased revenues in the future.

•

During 2006, no customer accounted for 10% or more of our total
    revenues. We expect that customer concentration levels will
    continue to decline compared to prior years if our customer base
    continues to grow.

•

As of January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment
    (revised 2004),” or SFAS No. 123(R), which
    requires us to record compensation expense for employee stock
    awards at fair value at the time of grant. As a result, our
    stock-based compensation expense increased in 2006 as compared
    to 2005, causing our net income to decrease significantly. For
    the year ended December 31, 2006, our pre-tax stock-based
    compensation expense was $49.6 million, as compared to
    $3.8 million and $1.3 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We expect that
    stock-based compensation expense will continue at the current
    rate, or slightly increase in the future, because we have a
    significant number of unvested employee awards outstanding and
    plan to continue to grant equity-based compensation in the
    future. As of December 31, 2006, our total pre-tax
    unrecognized compensation costs for stock-based awards were
    $107.5 million, which we expect to recognize as expense
    over a weighted average period of 1.5 years.

•

During 2006, revenues derived from customers outside the United
    States accounted for 22% of our total revenues. We expect that
    revenues from customers outside the United States as a
    percentage of our total revenues will be between 20% and 25% in
    2007.

•

During 2006, we continued to reduce our network bandwidth costs
    per unit by entering into new supplier contracts with lower
    pricing and amending existing contracts to take advantage of
    price reductions offered by our existing suppliers. However, due
    to increased traffic delivered over our network, our total
    bandwidth



costs increased during 2006. We believe that our overall
    bandwidth costs will continue to increase as a result of
    expected higher traffic levels, partially offset by continued
    reductions in bandwidth costs per unit that we have realized and
    may continue to realize in the future. If we do not experience
    lower per unit bandwidth pricing and we are unsuccessful at
    effectively routing traffic over our network through lower cost
    providers, network bandwidth costs could increase in excess of
    our expectations in 2007.

•

Depreciation expense related to our network equipment increased
    in 2006 as compared to 2005 as we have increased our purchases
    of servers during the year in an effort to expand our network
    and improve the quality of our services. We expect this trend to
    continue in 2007; accordingly, we believe that depreciation
    expense related to our network equipment will continue to
    increase. In addition, we expect to continue to enhance and add
    functionality to our service offerings and, therefore, to
    increase the amount of capitalized internal-use software costs,
    which includes stock-based compensation expense attributable to
    employees working on such projects. As a result, we believe that
    the amortization of internal-use software development costs,
    which we include in cost of revenues, will increase in 2007.

•

During 2006, our effective tax rate, including discrete items,
    was 41.5%. While we expect our annual effective tax rate to
    remain relatively constant in 2007, we do not expect to make
    significant cash tax payments due to the continued utilization
    of our net operating loss carryforwards.

Based on our analysis of these identified trends and events, we
    expect to continue to generate net income on a quarterly and
    annual basis during 2007; however, our future results and our
    ability to generate profits will be affected by many factors
    identified below and in the section of this report entitled
    “Risk Factors,” including our ability to:

•

increase our revenue by adding customers through long-term
    contracts and limiting customer cancellations and terminations;

•

maintain the prices we charge for our services;

•

prevent disruptions to our services and network due to accidents
    or intentional attacks; and

•

maintain our network bandwidth costs and other operating
    expenses consistent with our revenues.

Given these uncertainties, there is no assurance that we will
    achieve our expected financial objectives, including positive
    net income.

Application
    of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Overview

Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial
    condition and results of operations is based upon our
    consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. These principles require us to make
    estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
    assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, cash flow and
    related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our
    estimates include those related to revenue recognition, accounts
    receivable and related reserves, capitalized internal-use
    software costs, intangible assets and goodwill, income and other
    taxes, impairment and useful lives of long-lived assets,
    restructuring liabilities, loss contingencies and stock-based
    compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and
    on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable
    under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made.
    Actual results may differ from these estimates. For a complete
    description of our significant accounting policies, see
    Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Definitions

We define our “critical accounting policies” as those
    accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America that require us to make subjective
    estimates about matters that are uncertain and are likely to
    have a material impact on our financial condition and results of
    operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply
    those principles. Our estimates are based upon assumptions and
    judgments about matters that are



highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and
    applied and require us to assess a range of potential outcomes.

Review
    of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Revenue
    Recognition:

We recognize service revenue in accordance with the Securities
    and Exchange Commission’s Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 104, “Revenue Recognition,” and
    the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Emerging
    Issues Task Force Issue

No. 00-21,

“Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.”
    Revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or
    determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the
    service is performed and collectibility of the resulting
    receivable is reasonably assured.

At the inception of a customer contract for service, we make an
    estimate as to that customer’s ability to pay for the
    services provided. We base our estimate on a combination of
    factors, including the successful completion of a credit check
    or financial review, our payment history with the customer and
    other forms of payment assurance. Upon the completion of these
    steps, we recognize revenue monthly in accordance with our
    revenue recognition policy. If we subsequently determine that
    collection from the customer is not reasonably assured, we
    record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense
    for all of that customer’s unpaid invoices and cease
    recognizing revenue for continued services provided until cash
    is received. Changes in our estimates and judgments about
    whether collection is reasonably assured would change the timing
    of revenue or amount of bad debt expense that we recognize.

We primarily derive income from the sale of services to
    customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer.
    These contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum
    monthly or annual level of usage and provide the rate at which
    the customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly or
    annual minimum. For these services, we recognize the monthly
    minimum as revenue each month provided that an enforceable
    contract has been signed by both parties, the service has been
    delivered to the customer, the fee for the service is fixed or
    determinable and collection is reasonably assured. Should a
    customer’s usage of our service exceed the monthly minimum,
    we recognize revenue for such excess usage in the period of the
    usage. For annual revenue commitments, we recognize revenue
    monthly based upon the customer’s usage in such period. We
    typically charge the customer an installation fee when the
    services are first activated. The installation fees are recorded
    as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the
    estimated life of the customer arrangement. We also derive
    income from services sold as discrete, non-recurring events or
    based solely on usage. For these services, we recognize revenue
    after an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties,
    the fee is fixed or determinable, the event or usage has
    occurred and collection is reasonably assured.

When more than one element is contained in a single arrangement,
    we allocate revenue between the elements based on each
    element’s relative fair value, provided that each element
    meets the criteria as a separate unit of accounting. An item is
    considered a separate unit of accounting if it has value to the
    customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and
    verifiable evidence of the fair value of the separate elements.
    Fair value is generally determined based upon the price charged
    when the element is sold separately. If the fair value of each
    element cannot be objectively determined, the total value of the
    arrangement is recognized ratably over the entire service period
    to the extent that all services have begun to be provided at the
    outset of the period. For most multi-element service
    arrangements to date, the fair value of each element has not
    been objectively determinable. Therefore, all revenue under
    these arrangements has been recognized ratably over the related
    service period to the extent that all services have begun to be
    provided at the outset of the period.

We also license software under perpetual and term license
    agreements. We apply the provisions of Statement of Position, or
    SOP,

97-2,

“Software Revenue Recognition,” as amended by

SOP 98-9,

“Modifications of

SOP 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain
    Transactions.” As prescribed by this guidance, we apply the
    residual method of accounting. The residual method requires that
    the portion of the total arrangement fee attributable to
    undelivered elements, as indicated by vendor specific objective
    evidence of fair value, is deferred and subsequently recognized
    when delivered. The difference between the total arrangement fee
    and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is
    recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements, if all
    other revenue recognition criteria of

SOP 97-2

are met.



We also sell our services through a reseller channel. Assuming
    all other revenue recognition criteria are met, we recognize
    revenue from reseller arrangements based on the reseller’s
    contracted non-refundable minimum purchase commitments over the
    term of the contract, plus amounts sold by the reseller to its
    customers in excess of the minimum commitments. These excess
    commitments are recognized as revenue in the period in which the
    service is provided.

We recognize revenue from fixed-fee arrangements and software
    arrangements that require significant customization or
    modification using the

percentage-of-completion

method in accordance with Accounting Research Bulletin, or ARB,
    No. 45, “Long-Term Construction-Type Contracts,”
    and with the applicable guidance provided by

SOP 81-1,

“Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and
    Certain Production-Type Contracts.” We generally recognize
    revenue under these arrangements based on the percentage of cost
    incurred to date compared to the estimated total cost to
    complete the project. In certain customer arrangements, we
    recognize revenue based on the progress made towards achieving
    milestones under the contract. The impact of any change in
    estimate is recorded prospectively from the date of the change.
    At the outset of a fixed-fee arrangement, if we are not able to
    estimate the total

cost-to-complete,

nor able to measure progress towards the achievement of contract
    milestones, we account for the arrangement using the
    completed-contract method of accounting. Under this method, we
    recognize revenue when the contract is complete and there are no
    remaining costs or deliverables. In the event that the estimated
    total cost on a fixed-fee contract indicates a loss, we will
    record the loss immediately.

From time to time, we enter into contracts to sell our services
    or license our technology to unrelated companies at or about the
    same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or
    services from the same companies. If we conclude that these
    contracts were negotiated concurrently, we record as revenue
    only the net cash received from the vendor, unless the product
    or service received has a separate and identifiable benefit and
    the fair value to us of the vendor’s product or service can
    be objectively established.

We may from time to time resell licenses or services of third
    parties. We record revenue for these transactions on a gross
    basis when we have risk of loss related to the amounts purchased
    from the third party and we add value to the license or service,
    such as by providing maintenance or support for such license or
    service. If these conditions are present, we recognize revenue
    when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied.

Deferred revenue includes amounts billed to customers for which
    revenue has not been recognized. Deferred revenue primarily
    consists of the unearned portion of monthly billed service fees;
    prepayments made by customers for future periods; deferred
    installation and activation

set-up

fees;
    amounts billed under extended payment terms; and maintenance and
    support fees charged under license arrangements.

Accounts
    Receivable and Related Reserves:

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts
    and do not bear interest. In addition to trade accounts
    receivable, our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled
    accounts that represent revenue recorded for customers that is
    typically billed within one month. We record reserves against
    our accounts receivable balance. These reserves consist of
    allowances for doubtful accounts, cash basis customers and
    service credits. Increases and decreases in the allowance for
    doubtful accounts are included as a component of general and
    administrative expenses. The reserve for cash basis customers
    increases as services are provided to customers for which
    collection is no longer assured. The reserve decreases and
    revenue is recognized when and if cash payments are received.
    The reserve for service credits increases as a result of
    specific service credits that are expected to be issued to
    customers during the ordinary course of business, as well as for
    billing disputes. These credits result in a reduction to
    revenues. Decreases to the reserve for service credits are the
    result of actual credits being issued to customers, causing a
    corresponding reduction in accounts receivable.

Estimates are used in determining these reserves and are based
    upon our review of outstanding balances on a customer-specific,

account-by-account

basis. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a
    review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection
    issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the
    ability to pay for prior services provided. We reserve for all
    invoices that have been outstanding greater than one year. We
    perform on-going credit evaluations of our customers. If such an
    evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably
    assured for services provided, any future services provided to
    that customer will result in creation of a cash basis reserve
    until we receive consistent payments. In addition, we reserve a
    portion of revenues as a



reserve for service credits. Reserves for service credits are
    measured based on an analysis of revenue credits to be issued
    after the month of billing and an estimate for future credits.
    These credits typically relate to management’s estimate of
    the resolution of customer disputes and billing adjustments. We
    do not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to our
    customers.

Impairment
    and Useful Lives of Long-Lived Assets:

We review our long-lived assets, such as fixed assets and
    intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets
    may not be recoverable. Events that would trigger an impairment
    review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted
    negative cash flows related to the asset. When such events
    occur, we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the
    undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset. If
    this comparison indicates that an impairment is present, the
    amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between
    the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. If a
    readily determinable market price does not exist, fair value is
    estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to
    the asset. The estimates required to apply this accounting
    policy include forecasted usage of the long-lived assets and the
    useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows.
    Changes in these estimates could materially impact results from
    operations.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

We test goodwill for impairments on an annual basis or more
    frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the asset might be impaired. We performed an impairment test of
    goodwill as of January 1, 2006 and January 1, 2007.
    These tests did not result in an impairment of goodwill. Other
    intangible assets consist of completed technologies, customer
    relationships, trademarks and non-compete agreements arising
    from acquisitions of businesses and acquired license rights.
    Purchased intangible assets, other than goodwill, are amortized
    over their estimated useful lives based upon the economic value
    derived from the related intangible assets. Goodwill is carried
    at its historical cost.

Restructuring
    Liabilities Related to Facility Leases:

When we vacate a facility subject to a non-cancelable long-term
    lease, we record a restructuring liability for either the
    estimated costs to terminate the lease or the estimated costs
    that will continue to be incurred under the lease for its
    remaining term where there is no economic benefit to us. In the
    latter case, we measure the amount of the restructuring
    liability as the amount of contractual future lease payments
    reduced by an estimate of sublease income. To date, we have
    recorded a restructuring liability when our management approves
    and commits us to a plan to terminate a lease, the plan
    specifically identifies the actions to be taken, and the actions
    are scheduled to begin soon after management approves the plan.
    In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards,
    or SFAS, No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated
    with Exit or Disposal Activities,” we record restructuring
    liabilities, discounted at the appropriate rate, for a facility
    lease only when we have both vacated the space and completed all
    actions needed to make the space readily available for sublease.

As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately $900,000 in
    accrued restructuring liabilities related to vacated facilities,
    which we expect will be paid within 12 months.

Loss
    Contingencies:

We define a loss contingency as a condition involving
    uncertainty as to a possible loss related to a previous event
    that will not be resolved until one or more future events occur
    or fail to occur. Our primary loss contingencies relate to
    pending or threatened litigation. We record a liability for a
    loss contingency when we believe that it is probable that a loss
    has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably
    estimated. When we believe the likelihood of a loss is less than
    probable and more than remote, we do not record a liability.
    Material loss contingencies are disclosed in the notes to the
    consolidated financial statements.

Tax
    Reserves:

Our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a
    deferred portion. The current income tax provision is calculated
    as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for
    the current year. The deferred



income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax
    effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards
    using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the
    differences are expected to reverse.

We currently have significant deferred tax assets resulting from
    net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards and
    deductible temporary differences. Our management periodically
    weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is
    more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets
    will be realized. During 2005, our management determined it was
    more likely than not that substantially all of the deferred tax
    assets would be realized, and, accordingly released
    substantially all of our valuation allowance. This decision was
    based on our cumulative history of earnings before taxes for
    financial reporting purposes over a

12-quarter

period and on the projections of expected future taxable income.
    The tax assets estimated to be realized in future periods have
    been calculated by applying a blended federal and state tax rate
    of 39.1%, which is based upon the tax rates expected to be in
    effect, apportioned by jurisdiction, in the periods during which
    the attributes are expected to be utilized. Changes in this
    blended rate in future periods could have a material effect on
    both the tax provision in the period of change as well as the
    net deferred tax asset carrying value.

We have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential
    exposures involving our sales and use and franchise tax
    positions. These potential tax liabilities result from the
    varying application of statutes, rules, regulations and
    interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions. Our estimate
    of the value of these tax reserves contains assumptions based on
    past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of
    statutes, rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions. It is
    possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit
    from these matters may be materially greater or less than the
    amount that we estimated.

In November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position SFAS
    No. 123(R)-3, “Transition Election to Accounting for
    the Tax Effect of Share-Based Payment Awards.” We have
    elected to adopt the modified prospective transition method for
    calculating the tax effects of stock-based compensation pursuant
    to SFAS No. 123(R). Under the modified prospective
    transition method, no adjustment is made to the deferred tax
    balances associated with stock-based payments that continue to
    be classified as equity awards. Additionally, we elected to use
    the “long-form method,” as provided in
    paragraph 81 of SFAS No. 123(R) to determine the
    pool of windfall tax benefits. The long-form method requires us
    to analyze the book and tax compensation for each award
    separately as if it had been issued following the recognition
    provisions of SFAS No. 123, subject to adjustments for
    net operating loss carryforwards.

Accounting
    for Stock-Based Compensation

Since January 1, 2006, we have accounted for stock-based
    compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R).
    Historically, we recognized stock-based compensation costs
    pursuant to Accounting Principles Bulletin No. 25,
    “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and
    elected to disclose the impact of expensing stock options
    pursuant to SFAS No. 123, “Share-Based
    Payment” in the notes to our financial statements. See
    Note 16 to the Financial Statements included elsewhere in
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Under the fair value recognition provisions of
    SFAS No. 123(R), stock-based compensation cost is
    measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and
    is recognized as expense over the vesting period. We have
    selected the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine
    fair value of stock option awards. Determining the fair value of
    stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment,
    including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and
    the volatility of the underlying common stock. Our assumptions
    may differ from those used in prior periods because of
    adjustments to the calculation of such assumptions based upon
    the guidance of SFAS No. 123(R) and Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 107, “Share-Based Payment.” Changes
    to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair
    value of stock options, which could have a material impact on
    our financial statements. In addition, judgment is also required
    in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected
    to be forfeited. Should our actual forfeiture rates differ
    significantly from our estimates, our stock-based compensation
    expense and results of operations could be materially impacted.

Capitalized
    Internal-Use Software Costs:

We capitalize the salaries and payroll-related costs of
    employees and consultants who devote time to the development of
    internal-use software projects. If a project constitutes an
    enhancement to previously developed software, we assess whether
    the enhancement is significant and creates additional
    functionality to the software, thus



qualifying the work incurred for capitalization. Once the
    project is complete, we estimate the useful life of the
    internal-use software, and we periodically assess whether the
    software is impaired. Changes in our estimates related to
    internal-use software would increase or decrease operating
    expenses or amortization recorded during the period.

Results
    of Operations

Revenues.

Total revenues increased 51%, or
    $145.6 million, to $428.7 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 as compared to $283.1 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2005. Total revenues increased
    35%, or $73.1 million, to $283.1 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $210.0 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in total
    revenues for 2006 as compared to 2005 was attributable to an
    increase in service revenue of $146.0 million. Service
    revenue, which consists of revenue from our content and
    application delivery services, increased 52%, to
    $427.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as
    compared to $281.5 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2005. Service revenue was $206.8 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increases in
    service revenue during the periods presented were primarily
    attributable to increases in the number of customers under
    recurring revenue contracts, as well as increases in traffic and
    additional services sold to new and existing customers and
    increases in the average revenue per customer. The increases in
    service revenue 2006 and 2005 are attributable to greater market
    acceptance of our services among new customers and improvements
    in our ability to sell additional features to our existing
    customers. Our delivery of streaming services for a number of
    high-profile media events during 2006 also contributed to higher
    service revenue. Also contributing to the increases in service
    revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 were revenues
    generated from customers of Speedera, which we acquired in June
    2005. As of December 31, 2006, we had 2,347 customers under
    recurring revenue contracts as compared to 1,910 as of
    December 31, 2005, and 1,310 as of December 31, 2004.

Software and software-related revenue decreased 27%, or
    $449,000, to $1.2 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 as compared to $1.6 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2005. Software and software-related
    revenue was $3.3 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2004. Software and software-related revenue
    includes sales of customized software projects and technology
    licensing. The decreases in software and software-related
    revenue over the periods presented reflect a reduction in the
    number of customized software projects that we undertook for
    customers and a decrease in the number of software licenses
    executed with customers. We do not expect software and
    software-related revenue to increase as a percentage of revenues
    in 2007.

For 2006 and 2005, 22% and 21%, respectively, of our total
    revenues was derived from our operations located outside of the
    United States, of which 18% and 16% of total revenues,
    respectively, was derived from operations in Europe. For 2004,
    19% of our total revenues was derived from our operations
    located outside of the United States, of which 14% of total
    revenues was derived from operations in Europe. No single
    country accounted for 10% or more of revenues derived outside of
    the United States during these periods. We do not expect
    international sales to increase as a percentage of our overall
    sales in 2007. Resellers accounted for 20% of revenues in 2006,
    24% in 2005 and 27% in 2004. For 2006 and 2005, no single
    customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenues. For 2004,
    Microsoft Corporation accounted for 10% of total revenues.

Cost of Revenues.

Cost of revenues includes
    fees paid to network providers for bandwidth and co-location of
    our network equipment. Cost of revenues also includes payroll
    and related costs and stock-based compensation for network
    operations personnel, cost of software licenses, depreciation of
    network equipment used to deliver our services, amortization of
    internal-use software and amortization of capitalized
    stock-based compensation.

Cost of revenues increased 69%, or $38.4 million, to
    $94.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as
    compared to $55.7 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2005. Cost of revenues increased 21%, or
    $9.5 million, to $55.7 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2005 compared to $46.2 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2004. These increases were
    primarily due to an increase in the amounts paid to network
    providers due to higher traffic levels, partially offset by
    reduced bandwidth costs per unit, and an increase in
    depreciation expense of network equipment as we continue to
    invest in our infrastructure. Additionally, cost of revenues
    increased in 2006 due to an increase in stock-based compensation
    expense resulting from our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R).

Cost of revenues during 2006, 2005 and 2004 also included
    credits received of approximately $1.5 million,
    $1.2 million and $1.0 million, respectively, from
    settlements and renegotiations entered into in connection with



billing disputes related to bandwidth contracts. Credits of this
    nature may occur in the future; however, the timing and amount
    of future credits, if any, will vary.

Cost of revenues is comprised of the following (in millions):

We have long-term purchase commitments for bandwidth usage and
    co-location with various networks and Internet service
    providers. For the years ending December 31, 2007, 2008 and
    2009, the minimum commitments related to bandwidth usage and
    co-location services are approximately $20.0 million,
    $8.4 million and $897,000, respectively.

We believe cost of revenues will increase in 2007. We expect to
    deliver more traffic on our network, which would result in
    higher expenses associated with the increased traffic; however,
    such costs are likely to be partially offset by lower bandwidth
    costs per unit. Additionally, we anticipate increases in
    depreciation expense related to our network equipment and
    amortization of internal-use software development costs, along
    with increased payroll and related costs, as we continue to make
    investments in our network to service our customer base. Cost of
    revenues is also expected to increase as we continue to expense
    employee stock awards at fair value in accordance with
    SFAS No. 123(R). The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R)
    will also result in additional expense associated with the
    amortization of stock-based compensation.

Research and Development.

Research and
    development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related
    costs and stock-based compensation for research and development
    personnel who design, develop, test and enhance our services and
    our network. Research and development costs are expensed as
    incurred, except certain internal use software development costs
    eligible for capitalization. During the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we capitalized software
    development costs of $11.7 million, $8.5 million and
    $7.5 million, respectively, net of impairments. These
    development costs consisted of external consulting and payroll
    and payroll-related costs for personnel involved in the
    development of internal-use software used to deliver our
    services and operate our network. Additionally, for the year
    ended December 31, 2006, we capitalized $4.3 million
    of stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS
    No. 123(R). These capitalized internal-use software costs
    are amortized to cost of revenues over their estimated useful
    lives of two years.

Research and development expenses increased 83%, or
    $15.0 million, to $33.1 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 as compared to $18.1 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2005. Research and development
    expenses increased 49%, or $5.9 million, to $18.1 for the
    year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2004. Research and development expenses for
    the year ended December 31, 2004 were $12.1 million.
    Research and development expense increased in 2006 due to an
    increase in stock-based compensation expense resulting from
    SFAS No. 123(R). The increase in 2005 was due to an
    increase in payroll and related costs due to an increase in
    headcount.



The following table quantifies the net changes in research and
    development expenses over periods presented (in millions):

We believe that research and development expenses will increase
    in 2007, as we continue to increase our hiring of development
    personnel and make investments in our core technology and
    refinements to our other service offerings. Additionally,
    research and development expenses are expected to increase as a
    result of expensing stock-based compensation in accordance with
    SFAS No. 123(R).

Sales and Marketing.

Sales and marketing
    expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs,
    stock-based compensation and commissions for personnel engaged
    in marketing, sales and service support functions, as well as
    advertising and promotional expenses.

Sales and marketing expenses increased 54%, or
    $41.8 million, to $119.7 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 as compared to $77.9 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2005. Sales and marketing expenses
    increased 40%, or $22.2 million, to $77.9 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to
    $55.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.
    The increase in sales and marketing expenses during these
    periods was partially the result of higher payroll and related
    costs, particularly commissions, for sales and marketing
    personnel, due to revenue growth. Additionally, marketing and
    related expense increased in 2006 due to an increase in
    stock-based compensation expense as a result of SFAS
    No. 123(R).

We believe that sales and marketing expenses will continue to
    increase in 2007 due to an expected increase in commissions on
    higher forecasted sales of our services, the expected increase
    in hiring of sales and marketing personnel and additional
    expected increases in other marketing costs such as advertising.
    Additionally, sales and marketing expenses are expected to
    increase as a result of expensing stock-based compensation in
    accordance with SFAS No. 123(R).

General and Administrative.

General and
    administrative expenses consist primarily of the following
    components:

•

payroll, stock-based compensation and other related costs,
    including expenses for executive, finance, business
    applications, internal network management, human resources and
    other administrative personnel;

•

depreciation of property and equipment used by us internally;

•

fees for professional services;



•

non-income related taxes;

•

insurance costs;

•

the provision for doubtful accounts; and

•

rent and other facility-related expenditures for leased
    properties.

General and administrative expenses increased 70%, or
    $37.2 million, to $90.2 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 as compared to $53.0 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2005. General and administrative
    expenses increased 13%, or $6.0 million, to
    $53.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as
    compared to $47.1 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2004. The increase in general and
    administrative expenses during 2006 was primarily due to an
    increase in payroll and related costs as a result of headcount
    growth, as well as stock-based compensation expense. The
    increase in general and administrative expenses during 2005 was
    primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs as a
    result of headcount growth, as well as stock-based compensation
    expense. These increases were offset by a reduction in legal and
    consulting costs associated with the dismissal of the lawsuits
    between Akamai and Speedera as a result of our acquisition of
    Speedera and a reduction in non-income taxes as a result of
    settlements with state taxation authorities in 2005 that allowed
    us to reduce the related accrual. These

one-time

savings resulted in higher non-income taxes in 2006 as compared
    to the prior year.

    administrative expenses for the periods presented (in millions):

During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we
    capitalized software development costs of $889,000 and $718,000,
    respectively, consisting of external consulting fees and payroll
    and payroll-related costs associated with the development of
    internally-used software applications. Once the projects are
    completed, such costs will be amortized and included in general
    and administrative expenses.

We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in
    2007 due to increased payroll and related costs attributable to
    increased hiring, an increase in non-income tax expense and an
    increase in rent and facilities costs because we expanded leased
    office space during 2006. Additionally, general and
    administrative expenses are expected to increase as a result of
    higher stock-based compensation expense as a result of
    SFAS No. 123(R).

Amortization of Other Intangible
    Assets.

Amortization of other intangible assets
    consists of the amortization of intangible assets acquired in
    business combinations and amortization of acquired license
    rights. Amortization of other intangible assets increased to
    $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as
    compared to $5.1 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2005. Amortization of other intangible assets
    for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $48,000. The
    increase in amortization of other intangible assets in 2006 was
    due to the amortization of intangible assets of $3.4 million in
    connection with the acquisition of Nine Systems in December 2006
    and Speedera in June 2005. The increase in amortization of
    intangible assets in 2005 as compared to 2004 was due to the
    amortization of intangible assets of $5.1 million in
    connection with our acquisition of Speedera. We expect to
    amortize approximately $10.7 million, $10.2 million,
    $9.2 million, $7.6 million and $6.4 million for
    fiscal years



2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively, as a result of
    the Nine Systems and Speedera acquisitions. In January 2007, we
    announced a plan to acquire Netli, Inc. If this acquisition is
    completed, we expect that amortization of other intangible
    assets will increase in the future.

Interest Income.

Interest income includes
    interest earned on invested cash balances and marketable
    securities. Interest income increased 315%, or
    $13.4 million, to $17.7 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 as compared to $4.3 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2005. Interest income increased
    98%, or $2.1 million, to $4.3 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $2.2 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in
    interest income in 2006 as compared to 2005 and 2004 was due to
    an increase in our invested marketable securities period over
    period, due to the investment of $202.1 million in net
    proceeds we received from our public equity offering of
    12.0 million shares of our common stock in November 2005,
    as well as generating greater cash flows from operations. We
    also experienced an increase in interest rates earned on our
    investments.

Interest Expense.

Interest expense includes
    interest paid on our debt obligations as well as amortization of
    deferred financing costs. Interest expense decreased 41%, or
    $2.2 million, to $3.2 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 compared to $5.3 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2005. Interest expense decreased
    48%, or $4.9 million, to $5.3 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $10.2 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease during
    each of these periods was due to lower interest expense as a
    result of redemptions and repurchases of our


/


%
    convertible subordinated notes. During 2005 and 2004, we
    redeemed or repurchased $56.6 million and
    $169.4 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount
    of our


/


% convertible
    subordinated notes. As of December 31, 2006, there was an
    aggregate principal amount of $200 million of our
    1.0% convertible senior notes outstanding. We believe that
    interest expense on our debt obligations, including deferred
    financing amortization, will not exceed $3.1 million in
    2007.

Other Income (Expense), net.

Other income
    (expense), net primarily represents net foreign exchange gains
    and losses incurred during the periods presented, as well as
    gains and losses on legal settlements. Other net expense
    decreased 212%, or $1.1 million, to other net income of
    $570,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared
    to other net expense of $507,000 for the year ended
    December 31, 2005. Other net income was $1.1 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2004. Other net income for
    the year ended December 31, 2006 represented $90,000 of
    foreign exchange gains and $480,000 of net gains on legal
    settlements. Other net expense of $507,000 for the year ended
    December 31, 2005 represented approximately
    $1.5 million of foreign exchange losses, offset by
    $1.0 million of net gains on legal settlements. For the
    year ended December 31, 2004, other net income of
    $1.1 million represented approximately $518,000 of gains on
    legal settlements and $543,000 of foreign exchange gains. Other
    net income (expense) may fluctuate in the future based upon
    movements in foreign exchange rates, the outcome of legal
    proceedings and other events.

Gain (Loss) on Investments, net.

During the
    year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded a net gain on
    investments of $261,000 on the sale of marketable securities.
    During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we
    recorded a net loss on investments of $27,000 and $69,000,
    respectively, from the sale of marketable securities. We do not
    expect significant gains or losses on investments in 2007.

Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt.

We had
    no loss on early extinguishment of debt during 2006 because we
    did not redeem or repurchase any debt during the year. Loss on
    early extinguishment of debt decreased to $1.4 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to
    $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The
    decrease in loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2005 is due
    to costs incurred in connection with our redemption of
    $56.6 million in aggregate principal amount of our


/


% convertible
    subordinated notes during 2005. This loss of $1.4 million
    consists of $889,000 in premiums above par value paid to redeem
    such notes and $481,000 of deferred financing costs associated
    with redeeming such notes prior to their maturity. During 2004,
    we repurchased $169.4 million in principal amount of our


/


% convertible
    subordinated notes which resulted in a loss on early
    extinguishment of debt of $6.8 million.

Provision (Benefit) for Income
    Taxes.

Provision for income taxes increased to
    $41.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as
    compared to a benefit for income taxes of $257.6 million
    during the year ended December 31, 2005. Provision for
    income taxes was $772,000 for the year ended December 31,
    2004. During 2005, in connection with the release of our
    deferred tax asset valuation allowance, we recorded an income
    tax benefit of $285.8 million which was offset by provision
    for income taxes primarily related to our alternative minimum
    tax



obligations and income earned in profitable foreign
    jurisdictions. As a result of the release of the deferred tax
    asset valuation allowance in 2005, we recorded a provision for
    income taxes of $41.1 million in 2006. The provision for
    income taxes for 2004 was primarily related to our alternative
    minimum tax payment obligations and income earned in foreign
    jurisdictions where we were profitable.

As of December 31, 2004, our United States and foreign net
    operating losses, or NOLs, and other deferred tax assets were
    fully offset by a valuation allowance primarily because at the
    time, pursuant to SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for
    Income Taxes,” we did not have sufficient history of
    taxable income to conclude that it was more likely than not that
    we would be able to realize the tax benefits of those deferred
    tax assets. Based upon our cumulative history of earnings over a

12-quarter

period and an assessment of our expected future results of
    operations, during the third quarter of 2005, we determined that
    it had become more likely than not that we would be able to
    realize a substantial portion of our United States and foreign
    NOL carryforward tax assets prior to their expiration and other
    deferred tax assets. As a result, during 2005, we released a
    total of $349.5 million of our United States and foreign
    deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Of the
    $349.5 million, $285.8 million of the valuation
    release was recorded as an income tax benefit in our statement
    of operations, $61.0 million of the valuation release was
    attributable to stock option exercises, which was recorded as an
    increase in additional paid-in capital on our balance sheet, and
    approximately $2.7 million of the valuation release was
    recorded as a reduction to acquired goodwill and intangible
    assets.

As of December 31, 2006, we had a remaining valuation
    allowance of $6.3 million. During the fourth quarter of
    2006, we recorded additional deferred tax assets related to
    acquired NOL carryforwards from Nine Systems. However, these
    NOLs are subject to limitation pursuant to section 382 of
    the Internal Revenue Code due to changes in ownership of more
    than 50%. Because the realization of these deferred tax assets
    does not meet the “more likely than not” criterion
    under SFAS No. 109, we recorded a valuation allowance
    of $4.4 million against the acquired NOLs. We continue to
    maintain a valuation allowance of $1.9 million related to
    certain state NOLs that we expect will expire unused.

While we expect our consolidated annualized effective tax rate
    in 2007 to remain relatively consistent with 2006, this
    expectation does not take into consideration the effect of
    discrete items recorded as a result of our compliance with
    SFAS No. 123(R). The effective tax rate including the
    effect of discrete items could be materially different depending
    on the nature and timing of the disposition of incentive and
    other employee stock options.

Because of the availability of the NOLs discussed above, a
    significant portion of our future provision for income taxes is
    expected to be a non-cash expense; consequently, the amount of
    cash paid with respect to income taxes is expected to be a
    relatively small portion of the total annualized tax expense
    during periods in which the NOLs are utilized. In determining
    our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances, and
    projections of our future provision for income taxes, annualized
    effective tax rates, and cash paid for income taxes, management
    is required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and
    foreign profitability, the timing and extent of the utilization
    of NOL carryforwards, applicable tax rates, transfer pricing
    methodologies and tax planning strategies. Judgments and
    estimates related to our projections and assumptions are
    inherently uncertain; therefore, actual results could differ
    materially from our projections.

We have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential
    exposures involving our sales and use and franchise tax
    positions. These potential tax liabilities result from the
    varying application of statutes, rules, regulations and
    interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions. Our estimate
    of the value of these tax reserves reflects assumptions based on
    past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of
    statutes, rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions. It is
    possible that the ultimate tax liability or benefit from of
    these matters may be materially greater or less than the amount
    that we have estimated.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the
    following transactions:

•

private sales of capital stock and subordinated notes, which
    notes were repaid in 1999;

•

an initial public offering of our common stock in October 1999,
    which generated net proceeds of $217.6 million;



•

the sale in June 2000 of an aggregate of $300 million in
    principal amount of our


/


% convertible
    subordinated notes, which generated net proceeds of
    $290.2 million and were repaid or redeemed in full between
    December 2003 and September 2005;

•

the sale in December 2003 and January 2004 of an aggregate of
    $200 million in principal amount of our 1% convertible
    senior notes, which generated net proceeds of
    $194.1 million;

•

the public offering of 12.0 million shares of our common
    stock in November 2005, which generated net proceeds of
    $202.1 million;

•

proceeds from the exercise of stock awards; and

•

cash generated by operations.

As of December 31, 2006, cash, cash equivalents and
    marketable securities totaled $434.5 million, of which
    $4.2 million is subject to restrictions limiting our
    ability to withdraw or otherwise use such cash, cash equivalents
    and marketable securities. See “Letters of Credit”
    below.

Cash provided by operating activities increased
    $49.2 million to $132.0 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 compared to $82.8 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2005. Cash provided by operating
    activities increased $31.6 million to $82.8 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to cash
    provided by operating activities of $51.2 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in cash provided
    by operating activities for each of 2006 and 2005 as compared to
    2004 was primarily due to increased service revenue as well as
    increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses. We expect
    that cash provided by operating activities will continue to
    increase as a result of an upward trend in cash collections
    related to higher revenues, partially offset by an expected
    increase in operating expenses that require cash outlays, such
    as salaries, in connection with expected increases in headcount.
    The timing and amount of future working capital changes and our
    ability to manage our days sales outstanding will also affect
    the future amount of cash used in or provided by operating
    activities.

Cash used in investing activities was $205.6 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to
    $183.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005.
    Cash provided by investing activities was $9.1 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2004. Cash used in investing
    activities for 2006 reflects net purchases of short and
    long-term investments of $131.6 million and capital
    expenditures of $69.3 million, consisting of the
    capitalization of internal-use development costs related to our
    current and future service offerings and purchases of network
    infrastructure equipment. In addition, approximately
    $5.1 million of cash, including transaction costs, was used
    to acquire Nine Systems. These investments were offset by a
    decrease of $400,000 in restricted investments previously held
    for security deposits. Cash used in investing activities for the
    year ended December 31, 2005 reflects net purchases of
    marketable securities of $149.5 million primarily related
    to the cash received from our equity financing in November 2005.
    Additionally, cash used in investing activities for 2005
    includes capital expenditures of $36.2 million. These
    investments were offset by $1.7 million of cash acquired
    through the Speedera acquisition and a decrease of $202,000 in
    restricted investments previously held for security deposits.
    Cash provided by investing activities for 2004 reflects proceeds
    from net sales and maturities of investments of
    $24.1 million, offset by capital expenditures of
    $20.1 million. During 2004, cash provided by investing
    activities also included a decrease of $5.0 million in
    restricted cash to reflect our repurchase of $5.0 million
    in principal amount of our


/


%
    convertible subordinated notes in early 2004 and a decrease of
    $96,000 in restricted investments previously held for security
    deposits. For 2007, we expect total capital expenditures, a
    component of cash used in investing activities, to be
    approximately the same percentage of revenues as 2006.

Cash provided by financing activities was $60.4 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to
    $159.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005.
    Cash used in financing activities was $131.9 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2004. Cash provided by
    financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006
    included proceeds of $27.9 million from the issuance of
    common stock upon the exercise of stock options and the sale of
    shares under our employee stock purchase plan. Cash provided by
    financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006
    also includes $32.5 million related to excess tax benefits
    resulting from the exercise of stock options. Cash provided by
    financing activities in 2005 reflects net proceeds from our
    November 2005 equity offering of $202.1 million and
    proceeds from issuances of common stock under our equity
    compensation plans of



$14.5 million, offset by payments made to redeem $56.6
    million in principal amount of our outstanding


/


% convertible
    subordinated notes and payments on capital lease obligations of
    $818,000. Cash used in financing activities in 2004 reflects
    payments for the repurchase of approximately $169.4 million
    in aggregate principal amount of our


/


%
    convertible subordinated notes and payments on our capital
    leases of $543,000, offset by net proceeds received from the
    issuance of our 1% convertible senior notes of
    $24.3 million and proceeds from issuances of common stock
    under our equity compensation plans of $13.8 million.

Changes in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are
    dependent upon changes in working capital items such as deferred
    revenue, accounts payable, accounts receivable and various
    accrued expenses, as well as changes in our capital and
    financial structure, including debt repurchases and issuances,
    stock option exercises, sales of equity investments and similar
    events.

We believe, based on our current business plan, that our cash,
    cash equivalents and marketable securities of
    $434.5 million as of December 31, 2006 and forecasted
    cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash
    needs for working capital and capital expenditures and
    restructuring expenses for at least the next 24 months. If
    the assumptions underlying our business plan regarding future
    revenue and expenses change or if unexpected opportunities or
    needs arise, we may seek to raise additional cash by selling
    equity or debt securities. If additional funds are raised
    through the issuance of equity or debt securities, these
    securities could have rights, preferences and privileges senior
    to those accruing to holders of common stock, and the terms of
    such debt could impose restrictions on our operations. The sale
    of additional equity or convertible debt securities would also
    result in additional dilution to our stockholders. See
    “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

Letters
    of Credit

As of December 31, 2006, we had outstanding
    $4.2 million in irrevocable letters of credit issued by us
    in favor of third-party beneficiaries, primarily related to
    long-term facility leases. The letters of credit are
    collateralized by restricted marketable securities, of which
    $3.1 million are classified as long-term marketable
    securities and $1.1 million are classified as short-term
    marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheet dated as
    of December 31, 2006. The restrictions on these marketable
    securities lapse as we fulfill our obligations or as such
    obligations expire under the terms of the letters of credit.
    These restrictions are expected to lapse at various times
    through May 2011.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

We have entered into various indemnification arrangements with
    third parties, including vendors, customers, landlords, our
    officers and directors, stockholders of acquired companies,
    joint venture partners and third parties to whom and from whom
    we license technology. Generally, these indemnification
    agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by third
    parties due to various events, such as lawsuits arising from
    patent or copyright infringement or our negligence. These
    indemnification obligations are considered off-balance sheet
    arrangements in accordance with FASB Interpretation 45,
    “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
    for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
    Others.” To date, we have not encountered material costs as
    a result of such obligations and have not accrued any
    liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our
    financial statements. See Note 11 to our consolidated
    financial statements included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for further discussion of these indemnification agreements.

The conversion features of our 1% convertible senior notes
    are equity-linked derivatives. As such, we recognize these
    instruments as off-balance sheet arrangements. The conversion
    features associated with these notes would be accounted for as
    derivative instruments, except that they are indexed to our
    common stock and classified in stockholders’ equity.
    Therefore, these instruments meet the scope exception of
    paragraph 11(a) of SFAS No. 133, “Accounting
    for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” and are
    accordingly not accounted for as derivatives for purposes of
    SFAS No. 133. See Note 12 to our consolidated
    financial statements for more information.

Litigation

We are party to litigation which we consider routine and
    incidental to our business. Management does not expect the
    results of any of these actions to have a material adverse
    effect on our business, results of operations or financial
    condition. See “Legal Proceedings” elsewhere in this
    annual report on

Form 10-K

for further discussion on litigation.



Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
    Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109,” or
    FIN No. 48. FIN No. 48 clarifies the
    accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an
    enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with FASB
    Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.”
    FIN No. 48 prescribes a two-step process to determine
    the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax
    position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it
    will be sustained upon external examination. If the tax position
    is deemed more-likely-than-not to be sustained, the tax position
    is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize
    in the financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may
    be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than
    50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate
    settlement. FIN No. 48 will be effective for us
    beginning in 2007. We do not expect the implementation of
    FIN No. 48 to have a material impact on our financial
    statements.

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or
    the SEC, released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,
    or SAB 108. SAB 108 expresses the SEC staff’s
    views regarding the process of quantifying financial statement
    misstatements. SAB 108 also states that correcting prior
    year financial statements for immaterial errors would not
    require previously filed reports to be amended. Such correction
    may be made the next time the registrant files the prior year
    financial statements. Registrants electing not to restate prior
    periods should reflect the effects of initially applying the
    guidance in SAB 108 in their annual financial statements
    covering the first fiscal year ending after November 15,
    2006. The cumulative effect of the initial application should be
    reported in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities as of
    the beginning of that fiscal year and the offsetting adjustment
    should be made to the opening balance of retained earnings for
    that year. Registrants should disclose the nature and amount of
    each individual error being corrected in the cumulative
    adjustment. The disclosure should also include when and how each
    error arose and the fact that the errors had previously been
    considered immaterial. The SEC staff encourages early
    application of the guidance in SAB 108 for interim periods
    of the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006.
    The implementation of SAB 108 did not have a material
    impact on our financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements,” or SFAS 157.
    SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
    measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting
    principles, and expands disclosures about fair value
    measurements. SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value
    measurements but may change current practice for some entities.
    SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for
    fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim
    periods within those years. We do not expect the implementation
    of SAB 157 to have a material impact on our financial
    statements.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates
    relates primarily to our debt and investment portfolio. In our
    investment portfolio we do not use derivative financial
    instruments. We place our investments with high quality issuers
    and, by policy, limit the amount of risk by investing primarily
    in money market funds, United States Treasury obligations,
    high-quality corporate and municipal obligations and
    certificates of deposit.

Our 1% convertible senior notes are subject to changes in
    market value. Under certain conditions, the holders of our
    1% convertible senior notes may require us to redeem the
    notes on or after December 15, 2010. As of
    December 31, 2006, the aggregate outstanding principal
    amount and the fair value of the 1% convertible senior
    notes were $200.0 million and $374.4 million,
    respectively.

We have operations in Europe and Asia. As a result, we are
    exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Additionally,
    we may continue to expand our operations globally and sell to
    customers in foreign locations, which may increase our exposure
    to foreign exchange fluctuations. We do not have any foreign
    hedge contracts.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Akamai
    Technologies, Inc.:

We have completed integrated audits of Akamai Technologies,
    Inc.’s consolidated financial statements and of its
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006 in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our
    opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated
    financial statements and financial statement
    schedule

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the accompanying index, present fairly, in all material
    respects, the financial position of Akamai Technologies, Inc.
    and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2006 and
    December 31, 2005, and the results of their operations and
    their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2006 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
    in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
    accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects,
    the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with
    the related consolidated financial statements. These financial
    statements and financial statement schedule are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
    We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
    the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
    (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
    audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test
    basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
    financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
    and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
    audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
    for share-based compensation in 2006.

Internal
    control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in
    Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting appearing on page 80 of this

Form 10-K,

that the Company maintained effective internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly
    stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria.
    Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s management
    is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
    is to express opinions on management’s assessment and on
    the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit
    of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with
    the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
    (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    effective internal control over financial reporting was
    maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal
    control over financial reporting includes obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
    the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
    performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made



only in accordance with authorizations of management and
    directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable
    assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Nature of
    Business and Basis of Presentation:

Akamai Technologies, Inc. (“Akamai” or the
    “Company”) provides services for accelerating and
    improving the delivery of content and applications over the
    Internet. Akamai’s globally distributed platform comprises
    thousands of servers in hundreds of networks in approximately 70
    countries. The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1998 and
    is headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Akamai currently
    operates in one business segment: providing services for
    accelerating and improving the delivery of content and
    applications over the Internet.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
    accounts of Akamai and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
    Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in
    consolidation.

2.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies:

Use of
    Estimates

The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. These principles require management to
    make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the
    reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses,
    together with amounts disclosed in the related notes to the
    consolidated financial statements. Actual results and outcomes
    may differ from management’s estimates, judgments and
    assumptions. Significant estimates used in these financial
    statements include, but are not limited to, revenues, accounts
    receivable and related reserves, restructuring reserves,
    contingencies, useful lives and realizability of long-term
    assets and goodwill, capitalized software, income and other
    taxes and the fair value of stock-based compensation. Estimates
    are periodically reviewed in light of changes in circumstances,
    facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in
    estimates are reflected in the consolidated financial statements
    prospectively from the date of the change in estimate.

Revenue
    Recognition

The Company recognizes service revenues in accordance with the
    Securities and Exchange Commission’s Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 104, “Revenue Recognition,” and
    the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s
    (“FASB”) Emerging Issues Task Force Issue

No. 00-21,

“Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.”
    Revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or
    determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the
    service is performed and collectibility of the resulting
    receivable is reasonably assured.

At the inception of a customer contract for service, the Company
    makes an assessment as to that customer’s ability to pay
    for the services provided. The Company bases its assessment on a
    combination of factors, including the successful completion of a
    credit check or financial review, its payment history with the
    customer and other forms of payment assurance. Upon the
    completion of these steps, the Company recognizes revenue
    monthly in accordance with its revenue recognition policy. If
    the Company subsequently determines that collection from the
    customer is not reasonably assured, the Company records an
    allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all of
    that customer’s unpaid invoices and ceases recognizing
    revenue for continued services provided until cash is received.
    Changes in the Company’s estimates and judgments about
    whether collection is reasonably assured would change the timing
    of revenue or amount of bad debt expense that the Company
    recognizes.

Akamai primarily derives income from the sale of services to
    customers executing contracts having terms of one year or
    longer. These contracts generally commit the customer to a
    minimum monthly or annual level of usage and provide the rate at
    which the customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly
    or annual minimum. For these services, Akamai recognizes the
    monthly minimum as revenue each month provided that an
    enforceable contract has been signed by both parties, the
    service has been delivered to the customer, the fee for the
    service is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably
    assured. Should a customer’s usage of Akamai services
    exceed the monthly or annual minimum, Akamai recognizes revenue
    for such excess in the period of the usage. For annual revenue
    commitments, the Company recognizes revenue monthly based upon
    the customer’s usage in such period.



AKAMAI
    TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company typically charges the customer an installation fee
    when the services are first activated. The installation fees are
    recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably
    over the estimated life of the customer arrangement. The Company
    also derives revenue from services sold as discrete,
    non-recurring events or based solely on usage. For these
    services, the Company recognizes revenue after an enforceable
    contract has been signed by both parties, the fee is fixed or
    determinable, the event or usage has occurred and collection is
    reasonably assured.

When more than one element is contained in a single arrangement,
    the Company allocates revenue between the elements based on each
    element’s relative fair value, provided that each element
    meets the criteria as a separate unit of accounting. An item is
    considered a separate unit of accounting if it has value to the
    customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and
    verifiable evidence of the fair value of the separate element.
    Fair value is generally determined based upon the price charged
    when the element is sold separately. If the fair value of each
    element cannot be objectively determined, the total value of the
    arrangement is recognized ratably over the entire service period
    to the extent that all services have begun to be provided at the
    outset of the period. For most multi-element service
    arrangements to date, the fair value of each element has not
    been objectively determinable. Therefore, all revenue under
    these arrangements has been recognized ratably over the
    applicable service period to the extent that all services have
    begun to be provided at the outset of the period.

The Company also licenses software under perpetual and term
    license agreements. The Company applies the provisions of
    Statement of Position (“SOP”)

97-2,

“Software Revenue Recognition,” as amended by

SOP 98-9,

“Modifications of

SOP 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain
    Transactions.” As prescribed by this guidance, the Company
    applies the residual method of accounting. The residual method
    requires that the portion of the total arrangement fee
    attributable to undelivered elements, as indicated by vendor
    specific objective evidence of fair value, is deferred and
    subsequently recognized when delivered. The difference between
    the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the
    undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the
    delivered elements, if all other revenue recognition criteria of

SOP 97-2

are met.

The Company also sells its services through a reseller channel.
    Assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, the
    Company recognizes revenue from reseller arrangements based on
    the reseller’s contracted non-refundable minimum purchase
    commitments over the term of the contract, plus amounts sold by
    the reseller to its customers in excess of the minimum
    commitments. These excess minimum commitments are recognized as
    revenue in the period in which the service is provided.

Akamai recognizes revenue from fixed-fee arrangements and
    software arrangements that require significant customization or
    modification using the

percentage-of-completion

method in accordance with Accounting Research Bulletin
    (“ARB”) No. 45, “Long-Term Construction-Type
    Contracts,” and with the applicable guidance provided by

SOP 81-1,

“Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and
    Certain Production-Type Contracts.” The Company generally
    recognizes revenue under these arrangements based on the
    percentage of cost incurred to date compared to the estimated
    total cost to complete the project. In certain customer
    arrangements, the Company recognizes revenue based on the
    progress made toward achieving milestones under the contract.
    The impact of any change in estimate is recorded prospectively
    from the date of the change. At the outset of a fixed-fee
    arrangement, if the Company is not able to estimate the total

cost-to-complete,

nor able to measure progress towards the achievement of contract
    milestones, the Company accounts for the arrangement using the
    completed-contract method of accounting. Under this method, the
    Company recognizes revenue when the contract is complete and
    there are no remaining costs or deliverables. In the event that
    the estimated total cost on a fixed-fee contract indicates a
    loss, the Company will record the loss immediately.

From time to time, the Company enters into contracts to sell its
    services or license its technology to unrelated enterprises at
    or about the same time that it enters into contracts to purchase
    products or services from the same enterprise. If the Company
    concludes that these contracts were negotiated concurrently, the
    Company records as revenue only the net cash received from the
    vendor, unless the product or service received has a separate
    identifiable benefit and the fair value to the Company of the
    vendor’s product or service can be established objectively.



AKAMAI
    TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company may from time to time resell licenses or services of
    third parties. The Company records revenue for these
    transactions on a gross basis when the Company has risk of loss
    related to the amounts purchased from the third party and the
    Company adds value to the license or service, such as by
    providing maintenance or support for such license or service. If
    these conditions are present, the Company recognizes revenue
    when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied.

Deferred revenue includes amounts billed to customers for which
    revenue has not been recognized. Deferred revenue primarily
    consists of the unearned portion of monthly billed service fees;
    prepayments made by customers for future periods; deferred
    installation and activation

set-up

fees;
    amounts billed under extended payment terms; and maintenance and
    support fees charged under license arrangements.

Cost
    of Revenues

Cost of revenues consists primarily of fees paid to network
    providers for bandwidth and for housing servers in third-party
    network data centers, also known as co-location costs. Cost of
    revenues also includes network operation employee costs, network
    storage costs, cost of software licenses, depreciation of
    network equipment used to deliver the Company’s services,
    amortization of network-related internal-use software and costs
    for the production of live on-line events. The Company enters
    into contracts for bandwidth with third-party network providers
    with terms typically ranging from several months to two years.
    These contracts generally commit Akamai to pay minimum monthly
    fees plus additional fees for bandwidth usage above the
    contracted level. In some circumstances, Internet service
    providers (“ISPs”) make available to Akamai rack space
    for the Company’s servers and access to their bandwidth at
    discounted or no cost. In exchange, the ISP and its customers
    benefit by receiving content through a local Akamai server
    resulting in better content delivery. The Company does not
    consider these relationships to represent the culmination of an
    earnings process. Accordingly, the Company does not recognize as
    revenue the value to the ISPs associated with the use of
    Akamai’s servers nor does the Company recognize as expense
    the value of the rack space and bandwidth received at discounted
    or no cost.

Accounting
    for Stock-Based Compensation

On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 123R,
    “Share-Based Payment”
    (“FAS No. 123R”). The standard requires
    recognizing compensation costs for all share-based payment
    awards made to employees and directors based upon the
    awards’ estimated grant date fair value. The standard
    covers employee stock options, restricted stock, restricted
    stock units, deferred stock units and employee stock purchases
    related to the Company’s employee stock purchase plan.
    Additionally, the Company applied the provisions of the
    SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 on
    Share-Based Payment to the Company’s adoption of
    FAS No. 123R. Previously, the Company elected to
    account for these share-based payment awards under Accounting
    Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock
    Issued to Employees” (“APB No. 25”) and
    elected to only disclose the impact of expensing the fair value
    of stock options in the notes to the financial statements.

The Company adopted FAS No. 123R using the modified
    prospective transition method which requires applying the
    standard as of January 1, 2006 (“the adoption
    date”). The modified prospective transition method does not
    result in the restatement of results from prior periods and,
    accordingly, the results of operations for 2006 and future
    periods will not be comparable to the Company’s historical
    results of operations.

Under the modified prospective transition method,
    FAS No. 123R applies to new equity awards and to
    equity awards modified, repurchased or canceled after the
    adoption date. Additionally, compensation cost for the portion
    of awards granted prior to the adoption date for which the
    requisite service has not been rendered as of the adoption date
    shall be recognized as the requisite service is rendered. The
    compensation cost for that portion of awards shall be based on
    the grant-date fair value of those awards as calculated in the
    prior period pro forma disclosures under FAS No. 123,
    “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”
    (“FAS No. 123”). Changes to the grant-date
    fair value of equity awards granted before the effective date
    are precluded. The compensation cost for those earlier awards



AKAMAI
    TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

shall be attributed to periods beginning on or after the
    adoption date using the attribution method that was used under
    FAS No. 123, which was the straight-line method. The
    Company estimates an expected forfeiture rate which is factored
    in to determine the Company’s quarterly expense. Deferred
    compensation which related to those earlier awards has been
    eliminated against additional paid-in capital.
    FAS No. 123R also changes the reporting of tax-related
    amounts within the statement of cash flows. The excess amount of
    windfall tax benefits resulting from stock-based compensation
    will be reported as financing inflows.

For stock options, the Company has selected the Black-Scholes
    option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option
    awards. For stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock
    units and deferred stock units, the Company recognizes
    compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the awards’
    vesting periods for those awards that contain a service vesting
    feature. For awards with a performance condition vesting
    feature, the Company recognizes compensation cost on a
    straight-line basis over the awards’ expected vesting
    periods.

Research
    and Development Costs

Research and development costs consist primarily of payroll and
    related personnel costs for the design, development, deployment,
    testing, operation and enhancement of the Company’s
    services and network. Costs incurred in the development of the
    Company’s services are expensed as incurred, except certain
    software development costs eligible for capitalization. Costs
    associated with the development of software to be marketed
    externally are expensed prior to the establishment of
    technological feasibility as defined by SFAS No. 86,
    “Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software to be Sold,
    Leased, or Otherwise Marketed,” and capitalized thereafter
    until the general release of the software. To date, the
    Company’s development of software to be sold externally has
    been completed concurrently with the establishment of
    technological feasibility and, accordingly, all associated costs
    have been charged to expense as incurred in the accompanying
    consolidated financial statements.

Costs incurred during the application development stage of
    internal-use software projects are capitalized in accordance
    with

SOP 98-1,

“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
    Obtained for Internal Use.” Capitalized costs include
    external consulting fees and payroll and payroll-related costs
    for employees in the Company’s development and information
    technology groups who are directly associated with, and who
    devote time to, the Company’s internal-use software
    projects during the application development stage.
    Capitalization begins when the planning stage is complete and
    the Company commits resources to the software project.
    Capitalization ceases when the software has been tested and is
    ready for its intended use. Amortization of the asset commences
    when the software is complete and placed in service. The Company
    amortizes completed internal-use software to cost of revenues
    over an estimated life of two years. Costs incurred during the
    planning, training and post implementation stages of the
    software development life-cycle are expensed as incurred. Costs
    related to upgrades and enhancements of existing internal-use
    software that increase the functionality of the software are
    also capitalized.

Concentrations
    of Credit Risk and Fair Value of Financial
    Instruments

The amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets for
    cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts
    payable approximate their fair value due to their short-term
    maturities. The fair value and the carrying amount of the
    Company’s 1% convertible senior notes were
    $347.4 million and $200.0 million, respectively, as of
    December 31, 2006. The fair value is based upon the trading
    price of the debt. The Company maintains the majority of its
    cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances
    principally with domestic financial institutions that the
    Company believes to be of high credit standing. Concentrations
    of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are primarily
    limited to certain customers to which the Company makes
    substantial sales. The Company’s customer base consists of
    a large number of geographically dispersed customers diversified
    across several industries. To reduce risk, the Company routinely
    assesses the financial strength of its customers. Based on such
    assessments, the Company believes that its accounts receivable
    credit risk exposure is limited. For the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, no customer accounted for more
    than 10% of total revenues. For the year ended December 31,
    2004,



AKAMAI
    TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

one customer accounted for 10% of total revenues. As of
    December 31, 2006, no customer had an account receivable
    balance greater than 10% of total accounts receivable. As of
    December 31, 2005, one customer had an account receivable
    balance of 13% of the Company’s total accounts receivable.
    The Company believes that, as of December 31, 2006,
    concentration of credit risk related to accounts receivable was
    not significant.

Taxes

The Company’s provision for income taxes is comprised of a
    current and a deferred portion. The current income tax provision
    is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on
    tax returns for the current year. The deferred income tax
    provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects
    attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards using
    expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the
    differences are expected to reverse or the carryforwards are
    expected to be realized.

The Company currently has significant deferred tax assets,
    resulting from net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit
    carryforwards and deductible temporary differences. Management
    periodically weighs the positive and negative evidence to
    determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the
    deferred tax assets will be realized. During 2005, management
    determined it was more likely than not that substantially all of
    the deferred tax assets would be realized, and, accordingly
    released substantially all of its valuation allowance. This
    decision was based on the Company’s cumulative history of
    earnings before taxes for financial reporting purposes over a

12-quarter

period and on the projections of expected future taxable income.
    The tax assets estimated to be realized in future periods have
    been calculated by applying a blended federal and state tax rate
    of 39.1%, which is based upon the tax rates expected to be in
    effect, apportioned by jurisdiction, in the periods during which
    the attributes are expected to be utilized. Changes in this
    blended rate in future periods could have a material effect on
    both the tax provision in the period of change as well as the
    net deferred tax asset carrying value.

The Company has recorded certain tax reserves to address
    potential exposures involving its sales and use and franchise
    tax positions. These potential tax liabilities result from the
    varying application of statutes, rules, regulations and
    interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions. The
    Company’s estimate of the value of its tax reserves
    contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments
    about the interpretation of statutes, rules and regulations by
    taxing jurisdictions. It is possible that the costs of the
    ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be
    materially greater or less than the amount that the Company
    estimated.

In November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
    SFAS 123(R)-3, “Transition Election to Accounting for
    the Tax Effect of Share-Based Payment Awards.” The Company
    has elected to adopt the modified prospective transition method
    for calculating the tax effects of stock-based compensation
    pursuant to SFAS No. 123(R). Under the modified
    prospective transition method, no adjustment is made to the
    deferred tax balances associated with stock-based payments that
    continue to be classified as equity awards. Additionally, the
    Company elected to use the “long-form method,” as
    provided in paragraph 81 of SFAS No. 123(R) to
    determine the pool of windfall tax benefits. The long-form
    method requires the Company to analyze the book and tax
    compensation for each award separately as if it had been issued
    following the recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123,
    subject to adjustments for net operating loss (“NOL”)
    carryforwards.

Foreign
    Currency Translation

Akamai has determined that the functional currency of its
    foreign subsidiaries is each respective subsidiary’s local
    currency. The assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are
    translated at the applicable exchange rate as of the balance
    sheet date and revenues and expenses are translated at an
    average rate over the period. Currency translation adjustments
    are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Gains
    and losses on inter-company transactions are recorded in other
    income (expense), net. For the years ended December 31,
    2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded foreign currency gain
    (loss) of $90,000, ($1.5) million and $543,000 respectively.

Cash,
    Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash held in bank deposit
    accounts and short-term, highly liquid investments with original
    maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. Cash
    equivalents are carried at amortized cost plus accrued interest,
    which approximates fair value. Total cash and cash equivalents
    were $434.5 million and $314.1 million at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Short-term marketable securities consist of high quality
    corporate and government securities with original maturities of
    more than three months at the date of purchase and less than one
    year from the date of the balance sheet. Long-term marketable
    securities consist of high quality corporate and government
    securities with maturities of more than one year from the date
    of the balance sheet. Short-term and long-term marketable
    securities include investments that are restricted as to use. As
    of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had
    $4.2 million and $4.5 million, respectively, of
    restricted marketable securities generally representing security
    for irrevocable letters of credit related to facility leases.

The Company classifies all debt securities and equity securities
    with readily determinable market values as “available for
    sale” in accordance with SFAS No. 115,
    “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
    Securities.” These investments are classified as marketable
    securities on the consolidated balance sheet and are carried at
    fair market value with unrealized gains and losses considered to
    be temporary in nature reported as a separate component of other
    comprehensive income (loss). Investments in securities of
    private companies are initially carried at cost. The Company
    reviews all investments for reductions in fair value that are

other-than-temporary.

When such reductions occur, the cost of the investment is
    adjusted to fair value through loss on investments on the
    consolidated statement of operations. Gains and losses on
    investments are calculated on the basis of specific
    identification.

Accounts
    Receivable and Related Reserves

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts
    and do not bear interest. In addition to trade accounts
    receivable, the Company’s accounts receivable balance
    includes unbilled accounts that represent revenues recorded for
    customers that are typically billed within one month. The
    Company records reserves against its accounts receivable
    balance. These reserves consist of allowances for doubtful
    accounts, cash basis customers and service credits. Increases
    and decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are
    included as a component of general and administrative expenses.
    The Company’s reserve for cash basis customers increases as
    services are provided to customers where collection is no longer
    assured. The reserve decreases and revenue is recognized when
    and if cash payments are received. The Company’s reserve
    for service credits increases as a result of specific service
    credits that are expected to be issued to customers during the
    ordinary course of business, as well as for billing disputes.
    These credits result in a reduction to revenues. Decreases to
    the reserve for service credits are the result of actual credits
    being issued to customers, causing a corresponding reduction in
    accounts receivable.

Estimates are used in determining these reserves and are based
    upon the Company’s review of outstanding balances on a
    customer-specific,

account-by-account

basis. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a
    review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection
    issues where the Company no longer believes that the customer
    has the ability to pay for services provided. The Company
    reserves for all invoices that have been outstanding greater
    than one year. The Company performs on-going credit evaluations
    of its customers. If such an evaluation indicates that payment
    is no longer reasonably assured for services provided, any
    future services provided to that customer will result in the
    creation of a cash basis reserve until the Company receives
    consistent payments. In addition, the Company reserves a portion
    of revenues as a reserve for service credits. Reserves for
    service credits are measured based on an analysis of revenue
    credits to be issued after the month of billing and an estimate
    for future credits. These credits typically relate to
    management’s estimate of the resolution of customer
    disputes and billing adjustments. The Company does not have any
    off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers.

Property
    and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost, net of accumulated
    depreciation and amortization. Property and equipment includes
    purchases of items with a per unit value greater than $1,000 and
    a useful life greater than one year. In certain instances, the
    Company has capitalized equipment purchases, such as laptop
    computers, that have a per unit value less than $1,000, because
    their useful lives are three years. Depreciation and
    amortization are computed on a straight-line basis over the
    estimated useful lives of the assets.

Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of related
    lease terms or their estimated useful lives. Property and
    equipment acquired under capital leases are depreciated over the
    shorter of the related lease terms or the useful lives of the
    assets. The Company periodically reviews the estimated useful
    lives of property and equipment. Changes to the estimated useful
    lives are recorded prospectively from the date of the change.
    Upon retirement or sale, the cost of the assets disposed of and
    the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the
    accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in income
    (loss) from operations. Repairs and maintenance costs are
    expensed as incurred.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

The Company tests goodwill for impairments on an annual basis or
    more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the asset might be impaired. The Company performed an
    impairment test of goodwill as of January 1, 2006 and 2007.
    These tests did not result in an impairment to goodwill. Other
    intangible assets consist of completed technologies, customer
    relationships, trademarks and non-compete agreements arising
    from acquisitions of businesses and acquired license rights.
    Purchased intangible assets, other than goodwill, are amortized
    over their estimated useful lives based upon the economic value
    derived from the related intangible asset. Goodwill is carried
    at its historical cost.

Valuation
    of Other Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment under the guidance
    of SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment
    or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” Under
    SFAS No. 144, long-lived assets are reviewed for
    impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as
    service discontinuance, technological obsolescence, a change in
    the Company’s market capitalization, facility closure or
    work-force reductions indicate that the carrying amount of the
    long-lived asset may not be recoverable. When such events occur,
    the Company compares the carrying amount of the asset to the
    undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset. If
    this comparison indicates that an impairment is present, the
    amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between
    the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. If a
    readily determinable market price does not exist, fair value is
    estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to
    the asset.

Restructuring
    Charges

A restructuring liability related to employee terminations is
    recorded by the Company when a one-time benefit arrangement is
    communicated to an employee who is involuntarily terminated as
    part of a company-wide reorganization and the amount of the
    termination benefit is known, provided that the employee is not
    required to render future services in order to receive the
    termination benefit.

The Company previously recorded real-property related
    restructuring expenses and liabilities when management approved
    and committed the Company to a plan to exit a facility lease,
    the plan specifically identified the actions to be taken and the
    actions were scheduled to begin soon after management approved
    the plan. Beginning in 2003, in accordance with
    SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated
    with Exit or Disposal Activities,” the Company records
    restructuring liabilities, discounted at the appropriate rate,
    for facility leases only when the space is both vacated and all
    actions needed to make the space readily available for sublease
    have been completed. The Company records restructuring
    liabilities for estimated costs to terminate a facility lease
    before the end of its

contractual term or for estimated costs that will continue to be
    incurred under the lease for its remaining term where there is
    no economic benefit to the Company, net of an estimate of
    sublease income.

Litigation

The Company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings.
    The Company estimates the range of liability related to pending
    litigation where the amount and range of loss can be estimated.
    The Company records its best estimate of a loss when the loss is
    considered probable. Where a liability is probable and there is
    a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range,
    the Company records the minimum estimated liability related to
    the claim. As additional information becomes available, the
    Company reassesses the potential liability related to the
    Company’s pending litigation and revises its estimate.

Advertising
    Expense

The Company recognizes advertising expense as incurred. The
    Company recognized total advertising expense of $450,000,
    $879,000 and $130,000 for the years ended December 31,
    2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
    Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”
    (“FIN No. 48”). FIN No. 48
    clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
    recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in
    accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting
    for Income Taxes.” FIN No. 48 prescribes a
    two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be
    recognized. First, the tax position must be evaluated to
    determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external
    examination. If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not
    to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine
    the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements.
    The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest
    amount that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of
    being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN No. 48 is
    effective for the Company beginning in 2007. The Company does
    not expect the implementation of FIN No. 48 to have a
    material impact on its financial statements.

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or
    the SEC, released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,
    (“SAB 108”). SAB 108 expresses the SEC
    staff’s views regarding the process of quantifying and
    recording financial statement misstatements. These
    interpretations were issued to address diversity in practice and
    the potential under current practice for the build up of
    improper amounts on the balance sheet. SAB 108 expresses
    the SEC staff’s view that a registrant’s materiality
    evaluation of an identified unadjusted error should quantify the
    effects of the error on each financial statement and related
    financial statement disclosures and that prior year
    misstatements should be considered in quantifying misstatements
    in current year financial statements. SAB 108 also states
    that correcting prior year financial statements for immaterial
    errors would not require previously filed reports to be amended.
    Such correction may be made the next time the registrant files
    the prior year financial statements. Registrants electing not to
    restate prior periods should reflect the effects of initially
    applying the guidance in SAB 108 in their annual financial
    statements covering the first fiscal year ending after
    November 15, 2006. The cumulative effect of the initial
    application should be reported in the carrying amounts of assets
    and liabilities as of the beginning of that fiscal year and the
    offsetting adjustment should be made to the opening balance of
    retained earnings for that year. Registrants should disclose the
    nature and amount of each individual error being corrected in
    the cumulative adjustment. The disclosure should also include
    when and how each error arose and the fact that the errors had
    previously been considered immaterial. The SEC staff encourages
    early application of the guidance in SAB 108 for interim
    periods of the first fiscal year ending after November 15,
    2006. The implementation of SAB 108 did not have a material
    impact on the Company’s financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements,”
    (“SFAS 157”). SFAS 157 defines “fair
    value”, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in
    generally accepted accounting principles, and expands
    disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 does
    not require any new fair value

measurements but may change current practice for some entities.
    SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for
    fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim
    periods within those years. The Company is currently evaluating
    the potential impact of SFAS 157 on the Company’s
    financial position and results of operations.

Business
    Acquisitions:

Nine
    Systems Corporation

On December 13, 2006, the Company acquired all of the
    outstanding common and preferred stock, including vested and
    unvested stock options, of Nine Systems Corporation (“Nine
    Systems”) in exchange for approximately 2.7 million
    shares of Akamai common stock, approximately $4.5 million
    in cash and options to purchase approximately
    400,000 shares of Akamai common stock. The purchase of Nine
    Systems is intended to increase the quantity and types of rich
    media management tools sold by the Company.

The aggregate purchase price, net of cash received, was
    approximately $157.7 million, which consisted of
    $133.5 million in shares of Akamai common stock,
    $19.1 million in fair value of the Company’s stock
    options, $4.5 million in cash and approximately $600,000 of
    transaction costs, which primarily consisted of fees for
    financial advisory and legal services. The fair value of the
    Company’s stock options issued to Nine Systems employees
    was estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with
    the following weighted-average assumptions:

Expected life (years)

—

The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of
    accounting and the results of operations of the acquired
    business since December 13, 2006, the date of acquisition,
    are included in the consolidated financial statements of the
    Company for the year ended December 31, 2006. The results
    of operations from this acquired business were insignificant to
    the consolidated statement of operations for 2006. The total
    purchase consideration was allocated to the assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the
    date of acquisition, as determined by management and, with
    respect to identified intangible assets, by management with the
    assistance of an appraisal provided by a third-party valuation
    firm. The purchase price allocation is preliminary and a final
    determination of purchase accounting adjustments will be made
    upon the finalization of the Company’s integration
    activities. The excess of the purchase price over the amounts
    allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been
    recorded as goodwill. The value of the goodwill from this
    acquisition can be attributed to a number of business factors
    including, but not limited to, potential sales opportunities of
    providing Akamai services to Nine Systems customers; a trained
    technical workforce in place in the United States; an existing
    sales pipeline and a trained sales force; and cost synergies
    expected to be realized. In accordance with current accounting
    standards, goodwill associated with Nine Systems will not be
    amortized and will be tested for impairment at least annually as
    required by SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets” (“SFAS No. 142”)
    (see Note 9).

In determining the purchase price allocation, the Company
    considered, among other factors, the Company’s intention to
    use the acquired assets and historical and estimated future
    demand of Nine Systems services. The fair value of intangible
    assets was based upon the income approach. The rate used to
    discount the net cash flows to their present values was based
    upon a weighted average cost of capital of 18%. The discount
    rate was determined after consideration of market rates of
    return on debt and equity capital, the weighted average return
    on invested capital and the risk associated with achieving
    forecasted sales related to the technology and assets acquired
    from Nine Systems.

The customer relationships were valued using the income
    approach. The key assumptions used in valuing the customer
    relationships are as follows: discount rate 18%, tax rate 40%
    and estimated average economic life of nine years. The customer
    relationships, trademarks and completed technology are being
    amortized based upon the expected benefit to be realized over
    each intangible’s estimated economic life. The values of
    the intangible assets acquired were determined using projections
    of revenues and expenses specifically attributed to the
    intangible assets. The income streams were then discounted to
    present value using estimated risk adjusted discount rates.

The relief-from-royalty method was used to value the completed
    technologies. The relief-from-royalty method is used to estimate
    the cost savings that accrue to the owner of an intangible asset
    that would otherwise be required



AKAMAI
    TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

to pay royalties or license fees on revenues earned through the
    use of the asset. The royalty rate used is based on an analysis
    of empirical, market-derived royalty rates for guideline
    intangible assets. Typically, revenue is projected over the
    expected remaining useful life of the intangible asset. The
    market-derived royalty rate is then applied to estimate the
    royalty savings. The key assumptions used in valuing the
    completed technologies are as follows: royalty rate 10.5%,
    discount rate 18%, tax rate 40% and estimated average economic
    life of four years.

The relief-from-royalty method was used to value trademarks. The
    relief-from-royalty method recognizes that the current value of
    an asset may be premised upon the expected receipt of future
    economic benefit in the use of trademarks and domain names.
    These benefits are generally considered to be higher income
    resulting from the avoidance of a loss in revenue that would
    likely occur without the specific trademarks and domain names.
    The key assumptions used in valuing trademarks are as follows:
    royalty rate 1%, discount rate 18%, tax rate 40% and estimated
    average economic life of five years.

The total weighted average amortization period for the
    intangible assets is 4.1 years. The intangible assets are
    being amortized based upon the pattern in which the economic
    benefit of the intangible assets are being utilized, which in
    general reflects the cash flows generated from such assets. None
    of the goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes.

In connection with the acquisition of Nine Systems, the Company
    commenced integration activities, which have resulted in
    recognizing approximately $500,000 in liabilities for employee
    termination benefits. We expect to pay the liabilities
    associated with the employee termination benefits throughout
    2007. Management is in the process of determining whether
    additional liabilities relating to employee termination benefits
    or other contractual obligations are required to be recorded.
    The impact of Nine Systems’ operating results, assuming the
    acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2006, on a
    consolidated basis would not be significant to the operations of
    the Company.

Speedera
    Networks, Inc.

In June 2005, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common
    and preferred stock, including vested and unvested stock
    options, of Speedera Networks, Inc. (“Speedera”) in
    exchange for 10.6 million shares of Akamai common stock and
    options to purchase 1.7 million shares of Akamai common
    stock. Speedera provided distributed content delivery services.
    The Company acquired Speedera because Akamai believed it would
    enable the Company to better compete against larger managed
    services vendors and other content delivery providers by
    expanding its customer base and providing customers with a
    broader suite of services.

The aggregate purchase price, net of cash received, was
    $142.2 million, which consisted of $121.5 million in
    shares of common stock based on the closing price on
    June 10, 2005, $18.2 million in fair value of the
    Company’s stock options and transaction costs of
    $2.5 million, which primarily consisted of fees for
    financial advisory and legal services. The fair value of the
    Company’s stock options issued to Speedera employees was
    estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
    following weighted-average assumptions:

The intrinsic value allocated to the unvested options issued in
    the acquisition that had yet to be earned as of the acquisition
    date was $9.3 million and has been recorded as deferred
    compensation in the purchase price allocation.

The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of
    accounting. The total purchase consideration was allocated to
    the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated
    fair values as of the date of acquisition, as determined by
    management and, with respect to identified intangible assets, by
    management with the assistance of an appraisal provided by a
    third-party valuation firm. The excess of the purchase price
    over the amounts allocated to assets acquired and liabilities
    assumed has been recorded as goodwill. The value of the goodwill
    from this acquisition can be attributed to a number of business
    factors including, but not limited to, potential sales

The customer relationships were valued using the income
    approach. The key assumptions used in valuing the customer
    relationships are as follows: discount rate 18%, tax rate 40%
    and estimated average economic life of eight years. The
    customer relationships are being amortized at the ratio that
    current revenues generated from those customer relationships
    bear to the total estimated revenues to be generated from those
    relationships from the date of acquisition. The completed
    technologies and non-compete agreements are being amortized
    using the straight-line method over their respective remaining
    lives. The values of the intangible assets acquired were
    determined using projections of revenues and expenses
    specifically attributed to the intangible assets. The income
    streams were then discounted to present value using estimated
    risk adjusted discount rates.

The relief-from-royalty method was used to value the completed
    technologies. The relief-from-royalty method is used to estimate
    the cost savings that accrue to the owner of an intangible asset
    that would otherwise be required to pay royalties or license
    fees on revenues earned through the use of the asset. The
    royalty rate used is based on an analysis of empirical,
    market-derived royalty rates for guideline intangible assets.
    Typically, revenue is projected

over the expected remaining useful life of the intangible asset.
    The market-derived royalty rate is then applied to estimate the
    royalty savings. The key assumptions used in valuing the
    completed technologies are as follows: royalty rate 5%, discount
    rate 18.0%, tax rate 40% and estimated average economic life of
    one to four years.

The lost profits method was used to value the non-compete
    agreements entered into by Akamai and three founders of
    Speedera. The lost profits method recognizes that the current
    value of an asset may be premised upon the expected receipt of
    future economic benefits protected by clauses within an
    agreement. These benefits are generally considered to be higher
    income resulting from the avoidance of a loss in revenue that
    would likely occur without an agreement. The key assumptions
    used in valuing the non-compete agreements are as follows:
    discount rate 18%, tax rate 40% and estimated average economic
    life of three years.

The following table reflects unaudited pro forma results of
    operations of the Company for the years ended December 31,
    2005 and 2004 assuming that the Speedera acquisition had

Net
    Income per Share:

Basic net income per weighted average share is computed using

    the applicable period. Diluted net income per weighted average
    share is computed using the weighted average number of common
    shares outstanding during the period, plus the dilutive effect
    of potential common stock. Potential common stock consists of
    stock options, deferred stock units, warrants, restricted stock
    units and convertible notes.

In connection with the Company’s adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R), the calculation of assumed proceeds
    used to determine the diluted weighted average shares
    outstanding under the treasury stock method in 2006 was adjusted
    by tax windfalls and shortfalls associated with all of the
    Company’s outstanding stock awards. Windfalls and
    shortfalls are computed by comparing the tax deductible amount
    of outstanding stock awards to their grant date fair values and
    multiplying the result by the applicable statutory tax rate. A
    positive result creates a windfall, which increases the assumed
    proceeds and a negative result creates a shortfall, which
    reduces the assumed proceeds.

    unrealized losses were due to changes in interest rates. The
    Company has determined that the gross unrealized losses at
    December 31, 2006 are temporary. In making this
    determination, the Company considered the financial condition
    and near-term prospects of the issuers, the magnitude of the
    losses compared to the investments’ cost, the length of
    time the investments have been in an unrealized loss position
    and the Company’s ability to hold the investment to

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets:

The Company acquired goodwill and other intangible assets
    through business acquisitions during 2000, 2005 and 2006. The
    Company also acquired license rights from the Massachusetts
    Institute of Technology in 1999. During the year ended
    December 31, 2006, the Company recorded goodwill of
    $142.5 million and acquired intangible assets of
    $28.9 million as a result of the acquisition of Nine
    Systems. In 2005, the Company recorded goodwill of
    $96.3 million and acquired intangible assets of
    $43.2 million as a result of the acquisition of Speedera.
    During 2006, the Company made purchase accounting adjustments to
    reflect the deferred tax assets and liabilities

recorded as a result of filing the final pre-acquisition income
    tax return for Speedera. As a result, the Company increased its
    net deferred taxes by $1.5 million mainly due to an
    increase in the federal and state research and development
    credits, which resulted in a reduction of goodwill. The changes
    in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005 were as follows:

The Company reviews goodwill and other intangible assets for
    impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amount of these assets may exceed their fair
    value. SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets,” requires the Company to test goodwill
    for impairment at least annually. The Company concluded that it
    had one reporting unit and assigned the entire balance of
    goodwill to this reporting unit as of January 1, 2006 and
    2007 for purposes of performing an impairment test. The fair
    value of the reporting unit was determined using the
    Company’s market capitalization as of January 1, 2006
    and 2007. The fair value on January 1, 2006 and 2007
    exceeded the net assets of the reporting unit, including
    goodwill, as of both dates. Accordingly, the Company concluded
    that no impairment existed as of these dates. Unless changes in
    events or circumstances indicate that an impairment test is
    required, the Company will next test goodwill for impairment on
    January 1, 2008.

The Company has issued letters of credit in the amount of
    $4.2 million related to certain of its real estate leases.
    These letters of credit are collateralized by marketable
    securities that have been restricted as to use (see
    Note 6). The letters of credit expire as the Company
    fulfills its operating lease obligations. Certain of the
    Company’s facility leases include rent escalation clauses.
    The Company normalizes rent expense on a straight-line basis
    over the term of the lease for known changes in lease payments
    over the life of the lease. In the event that the landlord
    provided funding for lease improvements to leased facilities,
    the Company would amortize such amount as part of rent expense
    on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.

Litigation

Between July 2, 2001 and November 7, 2001, purported
    class action lawsuits seeking monetary damages were filed in the
    United States District Court for the Southern District of New
    York against the Company as well as against the underwriters of
    its October 28, 1999 initial public offering of common
    stock. The complaints were filed allegedly on behalf of persons
    who purchased the Company’s common stock during different
    time periods, all beginning on October 28, 1999 and ending
    on various dates. The complaints are similar and allege
    violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934 primarily based on the allegation that the
    underwriters received undisclosed compensation in connection
    with the Company’s initial public offering. On
    April 19, 2002, a single consolidated amended complaint was
    filed, reiterating in one pleading the allegations contained in
    the previously filed separate actions. The consolidated amended
    complaint defines the alleged class period as October 28,
    1999 through December 6, 2000. A Special Litigation
    Committee of Akamai’s Board of Directors authorized
    management to negotiate a settlement of the pending claims
    substantially consistent with a Memorandum of Understanding that
    was negotiated among class plaintiffs, all issuer defendants and
    their insurers. The parties negotiated a settlement which is
    subject to approval by the Court. On February 15, 2005, the
    Court issued an Opinion and Order preliminarily approving the
    settlement, provided that the defendants and plaintiffs agree to
    a modification narrowing the scope of the bar order set forth in
    the original settlement agreement. The parties agreed to a
    modification narrowing the scope of the bar order, and on
    August 31, 2005, and the Court issued an order
    preliminarily approving the settlement. On December 5,
    2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
    overturned the District Court’s certification of the class
    of plaintiffs who are pursuing the claims that would be settled
    in the settlement against the underwriter defendants. Plaintiffs
    filed a Petition for Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc with the
    Second Circuit on January 5, 2007 in response to the Second
    Circuit’s decision and have informed the District Court
    that they would like to be heard as to whether the settlement
    may still be approved even if the decision of the Court of
    Appeals is not reversed. The District Court indicated that it
    would defer consideration of final approval of the settlement
    pending plaintiffs’ request for further appellate review.
    The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the
    claims made in the complaint and, if the settlement is not
    finalized and approved, it intends to contest the lawsuit
    vigorously. An adverse resolution of the action could have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
    condition and results of operations in the period in which the
    lawsuit is resolved. The Company is not presently able to
    estimate potential losses, if any, related to this lawsuit if
    the settlement is not finalized and approved.

The Company and Speedera were involved in lawsuits against each
    other regarding patent infringement and false advertising and
    trade secrets claims. Upon completion of the acquisition of
    Speedera, all lawsuits between Akamai and Speedera were
    dismissed.

The Company is party to various litigation matters that
    management considers routine and incidental to its business.
    Management does not expect the results of any of these actions
    to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    business, results of operations or financial condition.

Guarantees

The Company has identified the guarantees described below as
    disclosable in accordance with FASB Interpretation 45
    (“FIN 45”), “Guarantor’s Accounting and
    Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
    Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an interpretation of FASB
    Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and

rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34.” The Company
    evaluates estimated losses for guarantees under
    SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies, as
    Interpreted by FIN 45.” The Company considers such
    factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome
    and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of
    loss. To date, the Company has not encountered material costs as
    a result of such obligations and has not accrued any liabilities
    related to such guarantees in its financial statements.

As permitted under Delaware law, the Company’s Certificate
    of Incorporation provides that Akamai indemnify each of its
    officers and directors during his or her lifetime for certain
    events or occurrences that happen by reason of the fact that the
    officer or director is or was or has agreed to serve as an
    officer or director of the Company. The maximum potential amount
    of future payments the Company could be required to make under
    these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, the
    Company has a Director and Officer insurance policy that limits
    its exposure and would enable the Company to recover a portion
    of certain future amounts paid.

The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in
    the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements,
    the Company agrees to indemnify, hold harmless, and reimburse
    the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the
    indemnified party, generally Akamai’s business partners or
    customers, in connection with Akamai’s provision of its
    services and software. Generally, these obligations are limited
    to claims relating to infringement of a U.S. patent, or any
    copyright or other intellectual property or the Company’s
    negligence, willful misconduct or violation of the law (provided
    that there is not gross negligence or willful misconduct on the
    part of the other party). Subject to applicable statutes of
    limitation, the term of these indemnification agreements is
    generally perpetual from the time of execution of the agreement.
    The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company
    could be required to make under these indemnification agreements
    is unlimited; however, the Company carries insurance that covers
    certain third party claims relating to its services and could
    limit the Company’s exposure.

The Company acquired all of the stock of three companies in
    2000, as well as all of the stock of two other companies in 2005
    and 2006. As part of those acquisitions, the Company assumed the
    liability for undisclosed claims and losses previously incurred
    by such companies. Subject to applicable statutes of
    limitations, these obligations are generally perpetual from the
    time of execution of the agreement. The maximum potential amount
    of future payments the Company could be required to make in
    connection with these obligations is unlimited. The Company does
    not currently expect the costs of defending lawsuits or settling
    claims related to these acquired companies to be material.

The Company leases space in certain buildings, including a
    corporate headquarters building, under operating leases. The
    Company has standard indemnification arrangements under those
    leases that require it to indemnify the landlord against losses,
    liabilities, and claims incurred in connection with the premises
    covered by the Company leases, its use of the premises, property
    damage or personal injury, and breach of the lease agreement, as
    well as occurrences arising from the Company’s negligence
    or willful misconduct. The Company also subleases certain space
    and agrees to indemnify the sublessee for losses caused by the
    Company’s employees on the premises. Subject to applicable
    statutes of limitation, the term of these indemnification
    agreements is generally perpetual from the time of execution of
    the agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments
    the Company could be required to make under these
    indemnification agreements is unlimited. The Company has never
    incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to
    these indemnification agreements.

The Company entered into three joint ventures in 2001 and 2002,
    which have since terminated. The terms of the joint venture
    agreements generally provide that the Company indemnify the
    joint venture partner against property damage or bodily injury
    arising from the Company’s negligence or willful
    misconduct; third party claims of copyright infringement or
    trade secret theft associated with the software or marks
    licensed from the Company by the partner; and losses arising
    from any breach by the Company of its representations and
    warranties. Subject to applicable statutes of limitation, the
    term of these indemnification agreements is generally perpetual
    from the time of execution of the agreement. The maximum
    potential amount of future payments the Company could be
    required

to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. The
    Company has never incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle
    claims related to these indemnification agreements.

The Company leases certain equipment under operating leases that
    require it to indemnify the lessor against losses, liabilities
    and claims in connection with the lease agreement, possession or
    use of the leased equipment, and in some cases certain tax
    issues. Subject to applicable statutes of limitation, the term
    of these indemnification agreements is generally perpetual from
    the time of execution of the agreement. The maximum potential
    amount of future payments the Company could be required to make
    under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. The Company
    has never incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims
    related to these indemnification agreements.

The Company licenses technology to certain third parties under
    license agreements that provide for Akamai to indemnify the
    third parties against claims of patent and copyright
    infringement. This indemnity does not apply in the case where
    the licensed technology has been modified by the third party or
    combined with other technology, hardware, or data that the
    Company has not approved. Subject to applicable statutes of
    limitation, the term of these indemnification agreements is
    generally perpetual from the time of execution of the agreement.
    The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company
    could be required to make under these indemnification agreements
    is unlimited. The Company has never incurred costs to defend
    lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification
    agreements.

The Company licenses technology from third parties under
    agreements that contain standard indemnification provisions that
    require the Company to indemnify the third party against losses,
    liabilities and claims arising from the Company’s
    unauthorized use or modification of the licensed technology.
    Subject to applicable statutes of limitation, the term of these
    indemnification agreements is generally perpetual from the time

Convertible
    Notes:

1% Convertible
    Senior Notes

In January 2004 and December 2003, Akamai issued
    $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of
    1% convertible senior notes due December 15, 2033 for
    aggregate proceeds of $194.1 million, net of an initial
    purchaser’s discount and offering expenses of
    $5.9 million. The initial conversion price of the
    1% convertible senior notes is $15.45 per share
    (equivalent to 64.7249 shares of common stock per $1,000
    principal amount of 1% convertible senior notes). The notes
    may be converted at the option of the holder in the following
    circumstances:

•

during any calendar quarter commencing after March 31,
    2004, if the closing sale price of the common stock for at least
    20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days
    ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter
    is more than 120% of the conversion price in effect on such last
    trading day;

•

if the convertible notes are called for redemption;

•

if the Company makes specified distributions on its common stock
    or engages in specified transactions; and

•

during the five trading day period immediately following any
    ten-consecutive trading day period in which the trading price
    per $1,000 principal amount of the convertible notes for each
    day of such

ten-day

period is less than 95% of the product of the closing sale price
    per share of the Company’s common stock on that day
    multiplied by the number of shares of its common stock issuable
    upon conversion of $1,000 principal amount of the convertible
    notes.

Since December 2005, the first conversion term discussed above
    has been met; however, no notes had been converted as of
    December 31, 2006. The Company may redeem the
    1% convertible senior notes on or after December 15,
    2010 at the Company’s option at 100% of the principal
    amount together with accrued and unpaid

interest. Conversely, holders of the 1% convertible senior notes
    may require the Company to repurchase the notes at par value on
    certain specified dates beginning on December 15, 2010. In
    the event of a change of control, the holders may require Akamai
    to repurchase their 1% convertible senior notes at a repurchase
    price of 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest.
    Interest on the 1% convertible senior notes began to accrue
    as of the issue date and is payable semiannually on June 15 and
    December 15 of each year. Deferred financing costs of
    $5.9 million, including the initial purchaser’s
    discount and other offering expenses, for the
    1% convertible senior notes are being amortized over the
    first seven years of the term of the notes to reflect the put
    and call rights discussed above. Amortization of deferred
    financing costs of the 1% convertible senior notes was
    $841,000 for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and
    2005 and $839,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004. The
    Company records the amortization of deferred financing costs
    using the interest method as interest expense in the
    consolidated statement of operations.

    repurchased notes and premium paid of $481,000 and $889,000,
    respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2005, to loss
    on early extinguishment of debt. For the years ended
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, amortization of deferred
    financing costs was approximately $175,000 and $543,000,
    respectively.

    $131.5 million in aggregate principal amount of its
    outstanding


/

    subordinated notes for total cash payments of
    $133.9 million. The purchase prices ranged between
    $1,018.00 and $1,023.57 for each $1,000 in principal amount
    repurchased. Additionally, in February 2004, the Company
    commenced a tender offer to repurchase up to $101.0 million
    in aggregate principal amount of its outstanding

    subordinated notes at a purchase price between $1,000 and $1,005
    for each $1,000 of principal amount tendered. In March 2004, the

    at which it was willing to repurchase the

    subordinated notes to $1,012.50 per $1,000 principal amount of

    amount of the

    subordinated notes for a total cash payment of
    $38.3 million. The purchase price was $1,012.50 for each

    December 31, 2004, the Company charged the outstanding
    deferred financing costs relating to the repurchased notes and
    the premium paid of $2.5 million and $2.8 million,
    respectively, to loss on early extinguishment of debt.
    Additionally, the Company incurred $1.5 million of advisory
    services and offering expenses in connection with the tender
    offer and repurchases, which is included in loss on early
    extinguishment of debt.

Restructurings
    and Lease Terminations:

As of December 31, 2006, the Company had $2.1 million
    of accrued restructuring liabilities. As part of the Speedera
    and Nine System acquisitions, the Company’s management
    committed to plans to exit certain activities of these entities.
    In accordance with EITF

No. 95-3,

“Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase
    Business Combination,” the Company recorded a liability of
    $1.8 million and $500,000 related to workforce reductions
    during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006,
    respectively. These liabilities primarily consisted of employee
    severance and outplacement costs. The Company expects that these
    liabilities will be fully paid by June 2008.

    Company’s lessors and real estate advisors as to the
    likelihood that the Company will be able to partially offset its
    obligations with sublease income.

Rights
    Plan and Series A Junior Participating Preferred
    Stock:

On September 10, 2002, the Board of Directors of the
    Company (the “Board of Directors”) declared a dividend
    of one preferred stock purchase right for each outstanding share
    of the Company’s common stock held by stockholders of
    record at the close of business on September 23, 2002. To
    implement the rights plan, the Board of Directors designated
    700,000 shares of the Company’s 5.0 million
    authorized shares of undesignated preferred stock as
    Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value
    $.01 per share. Each right entitles the registered holder
    to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of
    preferred stock at a purchase price of $9.00 in cash, subject to
    adjustment. No shares of Series A Junior Participating
    Preferred Stock are outstanding as of December 31, 2006. In
    January 2004, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an
    amendment to the rights plan in which the purchase price of each
    right issued under the plan increased from $9.00 per share
    to $65.00 per share.

Stock-Based
    Compensation:

Equity
    Plans

In 1998, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board
    of Directors”) adopted the 1998 Stock Incentive Plan (the
    “1998 Plan”) for the issuance of incentive and
    nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards and other
    types of equity awards. Options to purchase common stock and
    other equity awards are granted at the discretion of the Board
    of Directors or a committee thereof. In October 2005, the Board
    of Directors delegated to the Company’s Chief Executive
    Officer the authority to grant equity incentive awards to
    employees of the Company below the level of Vice President,
    subject to certain specified limitations. In December 2001, the
    Board of Directors adopted the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan (the
    “2001 Plan”) for the issuance of nonqualified stock
    options, restricted stock awards and other types of equity
    awards. In March 2006, the Board of Directors adopted the Akamai
    Technologies, Inc. 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2006
    Plan”) for the issuance of incentive and nonqualified stock
    options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and
    other types of equity awards. The stockholders of the Company
    approved the adoption of the 2006 Plan in May 2006. The total
    number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the
    1998 Plan, the 2001 Plan and the 2006 Plan is 48,255,600,
    5,000,000 and 7,500,000 shares, respectively. Equity
    incentive awards may not be issued to the Company’s
    directors or executive officers under the 2001 Plan. As of
    December 31, 2006, no stock options or other equity
    incentive awards had been issued under the 2006 Plan.

Under the terms of the 1998 Plan and the 2006 Plan, the exercise
    price of incentive stock options may not be less than 100% (110%
    in certain cases) of the fair market value of the common stock
    on the date of grant. Incentive stock options may not be issued
    under the 2001 Plan. The exercise price of nonqualified stock
    options issued under the 1998 Plan, the 2001 Plan and the 2006
    Plan may be less than the fair market value of the common stock
    on the date of grant, as determined by the Board of Directors,
    but in no case may the exercise price be less than the statutory
    minimum. Stock option vesting is typically four years under all
    of the plans, and options are granted at the discretion of the
    Board of Directors. Under the 1998 Plan and 2001 Plan, the term
    of options granted may not exceed ten years, or five years for
    incentive stock options granted to holders of more than 10% of
    the Company’s voting stock. Under the 2006 Plan, the term
    of options granted may not exceed seven years.

The Company has assumed certain stock option plans and the
    outstanding stock options of companies that it has acquired
    (“Assumed Plans”). Stock options outstanding as of the
    date of acquisition under the Assumed Plans have been exchanged
    for the Company’s stock options and adjusted to reflect the
    appropriate conversion ratio as specified by the applicable
    acquisition agreement, but are otherwise administered in
    accordance with the terms of the Assumed Plans. Stock options
    under the Assumed Plans generally vest over four years and
    expire ten years from the date of grant. No additional stock
    options have been or will be granted under the Assumed Plans.

In August 1999, the Board of Directors adopted the 1999 ESPP.
    The Company reserved 3,100,000 shares of common stock for
    issuance under the 1999 ESPP. In May 2002, the stockholders of
    the Company approved an amendment to the 1999 ESPP that allows
    for an automatic increase in the number of shares of common
    stock available under the 1999 ESPP each June 1 and
    December 1 to restore the number of shares available for
    issuance to 1,500,000 shares, provided that the aggregate
    number of shares issued under the 1999 ESPP shall not exceed
    20,000,000. In April 2005, the Company’s Board of Directors
    approved amendments to the 1999 ESPP as follows: the duration of
    the offering periods was decreased from 24 months to six
    months; the number of times a participant may elect to change
    his or her percentage during an offering period was changed from
    four times to two times; the definition of
    “compensation” was amended to clarify that it includes
    cash bonuses and other cash incentive programs; and a provision
    was added to clarify that upon termination of an offering
    period, each eligible participant will be automatically enrolled
    in the next offering period. These amendments became effective
    in June 2005. The 1999 ESPP allows participants to purchase
    shares of common stock at a 15% discount from the fair market
    value of the stock as determined on specific dates at six-month
    intervals. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005
    and 2004, the Company issued 295,113, 475,776 and
    1,598,947 shares under the 1999 ESPP, respectively, with a
    weighted average purchase price per share of $22.00, $9.70 and
    $3.17, respectively. Total cash proceeds from the purchase of
    shares under the 1999 ESPP in 2006, 2005 and 2004 were
    $6.5 million, $4.6 million and $4.7 million,

respectively. As of December 31, 2006, $1.0 million

    1999 ESPP.

Impact
    of the Adoption of SFAS No. 123(R)

The Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified
    prospective transition method, which requires the application of
    the accounting standard as of January 1, 2006, the first
    day of Akamai’s fiscal year 2006. Under the modified
    prospective transition method, stock-based compensation expense
    recognized during the year ended December 31, 2006
    includes: shares issued under the 1999 ESPP during the offering
    period commencing on December 1, 2005, based on the
    grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original
    provisions of SFAS No. 123; shares issued under the
    1999 ESPP during the offering period commencing on each of
    June 1, 2006 and December 1, 2006, based on the
    grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the
    provisions of SFAS No. 123(R); stock options and
    deferred stock units granted prior to, but not yet vested as of
    January 1, 2006 based on the grant-date fair value
    estimated in accordance with the original provisions of
    SFAS No. 123; and stock options, deferred stock units
    and restricted stock units granted after December 31, 2005,
    based on the grant-date fair value, in accordance with the
    provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). Under the modified
    prospective transition method, results for prior periods are not
    restated; accordingly, the results of operations for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 and future periods will not be
    comparable to the Company’s historical results.

For stock options, Akamai has selected the Black-Scholes option
    pricing model to determine the fair value of the Company’s
    stock option awards. The estimated fair value of Akamai’s
    stock-based awards, less expected forfeitures, is amortized over
    the awards’ vesting period on a straight-line basis.
    Deferred compensation related to awards granted prior to
    January 1, 2006 has been included in additional paid-in
    capital on the balance sheet at December 31, 2006; as of
    and prior to December 31, 2005, it was carried as a
    separate line item entitled “deferred compensation” in
    the stockholders’ equity portion of the balance sheet.
    SFAS No. 123(R) also changes the reporting of
    tax-related amounts within the statement of cash flows. The
    excess windfall tax benefits resulting from stock-based
    compensation has been reported as a separate line item entitled
    “excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation” in
    the consolidated statement of cash flows.

The fair value of Akamai’s ESPP awards granted during year

Expected volatilities are based on the Company’s historical
    volatility and implied volatility from traded options in its
    stock. The Company uses historical data to estimate the expected
    life of options granted within the valuation model. The
    risk-free interest rate for periods commensurate with the
    expected life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury
    yield rate in effect at the time of grant.

As of December 31, 2006, total pre-tax unrecognized
    compensation cost for stock options, restricted stock units,
    deferred stock units and the 1999 ESPP awards was
    $107.5 million. This non-cash expense will be recognized
    through 2014 over a weighted average period of 1.5 years.
    Nearly all of the Company’s employees have received grants
    through these equity compensation programs.

As a result of adopting SFAS No. 123(R), the
    Company’s income before taxes for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 was $7.5 million lower than if the
    Company had continued to account for share-based compensation
    under Accounting Principles Bulletin No. 25,
    “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB
    No. 25”). Net income for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 was $4.4 million lower than if the
    Company had continued to account for share-based compensation
    under APB No. 25. Basic and diluted earnings per share for
    the year ended December 31, 2006 would have been $0.40 and
    $0.36, respectively, had the Company not adopted
    SFAS No. 123(R), compared to reported basic and
    diluted earnings per share of $0.37 and $0.34, respectively, for
    such period.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company
    presented all tax benefits of deductions resulting from
    exercises of stock options as operating cash flows in the
    consolidated statement of cash flows. SFAS No. 123(R)
    requires the cash flows resulting from excess windfall tax
    benefits to be classified as financing cash flows, rather than
    as operating cash flows. The $32.5 million in excess
    windfall tax benefit classified as a financing cash inflow for
    2006 would have been classified as an operating cash inflow had
    the Company not adopted SFAS No. 123(R).

Prior
    to the Adoption of SFAS No. 123(R)

For periods prior to 2006, the Company elected to apply APB
    No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for its
    stock-based compensation.

The following is a reconciliation of pro forma net income (loss)
    per weighted average share calculated as if the Company had

The fair value of Akamai’s stock options issued prior to
    the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) was estimated using a
    Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires the
    input of subjective assumptions, including expected stock price
    volatility and estimated life of each award. The fair values of
    these options was estimated assuming no expected dividends and
    the estimated life of each award, volatility and risk-free
    interest rate at the time of grant.

The fair value of Akamai’s 1999 ESPP awards granted during
    the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was estimated on

Options to purchase common stock are granted at the discretion
    of the Board of Directors, or a committee thereof or other
    designee. Options granted to date generally have a contractual
    life of ten years and typically vest 25% one year from date of
    grant, and the remaining 75% vest in twelve equal quarterly
    installments so that all options are vested at the end of four
    years.

    related to

“in-the-money”

options exercisable as of December 31, 2006 was
    approximately 6.8 million.

Deferred
    Stock Units

In May 2006, the Company granted an aggregate of 33,545 deferred
    stock units (“DSUs”) under the Company’s 1998
    Plan to non-employee members of its Board of Directors and its
    Executive Chairman. During 2005 and 2004, the Company granted an
    aggregate of 109,876 DSUs to non-employee members of its Board
    of Directors and to the Company’s Executive Chairman. Each
    DSU represents the right to receive one share of the
    Company’s common stock upon vesting. The holder may elect
    to defer receipt of all or a portion of the vested shares of
    stock represented by the DSU for a period for at least one year
    but not more than ten years from the grant date. The DSUs
    typically vest 50% upon the first anniversary of grant date with
    the remaining 50% vesting in equal installments of 12.5% each
    quarter thereafter.

In September 2006, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted
    a policy (the “Policy”) with respect to the payment of
    compensation to a director in good standing upon such
    director’s departure from the Board. Pursuant to the
    Policy, upon a director’s departure from the Board, such
    director will receive a cash payment equal to the annual cash
    retainer payable to such director under our non-employee
    director compensation plan pro-rated through the

date of departure and 100% of the unvested shares underlying the
    DSUs held by such director will accelerate at the time of
    departure and become exercisable in full. In addition, if a
    director has completed three years of Board service at the time
    of departure, 100% of the unvested options initially granted to
    such director upon joining the Board will accelerate at the time
    of departure and become fully exercisable. As a result of the
    adoption of the Policy, the Company accelerated the remaining
    unamortized compensation expense related to DSUs issued to
    non-employee directors of $1.2 million during the third
    quarter of 2006.

The total fair value of DSUs that vested during the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $1.2 million and
    $787,000, respectively. The grant date fair value is calculated
    based upon the Company’s closing stock price on the date of
    grant. As of December 31, 2006, 45,453 shares of DSUs
    were unvested, with an aggregate intrinsic value of
    $2.4 million and a weighted average remaining contractual
    life of approximately 9.1 years. These units are expected
    to vest through May 2008. All DSUs vest upon fulfilling service
    conditions or upon a director’s departure from the Board
    under the terms of the Policy.

Restricted
    Stock Units

In 2006, the Company granted an aggregate of 834,081 restricted
    stock units (“RSUs”), respectively, to certain
    employees. These RSUs generally vest in three equal annual
    installments over the three-year period following the grant
    date. Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of the
    Company’s common stock upon vesting. The fair value of
    these RSUs was calculated based upon the Company’s closing
    stock price on date of grant, and the equity-related
    compensation expense is being recognized over the vesting period
    of three years.

Additionally, in connection with the original grants of RSUs
    noted above, the Company also granted performance-based RSUs to
    certain employees. These performance-based RSUs will only vest
    to the extent that the Company exceeds specified cumulative
    revenue and earnings per share targets for fiscal years 2006,
    2007 and 2008. The maximum number of performance-based RSUs that
    may vest is equal to 300% of the number of non-performance-based
    RSUs granted on the same date; such maximum vesting would only
    occur if the Company meets or exceeds 110% of both its
    cumulative revenue and earnings per share targets for fiscal
    years 2006, 2007 and 2008. No performance-based RSUs will vest
    if the Company fails to exceed the applicable targets. If the
    Company’s cumulative revenue

and/or

earnings per share results for the applicable years is between
    100% and 110% of the targets, the holder would receive between
    zero performance-based RSUs and the maximum deliverable amount
    set forth above. For the year ended December 31, 2006,
    management measured compensation expense for these
    performance-based RSUs based upon a review of the Company’s
    expected achievement of future cumulative

performance. Such compensation cost is being recognized over
    three years. Management will continue to review the
    Company’s expected performance and adjust the compensation
    cost, if needed, at such time.

    of December 31, 2005 no RSUs were outstanding. As of
    December 31, 2006, 3,140,124 RSUs were outstanding and
    unvested, with an aggregate intrinsic value of
    $166.8 million and a weighted average remaining contractual
    life of approximately 9.1 years. These units are expected
    to vest at various times through October 2009.

Employee
    Benefit Plan:

In January 1999, the Company established a savings plan for its
    employees that is designed to be qualified under
    Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Eligible
    employees are permitted to contribute to the 401(k) plan through
    payroll deductions within statutory and plan limits.
    Participants may select from a variety of investment options.
    Investment options do not include Akamai common stock. For 2005
    and 2006, the Company made matching contributions of


/


of the first 2% of employee contributions in each year and then
    matched


/


of the next 4% of employee contributions. The maximum amount of
    the Company match is $1,000 per employee per year. The
    Company’s contributions vest 25% per annum. The
    Company contributed approximately $627,000 and $467,000 of cash
    to the savings plan for the year ended December 31, 2006
    and 2005, respectively. The Company did not make any matching
    contributions to the 401(k) plan for the year ended

As of December 31, 2004, the Company’s United States
    and foreign net operating losses (“NOLs”) and other
    deferred tax assets were fully offset by a valuation allowance
    primarily because, pursuant to SFAS No. 109,
    “Accounting for Income Taxes,” the Company did not
    have sufficient history of income to conclude that it was more
    likely than not that the Company would be able to realize the
    tax benefits of those tax attributes. Based upon the
    Company’s cumulative history of earnings before taxes for
    financial reporting purposes over a

12-quarter

period and an assessment of the Company’s expected future
    results of operations, during the third quarter of 2005, the
    Company determined that it had become more likely than not that
    it would be able to realize a substantial portion of its United
    States and foreign NOL carryforwards prior to their expiration
    and other tax attributes. As a result, during 2005, the Company
    released a total of $349.5 million of its United States and
    foreign deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Of the
    $349.5 million, $285.8 million of the valuation
    allowance release was recorded as a discrete benefit for income
    taxes on the Company’s consolidated statement of
    operations; $61.0 million of the valuation release was
    attributable to stock option exercises, which was recorded as an
    increase in additional paid in-capital on the consolidated
    balance sheet; and approximately $2.7 million of the
    valuation release was recorded as a reduction to acquired
    goodwill and intangible assets.

As of December 31, 2006, the Company has United States
    Federal NOL carryforwards of approximately $697.3 million
    and state NOL carryforwards of approximately
    $291.4 million, which expire at various dates through 2024.
    The Company also had foreign NOL carryforwards of approximately
    $7.3 million as of December 31, 2006. The foreign NOL
    carryforwards have no expiration dates. The Company also had
    foreign NOL carryforwards of approximately $8.2 million as
    of December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2006 and
    2005, the Company had United States Federal and state research
    and development tax credit carryforwards of $16.0 million
    and $11.0 million, respectively, which will expire at
    various dates through 2026. As of December 31, 2006, the
    Company had foreign tax credit carryforwards of
    $3.5 million, which expire at various dates through 2016.

As of December 31, 2006, the Company had a remaining
    valuation allowance of $6.3 million. During the fourth
    quarter of 2006, the Company recorded additional deferred tax
    assets related to acquired NOL carryforwards from Nine Systems
    Corporation. However, these net operating losses are subject to
    limitation pursuant to section 382 of the Internal Revenue
    Code due to changes in ownership of more than 50%. Because the
    realization of these deferred tax assets does not meet the
    “more likely than not” criterion under
    SFAS No. 109, the Company recorded a valuation
    allowance of $4.4 million against the acquired NOLs. The
    Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance of
    $1.9 million related to certain state NOLs that it expects
    to expire unused.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

    approximately $1.5 million of undistributed foreign
    earnings.

Segment
    Information:

Akamai’s chief decision-maker, as defined under
    SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures About Segments of an
    Enterprise and Related Information,” is the Chief Executive
    Officer and the executive management team. As of
    December 31, 2006, Akamai operated in one business segment:
    providing global services for accelerating and improving the
    delivery of content and applications over the Internet.

The Company deploys its servers into networks worldwide. As of
    December 31, 2006, the Company had approximately
    $69.0 million and $17.6 million of property and
    equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, located in the
    United States and foreign locations, respectively. As of
    December 31, 2005, the Company had approximately
    $36.3 million and $8.6 million of property and
    equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, located in the
    United States and foreign locations, respectively. Akamai sells
    its services and licenses through a sales force located both
    domestically and abroad. For the years ended December 31,
    2006 and 2005, approximately 22% and 21%, respectively, of
    revenues was derived from the Company’s operations outside
    the United States, of which 18% and 16% of overall revenues,
    respectively, related to Europe. For the year ended
    December 31, 2004, approximately 19% of revenues was
    derived from the Company’s operations outside the United
    States, of which 14% of overall revenues related to Europe. No
    single country accounted for 10% or more of revenues derived
    outside of the United States.

20.

Quarterly
    Financial Results (unaudited):

The following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly
    results of operations of the Company for the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005. In the opinion of management,
    this information has been prepared on the same basis as the
    audited consolidated financial statements and all necessary
    adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments,
    have been included in the amounts below for a fair statement of
    the quarterly information when read in conjunction with the
    audited consolidated financial statements and related notes
    included elsewhere in this annual report on

Form 10-K.

The quarterly financial data for the third quarter of 2005
    includes the discrete impact of the release of the
    Company’s United States and foreign deferred tax asset
    valuation allowance. Based upon the Company’s cumulative
    operating results and an assessment of its expected future
    results, the Company determined that is was more likely than not
    that its deferred tax assets will be realized (see
    Note 18). During the third and fourth quarters of 2005, the
    total valuation allowance release recorded as an income tax
    benefit in the statement of operations was $258.1 million
    and $27.7 million, respectively. Such benefits were
    partially offset by normal tax expense for the period.

On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted, on a modified
    prospective basis, the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R),
    which requires the Company to record compensation expense for
    employee stock awards based on the fair value at the time of
    grant. As a result, the Company’s stock-based compensation
    expense increased in 2006, causing net income to decrease
    significantly. For the three months ended March 31, 2006,
    June 30, 2006, September 30, 2006 and
    December 31, 2006, the Company’s pre-tax stock
    compensation expense was $7.1 million, $13.2 million,
    $14.5 million and $14.8 million, respectively.

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our
    disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2006.
    Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and
    Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31,
    2006, our disclosure controls and procedures were
    (1) effective in that they were designed to ensure that
    material information relating to us, including our consolidated
    subsidiaries, is made known to our Chief Executive Officer and
    Chief Financial Officer by others within those entities,
    particularly during the period in which this report was being
    prepared and (2) effective, in that they provide reasonable
    assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the
    reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
    Commission’s rules and forms.

Management’s
    Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal
    control over financial reporting is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

or

15d-15(f)

promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal
    executive and principal financial officers and effected by the
    company’s board of directors, management and other
    personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles and includes those
    policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of the assets of the company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
    that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
    only in accordance with authorizations of management and
    directors of the company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

To assist management, we have established an internal audit
    function to verify and monitor our internal controls and
    procedures. Because of its inherent limitations, however,
    internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
    detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of
    effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
    controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
    or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
    may deteriorate.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006. In making this assessment, our
    management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework.

Based on our assessment, management concluded that, as of
    December 31, 2006, our internal control over financial
    reporting was effective based on those criteria at the
    reasonable assurance level.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006 has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in
    Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.



Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

No changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as
    defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Exchange Act) occurred during the fiscal quarter ended
    December 31, 2006 that have materially affected, or are
    reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
    over financial reporting.
