ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K

For the Fiscal Year Ended December 31,

PART I

Item 1.

Business

Overview

Akamai Technologies, Inc. is a leading provider
of secure, outsourced e-business infrastructure services and
software. These services and software enable enterprises to
reduce the complexity and cost of deploying and operating a
uniform Internet Protocol, or IP, infrastructure while ensuring
superior performance, reliability, scalability and
manageability. We principally target enterprises and government
entities as our customers. Our services give our commercial
customers a competitive advantage by providing a rich experience
for their end user customers without the need to manage and
deploy a complex internal infrastructure. Our intelligent edge
platform for content, streaming media, and application delivery
is comprised of more than 13,500 servers within over 1,000
networks in 66 countries. We were incorporated in Delaware in
1998 and have our corporate headquarters at 500 Technology
Square, Cambridge, Massachusetts. We operate in one business
segment: outsourced e-business infrastructure services and
software.

We offer enterprises a more effective, reliable
and scalable method for delivering Web content and applications
over global networks using IP technology. We began selling our
content delivery services in 1999 under the trade name FreeFlow.
Through our acquisitions of Network


Communications,
Inc., which we refer to as Network


, and InterVu, Inc.,
which we refer to as InterVu, during 2000, we enhanced the
streaming media delivery services in our service portfolio. Also
during 2000, we introduced traffic management services that
allow customers to monitor traffic patterns on their Web
properties both on a continual basis and for specific events. We
also introduced software that identifies the geographic location
and network origin from which site visitors access our
customer’s Web sites, enabling content providers to
customize content without compromising user privacy.

In October 2000, we launched our EdgeSuite
offering, a suite of services that allows for the
high-performance and dynamic delivery of Web content and
applications to end users, wherever they are located globally.
These services include content and application delivery, content
targeting and personalization, business intelligence and
streaming media. We view EdgeSuite as our core service offering
for 2002.

Our services are easy to implement and are highly
scalable. Using our software utility, a customer controls which
pieces of its Web site will be delivered over our platform.
Historically, our FreeFlow customers selected
bandwidth-intensive content for delivery over our platform,
typically rich non-text objects such as photographs, banner
advertisements and graphics. With the introduction of our
EdgeSuite service, customers may dynamically deliver a broader
range of content and applications — such as
e-commerce, customer relationship management tools, pay-per-view
video, software updates, and even entire Web sites —
over our platform. This enables us to locate applications and
content geographically closer to end users. Using the
proprietary algorithms we have developed that continuously
monitor and load-balance our network in real-time, we determine
the most efficient methods and routes available for delivering
the applications and content to our customers’ end users.

Industry Background

The end of the 20th century witnessed the
explosive growth of the Internet and the emergence of
e-business. E-business is the use of IP technologies to
streamline processes, improve productivity and increase
efficiencies, enabling enterprises to easily communicate with
customers, vendors and partners, connect back-end data systems
and transact commerce in a secure manner. The Internet, however,
is a complex system of networks that was not originally created
to accommodate the volume or sophistication of today’s
business communication demands. As a result, information is
frequently delayed or lost on its way through Internet as a
result of many potential bottlenecks, including:

•

bandwidth constraints between an end user and its
	network provider, such as an Internet Service Provider, or ISP,
	cable provider or digital subscriber line provider;

•

Internet traffic exceeding the capacity of
	routing equipment;



•

inefficient or nonfunctioning peering points, or
	points of connection, between ISPs; and

•

clogging of data centers.

In addition to the explosive growth of the
Internet, enterprises have widely deployed IP technology on
their public Internet Web sites, their internal networks,
commonly called Intranets, and their networks that are
accessible by their customers, partners, and vendors, commonly
called Extranets. This convergence of applications toward using
IP technology is raising the demand that all IP
networks — Internet, Intranet and Extranet —
function with better performance and reliability. Akamai’s
services address these demands for enterprise customers.

Driven by competition, globalization and
cost-containment strategies, e-business is becoming a critical
component for corporate enterprises. These trends require
enterprises to rely on an agile e-business infrastructure to
meet their real-time strategic and business objectives. We
expect enterprises to favor more decentralized information
technology architecture to support their goals of disaster
recovery, high availability, denial-of-service mitigation and
back up. We also anticipate that enterprises will continue to
expand their use of IP-based technologies.

Our Solutions

Akamai offers a broad range of secure, outsourced
e-business infrastructure solutions and software that enable
customers to reduce the complexity and cost of deploying and
operating a uniform IP infrastructure while ensuring superior
performance, reliability, scalability, and manageability.
Forming the core of these solutions is our EdgeSuite offering, a
suite of services that allows enterprises to maximize
performance and minimize cost while distributing their Web
content and applications using IP technology.

By moving electronic content and applications
closer to our customers’ end users, our EdgeSuite service
allows enterprises to improve the end-user experience, boost
reliability and scalability and reduce the cost of their
e-business infrastructure. In contrast to our traditional
content delivery services, our EdgeSuite offering is applied
across an entire site’s content — not just the
large objects such as graphics or video. We believe that our
EdgeSuite service is the only service available in the industry
capable of providing the benefits of distributed performance to
an enterprise’s entire Web site and all aspects of its
applications. Our EdgeSuite offering substantially reduces the
amount of Internet infrastructure required to maintain a global
IP presence. Site owners maintain a single-source copy of
applications and content, and our EdgeSuite service provides
global delivery, load balancing and storage, thereby enabling
businesses to focus valuable resources on strategic matters,
rather than tactical infrastructure issues.

Customers of our EdgeSuite service have access to
the following service and software features:

•

Secure Content

Enterprises are increasingly aware that having
	the ability to transmit content securely over the Internet is a
	crucial component of their e-business program. Our services
	offer support for the distribution of secure Web content. Using
	Secure Sockets Layer, or SSL, transport, our EdgeSuite offering
	ensures that content is distributed privately and reliably
	between two communicating applications.

•

Tiered Distribution

As their Web sites and interactions become more
	complex, enterprises are seeking tools to manage their Web
	presence. Our services optimize the delivery of all types of
	site content through the tiered nature of our platform. By using
	tiered distribution hubs that are connected to edge nodes close
	to requesting users, we are able to efficiently distribute our
	customers’ content based on unique characteristics and
	patterns. With our EdgeSuite services, enterprises can
	significantly reduce the load on their Web infrastructure and
	protect their online business from spikes in demand.

•

Site Fail Over

It is essential that e-businesses maintain
	constant availability of their Web sites. Our EdgeSuite service
	guarantees delivery of default content in the event that the
	source version of the Web site of an



enterprise customer becomes unavailable. Our
	EdgeSuite offering’s default content capabilities provide a
	solution for:

•

Site mirroring —

we provide an economical way to mirror
	a Web site without the expense of investing in additional data
	centers to achieve redundancy.

•

Disaster recovery —

we provide a backup if an unforeseen
	event causes a Web site to crash.

•

Site maintenance —

we deliver fail-over service so that a
	Web site remains available to end users during updates and
	maintenance.



•

Digitized Downloads

Digitized downloads consist of software
	applications and documents that may be downloaded onto the
	computers of permitted recipients. Our EdgeSuite service
	provides a solution for digital file distribution that offers
	our customers the ability to leverage the Internet as a
	distribution channel, resulting in expanded customer reach,
	significant cost efficiencies and time-to-market advantage. The
	unique, globally distributed network architecture on which the
	Akamai platform is based enhances the security and reliability
	of downloads while reducing infrastructure and bandwidth
	requirements at the origin site.

•

Business Intelligence

EdgeSuite Business Intelligence applications
	and services provide detailed real-time and historical
	information on site visitors, their behavior and the
	effectiveness of a Web site’s content. It also provides Web
	infrastructure information with details on Web site performance,
	site visitors’ access points, traffic patterns and
	automated delivery of Web logs in industry-standard formats.
	Companies use Business Intelligence’s comprehensive tools
	to evaluate their strategic investments in Web site
	functionality.

•

Streaming Services

Our streaming services provide for the delivery
	of streaming audio and video content to Internet users. We offer
	streaming services in all major formats. We principally focus on
	enterprise streaming applications such as video broadcasting of
	large events over IP networks, and video archives of corporate
	events or public news events. We believe that we have
	demonstrated superior streaming network capacity and quality,
	particularly for broadband users.

Business Segments and Geographic
Information

We currently operate in one business segment:
outsourced e-business infrastructure services and software.
Although we offer our services in several foreign locations,
over 90% of our revenue for each of the last three fiscal years
has been derived from customers located in the United States.
For more information on our segments and geographic areas, see
Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements appearing
elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The Akamai Platform

Our platform consists of a global network of over
13,500 computer servers and the complex proprietary software
that resides on them. Our servers are deployed in over 1,000
networks including Tier 1 providers, medium and small ISPs,
cable modem and satellite providers, universities and other
networks. We have formed alliances with many of the leading
networks worldwide. We also deploy our servers at smaller and
medium-sized domestic and international ISPs through our Akamai
Accelerated Network Program. Under this program, we offer use of
our servers to ISPs. In exchange, we typically do not pay for
rack space to house our servers or bandwidth to deliver content
from our servers to Internet users. By hosting our servers, ISPs
obtain access to popular content from the Internet that is
served from our platform. As a result, when this content is
requested by a user, the ISP does not need to pay for the
bandwidth otherwise necessary to retrieve the content from the
originating Web site.

We monitor our platform through our Network
Operations Command Center, which we call the NOCC, located at
our corporate headquarters, with a back-up facility on the West
Coast. Expert network operations personnel staff the NOCC 24
hour per day. We perform real-time monitoring of our own servers
and of the Internet to make certain that content is delivered to
users with the best possible performance and reliability. A key
design principle of our system is the use of a distributed
network of servers with no single point of failure. As a result,
if any computer, data center or portion of the Internet fails,
our services will continue operating. We constantly monitor the
performance of connections between various locations around the
Internet and our regions using numerous types of network
information to determine the performance of these connections.
The result is a “map” of the optimal Akamai region for
each location at that point in time. We rebuild this map
periodically to reflect changing conditions.



Real-time monitoring also enhances reliability.
Our servers maintain ample redundancy with other servers in our
network to ensure the highest level of performance and
reliability for our customers. This is increasingly important
for reliably delivering the mission-critical content and
applications of an enterprise over IP networks which, on their
own, are often unreliable.

Customers

Our customer base is centered on enterprises. As
of December 31, 2001, customers who have adopted our
services include many of the world’s leading enterprises,
including Apple Computer, Inc., Barnes & Noble, Best Buy,
Federal Express, General Motors Corporation, Target Corporation
and Xerox Corporation. We have also begun to address the needs
of the government market and, as of December 31, 2001, had
customers such as the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, the U.S. Geological Survey’s Earthquake
Hazards Program and the U.S. Government Printing Office. No
customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue for the year
ended December 31, 2001. For the year ended
December 31, 2000, Apple Computer represented 12% of total
revenue. For the year ended December 31, 1999, Yahoo! and
Apple Computer represented 22% and 13% of total revenue,
respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2001, we
entered into a technology license and service agreement with
Sockeye Networks Inc., or Sockeye, an affiliate of Akamai. See
Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements appearing
elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further
information on Sockeye.

Sales, Service and Marketing

Our sales and service professionals are located
in the United States and Europe, with ten offices in the
United States and three offices in Europe. We market and sell
our services and software domestically and internationally
through our direct sales and services organization and through
over 60 resellers including Compaq Computer Corporation,
Digex, Inc., Electronic Data Systems Corporation, or EDS,
International Business Machines, or IBM, InterNap Network
Services, Telefonica Group and others. Our sales and support
organization includes employees in direct and channel sales,
customer service, account management and technical consulting.
As of December 31, 2001, we had approximately
245 employees in our sales and support organization,
including 79 direct sales representatives whose performance is
measured on the basis of achievement of quota objectives. Our
ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will
depend in large part on how successfully we recruit, train and
retain sufficient direct sales, technical and global services
personnel, and how well we continue to establish and maintain
relationships with our strategic partners. We believe that the
complexity of our services will require a number of highly
trained global sales and services personnel.

To support our sales efforts and promote the
Akamai name, we conduct comprehensive marketing programs. Our
marketing strategies include an active public relations
campaign, print advertisements, online advertisements, trade
shows, strategic partnerships and on-going customer
communication programs. As of December 31, 2001, we had
18 employees in our marketing communications organization.
We have a prepaid advertising contract with CNN News Group that
was originally entered into by InterVu, which we acquired in
April 2000. The advertising agreement is effective through
November 2002 and provides for on-air and online advertising and
promotional opportunities across CNN’s properties. For
additional information on this advertising contract, see
Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements appearing
elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Engineering and Development

Our engineering and development organization is
continuously enhancing and improving our existing services,
strengthening our network and creating new services in response
to our customers needs and market demand. As of December 31,
2001, we had approximately 300 employees in our engineering and
development organization, many of whom hold advanced degrees in
their field. Our engineering and development expenses were
$61.5 million, $55.6 million and $11.7 million
for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.



We have numerous initiatives in our development
program, including the continued development of Edge Side
Includes, or ESI, a simple markup language that allows edge
servers and central servers to communicate in a distributed
computing environment. ESI is an open standard language, such as
XML, and has been co-authored by several leading software
companies including Oracle Corporation, BEA Systems, Inc. and
IBM. As application providers begin to adopt ESI in their
offerings, our EdgeSuite service will become immediately
compatible with these applications and will allow us to sell our
services to the application user. While we intend to continue to
extend our platform with proprietary technology to make
available to our customers our unique services and software, we
also intend to simultaneously support and maintain open
interconnections standards to facilitate the broadest possible
deployment and partnering opportunities.

Competition

The market for outsourced e-business
infrastructure services and software is new, intensely
competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology,
evolving industry standards and frequent new product and service
installations. We expect competition for our services to
increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants.
We compete primarily on the basis of:

We compete primarily with companies offering
products and services that address Internet performance
problems, including companies that provide Internet content
delivery and hosting services, streaming content delivery
services and equipment-based solutions to Internet performance
problems, such as load balancers and server switches. Some of
these companies resell our services. We also compete with
companies that host online conferences using proprietary
conferencing applications. We do not believe that any other
company currently offers the range of solutions that we offer
through our EdgeSuite service.

Proprietary Rights and Licensing

Our success and ability to compete are dependent
on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects
of our technology and operate without infringing on the
proprietary rights of others. We rely on a combination of
patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright laws and
contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of
our technology. These legal protections afford only limited
protection for our technology. We currently have several issued
United States patents covering our content delivery technology,
and we have numerous additional patent applications pending. We
cannot predict whether any of these issued patents will afford
us any meaningful protection. We cannot predict whether any
patent application we filed will result in any issued patent or,
if a patent is issued, any meaningful protection. We seek to
limit disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring
employees and consultants with access to our proprietary
information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by
restricting access to our source code.

Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary
rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our
services or software or to obtain and use information that we
regard as proprietary. The laws of many countries do not protect
our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of
the United States. Litigation may be necessary in the future to
enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade
secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary
rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or
invalidity. In September 2000, we filed suit in federal court in
Massachusetts against Digital Island, Inc. for infringing one of
our licensed patents and certain patents issued to InterVu.
Digital Island subsequently filed a patent infringing suit
against us in California. For a further discussion of this
litigation, see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements
appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



There can be no assurance that our means of
protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our
competitors will not independently develop similar technology.
Any failure by us to meaningfully protect our property could
have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
results and financial condition.

In October 1998, we entered into a license
agreement with MIT under which we were granted a royalty-free,
worldwide right to use and sublicense the intellectual property
rights of MIT under various patent applications and copyrights
relating to Internet content delivery technology. One of these
patent applications has now issued. We cannot predict whether
any of the other applications will result in issued patents that
will provide us with any meaningful protection. Some of our
technology is based on technology licensed from MIT. The license
has been granted to us on an exclusive basis, but is subject to
the rights of the United States government to use the licensed
intellectual property in government-funded inventions. As part
of the license agreement, MIT retained the right to use the
licensed intellectual property for non-commercial, teaching and
educational purposes. In connection with the license agreement,
we issued 682,110 shares of our common stock to MIT in October
1998. The license agreement is irrevocable and is effective for
the life of the relevant patents and patent applications, but
MIT may terminate the agreement if we cease our business due to
insolvency or if we materially breach the terms of the license
agreement.

Employees

As of December 31, 2001, we had a total of
841 full-time and part-time employees. Our future success will
depend in part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate
highly qualified technical and management personnel, for whom
competition is intense. Our employees are not represented by any
collective bargaining unit. We believe our relations with our
employees are good.

Factors Affecting Future Operating
Results

We believe that this report contains
“forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These
statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are based
on the beliefs and assumptions of our management based on
information currently available to our management. Use of words
such as “believes,” “expects,”
“anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,”
“estimates,” “should,” “likely” or
similar expressions, indicate a forward-looking statement.
Forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and
assumptions. Certain of the information contained in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K consists of forward-looking statements.
Important factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from the forward-looking statements include the
following:

Failure to increase our revenue or
	unexpected increases in expenses would prevent us from achieving
	and maintaining profitability.

We have never been profitable. We have incurred
significant losses since inception and expect to continue to
incur losses in the future. We cannot be certain that our
revenue will continue to grow or that we will produce sufficient
revenue to achieve profitability. Our failure to significantly
increase our revenue would seriously harm our business and
operating results. We have large fixed expenses, and we expect
to continue to incur significant sales and marketing, product
development, administrative and other expenses, including fees
to obtain access to bandwidth for the transport of data over our
network. As a result, we will need to generate significantly
higher revenue to achieve and maintain profitability.

If we are required to obtain additional
	funding, such funding may not be available on acceptable terms
	or at all.

If our revenue grows more slowly than we
anticipate or if our operating expenses increase more than we
expect or cannot be reduced in the event of lower revenue, we
may need to obtain funding from outside sources. If we are
unable to obtain needed outside funding, our business would be
materially and adversely affected. In addition, even if we were
to find outside funding sources, we might be required to issue
to such outside sources securities with greater rights than
those currently possessed by holders of our currently



outstanding securities. We might also be required
to take other actions that could lessen the value of our common
stock, including borrowing money on terms that are not favorable
to us.

Our business is difficult to evaluate and
	our business strategy may not successfully address risks we face
	because we have a limited operating history.

We were founded in August 1998 and began offering
our services commercially in April 1999. We have limited
historical financial data upon which to base planned operating
expenses and upon which investors may evaluate our prospects and
us. In addition, while our operating expenses are largely based
on anticipated but unpredictable revenue trends, a high
percentage of these expenses is and will continue to be fixed in
the short-term. Because of our limited operating history, our
business strategy may not successfully address all of the risks
we face.

We are primarily dependent on the
	Internet-related services and software that we provide to
	e-businesses, and our future revenue depends on continued demand
	for such services and software.

Our future growth currently depends on the
commercial success of our outsourced e-business infrastructure
services and software solutions for enterprises. We refer to
such enterprises as e-businesses. While we have been selling our
services commercially since April 1999, sales may not continue
in the future for a variety of reasons. First, the market for
our services and software is relatively new and issues
concerning the commercial use of the Internet, including
security, reliability, speed, cost, ease of access, quality of
service, regulatory initiatives and necessary increases in
bandwidth availability remain unresolved and are likely to
affect its development. Furthermore, our new services, including
those under development, may not achieve widespread market
acceptance. Failure of our current and planned services and
software to operate as expected could also hinder or prevent
their adoption. If a broad-based, sustained market for our
services does not emerge and our target customers do not adopt,
purchase and successfully deploy our current and planned
services and software, our revenue will not grow significantly
and our business, results of operations and financial condition
will be seriously harmed.

Any failure of our network infrastructure
	could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could
	reduce our revenue and harm our business, financial results and
	reputation.

Our business is dependent on providing our
customers with fast, efficient and reliable Internet
distribution application and content delivery services. To meet
these customer requirements, we must protect our network
infrastructure against damage from:

For our EdgeSuite, FreeFlow and FreeFlow
Streaming services, we currently provide a content delivery
service guarantee that our networks will deliver Internet
content 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year.
Generally, if we do not provide this service, the customer does
not pay for its services on that day. Any widespread loss or
interruption of services would reduce our revenue and could harm
our business, financial results and reputation.

Our services and our network may be subject
	to intentional disruption.

Although we believe we have sufficient controls
in place to prevent intentional disruptions of our services,
such as disruptions caused by software viruses specifically
designed to impede the performance of our services,



we may be an ongoing target of such disruptions.
Similarly, experienced computer programmers, or
“hackers,” may attempt to penetrate our network
security or the security of our Web site in order to
misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of
our operations. Our activities could be substantially disrupted
and our reputation and future sales harmed if these efforts are
successful.

Recent terrorist activities and resulting
	military and other actions could adversely affect our
	business.

Terrorist attacks in New York, Pennsylvania and
Washington, D.C. in September of 2001 disrupted commerce
throughout the United States and other parts of the world. The
continued threat of terrorism within the United States and
abroad and the potential for military action and heightened
security measures in response to such threat may cause
significant disruption to commerce throughout the world. To the
extent that such disruptions result in delays or cancellations
of customer orders, a general decrease in corporate spending on
information technology, or our inability to effectively market
and sell our services and software, our business and results of
operations could be materially and adversely affected. We are
unable to predict whether the threat of terrorism or the
responses thereto will result in any long-term commercial
disruptions or if such activities or responses will have a long
term material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations or financial condition.

Because our services are complex and are
	deployed in complex environments, they may have errors or
	defects that could seriously harm our business.

Our services are highly complex and are designed
to be deployed in and across numerous large and complex
networks. As of December 31, 2001, our network consisted of
over 13,500 servers across more than 1,000 different networks.
Our customers and we have from time to time discovered errors
and defects in our software. In the future, there may be
additional errors and defects in our software that may adversely
affect our services. If we are unable to efficiently fix errors
or other problems that may be identified, we could experience:

Any failure of our telecommunications and
	network providers to provide required transmission capacity to
	us could result in interruptions in our services.

Our operations are dependent in part upon
transmission capacity provided by third-party telecommunications
network providers. A number of these network providers have
recently filed for protection under the federal bankruptcy laws.
As a result, there is uncertainty about whether such providers
or others that enter into bankruptcy will be able to continue to
provide services to us. Any failure of these network providers
to provide the capacity we require may result in a reduction in,
or interruption of, service to our customers. This failure may
be a result of the telecommunications providers or Internet
service providers ceasing operations, experiencing interruptions
or other failures, failing to comply with or terminating their
existing agreements with us, otherwise denying or interrupting
service, refusing to enter into relationships with us or only
agreeing to enter into relationships with us on terms that are
not commercially acceptable to us. If we do not have access to
third-party transmission capacity, we could lose customers. If
we are unable to obtain transmission capacity on terms
commercially acceptable to us, our business and financial
results could suffer. In addition, our telecommunications and
network providers typically provide rack space for our servers.
Damage or destruction of, or other denial of access to, a
facility where our servers are housed could result in a
reduction in, or interruption of, service to our customers.



The markets in which we operate are highly
	competitive and we may be unable to compete successfully against
	new entrants and established companies with greater
	resources.

We compete in markets that are new, intensely
competitive, highly fragmented and rapidly changing. We have
experienced and expect to continue to experience increased
competition. Many of our current competitors, as well as a
number of our potential competitors, have longer operating
histories, greater name recognition, broader customer
relationships and industry alliances and substantially greater
financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. Our
competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to
new or emerging technologies and changes in customer
requirements. Some of our current or potential competitors may
bundle their services with other services, software or hardware
in a manner that may discourage Web site owners from purchasing
any service we offer or Internet service providers from
installing our servers.

As competition in the Internet content, streaming
media and applications delivery markets continues to intensify,
new solutions will come to market. We are aware of other
companies that are focusing or may in the future focus
significant resources on developing and marketing products and
services or entering into strategic alliances that will compete
with us. These companies include networking hardware and
software manufacturers, content distribution providers,
traditional hardware manufacturers, telecommunications
providers, software database companies, and large diversified
software and technology companies. Increased competition could
result in:

Any one of these could materially and adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

If we are not successful in entering into
	technology licensing, development or other strategic technology
	arrangements in the future, our results of operations could be
	adversely affected.

We derived a portion of our revenue in the year
ended December 31, 2001 from fees under license and
development agreements. We expect to derive a portion of our
revenue in the future from license agreements that we have
entered into as well as additional licensing arrangements,
development agreements and other strategic technology
arrangements that we may enter into. We may not be successful in
completing any additional arrangements within the time periods
we anticipate or at all, which could have an adverse effect on
our results of operations.

Some of our current customers are emerging
	Internet-based businesses that may not pay us for our services
	on a timely basis and that may not succeed over the long
	term.

Some of our customers are emerging Internet-based
businesses, and we expect to earn a portion of our future
revenue from this customer base. The unproven business models of
some of these customers make their continued financial viability
uncertain. Given the short operating history and emerging nature
of many of these businesses, there is a risk that these
customers will encounter financial difficulties and fail to pay
for our services or delay payment substantially. In fact, a
number of our customers have filed for protection under federal
bankruptcy laws. The failure of our emerging business customers
to pay our fees on a timely basis or to continue to purchase our
services in accordance with their contractual commitments could
adversely affect our accounts receivable collection periods, our
future revenue and other financial results.



If the estimates we make, and the
	assumptions on which we rely, in preparing our financial
	statements prove inaccurate, our actual results may vary from
	those reflected in our projections and accruals.

Our financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. The preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses, including expenses and liabilities recorded in
connection with our restructurings in 2001, and related
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our
estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the
circumstances. There can be no assurance, however, that our
estimates, or the assumptions underlying them, will be correct.
If, for example, the costs associated with terminating certain
real property leases vacated by us in our restructurings is
greater than the amount we have accrued in connection therewith,
our net income would be reduced which could have a negative
impact on our financial statements and results of operations.
This, in turn, could adversely affect our stock price.

If we are unable to scale our network as
	demand increases, the quality of our services may diminish and
	we may lose customers.

Our network of servers may not be scalable to
expected customer levels while maintaining superior performance.
We cannot be certain that our network of servers will connect
and manage a substantially larger number of customers at high
transmission speeds. In addition, as customers’ usage of
bandwidth increases, we will need to make additional investments
in our infrastructure to maintain adequate data transmission
speeds. We cannot ensure that we will be able to make these
investments successfully or at an acceptable or commercially
reasonable cost. Our failure to achieve or maintain high
capacity data transmission could significantly reduce demand for
our services, reducing our revenue in general and causing our
business and financial results to suffer.

If we do not respond rapidly to
	technological changes, we may lose customers.

The market for outsourced e-business
infrastructure services and software is likely to continue to be
characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new
product and service introductions and changes in customer
requirements. We may be unable to respond quickly or effectively
to these developments. If competitors introduce products,
services or technologies that are better than ours or that gain
greater market acceptance, or if new industry standards emerge,
and our services become obsolete, which would materially and
adversely affect our business, results of operations and
financial condition which would be materially and adversely
affected.

If our license agreement with MIT
	terminates, our business could be adversely
	affected.

We have licensed from the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, or MIT, technology covered by various patent
applications and copyrights relating to Internet content
delivery technology. Some of our technology is based in part on
the technology covered by these patent applications and
copyrights. Our license is effective for the life of the patent
and patent applications; however, under limited circumstances,
such as our insolvency or our material breach the terms of the
license agreement, MIT has the right to terminate our license. A
termination of our license agreement with MIT could have a
material adverse effect on our business.

Our business will be adversely affected if
	we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from
	third-party challenges.

We rely on a combination of patent, copyright,
trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure
to protect our intellectual property rights. These legal
protections afford only limited protection. Monitoring
unauthorized use of our services is difficult and we cannot be
certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized
use of our technology, particularly in foreign countries where
the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in
the United States.



Although we have licensed and proprietary
technology covered by United States patents, we cannot be
certain that any such patents will not be challenged,
invalidated or circumvented. Moreover, although we have filed
international patent applications, none of our technology is
patented abroad. We cannot be certain that any pending or future
patent applications will be granted, that any future patent will
not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or that rights
granted under any patent that may be issued will provide
competitive advantages to us.

The rates we charge for our services may
	decline over time, which would reduce our revenue and could
	cause our business and financial results to
	suffer.

We expect that our cost to obtain bandwidth
capacity for the transport of data over our network will decline
over time as a result of, among other things, the large amount
of capital currently being invested to build infrastructure
providing additional bandwidth and volume discounts available to
us as our network usage increases. We expect the prices we
charge for our services may also decline over time as a result
of, among other things, existing and new competition in the
markets we address. As a result, our historical revenue rates
may not be indicative of future revenue based on comparable
traffic volumes. If we fail to accurately predict the decline in
costs of bandwidth or, in any event, if we are unable to sell
our services at acceptable prices relative to our bandwidth
costs, or if we fail to offer additional services from which we
can derive additional revenue, our revenue will decrease and our
business and financial results will suffer.

Our business will suffer if we fail to
	manage our growth properly.

We have expanded our operations rapidly since our
inception. This growth has placed, and our anticipated growth in
future operations will continue to place, a significant strain
on our management systems and resources. Our ability to
successfully offer our services and implement our business plan
in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and
management process. We expect that we will need to continue to
improve our financial and managerial controls, reporting systems
and procedures, and will need to continue to train and manage
our workforce worldwide. In order to grow and achieve future
success, we must also improve our ability to effectively manage
multiple relationships with our customers, suppliers and other
third parties. In addition, from time to time, we have been
required to downsize our operations in order to effectively
manage our business. Failure to take any of the steps necessary
to manage our growth properly would have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

As part of our business strategy, we have
	entered into and may enter into or seek to enter into business
	combinations and acquisitions that may be difficult to
	integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value or
	divert management attention.

We acquired Network


in February 2000,
InterVu in April 2000 and CallTheShots Inc., which we refer to
as CTS, in July 2000. As a part of our business strategy, we may
enter into additional business combinations and acquisitions.
Acquisitions are typically accompanied by a number of risks,
including the difficulty of integrating the operations and
personnel of the acquired companies, the potential disruption of
our ongoing business, the potential distraction of management,
expenses related to the acquisition and potential unknown
liabilities associated with acquired businesses.

If we are not successful in completing
acquisitions that we may pursue in the future, we may be
required to reevaluate our growth strategy and we may have
incurred substantial expenses and devoted significant management
time and resources in seeking to complete proposed acquisitions
that will not generate benefits for us. In addition, with future
acquisitions, we could use substantial portions of our available
cash as all or a portion of the purchase price. We could also
issue additional securities as consideration for these
acquisitions, which could cause our stockholders to suffer
significant dilution. Our acquisitions of Network


,
InterVu and CTS and any future acquisitions may not ultimately
help us achieve our strategic goals and may pose other risks to
us.



We depend on our key personnel to manage
	our business effectively. If we are unable to retain our key
	employees and hire qualified sales and technical personnel, our
	ability to compete could be harmed.

Our future success depends upon the continued
services of our executive officers and other key technology,
sales, marketing and support personnel, who have critical
industry experience and relationships that they rely on in
implementing our business plan. None of our officers or key
employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific
term. We have a “key person” life insurance policy
covering only the life of F. Thomson Leighton. The loss of the
services of any of our key employees could delay the development
and introduction of and negatively impact our ability to sell
our services.

We face intense competition for qualified
personnel, including research and development personnel and
other persons with necessary technical skills, particularly in
the Boston, Massachusetts and San Mateo, California areas. Our
employees require extensive training in our outsourced
e-business infrastructure services and software. If we are
unable to hire and promptly train service and support personnel,
we may not be able to increase sales of our services, which
would seriously harm our business.

We face risks associated with international
	operations that could harm our business.

We have expanded our international operations to
Munich, Germany; London, England and Paris, France. In addition,
in April 2001, we formed a joint venture with SOFTBANK
Broadmedia Corporation to create Akamai Technologies
Japan KK, of which we own 40% of the common stock. A key
aspect of our business strategy is to continue to expand our
sales and support organizations internationally. Therefore, we
expect to commit significant resources to expand our
international sales and marketing activities. We are
increasingly subject to a number of risks associated with
international business activities that may increase our costs,
lengthen our sales cycle and require significant management
attention. These risks include:

Provisions of our charter documents may
	have anti-takeover effects that could prevent a change in
	control even if the change in control would be beneficial to our
	stockholders.

Provisions of our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation, by-laws, and Delaware law could
make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if
doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders.

The unpredictability of our quarterly
	results may adversely affect the trading price of our common
	stock.

Our revenue and operating results may vary
significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of
factors, many of which are outside of our control and any of
which may cause our stock price to fluctuate. The primary
factors that may affect us include the following:



Due to the above factors, we believe that
quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not
a good indication of our future performance. It is likely that
in some future quarters, our operating results may be below the
expectations of public market analysts and investors. In this
event, the price of our common stock will probably decrease.

Accounting principles relating to revenue
	recognition, equity awards and other topics relevant to our
	business, and our application of those principles, may
	change.

In December 1999 the Securities and Exchange
Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101,
“Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements,” which
we adopted in 2000. This guidance may continue to evolve. In
addition, applying revenue recognition principles to a business
like ours is complex. This complexity is in part a function of
the continual interpretation of accounting principles by those
that set accounting standards. In addition, changes in our
relationships with particular customers may require us to change
how we account for revenue from those customers. Such changes
could have a material adverse effect on the timing of revenue
recognition and could adversely affect our financial results.

We could incur substantial costs defending
	our intellectual property from infringement or a claim of
	infringement.

Other companies or individuals, including our
competitors, may obtain patents or other proprietary rights that
would prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use
or sell our services. As a result, we may be found to infringe
on the proprietary rights of others. In the event of a
successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or
inability to license the infringed technology, our business and
operating results would be significantly harmed. Companies in
the Internet market are increasingly bringing suits alleging
infringement of their proprietary rights, particularly patent
rights. Any litigation or claims, whether or not valid, could
result in substantial costs and diversion of resources.
Intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do
one or more of the following:

•

cease selling, incorporating or using products or
	services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;

•

obtain a license from the holder of the infringed
	intellectual property right, which license may not be available
	on reasonable terms or at all; and

•

redesign products or services.

If we are forced to take any of these actions,
our business may be seriously harmed. Although we carry
insurance, our insurance may not cover potential claims of this
type or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability
that may be imposed.



Internet-related laws could adversely
	affect our business.

Laws and regulations that apply to communications
and commerce over the Internet are becoming more prevalent. In
particular, the growth and development of the market for online
commerce has prompted calls for more stringent consumer
protection and privacy laws, both in the United States and
abroad, that may impose additional burdens on companies
conducting business online. This could negatively affect the
businesses of our customers and reduce their demand for our
services. Internet-related laws, however, remain largely
unsettled, even in areas where there has been some legislative
action. The adoption or modification of laws or regulations
relating to the Internet, or interpretations of existing law,
could adversely affect our business.

Our stock price has been and may continue
	to be volatile, which could result in litigation against
	us.

The market price of our common stock has been
extremely volatile and has fluctuated significantly in the past.
The following factors could cause the market price of common
stock to continue to fluctuate significantly:

In the past, class action litigation has often
been brought against companies following periods of volatility
in the market price of those companies’ common stock.
Litigation is often expensive and diverts management’s
attention and resources which could materially adversely affect
our business and results of operations.

Several class action lawsuits have been
	filed against us which may result in litigation that is costly
	to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain and may harm our
	business.

We and several of our officers and current and
former directors are named as defendants in several purported
class action complaints which have been filed allegedly on
behalf of certain persons who purchased our common stock during
different time periods, all beginning on October 28, 1999
and ending on various dates, the latest of which is
August 31, 2001. These complaints allege violations of the
Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Primarily they allege that there was undisclosed compensation
received by our underwriters in connection with our initial
public offering.

We can provide no assurance as to the outcome of
these complaints. Any conclusion of these matters in a manner
adverse to us would have a material adverse affect on our
financial position and results of operations. In addition, the
costs to us of defending any litigation or other proceeding,
even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Such
litigation could also substantially divert the attention of our
management and our resources in general. Uncertainties resulting
from the initiation and continuation of any litigation or other
proceedings could harm our ability to compete in the marketplace.

We may become
involved in other litigation that may adversely affect
us.

In the ordinary course of business, we may become
involved in litigation, administrative proceedings and
governmental proceedings. Such matters can be time-consuming,
divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to
incur significant expenses. Furthermore, there can be no
assurance that the results of



any of these actions will not have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations or
financial condition.

Item 2.

Properties.

Our headquarters are located in approximately
130,000 square feet of leased office space in Cambridge,
Massachusetts. In addition, our primary west coast office is
located in approximately 50,000 square feet of leased office
space in San Mateo, California. We maintain offices in several
other locations in the United States, including Los Angeles,
California; San Diego, California; Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago,
Illinois; New York, New York; Fairfax, Virginia and Seattle,
Washington. We also maintain offices in Europe including Munich,
Germany; Paris, France and London, England. During 2001, we
commenced an operating lease for approximately 110,000 square
feet of additional office space in Cambridge, Massachusetts. As
a result of reductions in head count in 2001, we are not
currently utilizing this additional space and we are actively
marketing the space to potential subtenants. We have also exited
approximately 175,000 square feet of office space under
non-cancellable leases in other locations in the United States
including San Diego, California, and Santa Clara, California. If
we are unable to successfully sublease our vacated and
unoccupied office space, our business may be adversely affected.
See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements
included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 3.

Legal
Proceedings.

We are subject to legal proceedings, claims and
litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. We do not
expect the ultimate costs to resolve these matters to have a
material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

On September 13, 2000, Akamai, together with
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT, filed suit in
Massachusetts federal court against Digital Island Inc., or
Digital Island, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cable and Wireless,
plc., for infringing an MIT patent licensed exclusively to us.
We refer to such patent as the 703 patent. The complaint was
subsequently amended to include a count seeking a declaratory
judgment that we did not infringe a Digital Island patent and a
count that Digital Island infringes a patent we acquired as a
result of our acquisition of InterVu. On September 19,
2000, Digital Island filed suit against us in federal court in
California alleging infringement of the Digital Island patent
that was the subject of our declaratory judgment request. All
claims were heard in a jury trial in Massachusetts federal court
in December 2001. On December 21, 2001, the jury found that
Digital Island’s Footprint 2.0 content delivery network and
service offering infringes seven asserted claims of the 703
patent, but that Digital Island does not infringe the other
patent at issue. The jury also ruled we do not infringe Digital
Island’s patent. Finally, the jury indicated that three of
the seven asserted claims of the 703 patent, although infringed,
were invalid due to a United States patent that was filed prior
to the patent application that matured into the 703 patent. No
judgment has been entered on the jury verdict, and we intend to
ask the Court to set aside the adverse jury verdict as to those
three claims. Following entry of judgment, the Court will set a
schedule for a separate trial to be held on the damages payable
by Digital Island as a result of its infringement of the 703
patent.

On September 21, 2000, we filed a lawsuit
against Digital Island in federal court in California for false
advertising, unfair competition, intentional interference with
contractual relationships and intentional interference with
business advantage. We are seeking damages and injunctive
relief. On October 26, 2000, Digital Island filed a
counterclaim against us alleging that distribution of certain
marketing materials and statements constituted false
advertising, unfair competition, intentional interference with
contractual relationships and intentional interference with
business advantage. Digital Island is seeking monetary damages
and injunctive relief. We intend to vigorously prosecute our
claim and aggressively defend Digital Island’s
counterclaim. Although we cannot be assured that we will prevail
in these actions, we believe that we have meritorious defenses
to the claims asserted by Digital Island. We do not believe that
the resolution of these claims will have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

Between July 2, 2001 and August 31,
2001, ten purported class action lawsuits were filed in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York against us and several of our officers and directors



as well as against the underwriters of our
October 28, 1999 initial public offering of common stock.
We expect these ten complaints to be consolidated at some point
in the future. The complaints were filed allegedly on behalf of
persons who purchased our common stock during different time
periods, all beginning on October 28, 1999 and ending on
various dates. The complaints are similar and allege violations
of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 primarily based on the allegation that the underwriters
received undisclosed compensation in connection with our initial
public offering. We are not presently able to estimate potential
losses, if any, related to these lawsuits.

In January 2000, a former employee of InterVu
filed an action against InterVu alleging that InterVu had
breached two restricted stock purchase agreements by failing to
deliver certain shares of stock after the employee’s
resignation. The plaintiff sought specific performance and
monetary damages. A bench trial was held in March 2001, and in
April 2001 the court ruled in favor of the plaintiff. The court
assessed damages against us in the amount of $1.9 million. We
have filed a notice of appeal of the trial court’s decision
in this case.

In August 2001, Network Caching Technology,
L.L.C., or NCT, amended an existing patent infringement action
pending in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of California to join Akamai as a co-defendant. The
case alleges that numerous entities, namely, Novell, Inc.,
Volera, Inc., CacheFlow, Inc., Inktomi Corporation and Akamai,
infringe four patents relating to network file services and
cache mechanisms. We have filed an answer denying the
allegations of infringement. Discovery proceedings in the case
are on-going. We believe that NCT’s infringement
allegations are without merit; however, given the inherent
uncertainty of litigation, there can be no assurance that we
will prevail in this action. We are not presently able to
estimate potential losses, if any, related to this lawsuit.

Overview

Akamai provides secure, outsourced e-business
infrastructure services and software solutions. We market our
services and software worldwide through a direct sales force and
a reseller channel. Our services and software enable enterprises
to reduce the complexity and cost of deploying and operating a
uniform Web infrastructure while ensuring superior performance,
reliability, scalability and manageability.

We were formed in August 1998 and began selling
our content delivery services commercially in April 1999. We
ended 1999 with approximately 227 customers under recurring
contract. During 2000 we acquired the businesses of Network


and InterVu. We recorded a total of $2.9 billion of
goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of these
acquisitions. In October 2000, we launched our EdgeSuite
offering, a suite of services that allows for the
high-performance, dynamic delivery of Web content and
applications to end users, wherever they are located globally.

The following significant events occurred in 2001:

•

as a result of a reduction in our market
	capitalization and other factors, we recorded an impairment
	charge of $1.9 billion to adjust the carrying amount of
	goodwill recorded in the acquisitions of Network


and
	InterVu to its fair value;

•

in an effort to better align our costs with
	forecasted revenue, we recorded a restructuring charge of
	$40.5 million to reflect the severance of approximately 400
	employees and the termination of leases related to excess office
	space;

•

we increased our EdgeSuite customer base to 152
	and we ended the year with 1,214 customers under recurring
	contracts; and



•

by the end of the year our intelligent edge
	platform was comprised of more than 13,500 servers within over
	1,000 networks in 63 countries.

We have incurred significant costs to develop our
technology, build our worldwide network, sell and market our
services and software and support our operations. We have also
incurred significant amortization expense of goodwill and other
intangible assets from the acquisition of businesses. Since our
inception, we have incurred significant losses and negative cash
flows from operations. We have not achieved profitability on a
quarterly or annual basis, and we anticipate that we will
continue to incur net losses in the future. We believe that our
success is dependent on increasing our customer base, developing
new services and software that leverage our proprietary
technology and maintaining a proper alignment between our cost
structure, particularly our cash operating expenses and our
revenue goals. In order to achieve these goals, we expect to
incur sales, marketing, engineering and development and general
and administrative costs in the future at amounts similar to the
amounts incurred in 2001.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations are based upon our
consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared by
us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. The preparation of these
financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities. Our estimates include those related to
revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts,
investments, intangible assets, income taxes, depreciable lives
of property and equipment, restructuring accruals and
contingency accruals. We base our estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that we believed to
be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
For a complete description of our accounting policies, see Note
2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our critical accounting policies include the
following:

Revenue Recognition.

We recognize revenue from our services
and licenses when an enforceable arrangement to deliver the
service or license has been established, the service or license
has been delivered to and accepted by the customer, the fee for
the service or license is fixed or determinable and collection
is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue from our content
delivery and streaming services based on the customer’s
minimum monthly usage commitment plus usage in excess of the
minimum commitment as defined in the service arrangement. We
record installation and set-up fees as deferred revenue and
recognize these fees ratably over the life of the customer
contract. We recognize revenue from resellers based on the
resellers’ contracted non-refundable minimum purchase
commitment, plus amounts sold by the resellers to their
customers in excess of the minimum commitment. We recognize
revenue from professional services as these services are
performed.

From time to time, we enter into contracts to
purchase goods or services for our operations from customers at
or about the same time that we enter into contracts to sell
services or license software to these organizations. These
transactions are separately negotiated and recorded at terms we
consider to be arm’s length. For all periods presented,
revenue recognized from vendors where we purchased goods or
services from the vendor at or about the same time that we
entered into contracts to sell services or license software was
less than 10% of total revenue.

Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts.

When estimating our
allowance for doubtful accounts, we analyze our accounts
receivable aging, historical bad debts, customer concentrations,
customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and other
factors. If the collection of accounts receivable is not
reasonably assured, we defer revenue recognition.

Cost of Service.

We
include in cost of service the fees paid to network providers
for bandwidth and fees for housing our servers in third-party
network data centers. Cost of service also includes network
storage costs; live event costs including costs for production,
encoding and signal acquisition; and costs of professional



services. We include the depreciation on network
equipment used to deliver our services in depreciation on the
consolidated statements of operations. We enter into contracts
for bandwidth with third-party network providers with terms
typically ranging from one to three years. These contracts
generally commit us to pay minimum monthly fees plus additional
fees for bandwidth usage above the contracted level and, in some
instances, commit us to share with the third-party network
providers a portion of the revenue recognized from customers
that use these third-party networks. In some circumstances, ISPs
make available to Akamai rack space for our servers and access
to their bandwidth at discounted or no cost. In exchange, the
ISPs’ customers benefit by receiving content through a
local Akamai server resulting in better content delivery. We do
not consider these relationships to represent the culmination of
an earnings process. Accordingly, we do not recognize as revenue
the value to the ISPs associated with the use of our servers and
we do not recognize as expense the value of the rack space and
bandwidth received at discounted or no cost.

Investments.

We
review all investments for reductions in fair value that are
other-than-temporary. We consider several factors when
determining whether such reductions are other-than-temporary,
including the financial condition and results of operations of
the investee and the amount of time the fair value of the
investment has been below cost. When such reductions occur, the
cost of the investment is adjusted to its fair value through
“loss on investments” on the consolidated statements
of operations. We adjust our marketable securities to fair value
on the consolidated balance sheet through other comprehensive
income. We disclose the value of restricted investments on the
consolidated balance sheets.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.

We review goodwill and other
long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may
not be recoverable. When such “triggering” events
occur, we compare the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets
to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to those
assets. If this comparison indicates that an impairment is
present, the amount of the impairment is calculated using
discounted expected cash flows using a weighted average cost of
capital.

In accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets,” we reclassified to goodwill the
carrying amount of our assembled workforce intangible asset. The
resulting balance of goodwill was $4.9 million on
January 1, 2002. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we
are required to perform a transitional impairment test on
goodwill by assigning goodwill to reporting units, determining
the fair value of the reporting units and comparing that fair
value to the recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities
of the reporting units, including goodwill. We have determined
that Akamai has one reporting unit. We have assigned the entire
balance of goodwill to this reporting unit as of January 1,
2002 for purposes of performing the transitional impairment
test. The fair value of the reporting unit was determined using
the market capitalization of Akamai as of January 1, 2002.
The fair value was compared to the recognized and unrecognized
net assets of the reporting unit, including goodwill. The fair
value exceeded the net assets of the reporting unit.
Accordingly, we concluded that no further impairment analysis
was necessary. We have designated January 1 as the date for our
annual impairment test. Unless changes in events and
circumstances indicate that an impairment test is required, we
expect to test goodwill for impairment again on January 1,
2003.

Related Party Transactions.

From time to time, we may enter into
transactions with parties that have relationships with our
officers or directors or entities in which we have an ownership
interest. Such transactions are reviewed by the Board of
Directors and are subject to the prior approval of members of
the Board of Directors who do not have a personal interest in
the applicable transaction. We disclose all material
transactions that, in our judgment, constitute related party
transactions. Related parties include our subsidiaries,
investments accounted for under the equity method, members of
our management and owners of a significant percentage of our
common stock and their family members, and any other party that
we significantly influence.

Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance.

We provide a valuation allowance
against our net deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of
available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all
of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In the event
that we determine in the future that we will be able to realize
our



deferred tax assets in excess of their carrying
amounts, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase
net income in the period such determination was made.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board, or FASB, issued SFAS No. 141, “Business
Combinations.” SFAS No. 141 requires the purchase
method of accounting for business combinations initiated after
June 30, 2001 and eliminates the pooling-of-interests
method. SFAS No. 141 did not have an impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” which became
effective January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 142 requires,
among other things, the discontinuance of goodwill amortization.
In addition, the standard includes provisions for the
reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as
goodwill, reassessment of the useful lives of existing
recognized intangibles, reclassification of certain intangibles
out of previously reported goodwill and the identification of
reporting units for purposes of assessing potential future
impairments of goodwill.

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143,
“Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” which
will be effective for fiscal year 2003. SFAS No. 143
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations
associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and
the associated asset retirement costs. We deploy servers in
third party networks and data centers worldwide under various
co-location contracts. Many of these contracts require the
physical removal, at our expense, of servers from the data
centers at the conclusion of the contract. We are reviewing
whether these removal requirements constitute an asset
retirement obligation under SFAS No. 143.

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets,” which became effective January 1,
2002. SFAS No. 144 supercedes SFAS No. 121 and the
accounting and reporting provisions for the disposal of a
segment of a business of Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 30 “Reporting the Results of
Operations — Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a
Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and
Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions.” We do not
expect that the adoption of SFAS No. 144 will have a
significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.



Results of Operations

The following sets forth, as a percentage of
revenue, consolidated statements of operations data for the
years indicated:

Revenue.

Revenue
increased to $163.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2001 compared to $89.8 million for the
year ended December 31, 2000 and $4.0 million for the
year ended December 31, 1999. Revenue increased in 2001
compared to 2000 primarily due to an increase in our average
recurring customer base which grew from approximately 800 to
1,300 during 2001, a change in our customer mix toward larger
enterprise customers and away from emerging Internet-based
businesses and a shift in our service mix toward higher priced
services. These factors contributed approximately $54.3 million
to 2001 revenue growth. Revenue also increased in 2001 due to an
increase in license revenue, which contributed $6.7 million to
2001 revenue growth, and an increase in service and license
revenue with related parties, which contributed
$12.4 million to 2001 revenue growth. Revenue increased in
2000 compared to 1999 due to an increase in our average
recurring customer base. For each of the years ended
December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, over 90% of our revenue
was derived from customers located in the United States. For the
year ended December 31, 2001, no customer accounted for
more than 10% of total revenue. For the year ended
December 31, 2000, one customer, Apple Computer, accounted
for 12% of total revenue. In April 2001, we re-signed Apple
Computer to a one-year contract. We do not expect that revenue
from Apple Computer will exceed 10% of total revenue for any
future period. For the year ended December 31, 1999, Apple
Computer and Yahoo! accounted for 22% and 13% of total revenue,
respectively.

Cost of Service.

Cost of service increased to $55.1 million for the year
ended December 31, 2001 compared to $42.0 million for
the year ended December 31, 2000 and $6.8 million for
the year ended December 31, 1999. Cost of service increased
in each year primarily due to higher bandwidth costs as a result
of the expansion of our network and the increased amount of
content delivered over our network. Gross margins, excluding
network-related depreciation, were 66.2%, 53.2% and (70.9)% for
the years ended



December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. Gross margins increased in each period due to a
decline in the ratio of bandwidth costs to our service prices
and an increase in licensing revenue. Gross margins on our
service revenue, excluding network-related depreciation, were
59.3%, 48.2% and (70.9)% for the years ended December 31,
2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Our long range gross margin
target is 65%-70%. We believe that in order to achieve this
objective, we must closely manage our bandwidth contracts,
terminate unprofitable service agreements with customers and
maintain the price levels of our services.

Engineering and
Development.

Engineering and
development expenses consist primarily of salaries and
payroll-related expenses and other costs related to the design,
development, testing, deployment, operation, monitoring and
enhancement of our services and our network. To date, we have
expensed engineering and development costs as incurred. We
believe that product development is critical to our future
objectives and we intend to continue to enhance our technology
to meet the challenging requirements of market demand.
Engineering and development expenses were $61.5 million for
the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to
$55.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 and
$11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999.
Engineering and development expenses increased in 2001 compared
to 2000 due to increased personnel and payroll-related expenses
as a result of increased average headcount in the engineering
organization, partially offset by a decrease in consulting,
temporary employees and recruiting expenses. Engineering and
development expenses increased in 2000 compared to 1999
primarily due to an increase in personnel and payroll-related
expenses as a result of increased headcount in the engineering
organization. We do not expect the amount of engineering and
development expenses to increase during 2002 as compared to 2001.

Sales, General and
Administrative.

Sales, general and
administrative, or SG&A, expenses consist primarily of
salaries and payroll-related expenses for marketing, sales,
operations and finance personnel, sales commissions, fees for
professional services, advertising costs, provision for doubtful
accounts and rent expense for leased properties. SG&A
expenses were $146.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2001 compared to $152.5 million for the
year ended December 31, 2000 and $28.4 million for the
year ended December 31, 1999. SG&A decreased in 2001
primarily due to decreased travel expenditures, recruiting
expenditures and advertising expenses, partially offset by
increased personnel and payroll-related expenses due to an
increase in average headcount, increased provision for doubtful
accounts and increased insurance and legal expenses. SG&A
expenses increased in 2000 as compared to 1999 due to increased
personnel and payroll-related expenses as a result of increases
in headcount to support our growth. We do not expect the amount
of SG&A to increase during 2002 as compared to 2001.

Depreciation.

Depreciation expense consists of depreciation of our network
equipment and property and equipment used by us internally.
Depreciation expense was $73.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2001 compared to $35.6 million for the
year ended December 31, 2000 and $3.4 million for the
year ended December 31, 1999. Depreciation expense
increased in each year primarily as a result of the expansion of
our network. We do not expect depreciation expense to increase
substantially in 2002 as compared to 2001.

Amortization of Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets.

Amortization of goodwill and
other intangible assets consists primarily of the amortization
of intangible assets, including goodwill, acquired in business
combinations. Amortization of goodwill and other intangible
assets was $255.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2001 compared to $676.1 million for the
year ended December 31, 2000 and $47.0 million for the
year ended December 31, 1999. Amortization of goodwill and
other intangible assets decreased in 2001 as compared to 2000
due to a write-off of goodwill as a result of an impairment
recorded in the first quarter of 2001 as described under the
heading “Impairment of Goodwill” below. Amortization
of goodwill and other intangible assets increased in 2000
compared to 1999 due to acquisitions of businesses in 2000. We
expect amortization of other intangible assets to decrease
significantly in 2002 as compared to 2001. We will cease to
amortize goodwill as of January 2002 in accordance with SFAS
No. 142.

Acquired In-Process Research and Development.

Acquired in-process research and
development, which we refer to as IPR&D, consists of a
charge of $1.4 million in 2000 for the value of development
projects acquired from InterVu, which we acquired in April 2000,
that had not reached technological feasibility and had no
alternative future use. IPR&D was identified and valued
through interviews and analysis of data provided by management
regarding products under development. Development projects that
had reached



technological feasibility were classified as
completed technology and are being amortized over three years.
Projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had
no future alternative uses were classified as IPR&D and were
charged to expense on the date of the acquisition. The value of
IPR&D was determined based on each project’s stage of
development, the time and resources needed for completion, the
contribution of core technology and the projected discounted
cash flows of completed products. The discount rate was
determined considering our weighted average cost of capital and
the risks surrounding the successful completion of the projects
under development.

Equity-Related
Compensation.

Equity-related
compensation expense was $31.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2001 compared to $26.1 million for the
year ended December 31, 2000 and $10.0 million for the
year ended December 31, 1999. Equity-related compensation
expense increased in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to an
employee stock option exchange offer that was completed in May
2001 and that increased deferred compensation by
$36.1 million. For additional information on the exchange
offer, see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements
included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Equity-related
compensation increased in 2000 compared to 1999 primarily as a
result of the acceleration of stock option vesting for a number
of terminated employees. The balance of deferred compensation as
of December 31, 2001 was $38.9 million. We expect to
fully amortize this balance to equity-related compensation
expense over the next three years.

Impairment of
Goodwill.

Impairment of goodwill for
the year ended December 31, 2001 reflects a charge of
$1,912.8 million to adjust the carrying amount of goodwill
arising from the acquisitions of Network


and InterVu to
its fair value as of March 31, 2001. We periodically review
goodwill and other long-lived assets for potential impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of these assets may exceed their fair value. We
consider several factors in determining whether an impairment
may have occurred, including Akamai’s market capitalization
in relation to its book value, the overall business climate and
recent estimates for operating results of acquired businesses. A
review of these factors as of March 31, 2001 indicated that
an impairment assessment was required for long-lived assets of
acquired businesses. We grouped all long-lived assets for
acquired businesses, including goodwill and other intangible
assets, and estimated the future discounted cash flows related
to these long-lived assets. The discount rate used was based on
the risks associated with the acquired businesses. As a result
of this analysis, we recorded an impairment charge of
$1,912.8 million for the three months ended March 31,
2001 to adjust the carrying amount of goodwill to its fair value.

Restructuring charge.

Restructuring charges were
$40.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. In
April 2001, we terminated approximately 150 employees from all
areas of the Company and commenced the termination and
subleasing of excess office space under non-cancelable operating
leases. As a result of these actions, we recorded a
restructuring charge of $26.2 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2001. In October 2001, we reduced our
workforce by an additional 250 employees and vacated additional
operating leases. As a result, we recorded a restructuring
charge of $14.3 million for the three months ended
December 31, 2001. We expect that these actions will result
in salary and personnel-related savings of approximately
$35.0 million over the next fiscal year. These charges were
measured based on:

As of December 31, 2001, we had paid
substantially all of the severance liability. We plan to
complete the consolidation and subleasing of office space as
soon as possible, subject to market and other conditions. We
expect that we will complete the restructuring plan within one
year.



As of December 31, 2001, we had made
$11.6 million of cash payments against the restructuring
liability. The restructuring liability is summarized below (in
millions):

The restructuring liability related to
non-cancelable operating leases is based on then-available
market data and discussions with our lessors. In the event that
these operating leases are terminated at a higher or lower cost
than the amount accrued as of December 31, 2001, we will
record an adjustment to the restructuring liability through a
restructuring charge.

Interest Income.

Interest income consists of interest earned on invested cash
balances, which are invested in money market funds, United
States Treasury obligations and high-quality corporate
obligations. Interest income was $12.3 million for the year
ended December 31, 2001 compared to $22.9 million for
the year ended December 31, 2000 and $4.4 million for
the year ended December 31, 1999. Interest income decreased
in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily as a result of a decrease in
our invested cash. Interest income increased in 2000 compared to
1999 due to investment of the proceeds from the issuance of our
$300 million 5 1/2% convertible notes issued in June
2000 and from our initial public offering in October 1999. We
expect interest income to decrease in 2002 as a result of a
decrease in our invested cash balance.

Interest Expense.

Interest expense consists of interest
paid on our debt obligations and the amortization of deferred
financing costs. Interest expense was $18.9 million for the
year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $8.9 million
for the year ended December 31, 2000 and $2.1 million
for the year ended December 31, 1999. Interest expense
increased in 2001 compared with 2000 and increased in 2000 as
compared with 1999 as a result of interest expense accrued on
our 5 1/2% convertible notes. We expect interest expense to
remain approximately the same in 2002 as compared to 2001.

Other Income.

We
received $1.0 million in proceeds from a key-person life
insurance policy as a result of the death in September 2001 of
Daniel M. Lewin, our co-founder.

Losses in Equity Method
Investment.

Losses in equity method
investment of $2.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2001 reflects our share of the losses in
Sockeye. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial
statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for
further discussion of Sockeye.

Loss on Investments.

Loss on investments for the year ended December 31, 2001
includes a realized loss of $2.8 million from the sale of
an investment in the preferred stock of a private company and
$10.2 million to adjust the cost basis of equity
investments to fair value as a result of a decline in the values
of those investments that, in the opinion of management, was
other-than-temporary. See Note 5 to the consolidated
financial statements included in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K for further discussion.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Prior to our initial public offering in October
1999, we financed our operations primarily through private sales
of our capital stock and issuance of senior subordinated notes
totaling approximately $124.6 million in net proceeds
through December 31, 1999. In October 1999, we sold shares
of common stock through our initial public offering. Net
proceeds to us from the initial public offering were
$217.6 million after deducting an aggregate of
$16.4 million in underwriting discounts and commissions to
the underwriters. Since our initial public offering, we have
funded our operations through the cash raised in our initial
public offering, cash flows from operations and proceeds from
the sale of our 5 1/2% convertible notes.



In June 2000, we issued $300.0 million of
5 1/2% convertible notes for aggregate net proceeds of
$290.2 million. The notes are due July 1, 2007 and are
convertible any time, at the option of the holders, into shares
of our common stock at a conversion price of $115.47 per share,
subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. In January
2001, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission that will enable us to sell
up to $500 million of equity or debt securities in one or
more public offerings. To date, we have not offered or sold any
securities under this registration statement. In addition, we
have secured approximately $10 million in equipment
financing for future capital expenditures. As of
December 31, 2001, cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities totaled $210.5 million, $29.0 million of
which was restricted by letters of credit issued in favor of
third-party beneficiaries, principally related to operating
leases.

Cash used in operating activities was
$119.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001
compared to $122.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2000 and $32.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 1999. Cash used in operating activities in
2001 reflects an increase in losses from operations before
non-cash expenses such as amortization, depreciation and
equity-related compensation, and an increase in accounts
receivable, partially offset by an increase in current
liabilities and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current
assets. Cash used in operating activities in 2001 also includes
payments against our restructuring liability of
$11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. We
expect to make payments against our restructuring liability of
at least $17.6 million over the next 12 months and
$10.0 million thereafter. Payments against our
restructuring liability may be higher if we are unable to
terminate certain abandoned real estate operating leases at
expected rates or we are unable to obtain sublease income on
such properties. Cash used in operating activities in 2000 and
1999 reflects losses from operations prior to non-cash expenses
and an increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and
other current assets, partially offset by an increase in other
current liabilities. We expect cash flows from operating
activities to be negative through at least the next
12 months.

Cash provided by investing activities was
$39.6 million for the year ended December 30, 2001.
Cash used in investing activities was $316.1 million for
the year ended December 31, 2000 and $25.9 million for
the year ended December 31, 1999. Cash provided by
investing activities in 2001 reflects net purchases, sales and
maturities of investments of $103.8 million and purchases
of property and equipment of $64.5 million, consisting
primarily of servers for the deployment and expansion of our
network and information systems used to operate our business.
Cash used in investing activities in 2000 reflects net
purchases, sales and maturities of investments of
$201.4 million, purchases of property and equipment of
$131.9 million and cash acquired from the acquisition of
business of $17.2 million. Cash used in investing
activities in 1999 consists primarily of purchases of property
and equipment. We expect capital expenditures to decrease
significantly in 2002 as compared to 2001. We expect to finance
future capital expenditures through current cash and marketable
securities or vendor financing.

Cash provided by financing activities was
$8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001,
$320.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000
and $321.0 million for the year ended December 31,
1999. Cash provided by financing activities in 2001 consists of
proceeds from the issuance of common stock under stock option
and employee stock purchase plans and the repayment of notes
receivable from officers for stock, partially offset by payments
against capital lease obligations. Cash provided by financing
activities in 2000 consists primarily of the sale of our
5 1/2% convertible notes and the issuance of common stock
under stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Cash
provided by financing activities in 1999 primarily reflects the
sale of common stock in our initial public offering and the sale
of convertible preferred stock.

We believe, based on our present business plan,
that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working
capital and capital expenditures on both a short-term and
long-term basis. If the assumptions underlying our business plan
regarding future revenue and expenditures change or if
unexpected opportunities or needs arise, we may seek to raise
additional cash by selling equity or debt securities. If
additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt
securities, these securities could have rights, preferences and
privileges senior to those accruing to holders of common stock,
and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our
operations. The sale of additional equity or



convertible debt securities could result in
additional dilution to our stockholders. See “Factors
Affecting Future Operating Results.”

Contractual Obligations and Commercial
Commitments

The following table presents our contractual
obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31,
2001 over the next five years and thereafter (in millions):

(1)

This obligation may be satisfied in cash or
	common stock, at our option. See Note 17 to the consolidated
	financial statements located elsewhere in this Annual Report on
	Form 10-K.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Our exposure to market risk for changes in
interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. We
do not use derivative financial instruments in our portfolio. We
place our investments with high quality issuers and, by policy,
limit the amount of risk by investing primarily in money market
funds, United States Treasury obligations, high-quality
corporate obligations and certificates of deposit. An increase
or decrease in interest rates of 100 to 200 basis points would
not materially affect the fair value of our investment portfolio
as of December 31, 2001. We expect to hold our marketable
debt securities until maturity and do not expect to realize
significant losses on the sale of marketable debt securities
prior to maturity. We also hold investments in the common or
preferred stock of several public and private companies. The
carrying value of these investments at December 31, 2001
was $7.7 million. Due to the limited operating history of
these companies we may not be able to recover our initial
investment.

Our 5 1/2% convertible notes are subject to
changes in market value. As of December 31, 2001, the
carrying amount and market value of these notes were
$300.0 million and $156.0 million, respectively.

We have foreign operations in Europe and we have
established a joint venture in Japan. As a result, we are
exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. However, we
do not expect that changes in foreign exchange rates will have a
significant impact on our consolidated results of operations,
financial position or cash flows. We may continue to expand our
operations globally and sell to customers in foreign locations,
which may increase our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations.



Item 8.

Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data.

Index to Consolidated Financial
Statements



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Akamai Technologies, Inc.:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of
operations, of cash flows and of convertible preferred stock and
stockholders’ equity (deficit) present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Akamai
Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31,
2001 and 2000 and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2001 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company’s management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the

AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

1.     Nature of
Business and Basis of Presentation:

Akamai Technologies, Inc. (“Akamai” or
the “Company”) is a leading provider of secure,
outsourced e-business infrastructure services and software.
These services and software enable enterprises to reduce the
complexity and cost of deploying and operating a uniform
Internet Protocol, or IP, infrastructure while ensuring superior
performance, reliability, scalability and manageability.
Akamai’s services provide its commercial customers a
competitive advantage by providing a superior experience for
their end user customers without the need to manage and deploy a
complex internal infrastructure. Akamai’s intelligent edge
platform for content, streaming media and application delivery
is comprised of more than 13,500 servers within over
1,000 networks in 66 countries. The Company was
incorporated in Delaware in 1998 and has its corporate
headquarters at 500 Technology Square, Cambridge,
Massachusetts. Akamai operates in one business segment:
outsourced e-business infrastructure services and software.

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Akamai and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany transactions and balances have been
eliminated in consolidation. Certain reclassifications of prior
year amounts have been made to conform with current year
presentation.

2.     Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies:

Use of Estimates

The Company prepares its consolidated financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles that require management to make estimates and
assumptions about the carrying amounts of reported assets and
liabilities and related disclosures. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. Significant estimates used in these
financial statements include the allowance for doubtful
accounts, useful lives of depreciable and intangible assets, the
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and accrued
restructuring liabilities.

Revenue Recognition

Akamai recognizes revenue for its services and
licenses when an enforceable arrangement to deliver the service
or license has been established, the service or license has been
delivered to and accepted by the customer, the fee for the
service or license is fixed or determinable and collection is
reasonably assured.

Akamai recognizes revenue from its content
delivery and streaming services based on the customer’s
minimum monthly usage commitment plus usage in excess of the
minimum commitment as defined in the service arrangement. The
Company records installation and set-up fees as deferred revenue
and recognizes these fees ratably over the life of the customer
contract. The Company recognizes revenue from resellers based on
the resellers’ contracted non-refundable minimum purchase
commitment, plus amounts sold by the resellers to their
customers in excess of the minimum commitment.

Akamai recognizes revenue from professional
services as these services are performed. For certain long-term
contracts, Akamai recognizes revenue under the completed
contract method as provided by Statement of Position 81-1,
“Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and
Certain Production-Type Contracts.” Profit estimates on
long-term contracts are revised periodically based on changes in
circumstances, and losses on contracts are recognized in the
period that such losses become known. Generally, the terms of
long-term contracts provide for progress billings based on
completion of certain phases or work. Payments received in
advance of revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue.

Akamai recognizes revenue from software licenses
when the software is delivered to the customer and all other
revenue recognition criteria have been met. For multi-element
arrangements, Akamai allocates a portion of the total fee to the
undelivered element using vendor specific objective evidence of
fair value of that element. The remaining portion of the fee is
allocated to the delivered elements using the residual method.



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Revenue from maintenance and support is
recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement and is
included in service revenue on the statements of operations.
Deferred revenue includes customer advances and amounts that
have been billed per contractual terms but have not been
recognized as revenue.

From time to time, the Company enters into
contracts to purchase goods or services for the Company’s
operations from customers at or about the same time the Company
enters into contracts to sell services or license software to
these organizations. These transactions are separately
negotiated and recorded at terms Akamai considers to be
arm’s length. For all periods presented, revenue recognized
from vendors where the Company purchased goods or services from
the vendor at or about the same time that the Company entered
into contracts to sell services or license software was less
than 10% of total revenue.

Cost of Service

Cost of service consists primarily of fees paid
to network providers for bandwidth and fees for housing the
Company’s servers in third-party network data centers. Cost
of service also includes network storage costs; live event costs
including costs for production, encoding and signal acquisition;
and costs of professional services. Depreciation on network
equipment used to deliver the Company’s services is
separately stated on the consolidated statements of operations.
The Company enters into contracts for bandwidth with third-party
network providers with terms typically ranging from one to three
years. These contracts commit Akamai to pay minimum monthly fees
plus additional fees for bandwidth usage above the contracted
level and, in some instances, commit Akamai to share with the
third-party network providers a portion of the revenue
recognized from customers that use these third-party networks.
In some circumstances, Internet service providers
(“ISPs”) make available to Akamai rack space for the
Company’s servers and access to their bandwidth at
discounted or no cost. In exchange, the ISPs’ customers
benefit by receiving content through a local Akamai server
resulting in better content delivery. The Company does not
consider these relationships to represent the culmination of an
earnings process. Accordingly, the Company does not recognize as
revenue the value to the ISPs associated with the use of
Akamai’s servers and the Company does not recognize as
expense the value of the rack space and bandwidth received at
discounted or no cost.

Equity-Related Compensation

Akamai accounts for stock-based awards to
employees using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by
Accounting Principles Board Opinion (“APB”)
No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,” and related interpretations. Accordingly, no
compensation expense is recorded for stock-based awards issued
to employees in fixed amounts and with fixed exercise prices at
least equal to the fair market value of the Company’s
common stock at the date of grant. Akamai has adopted the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”) No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation,” through disclosure only for
stock-based awards issued to employees (Note 13). All
stock-based awards to non-employees are accounted for at their
fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 123.

Equity-related compensation is comprised of the
following:

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Engineering and Development
	Costs

Engineering and development costs consist
primarily of salaries and related personnel costs for the
design, deployment, testing, operation, monitoring and
enhancement of the Company’s services and network. Costs
incurred in the engineering and development of the
Company’s services are expensed as incurred, except certain
software development costs. Costs associated with the
development of software to be marketed externally are expensed
prior to the establishment of technological feasibility as
defined by SFAS No. 86, “Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise
Marketed,” and capitalized thereafter until the software is
available for general release to customers. To date, the
Company’s software development has been completed
concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility
and, accordingly, all software development costs have been
charged to expense as incurred in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements. Costs associated with the development of
internal–use software are expensed or capitalized in
accordance with Statement of Position 98-1,
“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
Obtained for Internal Use.” Capitalized costs are amortized
on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the
internal-use software. Costs eligible for capitalization under
Statement of Position 98-1 have been insignificant to date.

Concentrations of Credit Risk and Fair
	Value of Financial Instruments

The amounts reflected in the consolidated balance
sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair
value due to their short-term maturities. The fair value and
carrying amount of the Company’s 5 1/2% convertible
notes were approximately $156.0 million and $300.0 million,
respectively, as of December 31, 2001. Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to
concentration of credit risk consist primarily of marketable
securities and accounts receivable. Akamai’s cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities are held with financial
institutions that the Company believes to be of high credit
standing. Akamai’s equity investments in private companies
are carried at cost. These investments are reviewed periodically
for impairment that is other-than-temporary.

Akamai’s customer base consists of a large
number of geographically dispersed customers diversified across
several industries. As a result, concentration of credit risk
with respect to accounts receivable is not significant. For the
year ended December 31, 2001, no customer accounted for
more than 10% of revenue. For the year ended December 31,
2000, one customer accounted for 12% of total revenue. For the
year ended December 31, 1999, two customers accounted for
22% and 13% of total revenue, respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company’s provision for income taxes is
comprised of a current and a deferred provision. The current
income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes
payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. The
deferred income tax provision is calculated as the estimated
future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and
carryforwards using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in
which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation
allowances are provided if, based on the weight of available
evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Advertising Expense

The Company recognizes advertising expense as
incurred. The Company acquired a prepaid advertising contract as
a result of its acquisition in April 2000 of InterVu, Inc.
(Note 17). The prepaid asset is being amortized to
advertising expense over its remaining contractual life based on
usage. As of December 31, 2001, $5.6 million remains
to be amortized and is included in prepaid expenses and other
current assets. For the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000
and 1999, the Company recognized $5.6 million,
$24.8 million and $8.2 million, respectively, of
advertising expense.



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency of Akamai’s foreign
subsidiaries is the subsidiary’s local currency. The assets
and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the
applicable exchange rate as of the balance sheet date and
revenues and expenses are translated at an average rate over the
period. Currency translation adjustments are recorded as a
component of other comprehensive loss. Gains and losses on
intercompany transactions are recorded in operating expenses and
have not been material for the periods presented.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable
	Securities

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash held in
bank deposit accounts and short-term, highly liquid investments
with original maturities of three months or less at the date of
purchase. Cash equivalents are carried at amortized cost, which
approximates fair value.

Short-term marketable securities consist of high
quality corporate and government securities, which have original
maturities of more than three months at the date of purchase and
less than one year from the date of the balance sheet, and
equity investments in publicly-traded companies. Long-term
marketable securities consist of high quality corporate and
government securities with maturities of more than one year from
the date of the balance sheet. Short-term and long-term
marketable securities include investments that are restricted as
to withdrawal.

The Company classifies all debt securities and
equity securities with readily determinable market value as
“available for sale” in accordance with SFAS
No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities.” These investments are classified as
marketable securities on the consolidated balance sheets and are
carried at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses
reported as a separate component of other comprehensive loss.
Investments in the securities of private companies are carried
at cost. These investments are included in other long-term
assets on the consolidated balance sheets as they do not have
readily determinable fair values. The Company reviews all
investments for reductions in fair value that are
other-than-temporary. When such reductions occur, the cost of
the investment is adjusted to its fair value through “loss
on investments” on the consolidated statement of
operations. Gains and losses on investments are calculated on
the basis of specific identification.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
assets. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter
of related lease terms or their estimated useful lives. Property
and equipment acquired under capital lease are depreciated over
the shorter of the related lease terms or the useful life of the
asset. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of the assets disposed
and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the
accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in loss from
operations. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as
incurred.

Goodwill and Other Intangible
	Assets

Goodwill and other intangible assets consist of
goodwill, completed technology, assembled workforce and
trademarks and trade names arising from the acquisition of
businesses. These intangible assets are amortized using the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. External
legal costs incurred to defend intellectual property are
expensed as incurred. Intangible assets also include the cost of
acquired license rights to content delivery technology. These
license rights are amortized using the straight-line method over
ten years. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets,” assembled workforce was
reclassified to goodwill as of January 1, 2002. The Company
has performed a transition impairment test of



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

goodwill as of January 1, 2002. Goodwill
will no longer be amortized and will be subject to an impairment
test at least annually.

Impairment of Goodwill and Other Long-Lived
	Assets

Goodwill and other long-lived assets are reviewed
for impairment under the guidance of SFAS No. 121,
“Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of.” Under SFAS
No. 121, long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment
whenever events such as service discontinuance, technological
obsolescence, a reduction in the Company’s market
capitalization, facility closure or other changes in
circumstances, indicate that the carrying amount of such assets
may not be recoverable. When such events occur, the Company
compares the carrying amount of the assets to the undiscounted
expected future cash flows related to those assets. If this
comparison indicates that an impairment is present, the amount
of the impairment is calculated using discounted expected cash
flows using the Company’s weighted average cost of capital.

Recent Accounting
	Pronouncements

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 141,
“Business Combinations.” SFAS No. 141 requires
the purchase method of accounting for business combinations
initiated after June 30, 2001 and eliminates the
pooling-of-interests method. SFAS No. 141 did not have an
impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142,
which became effective January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 142
requires, among other things, the discontinuance of goodwill
amortization. In addition, the standard includes provisions for
the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles
as goodwill, reassessment of the useful lives of existing
recognized intangibles, reclassification of certain intangibles
out of previously reported goodwill and the identification of
reporting units for purposes of assessing potential future
impairments of goodwill. The adoption of SFAS No. 142
resulted in the reclassification of approximately
$1.0 million of assembled workforce intangible assets to
goodwill and the discontinuance of goodwill amortization as of
January 1, 2002.

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143,
“Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” which
will be effective for fiscal year 2003. SFAS No. 143
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations
associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and
the associated asset retirement costs. The Company deploys
servers in third party networks and data centers worldwide under
various co-location contracts. Many of these contracts require
the physical removal, at the Company’s expense, of servers
from the data centers at the conclusion of the contract. The
Company is reviewing whether these removal requirements
constitute an asset retirement obligation under SFAS
No. 143.

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets” which became effective January 1,
2002. SFAS No. 144 supercedes SFAS No. 121 and the
accounting and reporting provisions for the disposal of a
segment of a business of APB No. 30 “Reporting the
Results of Operations — Reporting the Effects of
Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual
and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions.” The
Company does not expect that the adoption of SFAS No. 144
will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial
statements.

3.     Net Loss per
Share:

Basic net loss per share is computed using the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
year. Diluted net loss per share is computed using the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the year,
plus the dilutive effect of potential common stock. Potential
common stock

consists of stock options and warrants, unvested
restricted common stock, contingently issuable stock and
convertible notes.

The following table sets forth the components of
potential common stock excluded from the calculation of diluted
net loss per share since their inclusion would be antidilutive:

4.     Comprehensive
Loss:

Comprehensive loss is equal to net loss,
unrealized gains and losses on investments and foreign currency

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Available-for-sale securities by contractual
maturity are as follows (in thousands):

For all periods presented, realized gains and
losses on sales of available-for-sale debt securities were not
material. For the year ended December 31, 2001, realized
losses on sales of equity securities were $2.8 million. For
the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recorded a
loss of $10.2 million to adjust the cost basis of
investments in equity securities to fair value as a result of a
reduction in the fair value that, in the opinion of the Company,
was other-than-temporary. The carrying amount of investments in
the equity of private companies, which are included in other
assets on the consolidated balance sheets, was $6.0 million
and $6.4 million as of December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.

A total of $29.0 million of the
Company’s marketable securities, of which
$17.8 million are classified as long-term and
$11.2 million are classified as short-term, are restricted
by irrevocable letters of credit issued in favor of third-party
beneficiaries. These restrictions lapse as the Company fulfills
its obligations relating to the letters of credit.

Depreciation expense on property and equipment
for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999 was
$73.8 million, $35.6 million and $3.4 million,
respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the
Company changed the estimated useful life of its internal use
computers from 3 to 2 years. The impact of the change in
estimate was an increase to depreciation expense of
$2.4 million in 2001.

7.     Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets:

The Company acquired goodwill and other
intangible assets through business acquisitions during the year
ended December 31, 2000. The Company also acquired license
rights from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1999.
The Company reviews goodwill and other long-lived assets for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated
that the carrying amount of these assets may exceed their fair
value. The Company considers several factors in determining
whether an impairment may have occurred, including the
Company’s market capitalization in relation to its book
value, the overall business climate and recent estimates for
operating results of acquired businesses. A review of these
factors as of March 31, 2001 indicated that an impairment
assessment was required for long-lived assets of acquired
businesses. The Company grouped all long-lived assets for
acquired businesses, including goodwill and other intangible
assets, and estimated the future discounted cash flows related
to these long-lived assets. The discount rate used was based on
the risks associated with the acquired businesses. As a result
of this analysis, the Company recorded an impairment charge of
$1,912.8 million for the three months ended March 31,
2001 to adjust the carrying amount of goodwill arising from the
acquisitions of Network


Communications Inc.
(“Network


”) and InterVu Inc.
(“InterVu”) to its fair value as of March 31,
2001.

As of December 31, 2001, the carrying amount
of goodwill was $4.0 million. In accordance with SFAS
No. 142, the Company reclassified to goodwill the carrying
amount of its assembled workforce intangible asset. The
resulting balance of goodwill was $4.9 million on
January 1, 2002. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, the
Company has determined that it currently has one reporting unit
and has assigned the entire balance of goodwill to this
reporting unit as of January 1, 2002 for purposes of
performing a transitional impairment test. The fair value of the
reporting unit was determined using the market capitalization of
Akamai as of January 1, 2002. The fair value was compared
to the net assets of the reporting unit, including goodwill. The
fair value exceeded the net assets of the reporting unit.
Accordingly, the Company concluded that no further impairment
analysis was necessary. The Company has designated
January 1 as the date for its annual impairment test.
Unless changes in events or circumstances indicate that an
impairment test is required, the Company will next test goodwill
for impairment on January 1, 2003.

Goodwill and other intangible assets consist of
the following (in thousands):

The Company has concluded that all other
intangible assets, with the exception of acquired license
rights, have a remaining useful life of between
6-12 months. The Company will continue to amortize the
acquired license rights over a remaining useful life of
6 years.



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

8.     Commitments
and Contingencies:

Operating and Capital Leases

The Company leases its facilities and certain
equipment under operating leases. Rent expense for the years
ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was
$14.4 million, $9.5 million and $599,000,
respectively. Operating leases expire at various dates through
2013 and generally require the payment of real estate taxes,
insurance, maintenance and operating costs. The Company also
leases certain equipment under capital leases. The minimum
aggregate future obligations under non-cancelable leases and
equipment loans as of December 31, 2001 are as follows (in
thousands):

The Company has issued letters of credit in the
aggregate amount of $20.1 million related to certain of its
operating leases. These letters of credit are collateralized by
$20.1 million of marketable securities that have been
restricted as to withdrawal (Note 5). The letters of credit
expire as the Company fulfills its operating lease obligations.
Certain of the Company’s operating leases include rent
escalation clauses. The Company normalizes rent expense on a
straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

Bandwidth Usage and Co-location
	Commitments

The Company has commitments for bandwidth usage
and co-location with various network service providers. For the
years ending December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, the minimum
commitments are approximately $23.0 million,
$12.2 million and $4.0 million, respectively.

Litigation

The Company is subject to legal proceedings,
claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of
business. The Company does not expect that the ultimate costs to
resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on its
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

On September 13, 2000, the Company, together
with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(“MIT”), filed suit in Massachusetts federal court
against Digital Island, Inc. for infringing an MIT patent
licensed exclusively to Akamai. That complaint was subsequently
amended to include a count seeking a declaratory judgment that
Akamai did not infringe a Digital Island patent and a count that
Digital Island infringes a patent the Company acquired as a
result of its acquisition of InterVu. In September 2000, Digital



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Island filed suit against the Company in federal
court in California alleging infringement of the Digital Island
patent that was the subject of Akamai’s declaratory
judgment request. All claims were heard in a jury trial in
Massachusetts federal court in December 2001. On
December 21, 2001, the jury found that Akamai does not
infringe Digital Island’s patent. Accordingly, the Company
does not believe that the these claims will have a material
adverse effect on its financial condition or results of
operations.

On September 21, 2000, the Company filed a
lawsuit against Digital Island in federal court in California
for false advertising, unfair competition, intentional
interference with contractual relationships and intentional
interference with business advantage. Akamai is seeking damages
and injunctive relief. On October 26, 2000, Digital Island
filed a counterclaim against the Company alleging that
distribution of certain marketing materials and statements
constituted false advertising, unfair competition, intentional
interference with contractual relationships and intentional
interference with business advantage. Digital Island is seeking
monetary damages and injunctive relief. Akamai intends to
vigorously prosecute its claim and aggressively defend Digital
Island’s counterclaim. The Company does not believe that
the resolution of these claims will have a material adverse
effect on its financial condition or results of operations.

Between July 2, 2001 and August 31,
2001, ten purported class action lawsuits were filed in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York against the Company and several of its officers and
directors as well as against the underwriters involved with its
October 28, 1999 initial public offering of common stock.
The complaints were filed allegedly on behalf of persons who
purchased Akamai common stock during different time periods, all
beginning on October 28, 1999 and ending on various dates.
The complaints are similar and allege violations of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 primarily based on the assertion that there was
undisclosed compensation received by the underwriters in
connection with the Company’s initial public offering.
Akamai is not presently able to reasonably estimate the amount
of potential losses, if any, related to these lawsuits.

In January 2000, a former employee of InterVu
filed an action against InterVu alleging that InterVu had
breached two restricted stock purchase agreements by failing to
deliver certain shares of stock after the employee’s
resignation. The plaintiff sought specific performance and
monetary damages. In April 2001, the court ruled in favor of the
plaintiff. The court assessed damages against the Company in the
amount of $1.9 million. The Company has filed a notice of
appeal of the trial court’s decision in this case. The
Company has accrued for the potential loss and has placed
$2.5 million, which includes interest, into an escrow
account pending the appeal.

In August 2001, Network Caching Technology,
L.L.C. (“NCT”) amended an existing patent infringement
action pending in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of California to join Akamai as a
co-defendant. The case alleges that numerous entities, namely,
Novell, Inc., Volera, Inc., CacheFlow, Inc., Inktomi Corporation
and Akamai, infringe four patents relating to network file
services and cache mechanisms. The Company believes that
NCT’s infringement allegations are without merit; however,
given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, there can be no
assurance that the Company will prevail in this action. The
Company is not presently able to reasonably estimate the amount
of potential loss, if any, related to this lawsuit.

CNN Prepaid Advertising

The Company may become obligated to issue cash or
common stock, at the Company’s option, to CNN News Group in
the amount of up to $10 million during 2002. See
Note 17 for more information.

9.     Senior
Subordinated Notes and Convertible Notes:

Senior Subordinated Notes

In April 1999, Akamai entered into note and
warrant purchase agreements with private investors. Under the
agreements, Akamai issued 15% subordinated demand notes payable
in the aggregate amount of $15.0 million due in May 2004.
In connection with the notes, the Company also issued warrants
to purchase an aggregate of 2,002,836 shares of common stock at
$2.50 per share in exchange for cash. These warrants expire in
May 2004. The fair value of the warrants at the time of issuance
was estimated to be approximately $3.9 million, which was
recorded as additional paid-in capital and reduced the carrying
value of the notes. The fair value was determined using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model. The discount on the notes
was amortized over the term of the notes. For the year ended
December 31, 1999, interest expense of $1.5 million
was recognized related to the fair value of the warrants. In
December 1999, the Company exercised its right to pay off the
notes in full and paid $12.2 million in interest and
principal. The remaining unpaid balance of $2.8 million was
paid in the year ended December 31, 2000. The Company
recognized an extraordinary loss from early extinguishments of
the debt of $3.4 million (or $0.11 per share) during
the year ended December 31, 1999.

Convertible Notes

In June 2000, Akamai issued $300.0 million
of 5 1/2% Convertible Subordinated Notes due July 1,
2007 (the “Convertible Notes”) for aggregate net
proceeds of approximately $290.2 million (net of
underwriting fees and other offering expenses of
$9.8 million). The Convertible Notes are convertible at any
time into the Company’s common stock at a conversion price
of $115.47 per share (equivalent to 8.6603 shares of common
stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes), subject
to adjustment in certain events. The Company may redeem the
Convertible Notes on or after July 3, 2003, at the
Company’s option. In the event of a change of control,
Akamai may be required to repurchase all or a portion of the
Convertible Notes at a repurchase price of 100% of the principal
amount plus accrued interest. Interest on the Convertible Notes
accrues as of the issue date and is payable semiannually on
January 1 and July 1 of each year, commencing on
January 1, 2001. The Convertible Notes are unsecured
obligations and are subordinated to all existing and future
senior indebtedness of the Company. Deferred financing costs of
$9.8 million, including underwriting fees and other
offering expenses, for the Convertible Notes are being amortized
over the term of the notes. Amortization of deferred financing
costs was approximately $1.4 million and $740,000 for the
years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

10.     Restructuring:

During the year ended December 31, 2001, the
Company recorded a restructuring charge of $40.5 million.
The restructuring charge represents severance benefits for
terminated employees and exit costs related to abandoned real
property leases, net of estimated sublease income. The following
table summarizes the recorded accruals and usage of the
restructuring charge (in millions):



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Approximately 400 employees from all areas of the
Company were included in the severance. As of December 31,
2001, the Company had paid substantially all of the severance
liability. In connection with the reduction in its current and
anticipated employee base, the Company implemented an exit plan
with respect to excess office space under non-cancelable
operating leases. The exit plan is expected to be completed
within one year. The Company recognized a liability for the
estimated amount of future rent payments for permanently vacated
properties, less estimated sublease income, and the estimated
amount of lease termination fees. In addition, the Company
determined that capitalized leasehold improvements located in
certain abandoned facilities were also impaired.

11.     Convertible
Preferred Stock:

Prior to the closing of the Company’s
initial public offering (“IPO”) in October 1999, the

at $7.60 per share, 1,327,500 shares of Series B preferred
stock at $15.066 per share, 145,195 shares of Series C
preferred stock at $34.436 per share, 685,194 of Series D

Series E preferred stock at $26.239 per share, and 985,545
shares of Series F preferred stock at $15.22 per share.
Each series of preferred stock except the Series A
preferred stock accrued a cumulative dividend equal to 8.0% of
the original purchase price. The Company accrued a total of
$2.2 million of preferred stock dividends and accretion to
redemption value for the year ended December 31, 1999. Upon
completion of the IPO, all outstanding shares of preferred stock
automatically converted into shares of common stock. In November
1999, the Company’s board of directors authorized 5,000,000
shares of newly undesignated preferred stock with a par value of
$0.01 per share. As of December 31, 2001, no shares of
preferred stock were outstanding.

12.     Stockholders’
Equity:

Public Offering

In October 1999, Akamai completed an initial
public offering of 9,000,000 shares of its common stock for net
proceeds of $215.4 million after underwriting discounts,
commissions, and offering expenses. As a result, all outstanding
shares of preferred stock automatically converted into
38,467,466 shares of common stock.

Stock Split

On each of January 28, 1999 and May 25,
1999, the Company effected a 3-for-1 stock split through a stock
dividend of common stock. On September 8, 1999 the Company
effected a 2-for-1 stock split through a stock dividend of
common stock. All references in the Company’s consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto to preferred and common
stock share and per share amounts including options and warrants
to purchase common stock have been retroactively restated to
reflect the stock splits.

Common Stock

The common stockholders are entitled to one vote
per share. In May 2000, the stockholders of the Company approved
an increase in the number of authorized shares from 300,000,000
to 700,000,000. At December 31, 2001, the Company had

the notes issued by the Vice President of Product Marketing and
Business Development and the Chief Financial Officer were each
amended and replaced with new full recourse notes in the amounts
of $721,000 and $2,619,750, respectively (together, the
“Replacement Notes”). Each Replacement Note bears
interest at a rate of 4.0% and is payable in full by
July 23, 2009. Payment obligations on the Replacement Notes
may be accelerated at the option of the Company if the maker
ceases to be employed by the Company for any reason. In 2000,
the Company acquired a note receivable from an officer in the
amount of $228,000 in a business acquisition. This note was paid
in full in 2000.

13.     Stock
Plans:

In 1998, the Board of Directors adopted the 1998
Stock Incentive Plan (the “1998 Plan”) for the
issuance of incentive and nonqualified stock options and
restricted stock awards. Options to purchase common stock and
restricted stock awards are granted at the discretion of the
Board of Directors. In December 2001, the Board of Directors
adopted the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan (the
“2001 Plan”) for the issuance of nonqualified
stock options and restricted stock awards. The total number of
shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the
1998 Plan and the 2001 Plan is 41,255,600 and 5,000,000
shares, respectively. Equity incentives may not be issued to the
Company’s directors or executive officers under the
2001 Plan.

Under the terms of the 1998 Plan, the
exercise price of incentive stock options granted must not be
less than 100% (110% in certain cases) of the fair market value
of the common stock on the date of grant, as determined by the
Board of Directors. Incentive stock options may not be issued
under the 2001 Plan. The exercise price of nonqualified
stock options issued under the 1998 Plan or the 2001 Plan
may be less than the fair market value of the common stock on
the date of grant, as determined by the Board of Directors, but
in no case may the exercise price be less than the statutory
minimum. Stock option vesting is typically four years and is at
the discretion of the Board of Directors. The term of options
granted cannot exceed ten years, or five years for incentive
stock options granted to holders of more than 10% of the voting
stock of the Company.

Restricted stock awards may be issued out of the
1998 Plan to directors, officers, advisors and employees at
prices determined by the Compensation Committee.
Participants’ unvested shares are subject to repurchase by
the Company at the original purchase price for between two and
four years. Generally, 25% of the shares vest between six months
and one year of the date of purchase and, thereafter, the
remaining shares vest on a quarterly basis through the fourth
anniversary date of purchase. As of December 31, 2001, the
Company had the right to repurchase up to 4,985,994 unvested
shares at the original purchase prices ranging from $0.01 to
$2.50 per share.

The Company has assumed certain stock option
plans and the outstanding stock options of companies that have
been acquired (“Assumed Plans”). Stock options under
the Assumed Plans have been converted into the Company’s
stock options and adjusted to effect the appropriate conversion
ratio as specified by the applicable acquisition agreement, but
are otherwise administered in accordance with the terms of the
Assumed Plans. Stock options under the Assumed Plans generally
vest over four years and expire ten years from the date of
grant. No additional stock options will be granted under the
Assumed Plans.



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Employee
Stock Purchase Plan

In August 1999, the Board of Directors adopted
the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“1999 ESPP”).
The Company reserved 600,000 shares of common stock for issuance
under the 1999 ESPP. In May 2001, the Company approved an
increase to the amount of shares reserved for issuance under the
1999 ESPP to 3,100,000. The 1999 ESPP allows participating
employees to purchase shares of common stock at a 15% discount
from the market value of the stock as determined on specific
dates at six month intervals. As of December 31, 2001,
approximately $339,000 had been withheld from employees for
future purchases under the 1999 ESPP.

Fair Value
Disclosure

As discussed in Note 2, the Company has
adopted SFAS No. 123 for options issued to employees
through disclosure only. Had the Company accounted for stock
options issued to employees under the fair value method
prescribed by SFAS No. 123, Akamai’s net loss and
basic and diluted net loss per share would have been as follows
(in thousands):



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The effects of applying SFAS No. 123 in this
pro forma disclosure are not necessarily indicative of future
results. The fair value of each option is estimated on the grant
date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
following assumptions:

Equity-Related
Compensation

(a)     Deferred
Compensation:

For the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000
and 1999, equity-related compensation includes
$23.3 million, $10.0 million and $10.0 million,
respectively, of deferred compensation amortization. Deferred
compensation amortization in 2001 includes $9.3 million for
the amortization of the deferred compensation balance as of
December 31, 2000. During 2001, the following events
significantly increased the deferred compensation balance:

Exchange
Offer

In April 2001, the Company communicated to its
employees an offer to exchange (the “Exchange Offer”)
certain employee stock options having an exercise price of more
than $13.00 per share previously granted to them in return for
restricted shares of Akamai common stock at an exchange ratio of
two stock options for one share of restricted stock. In
addition, certain stock options granted in February 2001 were
eligible to be exchanged at a ratio of one stock option for two
shares of restricted stock. Employees who accepted the Exchange
Offer were required to exchange any stock option granted to them
after November 3, 2000 (whether or not the exercise price
of any such stock option was more than $13.00 per share) and to
forfeit certain stock options granted to them in October 2000.
Until the restricted stock vests, such shares are subject to
forfeiture for up to three years in the event the employee
leaves the Company. Generally, 25% of the shares vest after six
months and the remaining 75% of the shares vest quarterly
thereafter until the third anniversary of the effective date of
the Exchange Offer. On April 4, 2001, the Company filed the
Exchange Offer as a tender offer with the Securities and
Exchange Commission in accordance with Rule 13e-4 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Exchange Offer
was effective on May 5, 2001, and the Company accepted all
stock options tendered.

As a result of the Exchange Offer, stock options
to purchase approximately 6.6 million shares of Akamai
common stock were exchanged for 3.4 million shares of
restricted stock. In accordance with FASB Interpretation
No. 44, the Company recorded $36.1 million as deferred
compensation for the intrinsic value of the restricted stock
issued to employees who accepted the Exchange Offer. The
deferred compensation will be amortized over the vesting period
of the restricted stock. For the year ended December 31,
2001, $10.2 million had been amortized to equity-related
compensation. As of December 31, 2001, 728,221 shares
had been repurchased and retired by the Company as a result of
employee terminations, resulting in a reduction in deferred
compensation of approximately $7.7 million.



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Restricted
Stock and Stock Option Awards

During the year ended December 31, 2001,
deferred compensation was increased by $15.1 million as a
result of the issuance of 2.2 million shares of restricted
common stock at a purchase price of $0.01 per share and the
grant of options to purchase 53,419 shares of common stock at an
exercise price of $1.17 per share. The deferred compensation
will be amortized over the vesting periods of the equity awards.
For the year ended December 31, 2001, $3.7 million had
been amortized to equity-related compensation. As of
December 31, 2001, 318,204 shares had been repurchased and
retired by the Company as a result of employee terminations,
resulting in a reduction in deferred compensation of
approximately $2.0 million. In addition, the Company
repurchased 236,250 shares of restricted common stock that had
been issued in 1998, which decreased deferred compensation by
$245,000.

(b)     Equity Award
Modifications:

Equity-related compensation includes the
intrinsic value of modified stock option or restricted stock
awards that would have expired as unexercisable had the
associated vesting of the awards not been accelerated. For the
years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, equity compensation
includes $5.2 million and $13.8 million, respectively, for
equity award modifications.

(c)     Equity Bonus
Awards:

Equity-related compensation includes the
intrinsic value of equity awards issued to employees as
incentive bonuses. These awards are issued quarterly and
annually in accordance with incentive bonus plans. For the years
ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, equity-related
compensation includes $3.1 million and $2.3 million,
respectively, for equity bonuses. Equity bonuses in 2001 include
the issuance of 283,529 shares of restricted common stock at a
purchase price of $0.01 per share and the grant of options to
purchase 174,561 shares of common stock at a weighted average
exercise price of $1.09. Equity bonuses in 2000 included the
grant of options to purchase 103,822 shares of common stock at a
weighted average exercise price of $5.13.

(d)     Awards to
Non-Employees:

The Company has issued equity awards to advisors
and other non-employees. The Company recognizes the fair value
of these awards in equity-related compensation over the vesting
period of the awards pursuant to the requirements of SFAS
No. 123. Amounts recorded in all years presented have not
been material.

Warrants

Prior to its IPO in October 1999, the Company
issued warrants to investors in connection with borrowings
(Note 9). The Company also became obligated to honor
warrants that had been issued by acquired businesses. As of
December 31, 2001, there were 1,052,694 outstanding and
exercisable warrants to issue common stock at an exercise price
range of $2.50 to $151.08.

14.     Employee
Benefit Plan:

under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Eligible
employees are permitted to contribute to the 401(k) plan through
payroll deductions within statutory and plan limits.
Participants may select from a variety of investment options.
Investment options do not include Akamai common stock. The
Company provides limited matching of employee contributions to
the 401(k) plan. The Company has contributed approximately
$826,000 and $605,000 of cash to the savings plan for the years

As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the
Company has federal and state net operating loss carryforwards
of approximately $789.0 million and $617.0 million,
respectively, that expire at various dates through 2020. The
Company also has federal and state tax credit carryforwards as
of December 31, 2001 and 2000 of approximately
$9.2 million and $2.3 million, respectively. Pursuant
to Internal Revenue Code Sections 382 and 383, use of the
Company’s acquired net operating loss and credit
carryforwards may be subject to annual limitation due to a
change in ownership of more than 50%.

Approximately $141.0 million of the net
operating loss carryforwards available for federal income tax
purposes relate to the exercises of non-qualified stock options
and disqualifying disposition of incentive stock options, the
tax benefit from which, if realized, will be credited to
additional paid-in capital.

16.     Transactions
with Related Parties:

From time to time, the Company may engage in
transactions with parties that have relationships with officers
or directors of the Company or entities in which the Company has
an ownership interest. Such transactions are reviewed by the
Board of Directors and are subject to the prior approval of
members of the Board of Directors who do not have a personal
interest in the applicable transaction. During the year ended
December 31, 2001, the Company entered into the following
transactions with related parties:

(a) In the fourth quarter of 2000, Akamai
formed Sockeye Networks, Inc., formerly known as Arriva!
Networks, Inc. (“Sockeye”), as a wholly-owned
subsidiary and contributed certain technology in exchange for
all outstanding capital stock of Sockeye. Sockeye provides
intelligent Internet routing services. In January 2001, Akamai
deconsolidated Sockeye concurrently with the sale by Sockeye of
a majority interest in its equity to outside investors in return
for $28.0 million in cash. Akamai received no cash proceeds
from Sockeye’s sale of its capital stock, and Akamai’s
equity interest in Sockeye was reduced to approximately 40%.
Akamai maintains two out of five seats on Sockeye’s board
of directors.

Subsequent to the deconsolidation of
Sockeye’s financial statements, Akamai adopted the equity
method to account for its investment in Sockeye. For the year
ended December 31, 2001, Akamai’s share of
Sockeye’s losses was $2.0 million, which is recorded
in losses in equity method investment on the consolidated
statement of operations. The Company discontinued recognizing
its equity interest in Sockeye’s losses during the year
ended December 31, 2001 as the carrying amount of its
investment in Sockeye had been reduced to zero. The Company does
not guarantee the obligations of Sockeye and has no obligation
to provide future financing to Sockeye.

In January 2001, Akamai entered into a five-year
renewable license agreement with Sockeye for additional
technology that required Sockeye to pay to Akamai a minimum
monthly license fee of $1.0 million. Effective July 1,
2001, Akamai and Sockeye terminated the original license
agreement and entered into a new perpetual license agreement.
The fee for the new perpetual license was $3.8 million. In
addition, the parties entered into a quarterly service agreement
that is renewable at Sockeye’s option. Payments due under
the service agreement are based on a percentage of
Sockeye’s revenue, subject to quarterly minimum
commitments. Total license and service fees paid by Sockeye
during year ended December 31, 2001 were $9.2 million.
In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2001,
Sockeye paid Akamai $4.0 million for technology development
work performed by Akamai.

(b) In the first quarter of 2001, the
Company invested $5.0 million in Netaxs, Inc.
(“Netaxs”), a company in which a senior manager of
Akamai is an officer and holds a significant ownership interest.
The investment has been recorded in other assets on the
consolidated balance sheet. Akamai purchased approximately
$2.2 million of bandwidth and co-location space from Netaxs
during the year ended December 31, 2001. Akamai has future
minimum bandwidth and co-location commitments of
$5.2 million to Netaxs over the next three years. Sales to
Netaxs were $500,000 in 2000. There were no sales to Netaxs
in 2001.



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(c) In April 2001, Akamai and SOFTBANK
Broadmedia Corporation (“SBBM”), a subsidiary of
SOFTBANK Group, formed a joint venture to create Akamai
Technologies Japan KK (“Akamai Japan”). Akamai Japan
is the exclusive provider of Akamai’s services in Japan.
Akamai Japan is owned 60% by SBBM and 40% by Akamai. Akamai
Japan’s board of directors is comprised of seven seats,
four of which are controlled by SBBM and three of which are
controlled by Akamai. Akamai accounts for its investment in
Akamai Japan using the equity method. The Company has not
recognized its equity interest in Akamai Japan’s losses
during the year ended December 31, 2001 as the carrying
amount of its investment is zero. Akamai does not guarantee the
obligations of Akamai Japan and has no obligation to provide
future financing to Akamai Japan. Akamai recognized
$2.2 million of revenue from Akamai Japan during the year
ended December 31, 2001. As of December 31, 2001,
$750,000 due from Akamai Japan is included in accounts
receivable.

(d) A member of Akamai’s board of
directors served on the board of directors of one of the
Company’s bandwidth providers during a portion of 2001 but
no longer serves as a director of such company. This bandwidth
provider was also a customer to which Akamai provided
$2.25 million in services and software in 2000. There were
no sales to this company in 2001 or 1999. The Company purchased
approximately $800,000 of bandwidth and co-location from this
company during 2001.

(e) An officer of Akamai served on the board
of directors of one of the Company’s customers. Sales to
that customer were $250,000 in 2000. There were no sales to this
customer in 2001.

17.     CNN Prepaid
Advertising:

In November 1999, InterVu, which was acquired by
Akamai in April 2000, entered into an advertising agreement with
the CNN News Group (“CNN”). In accordance with the
agreement, InterVu issued common stock valued at $20.0 million
to CNN. In return, CNN agreed to provide InterVu with three
years of on-air and online advertising and promotional
opportunities across CNN’s properties. As part of its
purchase price allocation, Akamai estimated the fair value of
these services to be $18.4 million. This amount has been
recorded as an asset and is being amortized over the remaining
life of the agreement, based on usage, to advertising expense.
For the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000,
$5.6 million and $7.2 million has been amortized to
advertising expense, respectively. The remaining balance of
$5.6 million is classified as a prepaid expenses and other
current assets on the consolidated balance sheet and will be
amortized in full during 2002.

In connection with its acquisition of InterVu,
Akamai issued shares of its common stock to CNN in exchange for
shares of InterVu common stock held by CNN and assumed certain
obligations relating to such shares as described herein. The
Company has issued a letter of credit in the amount of
$3.8 million for the benefit of CNN in accordance with the
agreement. The Company may become obligated to pay CNN up to
$10.0 million in cash or common stock, at the
Company’s option, if CNN holds its Akamai shares until
November 11, 2002, and the price per share of Akamai common
stock is less than $144.05 at such date. At the time of the
acquisition of InterVu, the Company estimated the fair value of
the price guarantee and included the estimated value of the
guarantee in the purchase price of InterVu.

Either party may terminate the contract at any
time for a material breach by the other party that remains
uncured or the other party’s bankruptcy or similar adverse
condition. In the event the agreement is terminated by CNN, CNN
is required to pay Akamai as of the date of the termination
notice the value of the undelivered services purchased under the
agreement. In the event the agreement is terminated by Akamai
because CNN engages another party to provide Internet video
management and delivery services, CNN is required to pay Akamai
as of the date of the termination (i) the value of the
undelivered services purchased under the agreement and
(ii) a breakup fee of $3.0 million initially that
declines to zero over the term of the agreement.

20.     Business
Acquisitions:

All business acquisitions during the three-year
period ended December 31, 2001 have been accounted for
using the purchase method. The Company’s consolidated
results of operations include the operating results of the
acquired companies from their acquisition dates. Acquired assets
and liabilities were recorded at their estimated fair market
values at the acquisition date and the aggregate purchase price
plus the cost directly attributable to the acquisitions has been
allocated to the assets and liability acquired. The purchase
price in excess of identifiable net assets was recorded as
goodwill.

In February 2000, the Company acquired all of the
outstanding common and preferred stock of Network

a
provider of Internet broadcasting application services, in
exchange for approximately 621,000 shares of Akamai common stock
and $12.5 million in cash. Akamai also issued options and
warrants exercisable for approximately 196,000 shares of Akamai
common stock in exchange for all outstanding options and

acquisition costs, was $203.6 million. The
excess cost over the fair value of net assets acquired of
$200.7 million was allocated to goodwill and other
intangible assets, which are being amortized on a straight-line
basis over their useful lives. During the year ended
December 31, 2001, the Company recorded an impairment
charge to adjust goodwill to its fair value (Note 7).

In April 2000, the Company acquired all of the
outstanding common and preferred stock of InterVu, a service
provider for Internet audio and video delivery solutions, in
exchange for 10.0 million shares of Akamai common stock.
Akamai also issued options and warrants exercisable for
2.2 million shares of Akamai common stock in exchange for
all outstanding options and warrants exercisable for InterVu
common stock. The cost of the acquisition was $2.8 billion
based on the fair value of the consideration paid plus direct
acquisition costs. The Company may be required to deliver
additional securities to a former stockholder of InterVu based
on the future price of Akamai stock (Note 17). The excess
cost over the fair value of net assets acquired of
$2.8 billion was allocated to goodwill and other intangible
assets, which are being amortized on a straight-line basis over
their useful lives. Approximately $1.4 million of the
purchase price was allocated to in-process research and
development expense. During the year ended December 31,
2001, we recorded an impairment charge to adjust goodwill to its
fair value (Note 7). During the year ended
December 31, 2001, the Company issued approximately 184,000
shares of common stock to a former holder of InterVu preferred
stock upon the exercise of a conversion feature of the preferred
stock. The fair value of these additional shares had been
included in the purchase price of InterVu. Accordingly, no
adjustment to the purchase price was made upon the issuance of
these shares.

In July 2000, the Company acquired all of the
outstanding common and preferred stock of CallTheShots Inc.
(“CTS”),a developer of services that enable Web site
visitors to personalize their interaction with the sites they
visit, in exchange for 31,493 shares of Akamai common stock and
$259,000 in cash. In addition, 20,458 shares of Akamai common
stock and $434,000 in cash were placed in an escrow account and
were released over one year to certain former stockholders of
CTS as they continued employment with Akamai. The Company
recorded equity-related compensation for the escrowed shares in
the amount of $1.7 million ratably over the contingency
period based on the fair value of Akamai common stock on the
closing date of the acquisition. The excess purchase price over
the fair value of net assets acquired of $4.2 million was
assigned to goodwill and other intangible assets, which are
being amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.
