Overview

Akamai Technologies, Inc. provides services and
software that enable the world’s leading enterprises and
government agencies to extend and control their e-business
infrastructure. Akamai’s services are designed to enable
enterprises and government agencies to extend the reach of their
e-business infrastructures by ensuring the highest levels of
availability, reliability and performance for all their business
processes. Through the world’s largest distributed
computing platform, Akamai offers its customers seamless
information flow and robust, confident control of information,
enabling the secure delivery of networked information and
applications. Our services are built upon our globally
distributed platform for content, streaming media, and
application delivery, which is comprised of more than 13,000
servers within over 1,100 networks in 66 countries.

We began selling our content delivery services in
1999 under the trade name FreeFlow. Later that year, we added
streaming media delivery services to our portfolio and
introduced traffic management services that allow customers to
monitor traffic patterns on their websites both on a continual
basis and for specific events. In 2000, we began offering a
software solution that identifies the geographic location and
network origin from which end users access our customer’s
websites, enabling content providers to customize content
without compromising user privacy. In 2001, we commenced
commercial sales of our EdgeSuite offering, a suite of services
that allows for high-performance and dynamic delivery of web
content and applications to end users, wherever they are located
globally. These services include content and application
delivery, content targeting and personalization, business
intelligence and streaming media.

Our services are easy to implement and are highly
scalable. Historically, our FreeFlow customers selected
bandwidth-intensive content, typically media-rich non-text
objects such as photographs, banner advertisements and graphics,
for delivery over our platform. With the introduction of our
EdgeSuite service, customers may dynamically deliver a broader
range of content and applications — such as customer
relationship management tools, pay-per-view video, software
updates and entire websites — over our platform. The
technology underlying our EdgeSuite service enables us to locate
applications and content geographically closer to end users.
Using the proprietary algorithms we have developed that
continuously monitor and load-balance our network in real-time,
we determine the most efficient methods and routes available for
delivering the applications and content to our customers’
end users.

We were incorporated in Delaware in 1998 and have
our corporate headquarters at 8 Cambridge Center, Cambridge,
Massachusetts. Our Internet website address is www.akamai.com.
We are not including the information contained on our website as
part of, or incorporating it by reference into, this annual
report on Form 10-K.

We are registered as a reporting company under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which we refer
to as the Exchange Act. Accordingly, we file with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, or the Commission, annual reports on
Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current
reports on Form 8-K as required by the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations of the Commission. We refer to these
reports as Periodic Reports. The public may read and copy any
Periodic Reports or other materials we file with the



Commission at the Commission’s Public
Reference Room at 450 Fifth Street, NW, Washington, DC
20549. Information on the operation of the Public Reference Room
is available by calling 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, the
Commission maintains an Internet website that contains reports,
proxy and information statements and other information regarding
issuers, such as Akamai, that file electronically with the
Commission. The address of this website is http://www.sec.gov.

We make available, free of charge, on or through
our Internet website our Periodic Reports and amendments to
those Periodic Reports as soon as reasonably practicable after
we electronically file them with the Commission.

Industry Background

The end of the 20th century witnessed the
explosive growth of the Internet and the emergence of
e-business. E-business is the use of the Internet to streamline
processes, improve productivity and increase efficiencies,
enabling enterprises to easily communicate with customers,
vendors and partners, connect back-end data systems and transact
commerce in a secure manner. The Internet, however, is a complex
system of networks that was not originally created to
accommodate the volume or sophistication of today’s
business communication demands. As a result, information is
frequently delayed or lost on its way through the Internet as a
result of many potential bottlenecks, including:

Driven by competition, globalization and
cost-containment strategies, e-business is becoming a critical
component for corporate enterprises. These trends require
enterprises to rely on an agile e-business infrastructure to
meet their real-time strategic and business objectives. We
expect enterprises to favor more decentralized information
technology architecture to support their goals of disaster
recovery, high availability, denial-of-service mitigation and
back up. We also anticipate that enterprises will continue to
expand their use of technologies that allow an enterprise to
conduct business over the Internet, which are referred to at
Internet Protocol, or IP, technologies.

Our Solutions

Akamai offers a broad range of secure e-business
infrastructure solutions and software that enable customers to
reduce the complexity and cost of deploying and operating a
uniform IP infrastructure while ensuring superior performance,
reliability, scalability and manageability. Forming the core of
these solutions is our EdgeSuite offering, a suite of services
that allows enterprises to maximize performance and minimize
cost while distributing their Internet-related content and
applications using IP technology.

By moving electronic content and applications
closer to our customers’ end users, our EdgeSuite service
allows enterprises to improve the end-user experience, boost
reliability and scalability and reduce the cost of their
e-business infrastructure. We believe that our EdgeSuite
offering is the only service available in the industry capable
of providing the benefits of distributed performance to an
enterprise’s entire website and all aspects of its
applications. Our EdgeSuite service reduces the amount of IP
infrastructure required to maintain a global Internet presence.
Site owners maintain a control copy of their applications and
content, and our EdgeSuite service provides global delivery,
load balancing and storage, thereby enabling businesses to focus
valuable resources on strategic matters, rather than tactical
infrastructure issues.



Customers of our EdgeSuite service have access to
the following service and software features:

•

Secure Content

Enterprises are increasingly aware that having
    the ability to transmit content securely over the Internet is a
    crucial component of their e-business program. Our services
    offer support for the distribution of secure Internet-related
    content. Using Secure Sockets Layer, or SSL, transport, our
    EdgeSuite offering ensures that content is distributed privately
    and reliably between two communicating applications.

•

Tiered Distribution

As their websites and interactions become more
    complex, enterprises are seeking tools to manage their Internet
    presence. Tiered distribution is a hierarchical content
    distribution method that we use on behalf of participating
    customers. With this approach, a set of well-connected
    “core” server regions are available to store given
    content and, thus, to alleviate the load on the customer’s
    origin servers. Akamai’s edge servers can obtain content
    from these core server regions in lieu of going to the
    customer’s origin servers under certain conditions. As a
    result, we are able to efficiently distribute our
    customers’ content based on unique characteristics and
    patterns so that our customers can significantly reduce the load
    on their IP infrastructure and protect their online business
    from unexpected spikes in demand.

•

Site Fail Over

It is essential that e-businesses maintain
    constant availability of their websites. Our EdgeSuite service
    guarantees delivery of default content in the event that the
    primary, or source, version of the website of an enterprise
    customer becomes unavailable. Our EdgeSuite offering’s
    default content capabilities provide a solution for:

•

Site
    mirroring

— we provide an
    economical way to mirror a website without the expense of
    investing in additional data centers to achieve redundancy.

•

Disaster
    recovery

— we provide a
    backup if an unforeseen event causes a website to crash.

•

Site
    maintenance

— we deliver
    fail-over service so that a website remains available to end
    users during updates and maintenance.

•

Net Storage

For an enterprise to most effectively utilize the
    Internet, efficient content storage solutions are essential. Our
    EdgeSuite service provides a complete solution for digital
    storage needs for all content types. Our EdgeSuite Net Storage
    feature uses multiple terabytes of storage capacity,
    geographical replication, a scalable architecture and
    proprietary mapping and routing technology to ensure that
    content is consistently available.

•

Global Traffic Management

Our EdgeSuite service substantially reduces the
    amount of Internet infrastructure required to maintain a global
    Internet presence by providing geographically distributed IP
    infrastructures that reduce reliance on an origin site for
    presentation and application processing and enable site owners
    to maintain a minimal source copy of the website. Enterprises
    with geographically distributed IP infrastructures can use
    EdgeSuite Global Traffic Management to improve the availability,
    responsiveness and reliability of a multi-location website. When
    we need to access a customer’s origin site that has been
    mirrored elsewhere, we rely on our Global Traffic Management
    feature to choose the optimal mirrored site. Global Traffic
    Management frees enterprises from managing complex hardware and
    allows them to concentrate on their core business. Global
    Traffic Management reduces the need for enterprises to purchase,
    maintain or house hardware that can rapidly become obsolete and
    provides continuous monitoring and support from our Network
    Operations Command Center, which we call the NOCC.

•

Content Targeting

Content Targeting allows our customers to
    customize content by accurately identifying the visiting
    user’s geographic location, connection speed, device type
    or other specified information so that content can be targeted
    for each visitor in real time and at the network’s edge.
    Content Targeting enables



content providers to deliver localized content,
    customized store-fronts, targeted advertising, adaptive
    marketing and a rich user experience.

•

Digitized Downloads

Digitized downloads consist of software
    applications and documents that may be downloaded onto the
    computers of permitted recipients. Our EdgeSuite service
    provides a solution for digital file distribution that offers
    our customers the ability to leverage the Internet as a
    distribution channel, resulting in expanded customer reach,
    significant cost efficiencies and time-to-market advantage. The
    unique, globally distributed network architecture on which the
    Akamai platform is based enhances the security and reliability
    of downloads while reducing infrastructure and bandwidth
    requirements at the origin site.

•

Business Intelligence

EdgeSuite Business Intelligence applications and
    services provide detailed real-time and historical information
    on site visitors, their behavior and the effectiveness of a
    website’s content. It also provides IP infrastructure
    information with details on website performance, site
    visitors’ access points, traffic patterns and automated
    delivery of logs containing information about website traffic
    and usage in industry-standard formats. Companies use Business
    Intelligence’s comprehensive tools to evaluate their
    strategic investments in website functionality.

•

Streaming Services

Our streaming services provide for the delivery
    of streaming audio and video content to Internet users. We offer
    streaming services in all major formats. We principally focus on
    enterprise streaming applications such as video broadcasting of
    large events over IP networks, and video archives of corporate
    events or public news events. We believe that we have
    demonstrated superior streaming network performance and quality,
    particularly for broadband users.

•

Edge Assembly

Edge Side Includes (ESI) accelerates dynamic
    web-based applications by identifying cacheable and
    non-cacheable website page components that can be aggregated,
    assembled and delivered at the network edge. EdgeSuite Dynamic
    Content Assembly gives enterprises the ability to deliver rich,
    dynamically-rendered pages delivered without any performance
    penalty. EdgeSuite Dynamic Content Assembly allows companies to
    assemble and customize website pages at an optimal location
    within the Akamai’s global network of servers. Customized
    content is delivered quickly and reliably to each user without
    forcing interaction with a centralized application server.

•

Edge Computing

Edge computing allows enterprises to extend more
    of their applications into the network, closer to end users,
    including customers, partners, suppliers, and employees. By
    adding application server capabilities and support for
    application and development frameworks, such as Java (J2EE) and
    Microsoft .NET, Akamai is striving to become a pervasive,
    distributed, and standards-based high performance deployment
    platform for enterprise applications, Internet-based services
    and website content of all kinds. For example, we will be
    launching EdgeComputing for Java, a new service for distributed
    application delivery. Additionally, as part of a broader
    technology partnership with IBM, we will be integrating
    IBM’s WebSphere application server with the Akamai platform.

Business Segments and Geographic
Information

We operate in one business segment: providing
e-business infrastructure services and software. For the year
ended December 31, 2002, approximately 13% of revenue was
derived from our operations outside the United States. For all
other periods, less than 10% of revenue was derived from sources
outside of the United States. For more information on our
segments and geographic areas, see Note 20 to our
consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this
annual report on Form 10-K.



The Akamai Platform

The Akamai platform is the collection of
Akamai’s core technologies and global network footprint.
Comprising intelligent core technologies such as advanced
routing, load balancing, data collection and monitoring, the
Akamai platform is designed to ensure the highest levels of
availability, reliability and performance of information flow
between our customers and the Internet.

Our platform consists of a global network of over
13,000 computer servers and the complex proprietary
software that resides on them. Our servers are deployed in over
1,100 networks including Tier 1 providers, medium and
small ISPs, cable modem and satellite providers, universities
and other networks. We also deploy our servers at smaller and
medium-sized domestic and international ISPs through our Akamai
Accelerated Network Program. Under this program, we offer use of
our servers to ISPs. In exchange, we typically do not pay for
rack space to house our servers or bandwidth to deliver content
from our servers to Internet users. By hosting our servers, ISPs
obtain access to popular content from the Internet that is
served from our platform. As a result, when this content is
requested by a user, the ISP does not need to pay for the
bandwidth otherwise necessary to retrieve the content from the
originating website.

We monitor our platform through the NOCC, located
at our corporate headquarters, with a back-up facility on the
West Coast. Expert network operations personnel staff the NOCC
24 hour per day, seven days a week. We perform real-time
monitoring of our own servers and of the Internet to make
certain that content is delivered to users with the best
possible performance and reliability. A key design principle of
our system is the use of a distributed network of servers with
no single point of failure. As a result, if any computer, data
center or portion of the Internet fails, our services will
continue operating. We constantly monitor the performance of
connections between various locations around the Internet and
our regions using numerous types of network information to
determine the performance of these connections. The result is a
“map” of the optimal Akamai region for each location
at that point in time. We rebuild this map periodically to
reflect changing conditions.

Our technology is designed so that our servers
maintain redundancy with other servers in our network to ensure
the highest level of performance and reliability for our
customers. This is increasingly important for reliably
delivering the mission-critical content and applications of an
enterprise over IP networks that, on their own, are often
unreliable.

Customers

Our customer base is centered on enterprises. As
of December 31, 2002, customers who have adopted our
services include many of the world’s leading enterprises,
including American Suzuki Motor Corporation, Apple
Computer, Inc., Barnes & Noble, Best
Buy.com, Inc., Canon Japan, FedEx Corporation, General
Motors Corporation, L.L. Bean, Inc., Microsoft
Corporation, Molex Incorporated, NASDAQ, Sony Music
Entertainment Japan, Staples, Inc., VeriSign, Inc. and
VERITAS Software Corporation. We have also begun to address the
needs of the government market and, as of December 31,
2002, had customers such as the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, the U.S. Geological Survey’s Earthquake
Hazards Program and the U.S. Government Printing Office.
For the year ended December 31, 2000, Apple Computer
represented 12% of total revenue. No customer accounted for 10%
or more of total revenue for the years ended December 31,
2001 or December 31, 2002.

Sales, Service and Marketing

Our sales and service professionals are located
in eleven offices in the United States with additional locations
in Europe and Japan. We market and sell our services and
software domestically and internationally through our direct
sales and services organization and through more than 20 active
resellers including Digex, Inc., Electronic Data Systems
Corporation, or EDS, International Business Machines
Corporation, or IBM, InterNap Network Services Corporation,
Telefonica Group and others. Our sales and support organization
includes employees in direct and channel sales, professional
services, account management and technical consulting. As of
December 31, 2002, we had approximately 167 employees
in our sales and support organization, including 62 direct
sales representatives whose performance is measured on the basis
of



achievement of quota objectives. Our ability to
achieve significant revenue growth in the future will depend in
large part on how successfully we recruit, train and retain
sufficient direct sales, technical and global services
personnel, and how well we establish and maintain relationships
with our strategic partners. We believe that the complexity of
our services will require a number of highly trained global
sales and services personnel.

To support our sales efforts and promote the
Akamai name, we conduct comprehensive marketing programs. Our
marketing strategies include an active public relations
campaign, print advertisements, online advertisements, trade
shows, strategic partnerships and on-going customer
communication programs. As of December 31, 2002, we had 29
employees in our global marketing organization.

Research and Development

Our research and development organization is
continuously enhancing and improving our existing services,
strengthening our network and creating new services in response
to our customers’ needs and market demand, as described in
“Our Solutions” and “The Akamai Platform”
above. As of December 31, 2002, we had approximately 152
employees in our research and development organization, many of
whom hold advanced degrees in their field. Our research and
development expenses were $21.8 million, $44.8 million
and $38.2 million for the years ended December 31,
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Competition

The market for our services remains relatively
new, intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing
technology, evolving industry standards and frequent new product
and service installations. We expect competition for our
services to increase both from existing competitors and new
market entrants. We compete primarily on the basis of:

We compete primarily with companies offering
products and services that address Internet performance
problems, including companies that provide Internet content
delivery and hosting services, streaming content delivery
services and equipment-based solutions to Internet performance
problems, such as load balancers and server switches. Some of
these companies resell our services. We also compete with
companies that host online conferences using proprietary
conferencing applications. We do not believe that any other
company currently offers the range of solutions that we offer
through our EdgeSuite service.

Proprietary Rights and Licensing

Our success and ability to compete are dependent
on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects
of our technology and operate without infringing on the
proprietary rights of others. We rely on a combination of
patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright laws and
contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of
our technology. We currently have numerous issued United States
patents covering our content delivery technology, and we have
numerous additional patent applications pending. In October
1998, we entered into a license agreement with the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, or MIT, under which we were granted a
royalty-free, worldwide right to use and sublicense the
intellectual property rights of MIT under various patent
applications and copyrights relating to Internet content
delivery technology. Two of these patent applications have now
issued. We seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual property
by requiring employees and consultants with access to our
proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements
with us and by restricting access to our source code.



To enforce our intellectual property rights, we
have filed a number of lawsuits against certain of our
competitors. Additional litigation may be necessary in the
future to protect our rights. In addition, we aggressively
defend our technology and business against claims of
infringement or invalidity brought by others. For a further
discussion of this litigation, see Note 10 to our
consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this
annual report on Form 10-K. There can be no assurance that
our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate
or that our competitors will not independently develop similar
technology. Any failure by us to meaningfully protect our
property could have a material adverse effect on our business,
operating results and financial condition. See “Factors
Affecting Future Operating Results.”

Employees

As of December 31, 2002, we had a total of
567 full-time and part-time employees. Our future success
will depend in part on our ability to attract, retain and
motivate highly qualified technical and management personnel for
whom competition is intense. Our employees are not represented
by any collective bargaining unit. We believe our relations with
our employees are good.

Factors Affecting Future Operating
Results

The following important factors, among other
things, could cause our actual operating results to differ
materially from those indicated or suggested by forward-looking
statements made in this annual report on Form 10-K or
presented elsewhere by management from time to time.

Failure to increase our revenue and keep
    our expenses consistent with revenues could prevent us from
    achieving and maintaining profitability or cause us to miss debt
    payments.

We have never been profitable. We have incurred
significant losses since inception and expect to continue to
incur losses in the future. We have large fixed expenses, and we
expect to continue to incur significant bandwidth, sales and
marketing, product development, administrative, interest and
other expenses. Therefore, we will need to generate
significantly higher revenue to achieve and maintain
profitability. There are numerous factors that could impede our
ability to increase revenue and moderate expenses, including:

Our failure to significantly increase our revenue
would seriously harm our business and operating results and
could cause us to fail to make interest or principal payments on
our outstanding indebtedness.

We have significant long-term debt, and we
    may not be able to make interest or principal payments when
    due.

As of December 31, 2002, our total long-term
debt was approximately $301.0 million and our
stockholders’ deficit was $168.1 million. Our
5 1/2% convertible subordinated notes due 2007, which
we refer to as our 5 1/2% notes, do not restrict our
ability or our subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional
indebtedness,



including debt that ranks senior to the
5 1/2% notes. Our ability to satisfy our obligations
will depend upon our future performance, which is subject to
many factors, including factors beyond our control. The
conversion price for the 5 1/2% notes is
$115.47 per share. The current market price for shares of
our common stock is significantly below the conversion price of
our convertible subordinated notes. If the market price for our
common stock does not exceed the conversion price, the holders
of the notes are unlikely to convert their securities into
common stock.

Historically, we have had negative cash flow from
operations. For the year ended December 31, 2002, net cash
used in operating activities was approximately
$65.8 million. Annual interest payments on our debentures,
assuming no securities are converted or redeemed, is
approximately $16.5 million. Unless we are able to generate
sufficient operating cash flow to service the notes, we will be
required to raise additional funds or default on our obligations
under the debentures and notes.

If we are required to seek additional
    funding, such funding may not be available on acceptable terms
    or at all.

If our revenue grows more slowly than we
anticipate or if our operating expenses increase more than we
expect or cannot be reduced in the event of lower revenue, we
may need to obtain funding from outside sources. If we are
unable to obtain this funding, our business would be materially
and adversely affected. In addition, even if we were to find
outside funding sources, we might be required to issue
securities with greater rights than the securities we have
outstanding today. We might also be required to take other
actions that could lessen the value of our common stock,
including borrowing money on terms that are not favorable to us.

The markets in which we operate are highly
    competitive and we may be unable to compete successfully against
    new entrants and established companies with greater
    resources.

We compete in markets that are new, intensely
competitive, highly fragmented and rapidly changing. We have
experienced and expect to continue to experience increased
competition. Many of our current competitors, as well as a
number of our potential competitors, have longer operating
histories, greater name recognition, broader customer
relationships and industry alliances and substantially greater
financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. Our
competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to
new or emerging technologies and changes in customer
requirements. Some of our current or potential competitors may
bundle their services with other services, software or hardware
in a manner that may discourage website owners from purchasing
any service we offer or ISPs from installing our servers.
Increased competition could result in price and revenue
reductions, loss of customers and loss of market share, which
could materially and adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

If the prices we charge for our services
    decline over time, our business and financial results are likely
    to suffer.

We expect that the prices we charge for our
services may decline over time as a result of, among other
things, existing and new competition in the markets we address.
Consequently, our historical revenue rates may not be indicative
of future revenue based on comparable traffic volumes. If we are
unable to sell our services at acceptable prices relative to our
costs, our revenue and gross margins will decrease, and our
business and financial results will suffer.

Any unplanned interruption in our network
    or services could lead to significant costs and disruptions that
    could reduce our revenue and harm our business, financial
    results and reputation.

Our business is dependent on providing our
customers with fast, efficient and reliable Internet
distribution application and content delivery services. For our
core services, we currently provide a guarantee that our
networks will deliver Internet content 24 hours a day,
seven days a week, 365 days a year. If we do not meet this
standard, our customer does not pay for all or a part of its
services on that day. Our network or services could be disrupted
by numerous things, including, among other things, natural
disasters, failure or refusal of our third party network
providers to provide the capacity, power losses, and intentional
disruptions of our



services, such as disruptions caused by software
viruses or attacks by hackers. Any widespread loss or
interruption of our network or services would reduce our revenue
and could harm our business, financial results and reputation.

We may have insufficient transmission
    capacity which could result in interruptions in our services and
    loss of revenues.

Our operations are dependent in part upon
transmission capacity provided by third-party telecommunications
network providers. We believe that we have access to adequate
capacity to provide our services; however, there can be no
assurance that we are adequately prepared for unexpected
increases in bandwidth demands by our customers. In addition,
the bandwidth we have contracted to purchase may become
unavailable for a variety of reasons. For example, a number of
these network providers have recently filed for protection under
the federal bankruptcy laws. As a result, there is uncertainty
about whether such providers or others that enter into
bankruptcy will be able to continue to provide services to us.
Any failure of these network providers to provide the capacity
we require, due to financial or other reasons, may result in a
reduction in, or interruption of, service to our customers. If
we do not have access to third-party transmission capacity, we
could lose customers. If we are unable to obtain transmission
capacity on terms commercially acceptable to us, our business
and financial results could suffer. In addition, our
telecommunications and network providers typically provide rack
space for our servers. Damage or destruction of, or other denial
of access to, a facility where our servers are housed could
result in a reduction in, or interruption of, service to our
customers.

Because our services are complex and are
    deployed in complex environments, they may have errors or
    defects that could seriously harm our business.

Our services are highly complex and are designed
to be deployed in and across numerous large and complex
networks. From time to time, we have needed to correct errors
and defects in our software. In the future, there may be
additional errors and defects in our software that may adversely
affect our services. If we are unable to efficiently fix errors
or other problems that may be identified, we could experience
loss of revenues and market share, damage to our reputation,
increased expenses and legal actions by our customers.

If the estimates we make, and the
    assumptions on which we rely, in preparing our financial
    statements prove inaccurate, our actual results may vary from
    these reflected in our projections and accruals.

Our financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. The preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses, the amounts of charges accrued by us, such as
those made in connection with our restructurings, and related
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our
estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the
circumstances. There can be no assurance, however, that our
estimates, or the assumptions underlying them, will be correct.
As a result, our actual results could vary from those reflected
in our projections and accruals, which could adversely affect
our stock price.

Our business involves numerous risks and
    uncertainties that affect the trading price of our common stock,
    which could result in litigation against us.

The price of our common stock has been and likely
will continue to be subject to substantial fluctuations. The
following factors may contribute to the instability of our stock
price:



Class action litigation is often brought against
companies following periods of volatility in the market price of
their common stock. If such litigation were brought against us,
it could be expensive and divert our management’s attention
and resources that could materially adversely affect our
business and results of operations.

If our license agreement with MIT
    terminates, our business could be adversely
    affected.

We have licensed from MIT technology covered by
various patent applications and copyrights relating to Internet
content delivery technology. Some of our technology is based in
part on the technology covered by these patent applications and
copyrights. Our license is effective for the life of the patent
and patent applications; however, under limited circumstances,
such as a cessation of our operations due to our insolvency or
our material breach of the terms of the license agreement, MIT
has the right to terminate our license. A termination of our
license agreement with MIT could have a material adverse effect
on our business.

We could incur substantial costs defending
    our intellectual property from infringement or a claim of
    infringement.

Other companies or individuals, including our
competitors, may obtain patents or other proprietary rights that
would prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use
or sell our services. As a result, we may be found to infringe
the proprietary rights of others. In the event of a successful
claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to
license the infringed technology, our business and operating
results would be significantly harmed. Companies in the Internet
market are increasingly bringing suits alleging infringement of
their proprietary rights, particularly patent rights. We have
been named as a defendant in several lawsuits alleging that we
have violated other companies’ intellectual property
rights. Any litigation or claims, whether or not valid, could
result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and
require us to do one or more of the following:

•

cease selling, incorporating or using products or
    services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;

•

obtain a license from the holder of the infringed
    intellectual property right, which license may not be available
    on reasonable terms or at all; and

•

redesign products or services.

If we are forced to take any of these actions,
our business may be seriously harmed.

Our business will be adversely affected if
    we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from
    third-party challenges.

We rely on a combination of patent, copyright,
trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure
to protect our intellectual property rights. These legal
protections afford only limited protection. Monitoring
unauthorized use of our services is difficult and we cannot be
certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized
use of our technology, particularly in foreign countries where
the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in
the United States. Although we have licensed and proprietary
technology covered by patents, we cannot be certain that any
such patents will not be challenged, invalidated or
circumvented. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that any pending
or future patent applications will be granted, that any future
patent will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or
that rights granted under any patent that may be issued will
provide competitive advantages to us.



If we are unable to retain our key
    employees and hire qualified sales and technical personnel, our
    ability to compete could be harmed.

Our future success depends upon the continued
services of our executive officers and other key technology,
sales, marketing and support personnel who have critical
industry experience and relationships that they rely on in
implementing our business plan. None of our officers or key
employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific
term. We have a “key person” life insurance policy
covering only the life of F. Thomson Leighton. The loss of the
services of any of our key employees could delay the development
and introduction of and negatively impact our ability to sell
our services.

We face risks associated with international
    operations that could harm our business.

We have expanded our international operations to
Japan, Germany, England and France. In addition, we are part of
a joint venture in Australia. We expect to continue to expand
our sales and support organizations internationally. Therefore,
we expect to commit significant resources to expand our
international sales and marketing activities. We are
increasingly subject to a number of risks associated with
international business activities that may increase our costs,
lengthen our sales cycle and require significant management
attention. These risks include:

As part of our business strategy, we have
    entered into and may enter into or seek to enter into business
    combinations and acquisitions that may be difficult to
    integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value or
    divert management attention.

We have made acquisitions of other companies in
the past and may enter into additional business combinations and
acquisitions in the future. Acquisitions are typically
accompanied by a number of risks, including the difficulty of
integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired
companies, the potential disruption of our ongoing business, the
potential distraction of management, expenses related to the
acquisition and potential unknown liabilities associated with
acquired businesses. If we are not successful in completing
acquisitions that we may pursue in the future, we may be
required to reevaluate our business strategy, and we may have
incurred substantial expenses and devoted significant management
time and resources without a productive result. In addition,
with future acquisitions, we could use substantial portions of
our available cash or make dilutive issuances of securities.
Future acquisitions or attempted acquisitions could have an
adverse effect on our ability to become profitable.

Internet-related laws could adversely
    affect our business.

Laws and regulations that apply to communications
and commerce over the Internet are becoming more prevalent. In
particular, the growth and development of the market for online
commerce has prompted calls for more stringent tax, consumer
protection and privacy laws, both in the United States and
abroad, that may impose additional burdens on companies
conducting business online. This could negatively affect the
businesses of our customers and reduce their demand for our
services. We could also be negatively affected by tax laws that
might apply to our servers which are located in many different
jurisdictions. Internet-related laws, however, remain largely
unsettled, even in areas where there has been some legislative
action. The



adoption or modification of laws or regulations
relating to the Internet or our operations, or interpretations
of existing law, could adversely affect our business.

Terrorist activities and resulting military
    and other actions could adversely affect our
    business.

Terrorist attacks in New York, Pennsylvania and
Washington, D.C. in September 2001 disrupted commerce
throughout the United States and other parts of the world. The
continued threat of terrorism within the United States and
abroad, and the potential for military action and heightened
security measures in response to such threat, may cause
significant disruption to commerce throughout the world. To the
extent that such disruptions result in delays or cancellations
of customer orders, a general decrease in corporate spending on
information technology, or our inability to effectively market,
sell or operate our services and software, our business and
results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Provisions of our charter documents, our
    stockholder rights plan and Delaware law may have anti-takeover
    effects that could prevent a change in control even if the
    change in control would be beneficial to our
    stockholders.

Provisions of our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation, by-laws and Delaware law could
make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if
doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. In addition,
in September 2002, our Board of Directors adopted a shareholder
rights plans the provisions of which could make it more
difficult for a potential acquirer of Akamai to consummate an
acquisition transaction.

A class action lawsuit has been filed
    against us that may be costly to defend and the outcome of which
    is uncertain and may harm our business.

We are named as a defendant in a purported class
action lawsuit filed in 2001 alleging that the underwriters of
our initial public offering received undisclosed compensation in
connection with our IPO in violation of the Securities Act of
1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This litigation
could be expensive and divert the attention of our management
and other resources. We can provide no assurance as to the
outcome of this action. Any conclusion of these matters in a
manner adverse to us could have a material adverse affect on our
financial position and results of operations.

We may become involved in other litigation
    that may adversely affect us.

In the ordinary course of business, we may become
involved in litigation, administrative proceedings and
governmental proceedings. Such matters can be time-consuming,
divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to
incur significant expenses. Furthermore, there can be no
assurance that the results of any of these actions will not have
a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
or financial condition.

Item 2.

Properties

Our headquarters are located in approximately
89,000 square feet of leased office space in Cambridge,
Massachusetts. Our primary west coast office is located in
approximately 47,000 square feet of leased office space in
San Mateo, California. We are attempting to sublease a
substantial portion of our San Mateo facility. We maintain
offices in several other locations in the United States,
including in or near each of Los Angeles, California; Atlanta,
Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; New York, New York; Fairfax,
Virginia and Seattle, Washington. We also maintain offices in
Europe and Asia including in or near Munich, Germany; Paris,
France; London, England; and Tokyo, Japan. All of our facilities
are leased.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

We are subject to legal proceedings, claims and
litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. We do not
expect the ultimate costs to resolve these matters to have a
material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.



Between July 2, 2001 and August 31,
2001, purported class action lawsuits seeking monetary damages
were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York against us and several of our officers and
directors as well as against the underwriters of our
October 28, 1999 initial public offering of common stock.
The complaints were filed allegedly on behalf of persons who
purchased our common stock during different time periods, all
beginning on October 28, 1999 and ending on various dates.
The complaints are similar and allege violations of the
Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
primarily based on the allegation that the underwriters received
undisclosed compensation in connection with our initial public
offering. On April 19, 2002, a single consolidated amended
complaint was filed, reiterating in one pleading the allegations
contained in the previously filed separate actions. The
consolidated amended complaint defines the alleged class period
as October 28, 1999 through December 6, 2000. On
July 15, 2002, we joined in an omnibus motion to dismiss
filed by all issuer defendants named in similar actions which
challenges the legal sufficiency of the plaintiffs’ claims,
including those in the consolidated amended complaint.
Plaintiffs opposed the motion, and the Court heard oral
arguments on the motion in November 2002. On February 19,
2003, the Court ruled against us on this motion, and the case
may now proceed to discovery. In addition, in October 2002, the
plaintiffs dismissed without prejudice all of the individual
defendants from the consolidated complaint. Although we believe
that we have meritorious defenses to the claims made in the
complaint, an adverse resolution of the action could have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
of operations in the period in which the lawsuit is resolved. We
are not presently able to estimate potential losses, if any,
related to this lawsuit.

In June 2002, we filed suit against Speedera
Networks, Inc., or Speedera, in California Superior Court
alleging theft of Akamai trade secrets from an independent
company that provides website performance testing services. In
connection with this suit, in September 2002, the Court issued a
preliminary injunction to restrain Speedera from continuing to
access our confidential information from the independent
company’s database and from using any data obtained from
such access. In October 2002, Speedera filed a cross-claim
against us seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief and
alleging that we engaged in various unfair trade practices, made
false and misleading statements and engaged in unfair
competition. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the
claims made in Speedera’s cross-claim and intend to contest
the allegations vigorously; however, there can be no assurance
that we will be successful. We are not presently able to
reasonably estimate potential losses, if any, related to this
cross-claim.

In July 2002, Cable and Wireless Internet
Services, or C&W, formerly known as Digital Island, filed
suit against us in the United States District Court for the
District of Massachusetts alleging that certain Akamai services
infringe a C&W patent issued in that month. C&W is
seeking a preliminary injunction restraining us from offering
services that infringe such patent. Subsequently, in August
2002, C&W filed a suit against us in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of California alleging
that certain Akamai services infringe a second C&W patent.
We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims made
in the complaints and intend to contest the lawsuits vigorously;
however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful.
We are not presently able to reasonably estimate potential
losses, if any, related to these lawsuits.

In September 2002, Teknowledge Corporation, or
Teknowledge, filed suit in the United States District Court for
the District of Delaware against Akamai, C&W and Inktomi
Corporation alleging that certain services offered by each
company infringe a Teknowledge patent relating to automatic
retrieval of changed files by a network software agent. We
believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims made in
the complaint and intend to contest the lawsuit vigorously;
however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful.
We are not presently able to reasonably estimate potential
losses, if any, related to this lawsuit.

In November 2002, we filed suit against Speedera
in federal court in Massachusetts for infringement of a patent
held by Akamai. In January 2003, Speedera filed a counterclaim
in this case alleging that Akamai has infringed a patent that
was recently issued to Speedera. We believe that we have
meritorious defenses to the claims made in the counterclaim and
intend to contest them vigorously; however, there can be no
assurance that we will be successful. We are not presently able
to reasonably estimate potential losses, if any, related to this
counterclaim.

Market For Registrant’s Common Equity
    and Related Stockholder Matters

Our common stock trades under the symbol
“AKAM.” Our common stock has been listed on The NASDAQ
SmallCap Market since September 3, 2002. From the time that
public trading of our common stock commenced on October 29,
1999 until September 3, 2002, our common stock was listed
on The NASDAQ National Market. Prior to October 29, 1999,
there was no public market for our common stock. The following
table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low
sale price per share of the common stock on The NASDAQ National
Market and The NASDAQ SmallCap Market, as applicable:

As of March 24, 2003, there were
582 holders of record of our common stock.

We have never paid or declared any cash dividends
on shares of our common stock or other securities and do not
anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
We currently intend to retain all future earnings, if any, for
use in the operation of our business.

Item 6.

Selected Financial Data

The following selected consolidated financial
data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated
financial statements and related notes and with
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” and other financial
data included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.
The statement of operations data and balance sheet data for all
periods presented is derived from audited consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this annual report on
Form 10-K or on file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. We acquired several businesses in 2000 that were
recorded under the purchase method of accounting. We allocated
$3 billion of the cost of these acquisitions to goodwill
and other intangible assets. As a result, loss from operations
for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 includes
$256,000 and $676,000, respectively, for the amortization of
goodwill and other intangible assets related to these
acquisitions. In 2001, loss from operations includes a
$1.9 billion impairment of goodwill. On January 1,
2002, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets,” we discontinued the amortization of goodwill. Loss
from continuing operations for the years ended December 31,
2002 and 2001 includes restructuring charges of
$45.8 million and $40.5 mil-



lion, respectively, for actual and estimated
termination and modification costs related to non-cancelable
facility leases and employee severance.



Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

The following sets forth, as a percentage of
revenue, consolidated statements of operations data for the
years indicated:

Since our inception, we have incurred significant
costs to develop our technology, build our worldwide network,
sell and market our services and software and support our
operations. We have also incurred significant amortization
expense and impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets
from the acquisition of businesses. In recent years, we have
incurred significant restructuring expenses related to employee
severance payments and vacated facilities under long-term
leases. Since our inception, we have incurred significant losses
and negative cash flows from operations. We have not achieved
profitability on a quarterly or annual basis, and we anticipate
that we will continue to incur net losses over at least the next
12 to 18 months. As of December 31, 2002, we had
$300 million of convertible notes outstanding, which become
due in 2007. We ended the year with cash and marketable
securities of $125.2 million, of which $13.4 million
is subject to restrictions limiting our ability to withdraw or
otherwise use such cash.

We believe that our success is dependent on
increasing our net monthly recurring revenue, developing new
services and software that leverage our proprietary technology
and achieving and maintaining a proper alignment between our
revenue and our cost structure. We consider net additions to
monthly recurring revenue to be a critical success factor for
our business. We define net monthly recurring revenue as new
bookings of recurring revenue less lost recurring revenue due to
customer cancellations, non-renewals or collections issues. A
typical recurring revenue contract has a term of one to two
years. As of December 31, 2002, our net monthly recurring
revenue under contract was greater than such amount at
December 31, 2001. We continue to sell our services and
software into a depressed information technology market. We are
also experiencing competitive pricing pressures on our service
offerings. Due to these and other factors, our ability to
predict our future revenue results is limited, and there is no
guarantee that net monthly recurring revenue under contract will
continue to increase.



Our ability to maintain gross margins that fall
within our target range is also critical to our success.
Accordingly, we are continuously managing our network costs by
entering into competitively priced bandwidth and colocation
contracts that are aligned with our revenue forecasts and our
estimates as to the amount of traffic we expect to carry over
our network. As a result, we have been successful in maintaining
our gross margins despite pricing pressure on our service
offerings.

We have taken steps to align our recurring
operating expenses with our revenue and gross margins. Our
recurring operating expenses include research and development,
sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses.
These expenses were $184.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2002 compared to $259.6 million for the
year ended December 31, 2001 and $239.7 million for
the year ended December 31, 2000. During the year ended
December 31, 2002, we undertook actions to reduce our
overall cost structure, including employee severances, while
maintaining a high level of employee productivity and customer
service. As a result, we expect the downward trend in these
operating expenses to continue.

Our operating expenses also include restructuring
charges. We incurred restructuring charges of $45.8 million
and $40.5 million during the years ended December 31,
2002 and 2001, respectively. These expenses relate to actual and
estimated termination and modification costs on leases for
excess facilities and employee severance costs. We may incur
restructuring charges in the future depending on several
factors, including the timing and amount of any lease
modifications and terminations, the timing and amount of any
sublease receipts, and any future employee severances. We expect
that, if successful, our efforts to terminate and modify our
excess facility leases will require a significant amount of cash
in the future.

Recent Events

In October 2002, we reduced our workforce by 29%,
or approximately 200 employees, across all functional areas.
Accordingly, we recorded a restructuring charge in the fourth
quarter of 2002 of $3.6 million for one-time benefit
payments to affected employees. As a result of these actions, we
expect operating costs to decline in 2003 from previous levels.

In November 2002, Robert Cobuzzi became our Chief
Financial Officer following the resignation of our former Chief
Financial Officer, Timothy Weller.

In November 2002, we settled a stock price
appreciation guarantee to CNN News Group, or CNN, by making a
$2.7 million cash payment to CNN and allowing CNN to draw
on a $3.8 million letter of credit previously issued by us.
We acquired the obligation as part of our acquision of InterVu,
Inc. in April 2000. The settlement was accounted for as an
adjustment to the fair value of the common stock for the amount
of additional cash issued. Consequently, the total purchase
price was not adjusted.

In December 2002, we sold our 40% joint venture
interest in Akamai Technologies Japan KK to Softbank Broadmedia
Corporation, or SBBM. Prior to the sale, SBBM had owned a 60%
interest in Akamai Technologies Japan KK. We expect that SBBM
will operate the entity as a non-exclusive reseller of our
services in Japan. As a result of the sale, we recorded a gain
of $400,000 in loss on investments, net in the consolidated
statement of operations for the year ended December 31,
2002. In January 2003, we formed a new wholly-owned subsidiary
in Japan through which we sell our services and support our
reseller arrangements. The results of operations, financial
position and cash flows of the new subsidiary will be
consolidated into our future quarterly and annual financial
statements.

In January 2003, we paid $2.5 million,
including interest, to a former employee of an acquired company
as a result of an April 2001 judgment against the acquired
company for breach of contract. We have included this amount in
accrued expenses as of December 31, 2002. In February 2003,
we settled an employment-related lawsuit with multiple claims
brought by a former employee for a cash payment of
$3.6 million. Our insurance carrier reimbursed us for
$1.8 million of such settlement expense. As of
December 31, 2002, to reflect this settlement, we have
included $3.6 million in accrued expenses and
$1.8 million in current assets, and we recorded the net
amount of $1.8 million in general and administrative
expenses.



Change in Presentation of Consolidated
Statement of Operations Expense Categories

In 2002, we modified the presentation of our
consolidated statements of operations. All prior period amounts
have been reclassified to conform with current year
presentation. These modifications had no impact on loss from
operations or net loss. We modified certain expense categories
as follows:

In addition, we simplified the presentation of
the consolidated statement of operations as follows:

•

We included equity-related compensation in cost
    of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing and
    general and administrative based on the functional role of the
    related employee.

•

We included the depreciation and amortization on
    our network equipment and internal-use software used to deliver
    our services in cost of revenue.

•

We included the depreciation and amortization of
    all other property and equipment in general and administrative.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies
and Estimates

Overview

Our discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations are based upon our
consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared by
us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. The preparation of these
consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates
and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. Our estimates include those
related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts,
investments, intangible assets, income taxes, depreciable lives
of property and equipment, restructuring accruals and contingent
obligations. We base our estimates on historical experience and
on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these
estimates. For a complete description of our accounting
policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial
statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Definitions

We define our “critical accounting
policies” as those accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America, and the specific manner that we
apply those principals, that require us to make critical
accounting estimates about matters that are uncertain and have a
material impact on our financial position and results of
operations. We define a “critical accounting estimate”
as an estimate that requires us to make assumptions about
matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting
estimate is made and either the estimate is derived from a range
of potential outcomes or changes in the estimate would have a
material impact on our financial condition or results of
operations.



Review of Critical Accounting Policies and
    Estimates

Revenue Recognition:

We recognize revenue from our services when:

At the inception of a customer contract, we make
a critical estimate as to whether collection is reasonably
assured. We base our estimate on the successful completion of a
credit check, financial review or the receipt of a deposit from
the customer. Upon the completion of these steps, we recognize
revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue recognition
policy, assuming the other criteria are met. If we subsequently
determine that collection is not reasonably assured, we cease
recognizing revenue until cash is received. We also record an
allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all
other unpaid invoices for the related customer. Changes in our
estimates of whether collection is reasonably assured would
change the amount of revenue or bad debt expense that we
recognize.

Concurrent Transactions:

From time to time, we enter into contracts to
sell our services or license our technology with an enterprise
at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase
products or services from the same enterprise. If we conclude
that these contracts were negotiated concurrently, we record as
revenue only the net cash received from the vendor, unless the
fair value to us of the vendor’s product or service can be
established objectively and realization of such value is assumed
probable.

Investments:

We periodically review all investments for
reduction in fair value that is other-than-temporary. We
consider several factors that may trigger an
other-than-temporary decline in value, such as the length of
time the investment’s value has been below cost and the
financial results of the entity in which we invest. When we
conclude that the reduction is other-than-temporary, the cost of
the investment is adjusted to its fair value through a charge to
loss on investments on the consolidated statement of operations.
Changes in our judgment as to whether a reduction in the value
of an investment is other-than-temporary would increase loss on
investments.

Impairment and Useful Lives of Long-Lived
    Assets:

We review our long-lived assets, such as fixed
assets and intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
the assets may not be recoverable. Events that would trigger an
impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or
forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset. When such a
triggering event occurs, we compare the carrying amount of the
long-lived asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows
related to the asset. If the carrying amount is greater than the
sum of the undiscounted cash flows, we adjust the asset to its
fair value through an impairment charge included in loss from
operations. We determine fair value based upon a quoted market
price or a discounted cash flow analysis. The critical
accounting estimates required for this accounting policy include
forecasted usage of the long-lived assets and the useful lives
of these assets. Changes in these estimates could increase loss
from operations materially.

Restructuring Liabilities Related to Facility
    Leases:

When we vacate a facility subject to a
non-cancelable long-term lease, we record a restructuring
liability for either the estimated costs to terminate the lease
or the estimated costs that will continue to be incurred



under the lease for its remaining term where
there is no economic benefit to us. In the latter case, we
measure the amount of the restructuring liability as the amount
of contractual future lease payments reduced by an estimate of
sublease income. To date, we have recorded a restructuring
liability when our management approves and commits us to a plan
to terminate a lease, the plan specifically identifies the
actions to be taken, and the actions are scheduled to begin soon
after management approves the plan. Beginning in 2003, in
accordance with a newly adopted accounting standard, we will
record a restructuring liability, discounted at the appropriate
rate, for a facility lease only when we have both vacated the
space and completed all actions needed to make the space readily
available for sublease.

When we record a restructuring liability, we make
critical estimates related to the amount of rent or termination
costs that we will pay and the amount of sublease income that we
will receive related to the vacant property. As of
December 31, 2002, we had $37.5 million in accrued
restructuring liabilities related to vacated facilities. Our
estimates are based, in part, on the most recent negotiations
with the landlords of these properties and current market
conditions. We expect that approximately $23.6 million of
the amount accrued as of December 31, 2002 will be paid
within twelve months. Should the actual amounts or the timing of
restructuring payments differ from our estimate, we would adjust
the restructuring liability through a charge or benefit to
restructuring charges on the consolidated statement of
operations. If we are not able to successfully modify these
leases, the total contractual payout for these properties would
be approximately $64.0 million over the next seven years.
If we are not successful in subleasing these facilities, the
total incremental restructuring charge would be approximately
$27.0 million.

Loss Contingencies:

We define a loss contingency as a condition
involving uncertainty as to a possible loss related to a
previous event that will not be resolved until one or more
future events occur or fail to occur. Our primary loss
contingencies relate to pending or threatened litigation and the
collectibility of accounts receivable. We record a liability for
a loss contingency when we believe that it is probable that a
loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be
reasonably estimated. When we believe the likelihood of a loss
is less than probable and more than remote, we do not record a
liability but we disclose material loss contingencies in the
notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Valuation Allowance for Deferred
    Taxes:

We provide a valuation allowance against our
deferred tax assets when, based on the weight of available
evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. A change in our
estimate of the future realization of deferred tax assets would
result in a material income tax benefit.

Capitalization of Internal-Use Software
    Costs:

We capitalize the salaries and payroll-related
costs of employees who devote time to the application
development stage of internal-use software projects. If the
project is an enhancement to previously developed software, we
must assess whether the enhancement is significant and creates
additional functionality to the software, thus qualifying the
work incurred during the application development stage for
capitalization. We must gather employee data for the amount of
time incurred during the application development phase. Once the
project is complete, we must estimate the useful life of the
internal-use software, and we must periodically assess whether
the software is impaired. Changes in our estimates related to
internal-use software would increase or decrease operating
expenses or amortization recorded in during the period.

Results of Operations

Revenue.

Total
revenue decreased 11%, or $18.2 million, to
$145.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as
compared to $163.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2001. Total revenue was $89.8 million for
the year ended December 31, 2000. For 2002 and 2001, no
single customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue. For
2000, one customer, Apple Computer, accounted for 12% of our
total revenue. For 2002, 13% of our revenue was derived from our
operations located outside of the United States. For 2001



and 2000, less than 10% of our total revenue was
derived from our operations located outside of the United States.

Service revenue decreased 5%, or
$6.7 million, to $128.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2002 as compared to $135.3 million for
the year ended December 31, 2001. Service revenue was
$81.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000.
The decrease in service revenue in 2002 as compared to 2001 was
attributable to a decrease in customers under recurring revenue
contracts, partially offset by an increase in average monthly
recurring revenue per customer. The increase in service revenue
in 2001 compared to 2000 was due to an increase in customers
under recurring revenue contracts. Although we have achieved
positive net monthly recurring revenue during 2002, we are not
able to reasonably predict future service revenue given the
uncertainty of competition, customer cancellations and the
current macroeconomic environment.

License and other revenue decreased 47%, or
$5.9 million, to $6.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2002 as compared to $12.4 million for the
year ended December 31, 2001. License and other revenue was
$5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000.
License and other revenue includes sales of customized
technology solutions sold as perpetual licenses or delivered
under long-term contracts. The decrease in license and other
revenue in 2002 as compared to 2001 was attributable to a
reduction in the amount of software and other technology
licensed to customers. In contrast, we increased our license and
other revenue in 2001 as compared to 2000, principally as a
result of the introduction of our EdgeScape license offering in
2001.

Service and license revenue from related parties
decreased 37%, or $5.6 million, to $9.8 million for
the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to
$15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001.
Service and license revenue from related parties was
$3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The
decrease in revenue from related parties between 2002 and 2001
was primarily attributable to the reduction in revenue from
Sockeye Networks, Inc., or Sockeye, as a result of a reduction
in 2001 of Sockeye’s minimum monthly revenue commitment and
the cancellation in November 2002 of Sockeye’s contract
with us. The increase in revenue from related parties between
2001 and 2000 was primarily due to an increase in revenue from
Sockeye compared to the prior year. As a result of
Sockeye’s cancellation of its service agreement and the
sale of our equity interest in Akamai Technologies Japan KK, we
do not expect significant revenues from related parties in the
future.

Cost of Revenue.

Cost of revenue includes fees paid to
network providers for bandwidth and monthly fees for housing our
servers in third-party network data centers. Cost of revenue
also includes network operation employee costs, cost of
licenses, depreciation on the network equipment used to deliver
our services and amortization of internal-use software costs.
During the year ended December 31, 2002, we capitalized
$174,000 of payroll costs for network operations personnel
related to the development of internal-use software used to
operate and monitor our network. No payroll costs were
capitalized in 2001 or 2000.

Cost of revenue decreased 21%, or
$23.0 million, to $85.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2002 compared to $108.3 million for the
year ended December 31, 2001. Cost of revenue was
$72.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000.
Cost of revenue decreased in 2002 as compared to 2001 primarily
as a result of a reduction in traffic delivered over our
network, lower bandwidth costs per unit and improved management
of our network traffic. Cost of revenue increased in 2001 as
compared to 2000 primarily as a result of an increase in
depreciation on network assets and an increase in the amount of
traffic delivered over our network.



Cost of revenue is comprised of the following (in
millions):

Research and Development.

Research and development expenses
consist primarily of salaries, equity-related compensation and
related expenses for the design, development, testing and
enhancement of our services and our network. Research and
development costs are expensed as incurred, except certain
software development costs eligible for capitalization. During
the year ended December 31, 2002, we capitalized
$6.0 million, net of impairments, of payroll and
payroll-related costs related to the development of internal-use
software used to deliver our services and operate our network.
No payroll costs were capitalized in 2001 or 2000.

Research and development expenses decreased 51%,
or $23.1 million, to $21.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2002 as compared to $44.8 million for the
year ended December 31, 2001. Research and development
expenses were $38.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2000. The decrease in expenses in 2002 as
compared to 2001 was primarily due to a decrease in salaries as
a result of reduced headcount and reduced equity-related
compensation due to employee terminations in the research and
development organization and an increase in capitalization of
internal use software development costs. The increase in
research and development in 2001 as compared to 2000 was
primarily due to an increase in payroll and payroll-related
costs as a result of increases in headcount and an increase in
equity-related compensation as a result of the issuance of
restricted stock at below market value. These effects are
quantified as follows (in millions):

Sales and Marketing.

Sales and marketing expenses consist
primarily of salaries, equity-related compensation, commissions
and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing, sales
and service support functions, as well as advertising and
promotional expenses. Sales and marketing expenses decreased
30%, or $28.1 million, to $64.8 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $92.9 million
for the year ended December 31, 2001. Sales and marketing
expenses were $110.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2000. The decrease in sales and marketing
expenses in 2002 as compared to 2001 was primarily due to a
reduction in payroll, payroll-related costs and equity
compensation attributable to a reduction in headcount. The
decrease in sales and marketing expenses for 2001 as compared to
2000 was primarily due to a reduction in advertising-related
expenditures, partially offset by an increase in payroll and
payroll-related costs



attributable to an increase in headcount and an
increase in equity compensation as a result of the issuance of
restricted stock at below market value. These effects are
quantified as follows (in millions):

General and Administrative.

General and administrative expenses
consist primarily of depreciation and impairment of network
equipment and property and equipment used by us internally,
salaries, equity-related compensation and related expenses for
executive, finance, information technology, or IT, human
resources and other administrative personnel, fees for
professional services, telecommunications costs, the provision
for doubtful accounts, rent and other facility-related
expenditures for leased properties. During the year ended
December 31, 2002, we capitalized $732,000 of payroll costs
for IT personnel related to the development of internal-use
software. No payroll costs were capitalized in 2001 or 2000.

General and administrative expenses decreased
20%, or $24.0 million, to $97.9 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $121.9 million
for the year ended December 31, 2001. General and
administrative expenses were $90.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 2000. The decrease in general and
administrative expenses in 2002 as compared to 2001 was
primarily due to a decrease in the provision for doubtful
accounts, reduced payroll-related costs as a result of
reductions in headcount and reduced rent expense as a result of
facility restructurings. The decrease in the provision for
doubtful accounts in 2002 compared to 2001 reflects an
improvement in the financial health of our customer base,
reflecting our strategy to target permanent enterprise
customers. The increase in general and administrative expenses
in 2001 as compared to 2000 was due to an increase in provision
for doubtful accounts, an increase in payroll and
payroll-related costs, an increase in facility costs, due to an
expansion of our operations, and an increase in depreciation.
Depreciation increased in 2001 as compared to 2000 as a result
of increased purchases of property and equipment by us in 2001.
These effects are quantified as follows (in millions):

Aggregate research and development, sales and
marketing and general and administrative expenses were
$184.5 million, $259.6 million and $239.7 million
for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. As a result of our actions undertaken in 2002 to
reduce our overall cost structure, including employee severances
and lease terminations, we expect aggregate research and
development, sales and marketing and general and administrative
costs to decrease in 2003 as compared to 2002.

Amortization of Other Intangible Assets.

Amortization of other intangible
assets decreased 35%, or $6.6 million, to
$11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as
compared to $18.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2001. Amortization of other intangible assets
was $12.6 million for the year ended December 31,
2000. The decrease in amortization of other intangible assets in
2002 as compared to 2001 was primarily due to the discontinuance
of assembled workforce amortization in 2002, partially offset by
an



impairment to intangible assets in 2002. The
increase in amortization of other intangible assets in 2001
compared to 2000 was attributable to the recognition of a full
year of amortization recorded in 2001 due to acquisitions of
businesses in 2000. We expect to amortize approximately
$2.3 million of intangible assets in 2003.

Amortization of Goodwill.

We no longer amortize goodwill as a
result of our adoption of SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets,” on January 1, 2002. In
accordance with SFAS No. 142, we reclassified
assembled workforce intangible assets of approximately
$1.0 million to goodwill. The resulting balance of goodwill
was $4.9 million on January 1, 2002. For purposes of
performing an impairment test, we determined that we had one
reporting unit and we assigned the entire balance of goodwill to
this reporting unit as of January 1, 2002 and 2003. The
fair value of the reporting unit was determined using our market
capitalization as of January 1, 2002 and 2003,
respectively. The fair value on January 1, 2002 and 2003
exceeded the net assets of the reporting unit, including
goodwill, as of both dates. Accordingly, we concluded that no
impairment existed on these dates. Unless changes in events or
circumstances indicate that an impairment test is required, we
will next test goodwill for impairment as of January 1,
2004. Amortization of goodwill was $237.3 million for the
year ended December 31, 2001 and $663.5 million for
the year ended December 31, 2000. Amortization expense
declined between 2001 and 2000 as a result of an impairment to
the balance of goodwill in March 2001

.

Restructuring Charges.

We recorded restructuring charges of
$45.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.
These charges included $3.6 million for employee severance
benefits and $42.2 million for restructuring charges
attributable to facility leases and long-lived asset
impairments. During the year ended December 31, 2001, we
recorded restructuring charges of $40.5 million. These
charges included $5.1 million for severance benefits and
$35.4 million for restructuring charges attributable to
facility leases and long-lived asset impairments. We did not
have restructuring charges in 2000. Our restructuring expenses
are summarized as follows (in millions):

For the year ended December 31, 2001,
management approved an exit plan for excess and vacant
facilities under long-term non-cancelable leases. We recorded a
restructuring charge of $34.1 million for the estimated
amount of future lease payments and termination fees, less
estimated sublease income, for these facilities. We also
impaired $1.3 million of leasehold improvements located at
these facilities. The impairment was recorded as a non-cash
restructuring charge.

During 2002, we terminated our facility leases
for 500 and 600 Technology Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
at an aggregate cost of $15.9 million, including brokerage
and legal fees. As of the termination date, the accrued
restructuring liability attributable to these leases was
$7.9 million. Accordingly, we recorded an additional
restructuring charge of $8.0 million for the difference
between the actual termination costs and the amount previously
accrued. Also during 2002, we recorded restructuring charges of
$29.7 million representing the difference between the
anticipated costs to terminate or modify vacant facilities under
non-cancelable lease agreements and the previously recorded
restructuring liabilities for these properties. In addition, we
impaired leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures,
deposits, deferred rent and other long-lived assets related to
these facilities in the amount of $4.5 million.



The following table summarizes the establishment
and usage of the restructuring liabilities related to real
estate leases (in millions):

The amount of restructuring liabilities
associated with real estate leases has been estimated based on
the most recent available market data and discussions with our
lessors and real estate advisors. In the event that these
facility leases are terminated at a higher or lower cost than
the amount accrued as of December 31, 2002, we will record
an adjustment to the restructuring liability in the period in
which the adjustment becomes probable and estimable. If we are
not able to successfully terminate or modify these leases, the
total payout for these properties would be approximately
$64.0 million over the next seven years, of which
$37.5 million is accrued as of December 31, 2002.

Impairment of Goodwill.

During the first quarter of 2001, we
reviewed goodwill and other long-lived assets for impairment
under the guidance of SFAS No. 121, “Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to be Disposed Of.” We considered several factors in
determining whether an impairment may have occurred, including
our market capitalization compared to book value, the overall
business climate and recent estimates for operating results of
acquired businesses. A review of these factors as of
March 31, 2001 indicated that an impairment assessment was
required for long-lived assets of acquired businesses. We
grouped all long-lived assets for acquired businesses, including
goodwill and other intangible assets, and estimated the future
discounted cash flows related to these long-lived assets. The
discount rate used was based on the risks associated with the
acquired businesses. As a result of this analysis, we recorded
an impairment charge of $1,912.8 million during the first
quarter of 2001 to adjust the carrying amount of goodwill to its
fair value as of March 31, 2001.

Acquired In-Process Research and Development.

Acquired in-process research and
development, which we refer to as IPR&D, consists of a
charge for the value of development projects of acquired
businesses in 2000 that had not reached technological
feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the date of
business acquisition. The value of IPR&D of
$1.4 million was determined based on each project’s
stage of development, the time and resources needed for
completion, the contribution of core technology and the
projected discounted cash flows of completed projects.

Interest Income.

Interest income includes interest
earned on invested cash balances and interest earned on notes
receivable for stock. Interest income decreased 75%, or
$9.2 million, to $3.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2002 as compared to $12.3 million for the
year ended December 31, 2001. Interest income was
$22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000.
The decrease in interest income for 2002 as compared with 2001
was a result of a decrease in our invested cash balance and a
decrease in the interest rates earned on our investments.
Likewise, the decrease in interest income for 2001 as compared
with 2000 was a result of a decrease in our invested cash
balance and a decrease in the interest rates earned on our
investments.

Interest Expense.

Interest expense includes interest
paid on our debt obligations. Interest expense was
$18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002
compared to $18.9 million for the year ended



December 31, 2001 and $8.9 million for
the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase in net
interest expense for each of 2002 and 2001 as compared with 2000
is a result of recognizing a full year of interest on our
$300 million debt obligation, which was incurred in June
2000.

Other Income.

We
received $1.0 million in proceeds on a key-person life
insurance policy as a result of the death in September 2001 of
Daniel M. Lewin, Akamai’s co-founder.

Loss on Investments.

Loss on investments for the year ended
December 31, 2002 was $6.1 million as compared to
$15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001.
Loss on investments in 2002 included a loss of $4.3 million
related to our investment in Netaxs, Inc., a related party,
which was realized as a result of a merger transaction between
Netaxs and FASTNET Corporation in April 2002. Loss on
investments includes a gain of $400,000 on our sale of our
equity interest in Akamai Technologies Japan KK to SBBM. In
addition, loss on investments in 2002 consists of a loss of
$2.4 million to adjust the cost basis of equity investments
to fair value and approximately $149,000 of realized investment
gains. For the year ended December 31, 2001, loss on
investments includes a loss of $10.2 million for the
adjustment to market value of equity investments for impairment
that was determined to be other-than-temporary, realized losses
of $2.8 million and a related party loss of
$2.0 million in an investment accounted for under the
equity method.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

To date, we have financed our operations
primarily through private sales of capital stock and the
issuance in April 1999 of senior subordinated notes, which we
repaid in 1999, totaling approximately $124.6 million in
net proceeds, an initial public offering of our common stock in
October 1999 that provided $217.6 million after
underwriters’ discounts and commissions, and the sale in
June 2000 of $300 million in 5 1/2% convertible
subordinated notes due July 2007, which generated net proceeds
of $290.2 million. We have also entered into capital lease
agreements to fund the acquisition of property and equipment. As
of December 31, 2002, cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities totaled $125.2 million, of which
$13.4 million is subject to restrictions limiting our
ability to withdraw or otherwise use such cash.

Cash used in operating activities decreased 45%,
or $53.5 million, to $65.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2002 compared to $119.3 million for the
year ended December 31, 2001. Cash used in operating
activities was $122.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2000. The decrease in cash used in operating
activities in the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared
to the prior year was primarily due to a 41% decrease in net
losses before non-cash expenses such as depreciation,
amortization, impairment charges, loss on investments and
equity-related compensation. Cash used in operating expense in
2001 as compared to 2000 was consistent. We expect that cash
used in operating activities will continue to decline in 2003 as
a result of actions we undertook in 2002 to reduce operating
costs; however, the timing and amount of any lease termination
payments and other working capital changes will affect the
actual amount of cash used in operating activities.

Cash provided by investing activities was
$96.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 and
$39.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001.
Cash used in investing activities was $316.1 million for
the year ended December 31, 2000. Cash provided by
investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002
reflects net purchases, sales and maturities of investments of
$116.5 million less capital expenditures of
$7.2 million, consisting primarily of leasehold
improvements for our new corporate office facility and internal
infrastructure purchases, and $6.9 million for the
capitalization of internal-use software development costs, net
of impaired projects. Cash provided by investing activities also
includes a payment of $6.5 million to CNN to settle an
obligation resulting from our acquisition of InterVu in April
2000. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements
for further discussion. Cash provided by and used in investing
activities in 2001 and 2000 includes $64.5 million and
$131.9 million used for the purchase of property and
equipment, respectively. We expect capital expenditures,
including internal costs for the development of internal-use
software, to be approximately 5% to 10% of revenue in 2003. We
may enter into capital lease arrangements or use our available
cash to fund these expenditures.

Cash provided by financing activities was
$1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002,
$8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 and
$320.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000.
Cash



provided by financing activities in 2002 reflects
proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans
of $2.8 million and payments on our capital lease
obligations of $1.6 million. Cash payments on capital lease
obligations increased in 2002 due to $3.3 million of new
capital leases. We expect to make payments, including interest,
of $1.3 million in 2003 and $1.1 million thereafter on
these lease obligations. Cash received from the issuance of
common stock under stock option and employee stock purchase
plans declined in the year ended December 31, 2002 as
compared to prior years as a result of fewer option exercises in
2002. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended
December 31, 2000 included $290.2 million in net
proceeds from the issuance of $300 million in convertible
subordinated notes, due 2007.

We believe, based on our present business plan,
that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities of $125.2 million will be sufficient to meet our
cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at
least the next 24 months. If the assumptions underlying our
business plan regarding future revenue and expenditures change
or if unexpected opportunities or needs arise, we may seek to
raise additional cash by selling equity or debt securities. If
additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt
securities, these securities could have rights, preferences and
privileges senior to those accruing to holders of common stock,
and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our
operations. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt
securities could result in additional dilution to our
stockholders. See “Factors Affecting Future Operating
Results.”

Contractual Obligations and Commercial
Commitments

The following table presents our contractual
obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31,
2002 over the next five years and thereafter (in millions):

Letters of Credit

As of December 31, 2002, we had issued
$13.4 million in irrevocable letters of credit in favor of
third-party beneficiaries, primarily related to long-term
facility leases. The letters of credit are collateralized by
restricted marketable securities, of which $10.2 million
are classified as long-term and $3.2 million are classified
as short-term on the consolidated balance sheet. The
restrictions on these marketable securities lapse as we fulfill
our obligations as provided by the letters of credit.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have entered into indemnification agreements
with third parties, including vendors, customers, landlords, our
officers and directors, shareholders of acquired companies,
joint venture partners and third parties to whom we license
technology. Generally, these indemnification agreements require
us to reimburse losses suffered by the third party due to
various events, such as lawsuits arising from patent or
copyright infringement or our negligence. These indemnification
obligations are considered off-balance sheet arrangements in
accordance with FASB Interpretation 45,
“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others.” See Note 10 to our consolidated financial
statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for
further discussion of these indemnification agreements.



Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board, or FASB, issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards, or SFAS, No. 143, “Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations,” which is effective in January
2003. SFAS No. 143 addresses the financial accounting and
reporting requirements for obligations associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated
asset retirement costs. Weare assessing the potential impact
that the adoption of SFAS No. 143 will have on our
consolidated financial statements.

In April 2002, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements
No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13,
and Technical Corrections.” SFAS No. 145 rescinds
several statements, including SFAS No. 4,
“Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of
Debt.” The statement also makes several technical
corrections to other existing authoritative pronouncements.
SFAS No. 145 was effective in May 2002, except for the
rescission of SFAS No. 4, which is effective in
January 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 145 did not
have and is not expected to have a significant impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

In June 2002, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities.” SFAS No. 146
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs
associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies
Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94-3, “Liability
Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other
Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring).” SFAS No. 146 requires that a
liability be recognized when it is incurred and should initially
be measured and recorded at fair value. In accordance with
SFAS No. 146, a liability for costs that will continue
to be incurred under a contract for its remaining term without
economic benefit shall be recognized and measured at its fair
value when the Company ceases using the right conveyed by the
contract. For a real estate lease, the fair value of the
liability at the cease-use date is determined based on the
contractual future lease payments, reduced by estimated sublease
rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the property. This
statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are
initiated after December 31, 2002. We do not expect that
the adoption of SFAS No. 146 will have a significant
impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation
45, or FIN 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.” FIN 45
elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most
guarantees, including loan guarantees such as standby letters of
credit. It also clarifies that at the time a entity issues a
guarantee, the entity must recognize an initial liability for
the fair value, or market value, of the obligations it assumes
under the guarantee and must disclose that information in its
interim and annual financial statements. The initial recognition
and initial measurement provisions of FIN 45 apply on a
prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after
December 31, 2002. We are currently evaluating the impact
that initial measurement provisions of Interpretation 45 will
have on our consolidated financial statements. The disclosure
provisions of FIN 45 are effective for this annual report
on Form 10-K. Accordingly, we have included a discussion of
our guarantees in Note 10 to the consolidated financial
statements.

In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force,
or EITF, reached a consensus on Issue 00-21 “Revenue
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.” EITF 00-21
addresses the revenue recognition for revenue arrangements with
multiple deliverables. The deliverables in these revenue
arrangements should be divided into separate units of accounting
when the individual deliverables have value to the customer on a
stand-alone basis, there is objective and reliable evidence of
the fair value of the undelivered elements, and, if the
arrangement includes a general right to return the delivered
element, delivery or performance of the undelivered element is
considered probable. The relative fair value of each unit should
be determined and the total consideration of the arrangement
should be allocated among the individual units based on their
fair value. The guidance in this issue is effective for revenue
arrangements entered into after June 30, 2003. We do not
expect that the adoption of EITF 00-21 will have a material
impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2002, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation — Transition and Disclosure, an amendment
of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based



Compensation.” SFAS No. 148 amends
SFAS No. 123 to provide alternative methods of
transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method
of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In
addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure
requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent
disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements
about the method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation and the effect of the method used on reported
results. SFAS No. 148 is effective for annual periods
ending after December 15, 2002 and interim periods
beginning after December 15, 2002. The adoption of
SFAS No. 148 will require us to include additional
disclosures of equity-related compensation in our consolidated
financial statements, including this annual report on
Form 10-K.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation
46, or FIN 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities-an interpretation of ARB No. 51.” FIN 46
addresses consolidation of variable interest entities where the
equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity
to finance its activities without additional subordinated
financial support from other parties and the equity investors
lack one or more essential characteristics of a controlling
financial interest. This Interpretation applies immediately to
variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003,
and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains
an interest after that date. It applies in the first fiscal year
or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003, to
variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a
variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003.
We are currently evaluating the impact that FIN 46 will
have on our consolidated financial statements.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
    About Market Risk.

Our exposure to market risk for changes in
interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. We
do not use derivative financial instruments in our portfolio. We
place our investments with high quality issuers and, by policy,
limit the amount of risk by investing primarily in money market
funds, United States Treasury obligations, high-quality
corporate obligations and certificates of deposit. We expect to
hold our marketable debt securities until maturity and do not
expect to realize significant losses on the sale of marketable
debt securities prior to maturity. We also hold investments in
the equity of several public and private companies. The carrying
amount of these investments at December 31, 2002 was
approximately $500,000, which we believe approximates their fair
value.

We have operations in Europe and Japan. As a
result, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange
rates. We do not expect, however, that changes in foreign
exchange rates will have a significant impact on our
consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash
flows. We may continue to expand our operations globally and
sell to customers in foreign locations, which may increase our
exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations.

Our 5 1/2% convertible notes are
subject to changes in market value. As of December 31,
2002, the carrying amount and fair value of these notes were
$300.0 million and $133.9 million, respectively.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Akamai Technologies, Inc.:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of
operations, of cash flows and of stockholders’
(deficit) equity present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Akamai Technologies, Inc. and its
subsidiaries at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2002 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America, which require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As disclosed in Note 2 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company ceased amortization of
goodwill and reclassified its assembled workforce intangible
asset to goodwill in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets,” in January 2002.

Nature of Business and Basis of
    Presentation:

Akamai Technologies, Inc. (“Akamai” or
the “Company”) provides secure e-business
infrastructure services and software. These services and
software are designed to enable enterprises to extend and
control their e-business infrastructure while ensuring superior
performance, reliability, scalability and manageability.
Akamai’s globally distributed platform comprises more than
13,000 servers in more than 1,100 networks in 66 countries.
The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1998 and is
headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Akamai currently
operates in one business segment: providing e-business
infrastructure services and software.

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Akamai and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All
significant inter-company transactions and balances have been
eliminated in consolidation. Certain reclassifications of prior
year amounts have been made to conform with current year
presentation.

Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies:

Use of Estimates

The Company prepares its consolidated financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America that require management
to make estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of
reported assets and liabilities and related disclosures. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates
used in these financial statements include, but are not limited
to, accounting for long-term contracts, allowance for doubtful
accounts, restructuring reserves, contingencies, amortization
and impairment of intangibles, goodwill, and capitalized
software, depreciation and impairment of property and equipment,
deferred tax assets and other-than-temporary loss on
investments. Estimates are periodically reviewed in light of
changes in circumstances, facts and experience. The effects of
material revisions in estimates are reflected in the
consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of
the change in estimate.

The Company has incurred net losses and negative
cash flows since inception. The Company’s cash used in
operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 was
$65.8 million, and the Company had accrued restructuring
costs, primarily related to vacated facilities, of
$37.6 million at December 31, 2002. The Company’s
cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted
marketable securities at December 31, 2002 were
$125.2 million. The Company believes that its existing
cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted
marketable securities will be sufficient to meet its working
capital, capital expenditure and restructuring requirements for
at least the next 24 months. If, however, the demand for
the Company’s services and software does not increase, the
Company will incur additional losses and negative cash flows
which could be significant.

Revenue Recognition

Akamai primarily derives revenue from recurring
services sold to customers under long-term contracts. These
contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly
level of usage. The contract provides for the rate at which the
customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly minimum.
For these services, Akamai recognizes the monthly minimum as
revenue each month provided that an enforceable contract has
been signed by both parties, the service has been delivered to
the customer, the fee for the service is fixed or determinable
and collection is reasonably assured. Should a customer’s
usage exceed the monthly minimum, Akamai recognizes revenue for
that excess in the period of the usage. The Company charges the
customer an installation fee when the services are first
activated. The installation fees are recorded as deferred
revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated
life of the customer arrangement, which is generally the term of
the contract. The Company also derives revenue from services
sold as discrete events or based solely on usage. For these
services, the Company recognizes revenue after an enforceable
contract has been signed by both parties, the fee is fixed or
determinable, the event or usage has occurred and collection is
reasonably assured.



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company periodically enters into
multi-element service arrangements. When the Company enters into
such arrangements, each element is accounted for separately over
its respective service period, provided that there is objective
evidence of fair value for the separate element. For example,
objective evidence of fair value would include the price charged
for the element when sold separately. If the fair value of each
element cannot be objectively determined, the total value of the
arrangement is recognized ratably over the entire service
period. For all multi-element service arrangements to date, the
fair value of each element has not been objectively
determinable. Therefore, all revenue under these arrangements
has been recognized ratably over the related service period.

The Company licenses software under perpetual and
term license agreements. The Company applies the provisions of
Statement of Position (“SOP”) 97-2, “Software
Revenue Recognition,” as amended by SOP 98-9,
“Modifications of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue
Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions.” As
prescribed by this guidance, the Company applies the residual
method of accounting. The residual method requires that the
portion of the total arrangement fee attributable to undelivered
elements, as indicated by vendor specific objective evidence
(“VSOE”) of fair value, is deferred and subsequently
recognized in accordance with SOP 97-2. The difference
between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for
the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the
delivered elements, if all other revenue recognition criteria of
SOP 97-2 are met.

The Company sells its services through a reseller
channel. Assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are
met, the Company recognizes revenue from reseller arrangements
based on the resellers’ contracted non-refundable minimum
purchase commitments over the term of the contract, plus amounts
sold by the resellers to their customers in excess of the
minimum commitments.

Akamai recognizes revenue from fixed-fee
arrangements and software arrangements that require significant
customization or modification using the percentage-of-completion
method in accordance with Accounting Research Bulletin
(“ARB”) No. 45, “Long-Term Construction-Type
Contracts,” and with the applicable guidance provided by
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
SOP 81-1, “Accounting for Performance of
Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts”
based on the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to the
estimated total cost to complete the project. The impact of any
change in estimate is recorded prospectively from the date of
the change. At the outset of a fixed-fee arrangement, if the
Company is not able to estimate the total cost-to-complete, the
Company accounts for the arrangement using the
completed-contract method of accounting. Under this method, the
Company recognizes revenue when the contract is complete and
there are no remaining costs or deliverables. In the event that
the estimated total cost on a fixed-fee contract indicates a
loss, the Company will record the loss immediately.

From time to time, the Company enters into
contracts to sell its services or license its technology with
enterprises at or about the same time that it enters into
contracts to purchase products or services from the same
enterprise. If the Company concludes that these contracts were
negotiated concurrently, the Company records as revenue only the
net cash received from the vendor, unless the fair value to the
Company of the vendor’s product or service can be
established objectively.

The Company may from time to time resell licenses
or services of third parties. The Company records revenue for
these transactions when the Company has risk of loss related to
the amounts purchased from the third party and the Company adds
value to the license or service, such as by providing
maintenance or support for such license or service. If these
conditions are present, the Company recognizes revenue when all
other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied.

Cost of Revenue

Cost of revenue consists primarily of fees paid
to network providers for bandwidth and for housing servers in
third-party network data centers. Cost of revenue also includes
network operation employee costs, network



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

storage costs, cost of professional services,
cost of licenses, depreciation on network equipment used to
deliver the Company’s services, amortization of
network-related internal-use software, and costs for the
production of live events. The Company enters into contracts for
bandwidth with third-party network providers with terms
typically ranging from one to three years. These contracts
generally commit Akamai to pay minimum monthly fees plus
additional fees for bandwidth usage above the contracted level.
In some circumstances, Internet service providers
(“ISPs”) make available to Akamai rack space for the
Company’s servers and access to their bandwidth at
discounted or no cost. In exchange, the ISP and its customers
benefit by receiving content through a local Akamai server
resulting in better content delivery. The Company does not
consider these relationships to represent the culmination of an
earnings process. Accordingly, the Company does not recognize as
revenue the value to the ISPs associated with the use of
Akamai’s servers nor does the Company recognize as expense
the value of the rack space and bandwidth received at discounted
or no cost.

Equity-Related Compensation

Akamai accounts for stock-based awards to
employees using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by
Accounting Principles Board Opinion (“APB”)
No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,” and related interpretations. Accordingly, no
compensation expense is recorded for stock-based awards issued
to employees in fixed amounts and with fixed exercise prices at
least equal to the fair market value of the Company’s
common stock at the date of grant. Akamai applies the provisions
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”) No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation,” through disclosure only for
stock-based awards issued to employees. All stock-based awards
to non-employees are accounted for at their fair value in
accordance with SFAS No. 123.

Equity-related compensation is comprised of the
following:

The following table illustrates the effect on net
loss and net loss per share had the Company accounted for stock
options issued to employees under the fair value recognition
provisions of SFAS No. 123 (in thousands, except per
share data):



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The fair value of each award is estimated on the
grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
following assumptions:

Research and Development
    Costs

Research and development costs consist primarily
of salaries and related personnel costs for the design,
deployment, testing, operation and enhancement of the
Company’s services and network. Costs incurred in the
development of the Company’s services are expensed as
incurred, except certain software development costs eligible for
capitalization. Costs associated with the development of
software to be marketed externally are expensed prior to the
establishment of technological feasibility as defined by
SFAS No. 86, “Accounting for the Cost of Computer
Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed,” and
capitalized thereafter until the general release of the
software. To date, the Company’s development of software to
be sold externally has been completed concurrently with the
establishment of technological feasibility and, accordingly, all
associated costs have been charged to expense as incurred in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Costs incurred during the application development
stage of internal-use software projects are capitalized in
accordance with SOP 98-1, “Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.”
Capitalized costs include payroll and payroll-related costs for
employees in the Company’s development and information
technology groups who are directly associated with and who
devote time to the Company’s internal-use software projects
during the application development stage. Capitalization begins
when the planning stage is complete and the Company commits
resources to the software project. Capitalization ceases when
the software has been tested and is ready for its intended use.
Amortization of the asset commences when the software is
complete and placed in service. Costs incurred during the
planning, training and post implementation stages of the
software development life-cycle are expensed as incurred. Costs
related to upgrades and enhancements of existing internal-use
software that increase the functionality of the software are
also capitalized.

Concentrations of Credit Risk and Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The amounts reflected in the consolidated balance
sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and
accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair
value due to their short-term maturities. The fair value and
carrying value of the Company’s
5 1/2% convertible notes were approximately
$133.9 million and $300.0 million, respectively, as of
December 31, 2002. Akamai’s cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities are held with financial institutions that
the Company believes to be of high credit standing.
Akamai’s customer base consists of a large number of
geographically dispersed customers diversified across several
industries. For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001,
no customers accounted for more than 10% of total revenue. For
the year ended December 31, 2000, one customer accounted
for 12% of total revenue. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001,
no customer had an accounts receivable balance outstanding



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

more than 10% of total accounts receivable. As a
result, concentration of credit risk related to accounts
receivable is not significant.

Income Taxes

The Company’s provision for income taxes is
comprised of a current and a deferred provision. The current
income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes
payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. The
deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated
future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and
carryforwards using expected enacted tax rates in effect in the
years during which the differences are expected to reverse.
Valuation allowances are provided if, based on the weight of
available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all
of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Advertising Expense

The Company recognizes advertising expense as
incurred. The Company acquired a prepaid advertising contract as
a result of its acquisition in April 2000 of InterVu, Inc.
(Note 19). The prepaid asset has been fully amortized to
advertising expense in the amount of $5.6 million,
$5.6 million and $7.2 million for the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Company
recognized total advertising expense of $7.5 million,
$5.6 million and $24.8 million for the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Foreign Currency Translation

Akamai has determined that the functional
currency of its foreign subsidiaries is the subsidiary’s
local currency. The assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries
are translated at the applicable exchange rate as of the balance
sheet date and revenues and expenses are translated at an
average rate over the period. Currency translation adjustments
are recorded as a component of other comprehensive loss. Gains
and losses on inter-company transactions are recorded in
operating expenses and have not been material for the periods
presented.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable
    Securities

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash held in
bank deposit accounts and short-term, highly liquid investments
with original maturities of three months or less at the date of
purchase. Cash equivalents are carried at amortized cost, which
approximates fair value.

Short-term marketable securities consist of high
quality corporate and government securities with original
maturities of more than three months at the date of purchase and
less than one year from the date of the balance sheet, and
equity investments in publicly-traded companies. Long-term
marketable securities consist of high quality corporate and
government securities with maturities of more than one year from
the date of the balance sheet. Short-term and long-term
marketable securities include investments that are restricted as
to use.

The Company classifies all debt securities and
equity securities with readily determinable market values as
“available for sale” in accordance with
SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities.” These investments are
classified as marketable securities on the consolidated balance
sheet and are carried at fair market value with unrealized gains
and losses considered to be temporary in nature reported as a
separate component of other comprehensive loss. Investments in
the securities of private companies are initially carried at
cost. These investments are included in other long-term assets
on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company reviews all
investments for reductions in fair value that are
other-than-temporary. When such reductions occur, the cost of
the investment is adjusted to fair value through loss on
investments on the consolidated statement of operations. Gains
and losses on investments are calculated on the basis of
specific identification.



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of
related lease terms or their estimated useful lives. Property
and equipment acquired under capital leases are depreciated over
the shorter of the related lease terms or the useful lives of
the assets. The Company periodically reviews the estimated
useful lives of property and equipment. Changes to the estimated
useful lives are recorded prospectively from the date of the
change. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of the assets disposed
and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the
accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in loss from
operations. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as
incurred.

Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets

In accordance with SFAS No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” which the
Company adopted on January 1, 2002, the Company has
reclassified the balance of unamortized assembled workforce
intangible assets to goodwill as of January 1, 2002. The
Company has performed an impairment test of goodwill as of
January 1, 2002 and 2003. These tests did not result in an
impairment to goodwill, see Note 7. In accordance with
SFAS No. 142, the Company discontinued the
amortization of goodwill as of January 2002. Other intangible
assets consist of completed technology and trademarks and trade
names arising from the acquisition of businesses and acquired
license rights. These intangible assets are amortized using the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.

Impairment of Other Long-Lived
    Assets

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment
under the guidance of SFAS No. 144, “Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” Under
SFAS No. 144, long-lived assets are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as
service discontinuance, technological obsolescence, a change in
the Company’s market capitalization, facility closure, or
work-force reductions, indicate that the carrying amount of the
asset may not be recoverable. When such events occur, the
Company compares the carrying amount of the asset to the
undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset. If
this comparison indicates that an impairment is present, the
amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between
the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. If a
readily determinable market price does not exist, fair value is
estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to
the asset.

Restructuring Charges

A restructuring liability is recorded by the
Company when a one-time benefit arrangement is communicated to
an employee who is involuntarily terminated as part of a
company-wide reorganization and the amount of the termination
benefit is known, provided that the employee is not required to
render future services in order to receive the termination
benefit.

The Company has recorded restructuring expenses
and liabilities when its management approves and commits the
Company to a plan to exit a facility lease, the plan
specifically identifies the actions to be taken and the actions
are scheduled to begin soon after management approves the plan.
Beginning in 2003, in accordance with SFAS No. 146,
“Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities,” the Company will record a restructuring
liability, discounted at the appropriate rate, for facility
leases only when the space is both vacated and all actions
needed to make the space readily available for sublease have
been completed. The Company records restructuring liabilities
for estimated costs to terminate a facility lease before the end
of its contractual term or for estimated costs that will
continue to be incurred under the lease for its remaining term
when there is no economic benefit to the Company, less an
estimate of sublease income.

Recent Accounting
    Pronouncements

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (the “FASB”) issued SFAS No. 143,
“Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” which
is effective in January 2003. SFAS No. 143 addresses
financial accounting and reporting requirements for obligations
associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and
the associated asset retirement costs. The Company is assessing
the potential impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 143
will have on its consolidated financial statements.

In April 2002, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements
No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13,
and Technical Corrections.” SFAS No. 145 rescinds
several statements, including SFAS No. 4,
“Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of
Debt.” The statement also makes several technical
corrections to other existing authoritative pronouncements.
SFAS No. 145 was effective in May 2002, except for the
rescission of SFAS No. 4, which became effective in
January 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 145 has not had
and is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In June 2002, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities.” SFAS No. 146
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs
associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies
Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94-3, “Liability
Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other
Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring).” SFAS No. 146 requires that a
liability be recognized when it is incurred and should initially
be measured and recorded at fair value. This statement is
effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated
after December 31, 2002, and the adoption of this statement
is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

In November 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on
Issue 00-21 “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables.” EITF 00-21 addresses revenue recognition for
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. The
deliverables in these revenue arrangements should be divided
into separate units of accounting when the individual
deliverables have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis,
there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of
the undelivered elements, and, if the arrangement includes a
general right to return the delivered element, delivery or
performance of the undelivered element is considered probable.
The relative fair value of each unit should be determined and
the total consideration of the arrangement should be allocated
among the individual units based on their fair value. The
guidance on this issue is effective for revenue arrangements
entered into after June 30, 2003. The Company does not
expect that the adoption of EITF 00-21 will have a material
impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation
45, (“FIN 45”), “Guarantor’s Accounting
and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others — an
interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and
rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34.” FIN 45
elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most
guarantees, including loan guarantees such as standby letters of
credit. It also clarifies that at the time a company issues a
guarantee, the company must recognize an initial liability for
the fair value, or market value, of the obligations it assumes
under the guarantee and must disclose that information in its
interim and annual financial statements. The initial recognition
and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis
to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the initial
recognition and measurement provisions of FIN 45 will have
on its consolidated financial statements. The disclosure
provisions of FIN 45 are effective for this annual report
on Form 10-K. Accordingly, the Company has included a
discussion of its guarantees in Note 10 to the consolidated
financial statements.

In December 2002, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation — Transition and Disclosure, an amendment
of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation.” SFAS No. 148 amends
SFAS No. 123 to provide alternative methods of
transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method
of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In

addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the
disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require
prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial
statements about the method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation and the effect of the method used on
reported results. SFAS No. 148 is effective for annual
periods ending after December 15, 2002 and interim periods
beginning after December 15, 2002. The adoption of
SFAS No. 148 require the Company to provide additional
disclosures of equity-related compensation in its consolidated
financial statements, including this annual report on
Form 10-K.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation
46 (“FIN 46”), “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities — an interpretation of ARB
No. 51.” The interpretation addresses consolidation of
variable interest entities that have the following
characteristics: The equity investment at risk is not sufficient
to permit the entity to finance its activities without
additional subordinated financial support from other parties and
the equity investors lack one or more essential characteristics
of a controlling financial interest. FIN 46 applies
immediately to variable interest entities created after
January 31, 2003, and to variable interest entities in
which the Company obtains an interest after that date.
FIN 46 applies in the first fiscal year or interim period
beginning after June 15, 2003 to variable interest entities
in which the Company holds a variable interest that it acquired
before February 1, 2003. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact that FIN 46 will have on its
consolidated financial statements.

Net Loss per Share:

Basic net loss per share is computed using the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
year. Diluted net loss per share is computed using the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the year,
plus the dilutive effect of potential common stock. Potential
common stock consists of stock options, warrants, unvested
restricted common stock, contingently issuable common stock and
convertible notes.

The following table sets forth the components of
potential common stock excluded from the calculation of diluted
net loss per share because their inclusion would be antidilutive:

party investment, to adjust the cost basis of its equity
investments in publicly-traded companies to fair value as a
result of reductions in the market values of such investments
that, in the opinion of management, were other-than-temporary.
During 2002, the Company also recorded a loss of $960,000 to
adjust the carrying amount of its investment in a privately-held
company to its estimated fair value. Akamai estimated the
realizable value of the investment based on the recent market
capitalization of publicly traded companies in the
investee’s industry. Loss on investments in 2002 also

Property and Equipment:

Property and equipment consists of the following
(in thousands):

Depreciation and amortization expense on property
and equipment for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001
and 2000 was $78.5 million, $73.8 million and
$35.6 million, respectively. During the year ended
December 31, 2002, the Company accelerated the amortization
of leasehold improvements at its headquarters facility located
in Cambridge, Massachusetts, as a result of the move to a new
facility. The change in the useful lives of these assets
resulted in an increase to depreciation expense of
$5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.
During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company
changed the estimated useful lives of its internal use computers
from 3 to 2 years. The impact of the change in useful lives
resulted in an increase to depreciation expense of
$2.4 million in 2001.

During the years ended December 31, 2002 and
2001, as a result of restructuring actions undertaken by the
Company, the Company impaired approximately $3.2 million
and $1.3 million, respectively, of leasehold improvements
and furniture and fixtures. The Company recorded these
impairments as non-cash restructuring charges (Note 12). In
addition, during the year ended December 31, 2002, the
Company recorded an impairment charge of $979,000, which is
included in depreciation expense, for certain excess or obsolete
long-lived assets, consisting of computer and network equipment,
furniture and fixtures and licensed software.

leases as follows (in thousands):

During the year ended December 31, 2002, the
Company capitalized $7.2 million of payroll and
payroll-related costs for the development and enhancement of
internal-use software applications in accordance with
SOP 98-1. The internal-use software is used by the Company
primarily to operate and monitor its deployed network and
deliver its services. The $7.2 million of capitalized costs
represents $174,000, $6.3 million and

$732,000 of costs for employees which would have
been included in the cost of revenue, research and development
and general and administrative expense categories, respectively,
of the statement of operations. The Company impaired $285,000 of
in-process internal-use software previously capitalized for
projects that were cancelled, in part due to a reduction in the
Company’s engineering staff in the fourth quarter of 2002.
These impairments are recorded in research and development
expense. The Company amortizes completed internal-use software
over an estimated life of two years. As of December 31,
2002, the Company had amortized approximately $932,000 of
capitalized software costs. No costs were capitalized in 2001 or
2000.

Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets:

The Company acquired goodwill and other
intangible assets through business acquisitions during the year
ended December 31, 2000. The Company also acquired license
rights from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1999.
The Company reviews goodwill and other intangible assets for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of these assets may exceed their fair
value.

During the first quarter of 2001, the Company
reviewed goodwill and other long-lived assets for impairment
under the guidance of SFAS No. 121, “Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to Be Disposed Of.” The Company considered several
factors in determining whether an impairment may have occurred,
including the Company’s market capitalization compared to
its book value, the overall business climate and recent
estimates for operating results of acquired businesses. A review
of these factors as of March 31, 2001 indicated that an
impairment assessment was required for long-lived assets of
acquired businesses. The Company grouped all long-lived assets
for acquired businesses, including goodwill and other intangible
assets, and estimated the future discounted cash flows related
to these long-lived assets. The discount rate used was based on
the risks associated with the acquired businesses. As a result
of this analysis, the Company recorded an impairment charge of
$1,912.8 million during the first quarter of 2001 to adjust
the carrying amount of goodwill arising from the acquisitions of
Network


Communications, Inc.
(“Network


”) and InterVu to its fair value as
of March 31, 2001.

The Company adopted SFAS No. 142 in
January 2002. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 142,
the carrying amount of goodwill was $4.0 million. In
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, the
Company reclassified its assembled workforce intangible assets
of approximately $1.0 million to goodwill.
SFAS No. 142 requires the Company to test goodwill for
impairment at least annually. The Company concluded that it had
one reporting unit and assigned the entire balance of goodwill
to this reporting unit as of January 1, 2002 and 2003 for
purposes of performing an impairment test. The fair value of the
reporting unit was determined using the Company’s market
capitalization as of January 1, 2002 and 2003. The fair
value on January 1, 2002 and 2003 exceeded the net assets
of the reporting unit, including goodwill, as of both dates.
Accordingly, the Company concluded that no impairment existed as
of these dates. Unless changes in events or circumstances
indicate that an impairment test is required, the Company will
next test goodwill for impairment on January 1, 2004. In
accordance with SFAS No. 142, the Company discontinued
the amortization of goodwill as of January 1, 2002.

been adopted by the Company as of the beginning of each year:

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 142,
the Company’s other intangible assets consisted of
completed technology, trademarks and trade names, assembled
workforce and acquired license rights. In 2002, the Company
reclassified assembled workforce to goodwill and concluded that
the remaining intangible assets had definite useful lives
equivalent to their original useful lives. During the first
quarter of 2002, the Company discontinued the sales of a service
line that utilized technology acquired from Network


in
February 2000 and recorded an impairment loss of
$2.3 million to adjust the intangible assets related to the
Network


technology to their fair value. The impairment
loss was included in amortization of other intangible assets.

Other intangible assets subject to amortization
consist of the following (in thousands):

Amortization expense for other intangible assets
was $11.9 million, $18.5 million and

Operating and Capital Leases

The Company leases its facilities and certain
equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. These operating
leases expire at various dates through August 2010 and generally
require the payment of real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance
and operating costs. In June 2002, the Company entered into a
real property lease agreement, which expires in May 2009, for
its new corporate headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The
Company also leases certain equipment under capital leases,
which expire at various dates through June 2005. The minimum

respectively.

The Company has issued letters of credit in the
amount of $10.2 million related to certain of its real
estate leases. These letters of credit are collateralized by
marketable securities that have been restricted as to use
(Note 5). The letters of credit expire as the Company
fulfills its operating lease obligations. Certain of the
Company’s facility leases include rent escalation clauses.
The Company normalizes rent expense on a straight-line basis
over the term of the lease.

Purchase Commitments

The Company has long-term commitments for
bandwidth usage and co-location with various networks and
Internet service providers. For the years ending
December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, the minimum commitments
are approximately $12.5 million, $4.8 million and
$1.2 million, respectively. The Company had aggregate
equipment purchase commitments of approximately $500,000 as of

Litigation

In January 2000, a former employee of InterVu
filed an action against InterVu alleging that InterVu had
breached two restricted stock purchase agreements by failing to
deliver certain shares of stock after the employee’s
resignation. The plaintiff sought specific performance and
monetary damages. In April 2001, the court ruled in favor of the
plaintiff. The court assessed damages against the Company in the
amount of $1.9 million. As of December 31, 2002, the
Company had accrued for the loss and had placed
$2.5 million, which includes interest, into an escrow
account pending the appeal. In January 2003, the Company paid
the $2.5 million, including interest, required by the
judgment.

In June 2001, a former employee filed an
employment-related lawsuit with multiple claims against the
Company. The plaintiff sought monetary damages. In February
2003, the Company settled the matter for a sum of
$3.6 million, of which $1.8 million will be reimbursed
by the Company’s insurance carrier. As of December 31,
2002, the Company included $3.6 million in accrued
expenses, $1.8 million in current assets and recorded the
net amount of $1.8 million as general and administrative
expenses.

Between July 2, 2001 and August 31,
2001, purported class action lawsuits seeking monetary damages
were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York against the Company and several of its
officers and directors as well as against the underwriters of
its October 28, 1999 initial public offering of common
stock. The complaints were filed allegedly on behalf of persons
who purchased the Company’s common stock during different
time periods, all beginning on October 28, 1999 and ending
on various dates. The complaints are similar and allege
violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 primarily based on the allegation that the
underwriters received undisclosed compensation in connection
with the Company’s initial public offering. The Company has
not accrued any amounts related to these lawsuits because the
range of potential loss is not yet considered probable.

In June 2002, the Company filed suit against
Speedera Networks, Inc. (“Speedera”), in California
Superior Court alleging theft of Akamai trade secrets from an
independent company that provides website performance testing
services. In October 2002, Speedera filed a cross-claim against
the Company seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief and
alleging that Akamai engaged in various unfair trade practices,
made false and misleading statements and engaged in unfair
competition. The Company has not accrued any amounts related to
the cross-claim because the range of potential loss is not yet
considered probable.

In July 2002, Cable and Wireless Internet
Services (“C&W”), formerly known as Digital
Island, filed suit against the Company in the United States
District Court for the District of Massachusetts alleging that
certain Akamai services infringe a C&W patent issued in that
month. C&W is seeking a preliminary injunction restraining
the Company from offering services that infringe such patent.
Subsequently, in August 2002, C&W filed a suit against the
Company in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

California alleging that certain Akamai services
infringe a second C&W patent. The Company has not accrued
any amounts related to this litigation because the potential
loss is not yet considered probable.

In September 2002, Teknowledge Corporation
(“Teknowledge”), filed a lawsuit in the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware against Akamai,
C&W and Inktomi Corporation alleging that certain services
offered by each company infringe a Teknowledge patent relating
to automatic retrieval of changed files by a network software
agent. The Company has not recorded a liability related to this
lawsuit because the range of potential loss is not yet
considered probable.

In November 2002, the Company filed suit against
Speedera in federal court in Massachusetts for violation of a
patent held by Akamai. In January 2003, Speedera filed a
counterclaim in this case alleging that Akamai has infringed a
patent that was recently issued to Speedera. The Company has not
recorded a liability related to the counterclaim because the
potential loss is not yet considered probable.

Obligations under Guarantees:

The Company has identified the guarantees
described below as disclosable in accordance with FIN 45.

Convertible Notes:

In June 2000, Akamai issued $300.0 million
of 5 1/2% Convertible Subordinated Notes due
July 1, 2007 (the “Convertible Notes”) for
aggregate net proceeds of approximately $290.2 million (net
of underwriting fees and other offering expenses of
$9.8 million). The Convertible Notes are convertible at any
time into the Company’s common stock at a conversion price
of $115.47 per share (equivalent to 8.6603 shares of
common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes),
subject to adjustment in certain events. The Company may redeem
the Convertible Notes on or after July 3, 2003, at the
Company’s option. In the event of a change of control,
Akamai may be required to repurchase all or a portion of the
Convertible Notes at a repurchase price of 100% of the principal
amount plus accrued interest. Interest on the Convertible Notes

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

began to accrue as of the issue date and is
payable semiannually on January 1 and July 1 of each year,
commencing on January 1, 2001. The Convertible Notes are
unsecured obligations and are subordinated to all existing and
future senior indebtedness of Akamai. Deferred financing costs
of $9.8 million, including underwriting fees and other
offering expenses, for the Convertible Notes are being amortized
over the term of the notes. Amortization of deferred financing
costs was approximately $1.4 million for each of the years
ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, and $740,000 for the year
ended December 31, 2000.

Restructurings and Lease
    Terminations:

The Company recorded restructuring charges of
$45.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.
These charges included $3.6 million for employee severance
benefit costs and $42.2 million for the actual and
estimated termination and modification costs for excess facility
leases, less estimated sublease income. During the year ended
December 31, 2001, the Company recorded restructuring
charges of $40.5 million. These charges included
$5.1 million for severance benefit costs and
$35.4 million for facility leases.

During the year ended December 31, 2001,
management approved an exit plan with respect to excess and
vacant facilities under long-term non-cancelable leases. The
Company recorded a restructuring charge of $34.1 million
for the estimated amount of future lease payments and
termination fees, less estimated sublease income, for these
facilities. The Company also impaired $1.3 million of
leasehold improvements located at these facilities. The
impairment was recorded as a non-cash restructuring charge.

In 2002, the Company terminated its facility
leases for 500 and 600 Technology Square in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, for total costs of $15.9 million, including
brokerage and legal fees. Termination costs were settled using
cash and refundable deposits. The accrued liabilities for these
leases totaled $7.9 million. Accordingly, the Company
recorded an additional restructuring charge of $8.0 million
for the difference between the actual termination costs and the
amount previously accrued. The Company is currently negotiating
with the landlord of a facility, vacated by the Company, to
modify Akamai’s lease. The contractual lease term for the
facility is through 2010. As of December 31, 2002,
contractual future lease obligations for this facility were
$56.0 million. The Company believes that it is probable
that it will reach agreement with the landlord to modify the
lease for an amount less than the total contractual amount. As a
result, during the year ended December 31, 2002, the
Company recorded a restructuring charge of $29.3 million,
representing the difference between the amount payable for the
anticipated cost to the modified lease agreement and the
previously recorded restructuring liability for the facility.
Also during 2002, the Company impaired leasehold improvements
and furniture and fixtures related to vacated facilities in the
amount of $3.2 million.

In October 2002, the Company announced an
enterprise-wide workforce reduction. Approximately 200 employees
from all areas of the Company were included in the reduction.

The amount of restructuring liabilities
associated with facility leases has been estimated based on the
most recent available market data and discussions with the
Company’s lessors and real estate advisors. In the event
that these real estate leases are terminated at a higher or
lower cost than the amount accrued as of December 31, 2002,
the Company will record an adjustment to the restructuring
liability in the period in which the adjustment becomes probable
and estimable.

the rights plan, the Board of Directors designated
700,000 shares of the Company’s 5.0 million
authorized shares of undesignated preferred stock as
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value
$.01 per share. Each Right entitles the registered holder

and upon the exercise of options and warrants.

Notes Receivable for Stock

In 1999, in connection with the issuance of

Replacement Notes may be accelerated at the
option of the Company if the maker ceases to be employed by the
Company for any reason. In November 2002, the Company’s
Chief Financial Officer terminated his employment with Akamai,
and the Company chose not to exercise right to accelerate
payment of his Replacement Note. Shares of common stock
purchased with these Replacement Notes are subject to variable
accounting until the Replacement Note is paid in full. No
variable accounting charges have been recorded to date.

Stock Plans:

In 1998, the Board of Directors adopted the 1998
Stock Incentive Plan (the “1998 Plan”) for the
issuance of incentive and nonqualified stock options and
restricted stock awards. Options to purchase common stock and
restricted stock awards are granted at the discretion of the
Board of Directors. In December 2001, the Board of Directors
adopted the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2001
Plan”) for the issuance of nonqualified stock options and
restricted stock awards. The total number of shares of common
stock reserved for issuance under the 1998 Plan and the 2001
Plan is 41,255,600 and 5,000,000 shares, respectively.
Equity incentives may not be issued to the Company’s
directors or executive officers under the 2001 Plan.

Under the terms of the 1998 Plan, the exercise
price of incentive stock options granted must not be less than
100% (110% in certain cases) of the fair market value of the
common stock on the date of grant, as determined by the Board of
Directors. Incentive stock options may not be issued under the
2001 Plan. The exercise price of nonqualified stock options
issued under the 1998 Plan and the 2001 Plan may be less than
the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant,
as determined by the board of directors, but in no case may the
exercise price be less than the statutory minimum. Stock option
vesting is typically four years and is at the discretion of the
board of directors. The term of options granted might not exceed
ten years, or five years for incentive stock options granted to
holders of more than 10% of the voting stock of the Company.

Restricted stock awards may be issued under the
1998 Plan to directors, officers, advisors and employees at
prices determined by the Compensation Committee.
Participants’ unvested shares are subject to repurchase by
the Company at the original purchase price for between two and
four years. Generally, 25% of the shares vest between six months
and one year of the date of purchase and, thereafter, the
remaining shares vest on a quarterly basis through the fourth
anniversary date of purchase. As of December 31, 2002, the
Company had the right to repurchase up to 1,449,777 unvested
shares at original purchase prices ranging from $0.00 to
$2.50 per share.

The Company has assumed certain stock option
plans and the outstanding stock options of companies that it has
acquired (“Assumed Plans”). Stock options under the
Assumed Plans have been converted into the Company’s stock
options and adjusted to effect the appropriate conversion ratio
as specified by the applicable acquisition agreement, but are
otherwise administered in accordance with the terms of the
Assumed Plans. Stock options under the Assumed Plans generally
vest over four years and expire ten years from the date of
grant. No additional stock options will be granted under the
Assumed Plans.

The Company reserved 600,000 shares of common stock for
issuance under the 1999 ESPP. In May 2001, the Company approved

an automatic increase in the number of shares of common stock
available under the 1999 ESPP each June 1 and
December 1 to restore the number of shares available for
issuance to 1.5 million shares, provided that the aggregate
number of shares issuable under the 1999 ESPP shall not exceed
20.0 million. The 1999 ESPP allows participating employees
to purchase shares of common stock at a 15% discount from the
market value of the stock as determined on specific dates at
six-month intervals. As of December 31, 2002, approximately
$193,000 had been withheld from employees for future purchases

exercise or sale prices deemed to be less than the fair value of
the Company’s common stock on

and 2000, equity-related compensation includes
$18.1 million, $23.2 million and $10.0 million,
respectively, of deferred compensation amortization.
Equity-related compensation in the years ended December 31,
2002 and 2001 was affected by the following:

Exchange Offer

In April 2001, the Company communicated to its
employees an offer to exchange (the “Exchange Offer”)
certain eligible employee stock options previously granted to
them in return for restricted shares of Akamai common stock at
an exchange ratio of two stock options for one share of
restricted stock. In addition, certain stock options granted in
February 2001 were eligible to be exchanged at a ratio of one
stock option for two shares of restricted stock. Employees who
accepted the Exchange Offer were required to exchange any stock
option granted to them after November 3, 2000 (regardless
of the exercise price of any such stock option) and to forfeit
certain stock options granted to them in October 2000. Until the
restricted stock vests, such shares are subject to forfeiture
for up to three years from May 2001 in the event the employee
leaves the Company. Generally, 25% of the shares vested after
six months and the remaining 75% of the shares vest quarterly
thereafter until the third anniversary of the effective date of
the Exchange Offer. On April 4, 2001, the Company filed the
Exchange Offer as a tender offer with the Securities and
Exchange Commission in accordance with Rule 13e-4 of the
Securities Act of 1934, as amended. The Exchange Offer was
effective on May 5, 2001, and the Company accepted all
stock options tendered.

As a result of the Exchange Offer, stock options
to purchase approximately 6.6 million shares of Akamai
common stock were exchanged for approximately 3.4 million
shares of restricted stock. In accordance with FASB
Interpretation No. 44, “Accounting for Certain
Transactions Involving Stock Compensation (an Interpretation of
APB Opinion No. 25)” the Company recorded
$36.1 million as deferred compensation for the intrinsic
value of the restricted stock issued to employees who accepted
the Exchange Offer. The deferred compensation is being amortized
over the vesting period of the restricted stock. For the years
ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, $5.9 million and
$10.2 million, respectively, were amortized to
equity-related compensation. As of December 31, 2002,
1.3 million shares had been forfeited and retired as a
result of employee terminations, resulting in a reduction in
deferred compensation of $13.8 million.

Restricted Stock and Stock Option
    Awards

During the year ended December 31, 2002, the
Company issued 275,000 shares of restricted stock to
officers in exchange for the cancellation of previously issued
stock options. The Company recorded deferred compensation of
$278,000 for the intrinsic value of the restricted stock, which
will be amortized over the vesting period. The Company amortized
$26,000 to equity-related compensation for the year ended
December 31, 2002 for these awards. During the year ended
December 31, 2001, deferred compensation was increased by
$15.1 million as a result of the issuance of
2.2 million shares of restricted common stock at a purchase
price of $0.01 per share and the grant of options to
purchase 53,000 shares of common stock at an exercise
price of $1.17 per share. The deferred compensation will be
amortized over the vesting periods of the equity awards. For the
years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, $5.0 million
and $3.7 million, respectively, have been amortized to
equity-related compensation for these awards. As of
December 31, 2002, 821,000 shares had been repurchased
and retired by the Company as a result of employee terminations,
resulting in a reduction in deferred compensation of
approximately $1.4 million and $452,000 for the years ended
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

(b)     Equity Award
Modifications:

Equity-related compensation includes the
intrinsic value of modified stock options or restricted stock
awards that would have expired as unexercisable had the
associated vesting of the awards not been accelerated upon the
termination of the employee. For the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, equity-related

compensation includes $3.2 million,
$5.2 million and $13.8 million, respectively, for
equity award modifications.

(c)     Equity Bonus
Awards:

Equity-related compensation includes the
intrinsic value of equity awards issued to employees as
incentive bonuses. These awards are issued quarterly and
annually in accordance with incentive bonus plans. For the years
ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, equity-related
compensation includes $1.4 million, $3.1 million and
$2.3 million, respectively, for equity bonuses. Equity
bonuses in 2002 consisted of the grant of options to
purchase 1.4 million shares of common stock at a
weighted average exercise price of $0.47. Equity bonuses in 2001
consisted of the issuance of 284,000 shares of restricted
common stock at a purchase price of $0.01 per share and the
grant of options to purchase 175,000 shares of common
stock at a weighted average exercise price of $1.09. Equity
bonuses in 2000 consisted of the grant of options to
purchase 104,000 shares of common stock at a weighted
average exercise price of $5.13.

(d)     Equity Awards
Issued to Non-Employees:

The Company has issued equity awards to advisors
and other non-employees. The Company recognizes the fair value
of these awards in equity-related compensation over the vesting
period for the awards pursuant to the requirements of
SFAS No. 123. Amounts recorded in all years presented

acquired company. Prior period deferred tax assets and the
respective valuation allowance have been revised to reflect the
appropriate tax rates for the periods through the year ending

net operating loss carryforwards available for federal income
tax purposes relate to the exercises of non-qualified stock
options and disqualifying disposition of incentive stock options
and employee stock purchase plan options, the tax benefit from
which, if realized, will be credited to additional paid-in

19.

CNN Advertising Agreement:

In November 1999, InterVu, which was acquired by
Akamai in April 2000, entered into an advertising agreement with
the CNN News Group (“CNN”). Under the terms of such
agreement, InterVu issued common stock valued at
$20.0 million to CNN. In return, CNN agreed to provide
InterVu with three years of on-air and online advertising and
promotional opportunities across CNN’s properties. As part
of the purchase price allocation for its acquisition of InterVu,
Akamai estimated the fair value of these services to be
$18.4 million. This prepaid asset has been amortized over
the life of the advertising agreement to advertising expense in
the amounts of $5.6 million, $5.6 million and
$7.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2002,
2001 and 2000, respectively.

In connection with its acquisition of InterVu,
Akamai issued shares of its common stock to CNN in exchange for
shares of InterVu common stock held by CNN and assumed certain
obligations relating to such shares, including a guarantee that
the price of the shares of Akamai common stock would be above a
specified price on the third anniversary of the advertising
agreement. At the time of the acquisition of InterVu, the
Company estimated the fair value of the price guarantee and
included the estimated value of the guarantee in the purchase
price of InterVu. In November 2002, the Company satisfied the
price guarantee through a cash payment to CNN of
$2.7 million and by allowing CNN to draw on a
$3.8 million letter of credit. The $6.5 million
payment is considered a component of the purchase price of
InterVu and was accounted for as an adjustment, through a
reduction in additional paid-in capital, to the fair value of
the common stock issued.

20.

Segment Disclosure:

Akamai’s chief decision-maker, as defined
under SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures About Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information,” is the Chief

exchange for 10.0 million shares of Akamai common stock.
Akamai also issued options and warrants exercisable for
2.2 million shares of Akamai common stock in exchange for
all outstanding options and warrants exercisable for InterVu
common stock. The cost of the acquisition was $2.8 billion
based on the fair value of the consideration paid plus direct
acquisition costs. The excess cost over the fair value of net
assets acquired of $2.8 billion was allocated to goodwill
and other intangible assets. See Note 7 for further
discussion. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the
Company issued approximately 184,000 shares of common stock
to a former holder of InterVu preferred stock upon the exercise
of a conversion feature of the preferred stock. The fair value
of these additional shares had been included in the purchase
price of InterVu. Accordingly, no adjustment to the purchase
price was made upon the issuance of these shares. In addition,
in connection with the acquisition, the Company was required to
issue additional securities or cash to a former shareholder of
InterVu based on the future price of Akamai stock. In November
2002, the Company satisfied the price guarantee for
$6.5 million in cash (Note 19).

In July 2000, the Company acquired all of the
outstanding common and preferred stock of CallTheShots Inc.
(“CTS”), a developer of services that enable website
visitors to personalize their interaction with the sites they
visit, in exchange for 31,493 shares of Akamai common stock
and $259,000 in cash. In addition, 20,458 shares of Akamai
common stock and $434,000 in cash were placed in an escrow
account and were released over a one-year period to certain
former stockholders of CTS as they continued employment with
Akamai. The Company recorded equity-related compensation for the
escrowed shares in the amount of $1.7 million ratably over
the contingency period based on the fair value of Akamai common
stock on the closing date of the acquisition. The excess
purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired of
$4.2 million was assigned to goodwill and other intangible
assets. See Note 7 for further discussion.

22. Quarterly Financial Results
(unaudited):

The following table sets forth certain unaudited
quarterly results of operations of the Company for the years
ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. In the opinion of
management, this information has been prepared on the same basis
as the audited consolidated financial statements and all
necessary adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring
adjustments, have been included in the amounts stated below for
a fair presentation of the quarterly information when read in
conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements
and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on
Form 10-K. In 2002, the Company modified the presentation
of the consolidated statement of operations to include in cost
of revenue equity-related compensation expense, based on the
functional role of the related employee, and depreciation and
amortization on its network equipment. All quarterly amounts
presented below reflect this modification. In addition, in
accordance with SFAS No. 142, the Company discontinued the
amortization of goodwill as of January 1, 2002.

23. Subsequent Events

In June 2001, a former employee filed an
employment-related lawsuit with multiple claims against the
Company. The plaintiff sought monetary damages. In February
2003, the Company settled the matter for a sum of
$3.6 million, of which $1.8 million will be reimbursed
by the Company’s insurance carrier. As of December 31,
2002, the Company has included $3.6 million in accrued
expenses and $1.8 million in current assets and recorded
the net amount of $1.8 million as general and
administrative expenses.

Controls and Procedures

Within 90 days prior to the date of this

under the supervision and with the participation of our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of
the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely

our periodic SEC reports. In addition, we reviewed our internal
controls, and there have been no significant changes in our
internal controls or in other factors that could significantly
affect those controls subsequent to the date of their last
evaluation. It should be noted that a control system is based in
part upon certain assumptions and, no matter how well conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
