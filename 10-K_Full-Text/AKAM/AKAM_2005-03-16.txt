Overview

Akamai provides services for accelerating and improving the
delivery of content and business processes over the Internet.
Our solutions are designed to help businesses, government
agencies and other enterprises enhance their revenue streams and
reduce costs by maximizing the performance of their online
businesses. By enhancing the performance and reliability of
their websites, our customers can improve visitor experiences
and increase the effectiveness of Web-based campaigns and
operations. Through the Akamai EdgePlatform, the technological
platform of Akamai’s business solutions, our customers are
able to rely on Akamai’s infrastructure and reduce expenses
associated with internal infrastructure build-ups.

We began selling our content delivery services in 1999 under the
trade name FreeFlow®. Later that year, we added streaming
media delivery services to our portfolio and introduced traffic
management services that allow customers to monitor traffic
patterns on their websites both on a continual basis and for
specific events. In 2000, we began offering a software solution
that identifies the geographic location and network origin from
which end users access our customers’ websites, enabling
content providers to customize content without compromising user
privacy. In 2001, we commenced commercial sales of our
EdgeSuite® offering, a suite of services that allows for
high-performance and dynamic delivery of web content. In 2003,
we began offering on a commercial basis our EdgeComputing®
service, which allows for Web-based delivery of applications,
such as store/dealer locators, promotional contests, search
functionalities and user registration, over our network. In
2004, we packaged a number of services and specialized features
to tailor solutions to the needs of specific vertical market
segments such as media and entertainment, software downloads and
online commerce.

We were incorporated in Delaware in 1998 and have our corporate
headquarters at 8 Cambridge Center, Cambridge, Massachusetts,
02142. Our Internet website address is www.akamai.com. We are
not including the information contained on our website as part
of, or incorporating it by reference into, this annual report on

Meeting the Challenges of the Internet

The Internet has matured into a key tool for companies, public
sector agencies and other entities to conduct business and reach
the public. The Internet, however, is a complex system of
networks that was not originally created to accommodate the
volume or sophistication of today’s business communication
demands. As a result, information is frequently delayed or lost
on its way through the Internet due to many challenges,
including:

In addition to the challenges inherent in the Internet,
companies and other entities face internal technology
challenges. Driven by competition, globalization and
cost-containment strategies, companies need an agile
Internet-facing infrastructure that cost-effectively meets
real-time strategic and business objectives. As public sector
agencies migrate more and more of their processes from
in-person, mail, or phone services to Internet-based
applications, it has become essential that their websites be
more reliable and that they deliver their content and
applications more efficiently to their constituents. At the same
time, budget limitations may preclude public sector agencies
from developing their own infrastructure for Internet-facing
applications. Enterprises of all types are confronted with the
increasingly widespread use of broadband connectivity leading to
more users requesting more different types of rich content. As a
result, there is greater stress on centralized infrastructures.

Akamai meets these challenges in ways that are designed to help
companies and government agencies increase revenues and reduce
costs by improving the performance, reliability, and security of
their internet facing operations.

Superior Performance.

Customers seeking to remain
competitive and meet the challenges of globalization look to
Akamai’s EdgePlatform to reduce or eliminate downtime and
poor performance. Through a combination of people, processes and
technology, Akamai offers solutions designed to achieve
reliability, stability and predictability without the need for
our customers to spend a lot of money to develop their own
Internet-related infrastructure. Instead, we have a presence in
hundreds of networks around the world so that content can be
delivered from Akamai servers located closer to website
visitors — from what we call, the edge of the
Internet. We are thus able to reduce the impact of traffic
congestion, bandwidth constraints and capacity limitations. At
the same time, our customers have access to control features to
ensure that the content served to end users is current and is
delivered efficiently without the need for end users to traverse
the Internet to the origin server.

Scalability.

Many Akamai customers experience seasonal or
erratic demand for access to their websites. On a larger scale,
almost all websites experience demand peaks at different points
during the day. In both instances, it can be difficult and
expensive to plan for, and deploy solutions against, such peaks
and valleys. The Akamai EdgePlatform has the robustness and
flexibility to handle planned and unplanned peaks without
additional hardware investment and configuration on the part of
our customers. As a result, we are able to provide an on demand
solution to address our customers’ capacity needs in the
face of unpredictable traffic spikes, which helps them avoid
expensive over-investment in a centralized Internet-facing
infrastructure.

Security.

Security may be the most significant challenge
facing use of the Internet for business and government processes
today. That’s because security threats — in the
form of attacks, viruses, worms and intrusions — can
impact every measure of performance, including speed,
reliability, customer confidence and information security.
Unlike traditional security strategies that can impact
performance negatively, Akamai’s EdgePlatform is designed
to allow for proactive monitoring and rapid response to security
incidents and anomalies. We rely on both built-in defense
mechanisms and the ability to route traffic around potential
security issues so performance is not compromised.



The Akamai EdgePlatform

The EdgePlatform is the foundation of Akamai’s business
solutions. We believe Akamai has deployed the world’s
largest globally distributed computing platform, with more than
15,000 servers in 69 countries. To make this wide-reaching
deployment effective, the EdgePlatform includes specialized
technologies, such as advanced routing, load balancing, data
collection and monitoring. Through a combination of architecture
and services, Akamai’s EdgePlatform helps our customers
implement their Web strategy quickly, without adding equipment,
cost, or complexity to their existing information technology, or
IT, infrastructure.

The key to the EdgePlatform’s effectiveness is its use of a
distributed computing model in which both content and computing
applications are delivered across a system of widely distributed
networks of servers, and processed at the most efficient places
within the network. To implement this model, our servers are
deployed in more than 950 networks including large,
backbone network providers, medium and small ISPs, cable modem
and satellite providers, universities and other networks. We
also deploy our servers at smaller and medium-sized domestic and
international ISPs through our Akamai Accelerated Network
Program. Under this program, we offer use of our servers to
ISPs. In exchange, we typically do not pay for rack space to
house our servers or bandwidth to deliver content from our
servers to Internet users. By hosting our servers, ISPs gain
access to popular content from the Internet that is served from
our platform. As a result, when this content is requested by a
user, the ISP does not need to pay for the bandwidth otherwise
necessary to retrieve the content from the originating website.
We also have more than 500 peering relationships that provide us
with direct paths to end user networks, lowering latency and
packet loss, while also giving us more options for delivery
during network congestion or failures.

Our EdgePlatform components for content and application delivery
are designed so that sites download and run more quickly,
withstand security threats and reliably process applications and
deliver content to anywhere in the world. Our intelligent
routing software is designed to ensure that website visitors
experience fast page loading and content assembly wherever they
are on the Internet, regardless of global or local traffic
conditions. Customers are also able to control the extent of
their use of Akamai services to scale on demand, using as much
or as little capacity of the global platform as is required, to
support widely varying traffic and rapid e-business growth
without expensive and complex infrastructure build-out.

Our Solutions

With the EdgePlatform as our backbone, we offer services and
solutions for content and application delivery, application
performance services, on demand managed services and business
performance management services.

Content and Application Delivery Services

Akamai’s EdgeSuite service and related content delivery
offerings have represented the core of our business since our
founding. Leveraging the EdgePlatform, our EdgeSuite service is
designed to enable enterprises to improve the end-user
experience, boost reliability and scalability and reduce the
cost of their Internet-related infrastructure. By providing the
benefits of distributed performance to an enterprise’s
entire website and all aspects of its applications we are able
to provide our customers with a more efficient way to implement
and maintain a global Internet presence. While site owners
maintain a control copy of their applications and content,
EdgeSuite provides global delivery, load balancing and storage
of these applications and content, enabling businesses to focus
valuable resources on strategic matters, rather than technical
infrastructure issues.

Customers of our EdgeSuite service also have access to advanced
service features, such as:

•

Secure Content Distribution

— distribution of
    secure Internet-related content using Secure Sockets Layer
    transport, a protocol to secure transmittal of content over the
    Internet, to ensure that content is distributed privately and
    reliably between two communicating applications.

•

Site Failover

— delivery of default content in
    the event that the primary, or source, version of the website of
    an enterprise customer becomes unavailable.



Application Performance Services

Application performance services improve the performance of
highly dynamic content common on corporate extranets and wide
area networks. Traditionally, this market has been addressed
primarily by hardware and software products. We believe our
approach offers a more cost-effective and comprehensive solution
in this area without customers having to make significant
infrastructure investments.

One example of an Akamai application performance service is our
Web Application Accelerator service. A customer might use this
service to improve the operation of an online reservations
application. By tying such an application to the Akamai
EdgePlatform, a customer can enjoy high levels of performance
through connection and route optimization techniques that
dynamically avoid problem spots on the Internet.

In addition, our FirstPoint solution is designed to provide
application performance improvement for companies with mirrored
websites that require traffic management for multiple
application servers and databases. With the FirstPoint service,
enterprises and organizations with a geographically distributed
Web infrastructure can take advantage of real-time Internet
performance information to distribute incoming requests to an
optimal website.

On Demand Managed Services

Akamai’s on demand managed services, including Akamai
EdgeComputing and net storage offerings, enable enterprises to
dramatically reduce the need for an internal infrastructure to
handle unpredictable levels of Internet traffic. With access to
the EdgePlatform, customers are able to rapidly launch and
deploy new applications worldwide, with on demand availability
and scalability but on a cost-effective basis. For example,
Akamai On Demand Events provides an on demand platform for
running promotional websites — through Macromedia
Flash® promotions, site search, sweepstakes, polls,
regional offers or other innovative applications that create a
positive brand experience.

Akamai’s EdgeComputing service enables enterprises to
deliver Java (J2EE) Web applications that scale on demand and
perform faster and more reliably worldwide than if relying on
their internal IT infrastructures. At the same time, this
reduces the demands on their own IT infrastructures and
simplifies their support requirements. By enabling
Internet-based applications that improve promotion and sales,
customer service, and vendor and partner management, our
customers are better positioned to compete more effectively and
reduce business costs.

Our Akamai EdgeComputing Powered by IBM WebSphere® solution
enables enterprises to deploy Java-based software applications
over the Akamai network on a “pay-as-you-go” basis.
Our customers can extend applications built on IBM’s
WebSphere Internet infrastructure software to Akamai’s
distributed network of servers to handle everyday Web
application traffic and spikes in demand. Through Akamai’s
EdgeComputing services, specific application functions, such as
creating and viewing a personalized portal that provides access



to information for customers or suppliers, can now be securely
“pushed” to the edge of our network and executed
closer to the user.

Business Performance Management Services

Akamai’s offerings in this area include our network data
feeds and our Web analytics offering, which provide customers
with real time data about the performance of their content and
applications over the Internet and on the Edge Platform. In
addition, our business performance management services let
business managers better understand their Web operations through
relevant, timely information with tools that measure all aspects
of an application’s performance. For example, a customer
could use website data feeds from Akamai’s customer portal
to assist in managing costs and budget. The core of these
offerings lies in our
EdgeControl

sm

tools, which provide comprehensive reporting and management
capabilities.

EdgeControl tools can be integrated with existing enterprise
management systems, allowing our customers to manage their
distributed content and applications via a common interface.
EdgeControl also provides integration with third party network
management tools, including those offered by IBM,
Hewlett-Packard and BMC Software. Having created one of the
industry’s first examples of a commercially proven utility
computing platform, Akamai now provides a global network of
servers that can be utilized by a customer on demand, allowing
our customers to manage usage, troubleshooting, monitoring and
reporting, based on their individual business requirements.

Akamai Industry Solutions

Akamai’s industry solutions leverage capabilities from all
of our services offerings, but in a way that is specific to a
particular industry:

Akamai Online Commerce

is a secure, on demand business
solution that helps retailers more efficiently conduct
e-business transactions by meeting peak performance demands,
thereby delivering a positive customer experience and
facilitating transaction completion while reducing
infrastructure build-out costs.

Akamai Media Delivery

is designed to provide a solution
to the challenges of media delivery by helping media industry
clients to bypass traditional server and bandwidth limitations
to better handle peak traffic conditions and large file sizes.
This suite of services is particularly attractive for dynamic,
scalable delivery of music, movies and games.

Akamai Electronic Software Delivery

is a solution
designed to leverage the EdgePlatform to provide capacity for
the largest surges in traffic related to new software launches
with a goal of improved customer experiences, increased use of
electronic delivery and successful product launches, all at
lower costs than would be possible through self-provisioning.

Custom Solutions

In addition to our core commercial services, we are able to
leverage the expertise of our technology, networks and support
personnel to provide custom solutions to both commercial and
government customers. These solutions include replicating our
core technologies to facilitate content delivery behind the
firewall, combinations of our technology with that of other
providers to create unique solutions for specific customers and
support for mission critical applications that rely on the
Internet and intranets. Additionally, numerous federal
government agencies look to Akamai for information about traffic
conditions and activity on the Internet and tailored solutions
to their content delivery needs.

Business Segments and Geographic Information

We operate in one business segment: providing services for
accelerating delivery of content and business processes over the
Internet. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003,
approximately 19% and 16%, respectively, of revenue was derived
from our operations outside the United States, of which 14% and
13% of overall revenues, respectively, was derived from Europe.
For the year ended December 31, 2002, approximately 13% of
revenue was derived from our operations outside the United
States, of which 10% of overall



revenues was derived from Europe. No single country outside of
the United States accounted for 10% or more of our revenue.
Revenue from services accounted for 98%, 98% and 89% of our
total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively. For more segment and geographic
information, including revenues from customers, see our
consolidated financial statements included in this annual report
on Form 10-K, including Note 19 thereto.

Customers

Our customer base is centered on enterprises. As of
December 31, 2004, our customers included many of the
world’s leading corporations, including Airbus, Apple
Computer, Inc., Best Buy.com, Inc. FedEx Corporation,
L’Oreal, Microsoft Corporation, MTV Networks, Sony Ericsson
Mobile Communications and Victoria’s Secret. We also
actively sell to government agencies. As of December 31,
2004, our public sector customers included U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. Department of
Defense, U.S. Department of Labor, the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration, U.S. Army Recruitment, the
U.S. Geological Survey’s Earthquake Hazards Program
and the Voice of America. For the years ended December 31,
2004 and 2003, Microsoft Corporation accounted for 10% and 15%
of total revenue, respectively. No customer accounted for 10% or
more of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002.

Sales, Service and Marketing

Our sales and service professionals are located in nine offices
in the United States with additional locations in Europe and
Asia. We market and sell our services and solutions domestically
and internationally through our direct sales and services
organization and through more than 40 active resellers including
Electronic Data Systems Corporation, IBM, InterNap Network
Services Corporation, MCI and Telefonica Group. In addition to
entering into agreements with reseller partners, we have several
other types of sales- and marketing-focused alliances, with
entities such as system integrators, application service
providers, sales agents and referral partners. By aligning with
these companies, we are better able to market our services and
encourage increased adoption of our technology throughout the
industry.

Our sales and service organization includes employees in direct
and channel sales, professional services, account management and
technical consulting. As of December 31, 2004, we had
approximately 265 employees in our sales and support
organization, including 86 direct sales representatives whose
performance is measured on the basis of achievement of quota
objectives. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth in
the future will depend in large part on whether we successfully
recruit, train and retain sufficient direct sales, technical and
global services personnel, and how well we establish and
maintain relationships with our strategic partners. We believe
that the complexity of our services will continue to require a
number of highly trained global sales and services personnel.

To support our sales efforts and promote the Akamai brand, we
conduct comprehensive marketing programs. Our marketing
strategies include an active public relations campaign, print
advertisements, on-line advertisements, trade shows, strategic
partnerships and on-going customer communication programs. As of
December 31, 2004, we had 29 employees in our global
marketing organization.

Research and Development

Our research and development organization is continuously
enhancing and improving our existing services, strengthening our
network and creating new services in response to our
customers’ needs and market demand. As of December 31,
2004, we had approximately 164 employees in our research and
development organization, many of whom hold advanced degrees in
their field. Our research and development expenses were
$12.1 million, $13.0 million and $21.8 million
for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. In addition, for each of the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003, we capitalized
$7.5 million, net of impairments, of external consulting
and payroll and payroll-related costs related to the development
of internal-use software used to deliver our services and
operate our network. For the year ended December 31, 2002,
$6.0 million was capitalized.



Competition

The market for our services remains relatively new, intensely
competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology,
evolving industry standards and frequent new product and service
installations. We expect competition for our services to
increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants.
We compete primarily on the basis of:

We compete primarily with companies offering products and
services that address Internet performance problems, including
companies that provide Internet content delivery and hosting
services, streaming content delivery services and
equipment-based solutions to Internet performance problems, such
as load balancers and server switches. Some of these companies
resell our services. We also compete with companies that host
online conferences using proprietary conferencing applications.
Finally, potential customers may decide to purchase or develop
their own hardware, software and other technology solutions
rather than rely on an external provider like Akamai.

Proprietary Rights and Licensing

Our success and ability to compete are dependent on our ability
to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our
technology and operate without infringing on the proprietary
rights of others. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark,
trade secret and copyright laws and contractual restrictions to
protect the proprietary aspects of our technology. We currently
have numerous issued United States patents covering our content
delivery technology, and we have numerous additional patent
applications pending. Our issued patents extend to various dates
between approximately 2015 and 2020. In October 1998, we entered
into a license agreement with the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, or MIT, under which we were granted a royalty-free,
worldwide right to use and sublicense the intellectual property
rights of MIT under various patent applications and copyrights
relating to Internet content delivery technology. Two of these
patent applications have now been issued. These patents will
expire in 2018. We seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual
property by requiring employees and consultants with access to
our proprietary information to execute confidentiality
agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code.

Employees

As of December 31, 2004, we had a total of
605 full-time and part-time employees. Our future success
will depend in part on our ability to attract, retain and
motivate highly qualified technical and management personnel for
whom competition is intense. Our employees are not represented
by any collective bargaining unit. We believe our relations with
our employees are good.

Factors Affecting Future Operating Results

The following are certain of the important factors that could
cause our actual operating results to differ materially from
those indicated or suggested by forward-looking statements made
in this annual report on Form 10-K or presented elsewhere
by management from time to time.



The markets in which we operate are highly competitive,
    and we may be unable to compete successfully against new
    entrants and established companies with greater
    resources.

We compete in markets that are new, intensely competitive,
highly fragmented and rapidly changing. We have experienced and
expect to continue to experience increased competition. Many of
our current competitors, as well as a number of our potential
competitors, have longer operating histories, greater name
recognition, broader customer relationships and industry
alliances and substantially greater financial, technical and
marketing resources than we do. Other competitors may attract
customers by offering services that may be perceived as less
sophisticated versions of our services at lower prices than
those we charge. Our competitors may be able to respond more
quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes
in customer requirements. Some of our current or potential
competitors may bundle their services with other services,
software or hardware in a manner that may discourage website
owners from purchasing any service we offer or Internet service
providers from installing our servers. In addition, potential
customers may decide to purchase or develop their own hardware,
software and other technology solutions rather than rely on an
external provider like Akamai. Increased competition could
result in price and revenue reductions, loss of customers and
loss of market share, which could materially and adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

If the prices we charge for our services decline over
    time, our business and financial results are likely to
    suffer.

Prices we have been charging for some of our services have
declined in recent years. We expect that this decline may
continue in the future as a result of, among other things,
existing and new competition in the markets we serve.
Consequently, our historical revenue rates may not be indicative
of future revenues based on comparable traffic volumes. If we
are unable to sell our services at acceptable prices relative to
our costs or if we are unsuccessful with our strategy of selling
additional services and features to our existing EdgeSuite
delivery customers, our revenues and gross margins will
decrease, and our business and financial results will suffer.

Failure to increase our revenues and keep our expenses
    consistent with revenues could prevent us from maintaining
    profitability.

The year ended December 31, 2004 was the first fiscal year
during which we achieved profitability as measured in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. We have large fixed expenses, and we expect
to continue to incur significant bandwidth, sales and marketing,
product development, administrative, interest and other
expenses. Therefore, we will need to generate higher revenues to
maintain profitability. There are numerous factors that could,
alone or in combination with other factors, impede our ability
to increase revenues and/or moderate expenses, including:



•

failure of a significant number of customers to pay our fees on
    a timely basis or at all or failure to continue to purchase our
    services in accordance with their contractual
    commitments; and

•

inability to attract high-quality customers to purchase and
    implement our current and planned services and software.

If we are unable to develop new services and enhancements
    to existing services, and if we fail to predict and respond to
    emerging technological trends and customers’ changing
    needs, our operating results may suffer.

The market for our services is characterized by rapidly changing
technology, evolving industry standards and new product and
service introductions. Our operating results depend on our
ability to develop and introduce new services into existing and
emerging markets. The process of developing new technology is
complex and uncertain, and if we fail to accurately predict
customers’ changing needs and emerging technological
trends, our business could be harmed. We must commit significant
resources to developing new services or enhancements to our
existing services before knowing whether our investments will
result in services the market will accept. In addition, in an
effort to control expenses, our spending on research and
development decreased over the past three years. Furthermore, we
may not execute successfully our technology initiatives because
of errors in planning or timing, technical hurdles that we fail
to overcome in a timely fashion, or a lack of appropriate
resources. Failures in execution or market acceptance of new
services we introduce could result in competitors providing
those solutions before we do and loss of market share, revenues
and earnings.

Our substantial leverage may impair our ability to
    maintain and grow operations, and any failure to meet our
    repayment obligations would damage our business.

We have long-term debt. As of December 31, 2004, our total
long-term debt was approximately $256.6 million, of which
$56.6 million is due on June 30, 2007, and our
stockholders’ deficit was approximately
$125.9 million. Our level of indebtedness could adversely
affect our future operations by increasing our vulnerability to
adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions and
by limiting or prohibiting our ability to obtain additional
financing for future capital expenditures, acquisitions and
general corporate and other purposes. In addition, if we are
unable to make interest or principal payments when due, we would
be in default under the terms of our loans, which would result
in all principal and interest becoming due and payable which, in
turn, would seriously harm our business.

Any unplanned interruption in our network or services
    could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could
    reduce our revenues and harm our business, financial results and
    reputation.

Our business is dependent on providing our customers with fast,
efficient and reliable distribution of application and content
delivery services over the Internet. For our core services, we
currently provide a standard guarantee that our networks will
deliver Internet content 24 hours a day, seven days a week,
365 days a year. If we do not meet this standard, our
customer does not pay for all or a part of its services on that
day. Our network or services could be disrupted by numerous
events, including natural disasters, failure or refusal of our
third-party network providers to provide the necessary capacity,
power losses, and intentional disruptions of our services, such
as disruptions caused by software viruses or attacks by
unauthorized users. For example, approximately four percent of
our customers experienced a brief delay in delivery of services
on June 15, 2004 as a result of a denial of service
resulting from an attack by hackers on our network. We believe
this attack targeted several well-known websites that are
customers of Akamai. Although we have taken steps to enhance our
ability to prevent the recurrence of such an incident, there can
be no assurance that similar attacks will not be attempted in
the future, that our enhanced security measures will be
effective or that a successful attack would not be more
damaging. Any widespread loss or interruption of our network or
services would reduce our revenues and could harm our business,
financial results and reputation.



We may have insufficient transmission capacity, which
    could result in interruptions in our services and loss of
    revenues.

Our operations are dependent in part upon transmission capacity
provided by third-party telecommunications network providers. We
believe that we have access to adequate capacity to provide our
services; however, there can be no assurance that we are
adequately prepared for unexpected increases in bandwidth
demands by our customers. In addition, the bandwidth we have
contracted to purchase may become unavailable for a variety of
reasons. For example, a number of these network providers are
operating under the protection of the federal bankruptcy laws.
As a result, there is uncertainty about whether such providers,
or others that enter into bankruptcy, will be able to continue
to provide services to us. Any failure of these network
providers to provide the capacity we require, due to financial
or other reasons, may result in a reduction in, or interruption
of, service to our customers. If we do not have access to
third-party transmission capacity, we could lose customers. If
we are unable to obtain transmission capacity on terms
commercially acceptable to us or at all, our business and
financial results could suffer. In addition, our
telecommunications and network providers typically provide rack
space for our servers. Damage or destruction of, or other denial
of access to, a facility where our servers are housed could
result in a reduction in, or interruption of, service to our
customers.

Because our services are complex and are deployed in
    complex environments, they may have errors or defects that could
    seriously harm our business.

Our services are highly complex and are designed to be deployed
in and across numerous large and complex networks. From time to
time, we have needed to correct errors and defects in our
software. In the future, there may be additional errors and
defects in our software that may adversely affect our services.
We may not have in place adequate quality assurance procedures
to ensure that we detect errors in our software in a timely
manner. If we are unable to efficiently fix errors or other
problems that may be identified, or if there are unidentified
errors that allow persons to improperly access our services, we
could experience loss of revenues and market share, damage to
our reputation, increased expenses and legal actions by our
customers.

Our proposed acquisition of Speedera Networks, Inc. may
    fail to close or there could be substantial delays before the
    merger is completed.

On March 16, 2005, we entered into an agreement and plan of
merger providing for our acquisition of Speedera, Networks,
Inc., or Speedera, in exchange for the issuance of approximately
12 million shares of our common stock. Closing of the
merger is subject to regulatory approval, as well as the
approval of Speedera’s stockholders. The process of
obtaining such approval could be expensive and time-consuming.
If we are unable to obtain, or are significantly delayed in
obtaining, such approvals or are otherwise unable to complete
the merger, we would have devoted substantial resources and
management attention without any accompanying benefit. In such
an event, our financial condition and results of operations
could be materially adversely affected.

As part of our business strategy, we have entered into and
    may enter into or seek to enter into business combinations and
    acquisitions that may be difficult to integrate, disrupt our
    business, dilute stockholder value or divert management
    attention.

We have made acquisitions of other companies in the past and may
enter into business combinations and acquisitions in addition to
the proposed Speedera acquisition in the future. Acquisitions
are typically accompanied by a number of risks, including the
difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the
acquired companies, the potential disruption of our ongoing
business, the potential distraction of management, expenses
related to the acquisition and potential unknown liabilities
associated with acquired businesses. We face all of these risks
in connection with the proposed Speedera acquisition. If we are
not successful in completing acquisitions that we may pursue in
the future, we may be required to reevaluate our business
strategy, and we may incur substantial expenses and devote
significant management time and resources without a productive
result. In addition, with future acquisitions, we could use
substantial portions of our available cash or, as in the
proposed Speedera merger transaction, make dilutive issuances of
securities. Future acquisitions or attempted acquisitions could
also have an adverse effect on our ability to remain profitable.



If the estimates we make, and the assumptions on which we
    rely, in preparing our financial statements prove inaccurate,
    our actual results may be adversely affected.

Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. The preparation of these financial statements requires
us to make estimates and judgments about, among other things,
taxes, revenue recognition, capitalization of internal-use
software, contingent obligations, doubtful accounts and
restructuring charges, among other things. These estimates and
judgments affect the reported amounts of our assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, the amounts of charges
accrued by us, such as those made in connection with our
restructuring charges, and related disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to
be reasonable under the circumstances. If our estimates or the
assumptions underlying them are not correct, we may need to
accrue additional charges that could adversely affect our
results of operations, which in turn could adversely affect our
stock price.

If our license agreement with MIT terminates, our business
    could be adversely affected.

We have licensed technology from MIT covered by various patents,
patent applications and copyrights relating to Internet content
delivery technology. Some of our core technology is based in
part on the technology covered by these patents, patent
applications and copyrights. Our license is effective for the
life of the patents and patent applications; however, under
limited circumstances, such as a cessation of our operations due
to our insolvency or our material breach of the terms of the
license agreement, MIT has the right to terminate our license. A
termination of our license agreement with MIT could have a
material adverse effect on our business.

We have incurred and could continue to incur substantial
    costs defending our intellectual property from infringement
    claims.

Other companies or individuals, including our competitors, may
obtain patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent,
limit or interfere with our ability to make, use or sell our
services. Companies providing Internet-related products and
services are increasingly bringing suits alleging infringement
of their proprietary rights, particularly patent rights. We have
been named as a defendant in several lawsuits alleging that we
have violated other companies’ intellectual property
rights. Any litigation or claims, whether or not valid, could
result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and
require us to do one or more of the following:

If we are forced to take any of these actions, our business may
be seriously harmed. In the event of a successful claim of
infringement against us and our failure or inability to obtain a
license to the infringed technology, our business and operating
results could be materially adversely affected.

Our business will be adversely affected if we are unable
    to protect our intellectual property rights from third-party
    challenges.

We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and
trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our
intellectual property rights. We have brought numerous lawsuits
against entities that we believe are infringing on our
intellectual property rights. These legal protections afford
only limited protection. Monitoring unauthorized use of our
services is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we
have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology,
particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect
our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States.
Although we have licensed from other parties proprietary
technology covered by patents, we cannot be certain that any
such patents will not be



challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Furthermore, we cannot
be certain that any pending or future patent applications will
be granted, that any future patent will not be challenged,
invalidated or circumvented, or that rights granted under any
patent that may be issued will provide competitive advantages to
us.

If we are unable to retain our key employees and hire
    qualified sales and technical personnel, our ability to compete
    could be harmed.

Our future success depends upon the continued services of our
executive officers and other key technology, sales, marketing
and support personnel who have critical industry experience and
relationships that they rely on in implementing our business
plan. None of our officers or key employees is bound by an
employment agreement for any specific term. We have a “key
person” life insurance policy covering only the life of F.
Thomson Leighton, our Chief Scientist and a member of our Board
of Directors. The loss of the services of any of our key
employees could delay the development and introduction of and
negatively impact our ability to sell our services.

We face risks associated with international operations
    that could harm our business.

We have operations in several foreign countries and may continue
to expand our sales and support organizations internationally.
Such expansion could require us to make significant
expenditures. We are increasingly subject to a number of risks
associated with international business activities that may
increase our costs, lengthen our sales cycle and require
significant management attention. These risks include:

If we are required to seek additional funding, such
    funding may not be available on acceptable terms or at
    all.

If our revenues decrease or grow more slowly than we anticipate
or if our operating expenses increase more than we expect or
cannot be reduced in the event of lower revenues, we may need to
obtain funding from outside sources. If we are unable to obtain
this funding, our business would be materially and adversely
affected. In addition, even if we were to find outside funding
sources, we might be required to issue securities with greater
rights than the securities we have outstanding today. We might
also be required to take other actions that could lessen the
value of our common stock, including borrowing money on terms
that are not favorable to us, if at all.

Internet-related and other laws could adversely affect our
    business.

Laws and regulations that apply to communications and commerce
over the Internet are becoming more prevalent. In particular,
the growth and development of the market for online commerce has
prompted calls for more stringent tax, consumer protection and
privacy laws, both in the United States and abroad, that may
impose additional burdens on companies conducting business
online. This could negatively affect the businesses of our
customers and reduce their demand for our services. Tax laws
that might apply to our



servers, which are located in many different jurisdictions,
could require us to pay additional taxes that would adversely
affect our continued profitability. Internet-related laws,
however, remain largely unsettled, even in areas where there has
been some legislative action. The adoption or modification of
laws or regulations relating to the Internet or our operations,
or interpretations of existing law, could adversely affect our
business.

Provisions of our charter documents, our stockholder
    rights plan and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that
    could prevent a change in control even if the change in control
    would be beneficial to our stockholders.

Provisions of our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation, by-laws and Delaware law could make it more
difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so
would be beneficial to our stockholders. In addition, our Board
of Directors has adopted a shareholder rights plan the
provisions of which could make it more difficult for a potential
acquirer of Akamai to consummate an acquisition transaction
without the approval of our Board of Directors.

A class action lawsuit has been filed against us that may
    be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain and
    may harm our business.

We are named as a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit
filed in 2001 alleging that the underwriters of our initial
public offering received undisclosed compensation in connection
with our initial public offering of common stock in violation of
the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, which we refer to as the Exchange Act. Any conclusion
of these matters in a manner adverse to us could have a material
adverse affect on our financial position and results of
operations.

We may become involved in other litigation that may
    adversely affect us.

In the ordinary course of business, we may become involved in
litigation, administrative proceedings and governmental
proceedings. Such matters can be time-consuming, divert
management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur
significant expenses. Furthermore, there can be no assurance
that the results of any of these actions will not have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
or financial condition.

Item 2.

Properties

Our headquarters are located in approximately 89,000 square
feet of leased office space in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Our
primary west coast office is located in approximately
25,000 square feet of leased office space in
San Mateo, California. We maintain offices in several other
locations in the United States, including in or near each of Los
Angeles, California; Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; New
York, New York; Dallas, Texas; Reston, Virginia and Seattle,
Washington. We also maintain offices in Europe and Asia in or
near the following cities: Munich, Germany; Paris, France;
London, England; Tokyo, Japan; Singapore; Madrid, Spain; and
Sydney, Australia. All of our facilities are leased. We believe
our facilities are sufficient to meet our needs for the
foreseeable future and, if needed, additional space will be
available at a reasonable cost.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

We are subject to legal proceedings, claims and litigation
arising in the ordinary course of business. We do not expect the
ultimate costs to resolve these matters to have a material
adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results
of operations or cash flows.

Between July 2, 2001 and November 7, 2001, purported
class action lawsuits seeking monetary damages were filed in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York against us as well as against the underwriters of our
October 28, 1999 initial public offering of common stock.
The complaints were filed allegedly on behalf of persons who
purchased our common stock during different time periods, all
beginning on October 28, 1999 and ending on various dates.
The complaints are similar and allege violations of the
Securities Act of 1933 and the Exchange Act primarily based on
the allegation that the underwriters received undisclosed
compensation in connection with our initial public offering. On
April 19, 2002, a single



consolidated amended complaint was filed, reiterating in one
pleading the allegations contained in the previously filed
separate actions. The consolidated amended complaint defines the
alleged class period as October 28, 1999 through
December 6, 2000. A Special Litigation Committee of
Akamai’s Board of Directors authorized management to
negotiate a settlement of the pending claims substantially
consistent with a Memorandum of Understanding that was
negotiated among class plaintiffs, all issuer defendants and
their insurers. The parties negotiated a settlement which is
subject to approval by the Court. On February 15, 2005, the
Court issued an Opinion and Order preliminarily approving the
settlement, provided that the defendants and plaintiffs agree to
a modification narrowing the scope of the bar order set forth in
the original settlement agreement. We believe that we have
meritorious defenses to the claims made in the complaint and, if
the settlement is not finalized and approved, we intend to
contest the lawsuit vigorously. An adverse resolution of the
action could have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operations in the period in which the
lawsuit is resolved. We are not presently able to estimate
potential losses, if any, related to this lawsuit.

In February 2002, we filed suit against Speedera Networks, Inc.,
or Speedera, in federal court in Massachusetts, alleging patent
infringement and false advertising by Speedera. In April 2003,
we amended our complaint to include an allegation that Speedera
infringes a newly-issued content delivery patent held by MIT and
licensed to Akamai. In response, Speedera filed a counterclaim
in this case alleging that Akamai has infringed a Speedera
patent relating to the combined provision of traffic management
and content delivery services. In June 2004, Speedera amended
its counterclaim to include a second patent covering a similar
service it offers. We are not presently able to reasonably
estimate potential losses, if any, related to this counterclaim.
We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims made
in the counterclaim and intend to contest them vigorously;
however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful.
We are not presently able to reasonably estimate potential
losses, if any, related to this counterclaim.

In June 2002, we filed suit against Speedera in California
Superior Court alleging theft of Akamai trade secrets from an
independent company that provides website performance testing
services. In connection with this suit, in September 2002, the
Court issued a preliminary injunction to restrain Speedera from
continuing to access our confidential information from the
independent company’s database and from using any data
obtained from such access. In October 2002, Speedera filed a
cross-claim against us seeking monetary damages and injunctive
relief and alleging that we engaged in various unfair trade
practices, made false and misleading statements and engaged in
unfair competition. A trial date has been set for April 18,
2005. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims
made in Speedera’s cross-claim and intend to contest the
allegations vigorously; however, there can be no assurance that
we will be successful. We are not presently able to reasonably
estimate potential losses, if any, related to this cross-claim.

In November 2002, we filed suit against Speedera in federal
court in Massachusetts for infringement of a patent held by
Akamai. In January 2003, Speedera filed a counterclaim in this
case alleging that Akamai has infringed a patent held by
Speedera. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the
claims made in the counterclaim and intend to contest them
vigorously; however, there can be no assurance that we will be
successful. We are not presently able to reasonably estimate
potential losses, if any, related to this counterclaim.

On March 16, 2005, we entered into an agreement and plan of
merger providing for our acquisition of Speedera. Under the
terms of the agreement, all litigation between Akamai and
Speedera was immediately stayed. Upon the closing of the merger,
all such lawsuits would be dismissed.

Item 5.

Market For Registrant’s Common Equity and Related
    Stockholder Matters

Our common stock trades under the symbol “AKAM.” From
the time that public trading of our common stock commenced on
October 29, 1999 until September 3, 2002 and since
May 5, 2003, our common stock was listed on The NASDAQ
National Market. Our common stock was listed on The NASDAQ
SmallCap Market between September 3, 2002 and May 2,
2003. Prior to October 29, 1999, there was no public market
for our common stock. The following table sets forth, for the
periods indicated, the high and low sale price per share of the
common stock on The NASDAQ National Market and The NASDAQ
SmallCap Market, as applicable:

As of March 5, 2005, there were 547 holders of record of
our common stock.

We have never paid or declared any cash dividends on shares of
our common stock or other securities and do not anticipate
paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We
currently intend to retain all future earnings, if any, for use
in the operation of our business.

Item 6.

Selected Financial Data

The following selected consolidated financial data should be
read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements
and related notes and with “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” and other financial data included elsewhere in
this annual report on Form 10-K. The consolidated statement
of operations data and balance sheet data for all periods
presented is derived from audited consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this annual report on
Form 10-K or on file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. In 2002, the Company modified the presentation of
the consolidated statement of operations to include in cost of
revenue equity-related compensation expense, based on the
functional role of the related employee, and depreciation and
amortization on its network equipment.

We acquired several businesses in 2000 that were recorded under
the purchase method of accounting. We allocated $3 billion
of the cost of these acquisitions to goodwill and other
intangible assets. As a result, loss from operations for the
year ended December 31, 2001 includes $255.8 million
for the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets
related to these acquisitions. In 2001, loss from operations
includes a $1.9 billion impairment of goodwill. On
January 1, 2002, in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets,” we discontinued the amortization
of goodwill and reclassified our assembled workforce of
$1.0 million to goodwill. Loss from



continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2002
and 2001 includes restructuring charges of $45.8 million
and $40.5 million, respectively, for actual and estimated
termination and modification costs related to non-cancelable
facility leases and employee severance. Loss from continuing
operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 includes a
restructuring credit of $8.5 million for the reversal of
previously accrued restructuring liabilities and loss on early
extinguishment of debt of $2.1 million. Income from
continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2004
includes a loss on early extinguishment of debt of
$6.8 million.



Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

We primarily derive revenue from the sale of Akamai services to
customers executing contracts having terms of one year or
longer, which we refer to as recurring revenue contracts or
long-term contracts. These contracts generally commit the
customer to a minimum monthly level of usage with additional
charges applicable for actual usage above the monthly minimum.
Having a consistent and predictable base level of revenue is
important to our financial success. Accordingly, to be
successful, we must maintain our base of recurring revenue
contracts by eliminating or reducing lost monthly recurring
revenue due to customer cancellations or terminations and build
on that base by adding new customers and increasing the number
of services, features and functions our customers purchase. At
the same time, we must ensure that our expenses do not increase
at the same rate as our revenue. Accomplishing these goals
requires that we compete effectively in the marketplace on the
basis of price, quality and the attractiveness of our services
and technology. See “Factors Affecting Future Operating
Results” elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Our improved financial results in 2004 as compared to 2003 and
2002 reflect our improvements in our ability to increase our
monthly recurring revenue while reducing the expenses needed to
support such growth. The following sets forth, as a percentage
of revenue, consolidated statements of operations data for the
years indicated:

We were profitable during the year ended December 31, 2004,
the first full fiscal year during which we had net income. We
have observed the following trends and events that are likely to
have an impact on our financial condition and results of
operations in the future:

•

During each quarter in 2004, the dollar volume of the recurring
    revenue contracts that we booked exceeded the dollar volume of
    the contracts we lost through cancellations, terminations and
    non-payment. A continuation of this trend would lead to
    increased revenues.

•

During 2004, one customer, Microsoft Corporation, accounted for
    10% of our total revenues. We expect to continue to do business
    with Microsoft; however, we do not expect that revenues from
    Microsoft will be more than 10% of our total revenues in 2005.
    As our customer base continues to grow, we expect our customer
    concentration levels to decline.



Based on our analysis of the aforementioned known trends and
events, we expect to continue to generate net income on a
quarterly basis during 2005; however, our future results will be
affected by many factors identified below and in the section of
this report entitled “Factors Affecting Future Operating
Results,” including our ability to:

•

increase our revenue by adding customers through long-term
    contracts and limiting customer cancellations and terminations;

•

maintain the prices we charge for our services;

•

prevent disruptions to our services and network due to accidents
    or intentional attacks; and



•

maintain our network bandwidth costs and other operating
    expenses consistent with our revenues.

As a result, there is no assurance that we will achieve our
expected financial objectives.

Recent Events

On March 16, 2005, we entered into an agreement to acquire
all of the outstanding common and preferred stock, including
vested and unvested stock options, of Speedera by issuing
approximately 12 million shares of our common stock, valued
at approximately $130 million based on the closing stock
price of our common stock on the NASDAQ National Market on
March 15, 2005. The acquisition is expected to be accounted
for by us under the purchase method of accounting and is
expected to close during the quarter ended June 30, 2005,
subject to various regulatory approvals. The merger agreement
provides for a stay of all existing litigation between Speedera
and us until the closing of the merger or any earlier
termination of the merger agreement. Upon the closing, all
lawsuits between Speedera and us would be released.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Overview

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America which require us to make estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and
expenses, cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities. Our estimates include those related to revenue
recognition, accounts receivable reserves, investments,
capitalized internal-use software costs, intangible assets,
income and other taxes, useful lives of property and equipment,
restructuring accruals and contingent obligations. We base our
estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the
circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
For a complete description of our significant accounting
policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial
statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Definitions

We define our “critical accounting policies” as those
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America that require us to make highly judgemental estimates
about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a
material impact on our financial position and results of
operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply
those principles. Our estimates are based upon assumptions and
judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time
the accounting estimate is made and requires us to continually
assess a range of potential outcomes.

Review of Critical Accounting Policies and
    Estimates

Revenue Recognition:

At the inception of a customer contract for service, we make an
estimate as to that customer’s ability to pay for the
services provided. We base our estimate on the successful
completion of a credit check, financial review, the receipt of a
deposit from the customer and our payment history with the
customer. Upon the completion of these steps, we recognize
revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue recognition
policy. If we subsequently determine that collection from the
customer is not reasonably assured, we record an allowance for
doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all unpaid invoices
to that customer and cease recognizing revenue for continued
services provided until cash is received. Changes in our
estimates and judgments of whether collection is reasonably
assured would change the timing of revenue or amount of bad debt
expense that we recognize.

We primarily derive revenue from the sale of services to
customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer.
These contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum
monthly level of usage and provide the rate at which the
customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly minimum.
For these



services, we recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each month
provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both
parties, the service has been delivered to the customer, the fee
for the service is fixed or determinable and collection is
reasonably assured. Should a customer’s usage exceed the
monthly minimum, we recognize revenue for that excess in the
period of the usage. We typically charge the customer an
installation fee when the services are first activated. The
installation fees are recorded as deferred revenue and
recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated life of the
customer arrangement. We also derive revenue from services sold
as discrete events or based solely on usage. For these services,
we recognize revenue after an enforceable contract has been
signed by both parties, the fee is fixed or determinable, the
event or usage has occurred and collection is reasonably assured.

We periodically enter into multi-element service arrangements.
When we enter into such arrangements, each element is accounted
for separately over its respective service period, provided that
there is objective evidence of fair value for the separate
elements. For example, objective evidence of fair value would
include the price charged for the element when sold separately.
If the fair value of each element cannot be objectively
determined, the total value of the arrangement is recognized
ratably over the entire service period. For most multi-element
service arrangements to date, the fair value of each element has
not been objectively determinable. Therefore, all revenue under
these arrangements has been recognized ratably over the related
service period.

We license software under perpetual and term license agreements.
We apply the provisions of Statement of Position
(“SOP”) 97-2, “Software Revenue
Recognition,” as amended by SOP 98-9,
“Modifications of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue
Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions.” As
prescribed by this guidance, we apply the residual method of
accounting. The residual method requires that the portion of the
total arrangement fee attributable to undelivered elements, as
indicated by vendor specific objective evidence of fair value,
is deferred and subsequently recognized in accordance with
SOP 97-2. The difference between the total arrangement fee
and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is
recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements, if all
other revenue recognition criteria of SOP 97-2 are met.

We also sell our services through a reseller channel. Assuming
all other revenue recognition criteria are met, we recognize
revenue from reseller arrangements based on the reseller’s
contracted non-refundable minimum purchase commitments over the
term of the contract, plus amounts sold by the reseller to its
customers in excess of the minimum commitments.

We recognize revenue from fixed-fee arrangements and software
arrangements that require significant customization or
modification using the percentage-of-completion method in
accordance with Accounting Research Bulletin (“ARB”)
No. 45, “Long-Term Construction-Type Contracts,”
and with the applicable guidance provided by SOP 81-1,
“Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and
Certain Production-Type Contracts.” We generally recognize
revenue under these arrangements based on the percentage of cost
incurred to date compared to the estimated total cost to
complete the project. In certain customer arrangements, we
recognize revenue based on the progress made towards achieving
milestones under the contract. The impact of any change in
estimate is recorded prospectively from the date of the change.
At the outset of a fixed-fee arrangement, if we are not able to
estimate the total cost-to-complete, nor able to measure
progress towards the achievement of contract milestones, we
account for the arrangement using the completed-contract method
of accounting. Under this method, we recognize revenue when the
contract is complete and there are no remaining costs or
deliverables. In the event that the estimated total cost on a
fixed-fee contract indicates a loss, we will record the loss
immediately.

Deferred revenue includes amounts billed to customers for which
revenue has not been recognized. Deferred revenue primarily
consists of the unearned portion of monthly billed service fees;
deferred installation and activation set-up fees; amounts billed
under extended payment terms; and maintenance and support fees
charged under license arrangements.

Accounts Receivable and Related Reserves:

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts
and do not bear interest. In addition to trade accounts
receivable, our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled
accounts that represent revenue



recorded for customers that is typically billed within one
month. We record reserves against our accounts receivable
balance. These reserves consist of allowances for doubtful
accounts, cash basis customers and service credits. Increases
and decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are
included as a component of general and administrative expenses.
The reserve for cash basis customers increases as services are
provided to customers where collection is no longer assured. The
reserve decreases and revenue is recognized when and if cash
payments are received. The reserve for service credits increases
as a result of specific service credits that are expected to be
issued to customers during the ordinary course of business, as
well as for billing disputes. These credits result in a
reduction to revenues. Decreases to the reserve are the result
of actual credits being issued to customers which have a
corresponding reduction to accounts receivable.

Estimates are used in determining these reserves and are based
upon our review of outstanding balances on a customer-specific,
account-by-account basis. The allowance for doubtful accounts is
based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales
with collection issues where we no longer believe that the
customer has the ability to pay for prior services provided. We
perform on-going credit evaluations of our customers. If such an
evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably
assured for current services provided, any future services
provided to that customer will result in creation of a reserve
until we receive consistent payments. We evaluate customer
receivable balances and reserves on a monthly basis. In
addition, we reserve a portion of revenues as a reserve for
service credits. Reserves for service credits are measured based
on an analysis of revenue credits to be issued after the month
of billing and an estimate for future credits. These credits
typically relate to management’s estimate of the resolution
of customer disputes and billing adjustments. We do not have any
off-balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers.

Concurrent Transactions:

From time to time, we enter into contracts to sell our services
or license our technology with unrelated companies at or about
the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or
services from the same companies. If we conclude that these
contracts were negotiated concurrently, we record as revenue
only the net cash received from the vendor, unless both the fair
values of our services delivered to the customer and of the
vendor’s product or service we receive can be established
objectively and realization of such value is believed to be
probable.

Investments:

We periodically review all investments for reduction in fair
value that is other-than-temporary. We consider several factors
that may trigger an other-than-temporary decline in value, such
as the length of time the investment’s value has been below
carrying value and the financial results of the entity in which
we invest. When we conclude that the reduction is
other-than-temporary, the carrying value of the investment is
adjusted to its fair value through a charge to loss on
investments on the consolidated statement of operations. Changes
in our judgment as to whether a reduction in the value of an
investment is other-than-temporary could increase loss on
investments.

Impairment and Useful Lives of Long-Lived Assets:

We review our long-lived assets, such as fixed assets and
intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets
may not be recoverable. Events that would trigger an impairment
review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted
negative cash flows related to the asset. When such a triggering
event occurs, we compare the carrying amount of the long-lived
asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to
the asset. If the carrying amount is greater than the sum of the
undiscounted cash flows, we adjust the asset to its fair value
through an impairment charge included in loss from operations.
We determine fair value based upon a quoted market price or a
discounted cash flow analysis. The estimates required to apply
this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the
long-lived assets and the useful lives of these assets and
expected future cash flows. Changes in these estimates could
materially impact results from operations.



Restructuring Liabilities Related to Facility Leases:

When we vacate a facility subject to a non-cancelable long-term
lease, we record a restructuring liability for either the
estimated costs to terminate the lease or the estimated costs
that will continue to be incurred under the lease for its
remaining term where there is no economic benefit to us. In the
latter case, we measure the amount of the restructuring
liability as the amount of contractual future lease payments
reduced by an estimate of sublease income. To date, we have
recorded a restructuring liability when our management approves
and commits us to a plan to terminate a lease, the plan
specifically identifies the actions to be taken, and the actions
are scheduled to begin soon after management approves the plan.
Beginning in 2003, in accordance with SFAS No. 146,
“Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities,” we record restructuring liabilities,
discounted at the appropriate rate, for a facility lease only
when we have both vacated the space and completed all actions
needed to make the space readily available for sublease.

As of December 31, 2004, we had $3.6 million in
accrued restructuring liabilities related to vacated facilities.
In 2003, we were able to renegotiate two of our previously
restructured facility leases to reduce rents payable under the
leases to current market rates, resulting in a reversal of
previously recorded restructuring liabilities of
$9.6 million. We expect that approximately
$1.4 million of the amount accrued as of December 31,
2004 will be paid within 12 months. In the event that we
are able to sublease our restructured space, we will record an
adjustment to the restructuring liability in the period in which
the adjustment becomes probable and estimable.

Loss Contingencies:

We define a loss contingency as a condition involving
uncertainty as to a possible loss related to a previous event
that will not be resolved until one or more future events occur
or fail to occur. Our primary loss contingencies relate to
pending or threatened litigation. We record a liability for a
loss contingency when we believe that it is probable that a loss
has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably
estimated. When we believe the likelihood of a loss is less than
probable and more than remote, we do not record a liability but
we disclose material loss contingencies in the notes to the
consolidated financial statements.

Tax Reserves and Valuation Allowance for Deferred Income
    Taxes:

We currently have significant deferred tax assets, resulting
from net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards
and deductible temporary differences. We provide a full
valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. Management
weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is
more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets
will be realized. Forming a conclusion that a valuation
allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative
evidence such as cumulative losses in past years. Despite our
profitability in 2004, as of December 31, 2004, we have
continued to maintain a full valuation allowance on our tax
benefits until profitability has been sustained over a time
period and in amounts that are sufficient to support a
conclusion that it is more likely than not that a portion or all
of the deferred tax assets will be realized. A decrease in our
valuation allowance would result in an immediate material income
tax benefit, an increase in total assets and stockholder’s
equity, and could have a significant impact on earnings in
future periods.

We have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential
exposures involving our sales and use and franchise tax
positions. These potential exposures result from the varying
application of statutes, rules, regulations and interpretations
by different jurisdictions. Our estimate of the value of our tax
reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and
judgments about the interpretation of statutes, rules and
regulations by taxing jurisdictions. It is possible that the
ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than
the amount that we estimated.

Capitalized Internal-Use Software Costs:

We capitalize the salaries and payroll-related costs of
employees who devote time to the development of internal-use
software projects. If the project is an enhancement to
previously developed software, we must assess whether the
enhancement is significant and creates additional functionality
to the software, thus



qualifying the work incurred for capitalization. Once the
project is complete, we must estimate the useful life of the
internal-use software, and we must periodically assess whether
the software is impaired. Changes in our estimates related to
internal-use software would increase or decrease operating
expenses or amortization recorded during the period.

Results of Operations

Revenues.

Total revenues increased 30%, or
$48.8 million, to $210.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004 as compared to $161.3 million for
the year ended December 31, 2003. Total revenues increased
11%, or $16.3 million, to $161.3 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $145.0 million
for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in total
revenues for 2004 as compared to 2003 was attributable to an
increase in service revenue of $49.4 million, partially
offset by a reduction in software and software-related revenue
of $477,000. The increase in total revenues for 2003 as compared
to 2002 was attributable to an increase in service revenue of
$28.7 million, partially offset by a reduction in software
and software-related revenue of $2.8 million and related
party revenue of $9.7 million.

Service revenue, which consists of revenue from our content and
application delivery services, increased 31%, or
$49.4 million, to $206.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004 as compared to $157.4 million for
the year ended December 31, 2003. Service revenue was
$128.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.
The increases in service revenue were primarily attributable to
increases in the number of customers under recurring revenue
contracts, as well as increases in traffic and additional
services sold to new and existing customers and in an increase
in the average revenue per customer. We believe these increases
are attributable to greater market acceptance of our services
among new customers and improvements in our ability to sell
additional features to our existing customers. As of
December 31, 2004, we had 1,310 customers under
recurring revenue contracts as compared to 1,126 as of
December 31, 2003, and 955 as of December 31, 2002.

For 2004 and 2003, 19% and 16%, respectively, of our total
revenues was derived from our operations located outside of the
United States, of which 14% and 13% of overall revenues,
respectively, was derived from operations in Europe. For 2002,
13% of our total revenues was derived from our operations
located outside of the United States, of which 10% of overall
revenues was derived from operations in Europe. No single
country accounted for 10% or more of revenues derived outside of
the United States during these periods. Resellers accounted for
27% of revenues in 2004, 25% in 2003 and 24% in 2002. For 2004
and 2003, Microsoft Corporation accounted for 10% and 15%,
respectively, of total revenues. For 2002, no single customer
accounted for 10% or more of total revenues.

In September 2004, we entered into an amendment to our agreement
with Microsoft Corporation to adjust the pricing and commitment
levels. In addition, we also amended the service level agreement
guarantees applicable to the various services purchased by
Microsoft. The term of the agreement runs until September 2005
but may be renewed by the parties. Microsoft will have the right
to reduce its commitment levels by 50% for extensions of the
term of the agreement and convert the contract to a
month-to-month term after September 2005 if the parties fail to
reach agreement as to appropriate price and service level
changes at such time.

Software and software-related revenue decreased 13%, or
$477,000, to $3.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004 as compared to $3.7 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003. Software and software-related
revenue was $6.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2002. Software and software-related revenue
includes sales of customized technology solutions sold as
perpetual licenses or delivered under long-term contracts. The
decreases in software and software-related revenue over the
periods presented reflect a reduction in the number of
customized software projects performed and a decrease in the
number of software and other technology licenses executed as we
focused on our core services business. We do not expect software
and software-related revenue to increase as a percentage of
revenue in 2005.

We had no revenue from related parties during 2004. Service and
software revenue from related parties was $137,000 and
$9.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively. The reduction in revenue from related
parties in 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily attributable
to revenue in 2002 from



Sockeye Networks, Inc., Akamai Technologies Japan KK, or Akamai
Japan, and SOFTBANK Broadband Media, or SBBM, a co-investor in
Akamai Japan, with no associated revenue from those parties in
2003 or 2004. Related party revenue in 2003 represents revenue
from Akamai Australia, a joint venture with ES Group Ventures
Pty Ltd, relating to resale commitments. In December 2002 and
June 2003, the joint ventures of Akamai Japan and Akamai
Australia, respectively, were terminated. In 2003, we formed a
wholly-owned subsidiary in Japan. We do not expect to have any
revenue from related parties in 2005.

Cost of Revenues.

Cost of revenues includes fees paid to
network providers for bandwidth and co-location of our network
equipment. Cost of revenues also includes payroll and related
costs and equity-related compensation for network operations
personnel, cost of licenses, depreciation of network equipment
used to deliver our services and amortization of internal-use
software costs.

Cost of revenues decreased 24%, or $14.7 million, to
$46.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004
compared to $60.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003. Cost of revenues decreased 29%, or
$24.3 million, to $60.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003 as compared to $85.2 million for the
year ended December 31, 2002. The total cost of revenues
decrease for both periods is primarily a result of a decline in
depreciation expense of network equipment as the impact of our
network assets becoming fully depreciated exceeded the
depreciation from the recent investments we have made in our
network infrastructure. In 2004, however, a portion of this
decrease in deprecation expense was offset by an increase in
total bandwidth costs as a result of higher traffic delivered.
Traffic delivered over our network increased significantly in
2004 as compared to 2003. Despite this increase in traffic,
overall bandwidth costs have continued to increase at a lower
rate because we have reduced our network bandwidth costs per
unit. Cost of revenues decreased in 2003 as compared to 2002 by
$24.3 million primarily as a result of a reduction in
depreciation of network equipment, lower bandwidth costs per
unit and improved management of our network traffic.

Cost of revenues during 2004, 2003 and 2002 also included
credits received of approximately $1.0 million,
$3.0 million and $5.6 million, respectively, as a
result of settlements and renegotiations entered into in
connection with billing disputes related to bandwidth contracts.
Credits of this nature may occur in the future as a result of
our efforts to monitor and reduce our network costs; however,
the timing and amount of these credits, if any, will vary.

Cost of revenues is comprised of the following (in millions):

We have long-term commitments for bandwidth usage and
co-location with various networks and ISPs. For the years ending
December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, the minimum commitments
are approximately $9.7 million, $456,000 and $41,000,
respectively.

We believe cost of revenues will increase in 2005 as compared to
2004. We expect that bandwidth costs will increase slightly as a
result of higher expenses associated with increased traffic on
our network offset by expected lower bandwidth costs per unit.
Additionally, we expect increases in depreciation of our network
equipment and amortization of internal-use software development
costs, as well as an increase in payroll and payroll-related
costs as we continue to make investments in our network. Our
expectations in 2005 do not include the impact of implementing
SFAS No. 123R for the expensing of employee stock awards at fair
value, which becomes effective during the third quarter of 2005.



Research and Development.

Research and development
expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs and
equity-related compensation for research and development
personnel who design, develop, test and enhance our services and
our network. Research and development costs are expensed as
incurred, except certain software development costs requiring
capitalization. During the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, we capitalized software development costs of
$7.5 million, $7.5 million and $6.0 million,
respectively, consisting of external consulting and payroll and
payroll-related costs related to the development of internal-use
software used to deliver our services and operate our network.
These capitalized internal-use software costs are amortized to
cost of revenue over their useful lives of two years.

Research and development expenses decreased 6%, or $839,000, to
$12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as
compared to $13.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003. Research and development expenses
decreased 40%, or $8.8 million, to $13.0 million for
the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to
$21.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.
The decrease in 2004 as compared to 2003, as well as 2003 as
compared to 2002, was primarily due to decreases in payroll and
related costs, including equity-related compensation, as a
result of the impact of workforce reductions in 2002 and
reduction of equity compensation as stock awards have become
fully vested. The following table quantifies the net reduction
in research and development expenses over periods presented (in
millions):

We believe that research and development expenses will increase
in 2005 as compared to 2004, as we continue to increase hiring
of development personnel. Our expectations in 2005 do not
include the impact of implementing SFAS No. 123R for the
expensing of employee stock awards at fair value, which becomes
effective during the third quarter of 2005.

Sales and Marketing.

Sales and marketing expenses consist
primarily of payroll and related costs, equity-related
compensation and commissions for personnel engaged in marketing,
sales and service support functions, as well as advertising and
promotional expenses.

Sales and marketing expenses increased 17%, or
$8.1 million, to $55.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004 as compared to $47.6 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003. Sales and marketing expenses
decreased 27%, or $17.2 million, to $47.6 million for
the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to
$64.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.
The increase in sales and marketing expenses in 2004 as compared
to 2003 was primarily due to a rise in payroll and
payroll-related costs, particularly commissions, as a result of
revenue growth during 2004. The decrease in sales and marketing
expenses in 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily due to a
reduction in payroll and payroll-related costs, including
decreases in equity-related compensation attributable to
reductions in headcount in 2002. Sales and marketing during 2003
also decreased as a result of reductions in advertising costs
associated with an agreement between CNN News Group and Akamai,
which expired in the fourth quarter of 2002. The following table
quantifies the net increase and decrease in sales and marketing
expenses for the periods presented (in millions):

We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in 2005 as
compared to 2004 due to an expected increase in commissions as a
result of higher forecasted sales, an increase in hiring of
sales personnel and an expected increase in marketing costs. Our
expectations in 2005 do not include the impact of implementing
SFAS No. 123R for the expensing of employee stock awards at fair
value, which becomes effective during the third quarter of 2005.

General and Administrative.

General and administrative
expenses consist primarily of depreciation of property and
equipment used by us internally, payroll and related costs,
including equity-related compensation and related expenses for
executive, finance, business applications, network management,
human resources and other administrative personnel, fees for
professional services, non-income related taxes, the provision
for doubtful accounts and rent and other facility-related
expenditures for leased properties. During the year ended
December 31, 2004, we capitalized software development
costs of approximately $200,000, consisting of external
consulting and payroll and payroll-related costs related to the
development of internally-used software applications.

General and administrative expenses decreased 18%, or
$10.2 million, to $47.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004 as compared to $57.3 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003. General and administrative
expenses decreased 42%, or $40.9 million, to
$57.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 as
compared to $98.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2002. The decrease in general and
administrative expenses for both periods was primarily due to a
reduction in depreciation expense as a result of assets becoming
fully depreciated, a reduction in payroll and related costs,
including equity compensation, as a result of equity awards
becoming fully vested and reduced rent expense as a result of
the impact of restructurings that occurred in previous years.
During 2004, however, consulting and advisory services increased
significantly compared to 2003 as a result of the costs
associated with the evaluation of our internal controls in order
to allow management to report on, and our independent auditors
to attest to, our internal controls over financial reporting as
required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
The following table quantifies the net reduction in general and
administrative expenses for the periods presented (in millions):

We expect general and administrative expenses to slightly
increase in 2005 as compared to 2004 due to on-going litigation
costs associated with trials currently scheduled to occur in
2005. If our proposed acquisition of Speedera is completed,
however, we expect our litigation costs to be greatly reduced
and our overall general and administrative expenses to be about
the same in 2005 as compared to 2004. Our expectations in 2005
do not include the impact of implementing SFAS No. 123R for the
expensing of employee stock awards at fair value, which becomes
effective during the third quarter of 2005.

Amortization of Other Intangible Assets.

Amortization of
other intangible assets consists of the amortization of
intangible assets acquired in business combinations and
amortization of acquired license rights. Amortization of other
intangible assets decreased 98%, or $2.2 million, to
$48,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to
$2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.
Amortization of other intangible assets for the year ended
December 31, 2002 was $11.9 million. Intangible assets
acquired in business combinations were fully amortized as of the
end of the first quarter of 2003; therefore, there was no
corresponding amortization of such intangibles assets in the
remainder of 2003 or in 2004. We expect to



amortize approximately $48,000 of intangible assets related to
acquired license rights in 2005 and in each year thereafter
through 2008, during which they will become fully amortized.

Restructuring Charges (Benefits).

We did not record any
restructuring charges or benefits during the year ended
December 31, 2004. During the year ended December 31,
2003, we recorded net restructuring benefits of
$8.5 million as a result of amendments to certain lease
agreements. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we
amended or terminated three long-term leases in connection with
which we paid our lessors a total of $16.1 million in cash
and restricted cash. As a result of amendments to, or
terminations of, long-term leases, we reversed $9.6 million
of previously recorded restructuring liabilities, offset by a
restructuring charge of $1.1 million for costs relating to
the restructuring of a facility located in Europe. The reversals
represent the difference between the previously estimated
restructuring liabilities and the amounts payable under
negotiated agreements for certain leased properties with the
landlords thereof. Beginning in 2004, our monthly rental
payments have been reduced to a lower amount more aligned with
current market rates.

During the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded
restructuring charges of $45.8 million, which represents
$3.6 million for employee severance benefits and
$42.2 million attributable to facility leases and
long-lived asset impairments. During the year ended
December 31, 2002, in connection with the termination of
our facility leases for 500 and 600 Technology Square in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, we recorded a restructuring charge of
$8.0 million for the difference between the actual
termination costs and the amount previously accrued. Also during
the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded restructuring
charges of $29.7 million representing the difference
between the anticipated costs to terminate or modify vacant
facilities under non-cancelable lease agreements and the
previously recorded restructuring liabilities for these
properties. In addition, we impaired leasehold improvements,
furniture and fixtures, deposits, deferred rent and other
long-lived assets related to these facilities in the amount of
$4.5 million.

The following table summarizes the establishment and usage of
the restructuring liabilities related to real estate leases (in
millions):

The restructuring liabilities will be fully paid through August
2007. We do not anticipate significant restructuring charges in
the future; however, we will continue to pursue modifications or
settlements on our long-term leases if we believe it to be in
our and our stockholders’ best interests. We have estimated
the



amount of restructuring liabilities associated with real estate
leases based on the most recent available market data and
discussions with our lessors and real estate advisors.

Interest Income.

Interest income includes interest earned
on invested cash balances and marketable securities and interest
earned on notes receivable for stock. Interest income increased
66%, or $856,000, to $2.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004 as compared to $1.3 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003. Interest income decreased
57%, or $1.7 million, to $1.3 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $3.0 million
for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in
interest income for the year ended December 31, 2004 was a
result of an increase in our invested short-term and long-term
marketable securities balance during the course of 2004. The
decrease in interest income for 2003 as compared to 2002 was the
result in a decrease in our holdings of short-term and long-term
marketable securities and a decrease in interest rates.

Interest Expense.

Interest expense includes interest paid
on our debt obligations as well as amortization of deferred
financing costs. Interest expense decreased 44%, or
$8.1 million, to $10.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004 compared to $18.3 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003. For the year ended
December 31, 2003, interest expense remained relatively
flat at $18.3 million as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2002. The decrease during the year ended
December 31, 2004 was due to lower interest expense as a
result of our repurchases of a substantial portion of our


/


% convertible
subordinated notes in December 2003 and at various times in
2004, offset by interest payable on our 1% convertible
senior notes issued in December 2003 and January 2004. During
2004, we repurchased $169.4 million in aggregate principal
amount of our


/


% convertible
subordinated notes. As a result of these transactions, we
believe that interest expense on our debt obligations, including
deferred financing amortization and capital lease interest
expense, will not exceed $7.0 million in 2005.

Other Income (Expense), net.

Net other income
(expense) represents foreign exchange gains and losses
incurred during the periods presented, as well as gains on legal
settlements. Other net income of $1.1 million for the year
ended December 31, 2004 represents approximately $518,000
of gains on legal settlements and $543,000 of foreign exchange
gains. For the year ended December 31, 2003, other net
expense was $44,000 as compared to other net income of $68,000
for the year ended December 31, 2002. The difference
between 2003 and 2002 is attributable to exchange rate
fluctuations. Net other income (expense) may fluctuate in
the future based upon the movement in foreign exchange rates.

Loss (Gain) on Investments, net.

During the year ended
December 31, 2004, we recorded a net loss on investments of
$69,000 on the sale of marketable securities. During 2003, we
recorded a net gain of $1.6 million, of which
$1.7 million related to the sale of equity investments in
publicly-traded companies, offset by losses of approximately
$55,000 on investments in privately-held companies and sale of
marketable securities. Loss on investments in 2002 of
approximately $6.1 million included a loss of approximately
$4.3 million related to our investment in Netaxs, Inc., a
related party, which was realized as a result of a merger
transaction between Netaxs and FASTNET Corporation in April
2002. In addition, loss on investments in 2002 included a loss
of $2.4 million to adjust the cost basis of equity
investments to fair value. The loss on investments was partially
offset by a gain of $400,000 on the sale of our equity interest
in Akamai Japan to SBBM and by approximately $149,000 of
realized investment gains. We do not expect significant gain or
losses on investments, as we no longer hold investments in
publicly or privately-held companies.

Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt.

Loss on early
extinguishment of debt increased $4.7 million, or 223%, to
$6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as
compared to $2.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003. The increase in loss on early
extinguishment of debt is a result of costs incurred in
connection with our repurchase of $169.4 million in
principal amount of our


/


% convertible
subordinated notes during 2004. This loss of $6.8 million
consists of the reduction of $2.5 million of deferred
financing costs associated with repurchases of notes prior to
their maturity; $2.8 million in premiums above par value
paid to repurchase such notes; and $1.5 million of advisory
services and offering costs incurred in connection with the
repurchases.

Provision for Income Taxes.

Provision for income taxes
increased $143,000, or 23%, to $772,000 for the year ended
December 31, 2004 as compared to $629,000 for the year
ended December 31, 2003. Provision for



income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2002 was
$492,000. The provision for income taxes during all periods
presented relates to foreign income taxes which may fluctuate in
the future based upon changes in foreign income. Despite our
profitability in 2004, as of December 31, 2004, we have
continued to maintain a full valuation allowance on our tax
benefits until profitability has been sustained over a time
period and in amounts that are sufficient to support a
conclusion that it is more likely than not a portion or all of
the deferred tax assets will be realized. A decrease in our
valuation allowance would result in an immediate material income
tax benefit.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the
following transactions:

As of December 31, 2004, cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities totaled $108.4 million, of which
$4.6 million is subject to restrictions limiting our
ability to withdraw or otherwise use such cash, cash equivalents
and marketable securities. See “Letters of Credit”
below.

Cash provided by operating activities increased
$69.2 million, to $51.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004 compared to cash used in operating
activities of $18.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003. Cash used in operating activities
decreased $47.8 million, to $18.0 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003 compared to $65.8 million for
the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in cash
provided by operating activities for 2004 as compared to 2003
was primarily due to the increase in cash receipts from
customers driven by the rise in revenue billings during 2004, as
well as a decrease in payments made on accrued restructuring
liabilities during the period. The decrease in cash used in
operating activities for 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily
due to a decrease of approximately $108.0 million in net
losses before non-cash expenses such as depreciation and
amortization, loss on investments, equity-related compensation
and loss on early extinguishment of debt. We expect that cash
provided by operating activities will continue to remain
positive as a result of an upward trend in cash collections
related to higher revenue billings and a reduction in payments
towards our real estate restructuring liabilities, partially
offset by an expected increase in operating expenses that
require cash outlays due to expected increases in headcount.
However, the timing and amount of future working capital changes
and our ability to manage our days sales outstanding will affect
the future amount of cash used in or provided by operating
activities.

Cash provided by investing activities was $9.1 million for
the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to cash used in
investing activities of $33.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003. Cash provided by investing activities
was $38.0 million for the year ended December 31,
2002. Cash provided by investing activities for 2004 reflects
proceeds from net purchases, sales and maturities of investments
of $24.1 million, offset by capital expenditures of
$20.1 million, consisting of the capitalization of
internal-use software development costs related to our current
and future service offerings and purchase of network
infrastructure equipment. During 2004, cash provided by
investing activities also included a decrease of
$5.0 million in restricted cash to reflect our repurchase
of $5.0 million in principal amount of our


/


% convertible
subordinated notes in early 2004 and a decrease of $96,000 in
restricted cash previously held for security deposits. The
increase in cash provided by investing activities for 2004 as
compared to cash used in investing activities for 2003 was
primarily due to an increase in the proceeds from net purchases,
sales and maturities of investments, offset by an increase in
capital expenditures in 2004. Cash used in investing activities
for 2003



reflects net purchases, sales and maturities of investments of
$19.3 million, an increase in restricted cash to reflect a
commitment to repurchase $5.0 million in principal amount
of our


/


% convertible
subordinated notes in early 2004 and capital expenditures,
including capitalization of internal-use software development
costs of $8.9 million. Cash provided by investing
activities for 2002 reflects proceeds from net purchases, sales
and maturities of investments of $58.4 million less capital
expenditures of $14.2 million, including capitalization of
internal-use software development costs. Cash provided by
investing activities during 2002 also includes a payment of
$6.5 million to CNN News Group to settle an obligation
resulting from our acquisition of InterVu, Inc. in April 2000.
We expect total capital expenditures to be approximately 10% to
12% of revenues in 2005.

Cash used in financing activities was $131.9 million for
the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to cash provided
by financing activities of approximately $105.2 million for
the year ended December 31, 2003 and approximately
$1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.
Cash used in financing activities in 2004 reflects payments for
the repurchase of approximately $169.4 million in principal
amount of our


/


% convertible
subordinated notes and payments on our capital leases of
$543,000, offset by proceeds received from the issuance of our
1% convertible senior notes, net of financing costs, of
$24.3 million and issuances of common stock under our
equity compensation plans of $13.8 million. Cash provided
by financing activities in 2003 reflects proceeds received from
the issuance of our 1% convertible senior notes, net of
financing costs, of $169.8 million, issuances of common
stock under our equity compensation plans of $8.6 million,
settlement of notes receivable for stock of $2.3 million,
offset by payments for the repurchase of $74.0 million in
principal amount of our


/


% convertible
subordinated notes and payments on our capital leases of
$1.4 million. Cash provided by financing activities in 2002
reflects proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our
equity compensation plans of $2.8 million and payments on
our capital lease obligations of $1.6 million. Cash
received from the issuance of common stock under equity
compensation plans increased in 2004 as compared to prior years
as a result of more option exercises in 2004.

Changes in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are
dependent upon changes in working capital items such as deferred
revenues, accounts payable, accounts receivable and various
accrued expenses, as well as changes in our capital and
financial structure, including debt repurchases and issuances,
stock option exercises, sale of equity investments and
settlements of notes receivable for stock.

The following table represents the net outflow of cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities for the periods presented
(in millions):



We believe, based on our present business plan, that our current
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of
$108.4 million and forecasted cash flows from operations
will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital
and capital expenditures and restructuring expenses for at least
the next 24 months. If the assumptions underlying our
business plan regarding future revenue and expenses change or if
unexpected opportunities or needs arise, we may seek to raise
additional cash by selling equity or debt securities. We may
seek to retire or refinance our long-term debt with cash, equity
or a combination thereof. If additional funds are raised through
the issuance of equity or debt securities, these securities
could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those
accruing to holders of common stock, and the terms of such debt
could impose restrictions on our operations. The sale of
additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in
additional dilution to our stockholders. See “Factors
Affecting Future Operating Results.”

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments

The following table presents our contractual obligations and
commercial commitments as of December 31, 2004 over the
next five years and thereafter (in millions):

Letters of Credit

As of December 31, 2004, we had issued $4.6 million in
irrevocable letters of credit in favor of third-party
beneficiaries, primarily related to long-term facility leases.
The letters of credit are collateralized by restricted
marketable securities, of which $3.7 million are classified
as long-term and $932,000 are classified as short-term on our
consolidated balance sheet dated as of December 31, 2004.
The restrictions on these marketable securities lapse as we
fulfill our obligations or as such obligations expire as
provided by the letters of credit. These restrictions are
expected to lapse through May 2009.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have entered into various indemnification arrangements with
third parties, including vendors, customers, landlords, our
officers and directors, stockholders of acquired companies,
joint venture partners and third parties to whom and from whom
we license technology. Generally, these indemnification
agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by third
parties due to various events, such as lawsuits arising from
patent or copyright infringement or our negligence. These
indemnification obligations are considered off-balance sheet
arrangements in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards
Board, or FASB, Interpretation 45, “Guarantor’s
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.” To date, we
have not encountered material costs as a result of such
obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such
indemnifications in the financial statements. See Note 10
to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual
report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these
indemnification agreements.



Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or
“FASB,” issued SFAS No. 123R,
“Share-Based Payment (revised 2004),” which is a
revision of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation” and supersedes APB Opinion
No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees.” SFAS No. 123R requires all
share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee
stock options, to be valued at fair value on the date of grant,
and to be expensed over the applicable vesting period. Pro forma
disclosure of the income statement effects of share-based
payments is no longer an alternative. SFAS No. 123R is
effective for all stock-based awards granted on or after
July 1, 2005. We expect to adopt this standard in July 2005
under the modified prospective transition method. Under this
method, a company records compensation expense for all new
awards and awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after the
required effective date. In addition, companies must also
recognize compensation expense related to any awards that are
not fully vested as of the effective date. Compensation expense
for the unvested awards will be measured based on the fair value
of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma
disclosures in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS No. 123. We are currently assessing the impact of
adopting SFAS No. 123R to our consolidated results of
operations but expect that the adoption will have a material
impact.

In September 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force, or the EITF,
reached consensus on Issue 04-8, “The Effect of
Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per
Share,” or EITF 04-8. EITF 04-8 provides guidance
on when the dilutive effect of contingently convertible debt
securities with a market trigger should be included in diluted
earnings per share, or EPS. The guidance states that these
securities should be treated the same as other convertible
securities and included in diluted EPS computation, regardless
of whether the market price trigger has been met. EITF 04-8
is effective for all periods ending after December 15, 2004
and is applied retrospectively. As a result of the adoption of
EITF 04-8, our 1% convertible senior notes,
convertible into 12.9 million shares, are now included in
our diluted earnings per share computation for the year ended
December 31, 2004, which has resulted in a reduction in
diluted earnings per share of $0.01 for that period.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates
relates primarily to our debt and investment portfolio. In our
investment portfolio we do not use derivative financial
instruments. We place our investments with high quality issuers
and, by policy, limit the amount of risk by investing primarily
in money market funds, United States Treasury obligations,
high-quality corporate and municipal obligations and
certificates of deposit.

We may incur realized losses as a result of early redemptions of
our debt securities. Our


/


% convertible
subordinated notes and 1% convertible senior notes are
subject to changes in market value. Under certain conditions,
the holders of our 1% convertible senior notes may require
us to redeem the notes on or after December 15, 2010. As of
December 31, 2004, the aggregate outstanding principal
amount and the fair value of the


/


% convertible
subordinated notes were $56.6 million and
$57.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2004,
the aggregate outstanding principal amount and the fair value of
the 1% convertible senior notes were $200.0 million
and $222.0 million, respectively.

We have operations in Europe and Asia. As a result, we are
exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Additionally,
we may continue to expand our operations globally and sell to
customers in foreign locations, which may increase our exposure
to foreign exchange fluctuations.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements




REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Akamai
Technologies, Inc.:

We have completed an integrated audit of Akamai Technologies,
Inc.’s 2004 consolidated financial statements and of its
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004 and audits of its 2003 and 2002
consolidated financial statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below.

Consolidated financial statements

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
the related consolidated statements of operations, of cash flows
and of stockholders’ deficit present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Akamai
Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31,
2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2004 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Internal control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in
the accompanying “Management’s Annual Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,” that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004 based on criteria
established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion,
the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by
the COSO. The Company’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express
opinions on management’s assessment and on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit
of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal
control over financial reporting includes obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized



acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Nature of Business and Basis of Presentation:

Akamai Technologies, Inc. (“Akamai” or the
“Company”) provides services for accelerating and
improving the delivery of content and business processes over
the Internet. Akamai’s globally distributed platform
comprises more than 15,000 servers in more than
950 networks in 69 countries. The Company was
incorporated in Delaware in 1998 and is headquartered in
Cambridge, Massachusetts. Akamai currently operates in one
business segment: providing services for accelerating delivery
of content and business processes over the Internet.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Akamai and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in
consolidation. Certain reclassifications of prior reported
amounts have been made to conform with current year
presentation. In connection with preparation of the accompanying
consolidated financial statements, the Company concluded that it
was appropriate to classify its investments in auction rate
securities as short-term available-for-sale investments.
Previously, such investments were classified as cash and cash
equivalents. Accordingly, the Company has revised the
classification to exclude from cash and cash equivalents
$54.4 million and $62.8 million of auction rate
securities at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and
to include such amounts as short-term available-for-sale
investments. In addition, the Company has made corresponding
revisions to the accompanying consolidated statements of cash
flows to reflect the gross purchases and sales of these
securities as investing activities. As a result, cash used in
investing activities decreased by $8.4 million in 2003 and
cash provided by investing activities decreased by
$58.1 million in 2002. This revision in classification does
not affect previously reported cash flows from operations or
from financing activities.

In 2002, the Company modified the presentation of the
consolidated statement of operations to include in cost of
revenue equity-related compensation expense, based on the
functional role of the related employee, and depreciation and
amortization on its network equipment.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates:

Use of Estimates

The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America that require management to make
estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, together
with amounts disclosed in the related notes to the consolidated
financial statements. Actual results and outcomes may differ
from management’s estimates, judgments and assumptions.
Significant estimates used in these financial statements
include, but are not limited to, accounting for long-term
contracts, accounts receivable reserves, restructuring reserves,
contingencies, amortization and impairment of intangibles,
goodwill, capitalized software, depreciation and impairment of
property and equipment, deferred tax assets and
other-than-temporary losses on investments. Estimates are
periodically reviewed in light of changes in circumstances,
facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in
estimates are reflected in the consolidated financial statements
prospectively from the date of the change in estimate.

In 2004, for the first time since inception, the Company had net
income and positive cash flows from operations on a fiscal year
basis. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents generated
from operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 were
$51.2 million. The Company’s cash, cash equivalents,
restricted cash, long-term and short-term marketable securities
and restricted marketable securities at December 31, 2004
were $108.4 million. The Company believes that its existing
cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, restricted
marketable securities and forecasted cash flows from operations
will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital
expenditure requirements for at least the next 24 months.



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Revenue Recognition

Akamai primarily derives revenue from the sale of services to
customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer.
These contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum
monthly level of usage and provide the rate at which the
customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly minimum.
For these services, Akamai recognizes the monthly minimum as
revenue each month provided that an enforceable contract has
been signed by both parties, the service has been delivered to
the customer, the fee for the service is fixed or determinable
and collection is reasonably assured. Should a customer’s
usage exceed the monthly minimum, Akamai recognizes revenue for
that excess in the period of the usage. The Company typically
charges the customer an installation fee when the services are
first activated. The installation fees are recorded as deferred
revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated
life of the customer arrangement. The Company also derives
revenue from services sold as discrete events or based solely on
usage. For these services, the Company recognizes revenue after
an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties, the fee
is fixed or determinable, the event or usage has occurred and
collection is reasonably assured.

The Company periodically enters into multi-element service
arrangements. When the Company enters into such arrangements,
each element is accounted for separately over its respective
service period, provided that there is objective evidence of
fair value for the separate elements. For example, objective
evidence of fair value would include the price charged for the
element when sold separately. If the fair value of each element
cannot be objectively determined, the total value of the
arrangement is recognized ratably over the entire service
period. For most multi-element service arrangements to date, the
fair value of each element has not been objectively
determinable. Therefore, all revenue under these arrangements
has been recognized ratably over the related service period.

The Company licenses software under perpetual and term license
agreements. The Company applies the provisions of Statement of
Position (“SOP”) 97-2, “Software Revenue
Recognition,” as amended by SOP 98-9,
“Modifications of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue
Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions.” As
prescribed by this guidance, the Company applies the residual
method of accounting. The residual method requires that the
portion of the total arrangement fee attributable to undelivered
elements, as indicated by vendor specific objective evidence of
fair value, is deferred and subsequently recognized in
accordance with SOP 97-2. The difference between the total
arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered
elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered
elements, if all other revenue recognition criteria of
SOP 97-2 are met.

The Company also sells its services through a reseller channel.
Assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, the
Company recognizes revenue from reseller arrangements based on
the reseller’s contracted non-refundable minimum purchase
commitments over the term of the contract, plus amounts sold by
the reseller to its customers in excess of the minimum
commitments.

Akamai recognizes revenue from fixed-fee arrangements and
software arrangements that require significant customization or
modification using the percentage-of-completion method in
accordance with Accounting Research Bulletin (“ARB”)
No. 45, “Long-Term Construction-Type Contracts,”
and with the applicable guidance provided by SOP 81-1,
“Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and
Certain Production-Type Contracts.” The Company generally
recognizes revenue under these arrangements based on the
percentage of cost incurred to date compared to the estimated
total cost to complete the project. In certain customer
arrangements, the Company recognizes revenue based on the
progress made toward achieving milestones under the contract.
The impact of any change in estimate is recorded prospectively
from the date of the change. At the outset of a fixed-fee
arrangement, if the Company is not able to estimate the total
cost-to-complete, nor able to measure progress towards the
achievement of contract milestones, the Company accounts for the
arrangement using the completed-contract method of accounting.
Under this method, the Company recognizes revenue when the
contract is complete and there are no remaining costs or
deliverables.



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In the event that the estimated total cost on a fixed-fee
contract indicates a loss, the Company will record the loss
immediately.

From time to time, the Company enters into contracts to sell its
services or license its technology to enterprises at or about
the same time that it enters into contracts to purchase products
or services from the same enterprise. If the Company concludes
that these contracts were negotiated concurrently, the Company
records as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor,
unless the product or service received has a separate
identifiable benefit and the fair value to the Company of the
vendor’s product or service can be established objectively.

The Company may from time to time resell licenses or services of
third parties. The Company records revenue for these
transactions when the Company has risk of loss related to the
amounts purchased from the third party and the Company adds
value to the license or service, such as by providing
maintenance or support for such license or service. If these
conditions are present, the Company recognizes revenue when all
other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied.

Deferred revenue includes amounts billed to customers for which
revenue has not been recognized. Deferred revenue primarily
consists of the unearned portion of monthly billed service fees;
deferred installation and activation set-up fees; amounts billed
under extended payment terms; and maintenance and support
fees charged under license arrangements.

Cost of Revenues

Cost of revenue consists primarily of fees paid to network
providers for bandwidth and for housing servers in third-party
network data centers, also known as co-location costs. Cost of
revenue also includes network operation employee costs, network
storage costs, cost of professional services, cost of licenses,
depreciation of network equipment used to deliver the
Company’s services, amortization of network-related
internal-use software and costs for the production of live
on-line events. The Company enters into contracts for bandwidth
with third-party network providers with terms typically ranging
from one to three years. These contracts generally commit Akamai
to pay minimum monthly fees plus additional fees for bandwidth
usage above the contracted level. In some circumstances,
Internet service providers (“ISPs”) make available to
Akamai rack space for the Company’s servers and access to
their bandwidth at discounted or no cost. In exchange, the ISP
and its customers benefit by receiving content through a local
Akamai server resulting in better content delivery. The Company
does not consider these relationships to represent the
culmination of an earnings process. Accordingly, the Company
does not recognize as revenue the value to the ISPs associated
with the use of Akamai’s servers nor does the Company
recognize as expense the value of the rack space and bandwidth
received at discounted or no cost.

Equity-Related Compensation

Akamai accounts for stock-based awards to employees using the
intrinsic value method as prescribed by Accounting Principles
Board Opinion (“APB”) No. 25, “Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related
interpretations. Accordingly, no compensation expense is
recorded for stock-based awards issued to employees in fixed
amounts and with fixed exercise prices at least equal to the
fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the date
of grant. Akamai applies the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123,
as amended by SFAS No. 148, through disclosure only
for stock-based awards issued to employees. All stock-based
awards to non-employees are accounted for at their fair value in
accordance with SFAS No. 123.

Equity-related compensation is comprised of the following for
all periods presented:

(a)

amortization of deferred compensation resulting from the grant
    of stock options or shares of restricted stock to employees at
    exercise or sale prices deemed to be less than the fair value of

change in estimate for the year ended December 31, 2004 was
to increase stock-based employee compensation expense by
approximately $12.3 million.

Research and Development Costs

Research and development costs consist primarily of payroll and
related personnel costs for the design, deployment, testing,
operation and enhancement of the Company’s services and
network. Costs incurred in the development of the Company’s
services are expensed as incurred, except certain software
development costs eligible for capitalization. Costs associated
with the development of software to be marketed externally are
expensed prior to the establishment of technological feasibility
as defined by SFAS No. 86, “Accounting for the
Cost of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise
Marketed,” and capitalized thereafter until the general
release of the software. To date, the Company’s development
of software to be sold externally has been completed
concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility
and, accordingly, all associated costs have been charged to
expense as incurred in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements.

Costs incurred during the application development stage of
internal-use software projects are capitalized in accordance
with SOP 98-1, “Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.”
Capitalized costs include external consulting and payroll and
payroll-related costs for employees in the Company’s
development and information technology groups who are directly
associated with, and who devote time to, the Company’s
internal-use software projects during the application
development stage. Capitalization begins when the planning stage
is complete and the Company commits resources to the software
project. Capitalization ceases when the software has been tested
and is ready for its intended use. Amortization of the asset
commences when the software is complete and placed in service.
The Company



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

amortizes completed internal-use software to cost of revenue
over an estimated life of two years. Costs incurred during the
planning, training and post implementation stages of the
software development life-cycle are expensed as incurred. Costs
related to upgrades and enhancements of existing internal-use
software that increase the functionality of the software are
also capitalized.

Concentrations of Credit Risk and Fair Value of Financial
    Instruments

The amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets for
cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts
payable approximate their fair value due to their short-term
maturities. The fair value and the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of the Company’s


/


% convertible
subordinated notes were approximately $57.6 million and
$56.6 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2004.
The fair value and the aggregate outstanding principal amount of
the Company’s 1% convertible senior notes were
approximately $222.0 million and $200.0 million,
respectively, as of December 31, 2004. The Company
maintains the majority of its cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities balances principally with domestic
financial institutions that the Company believes to be of high
credit standing. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to
accounts receivable are limited to certain customers to which
the Company makes substantial sales. The Company’s customer
base consists of a large number of geographically dispersed
customers diversified across several industries. To reduce risk,
the Company routinely assesses the financial strength of its
customers and, as a consequence, believes that its accounts
receivable credit risk exposure is limited. For the year ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003, one customer accounted for 10%
and 15%, respectively, of total revenue. For the year ended
December 31, 2002, no customers accounted for more than 10%
of total revenue. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, no
customer had an accounts receivable balance outstanding more
than 10% of total accounts receivable. As a result,
concentration of credit risk related to accounts receivable is
not significant.

Taxes

The Company’s provision for income taxes is comprised of a
current and deferred portion. The current income tax provision
is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on
tax returns for the current year. The deferred income tax
provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects
attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards using
expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the
differences are expected to reverse.

The Company currently has significant deferred tax assets,
resulting from net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit
carryforwards and deductible temporary differences. The Company
provides a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax
assets. Management weighs the positive and negative evidence to
determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the
deferred tax assets will be realized. Forming a conclusion that
a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is
negative evidence such as cumulative losses in past years.
Despite the Company’s profitability in 2004, as of
December 31, 2004, the Company has continued to maintain a
full valuation allowance on its tax benefits until profitability
has been sustained over a time period and in amounts that are
sufficient to support a conclusion that it is more likely than
not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be
realized. A decrease in the Company’s valuation allowance
would result in an immediate material income tax benefit, an
increase in total assets and stockholder’s equity and could
have a significant impact on earnings in future periods.

The Company has recorded certain tax reserves to address
potential exposures involving its sales and use and franchise
tax positions. These potential exposures result from the varying
application of statutes, rules, regulations and interpretations
by different jurisdictions. The Company’s estimate of the
value of its tax reserves contains assumptions based on past
experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes,
rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions. It is possible
that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or
less than the amount that the Company estimated.

Foreign Currency Translation

Akamai has determined that the functional currency of its
foreign subsidiaries is the subsidiary’s local currency.
The assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated
at the applicable exchange rate as of the balance sheet date and
revenues and expenses are translated at an average rate over the
period. Currency translation adjustments are recorded as a
component of other comprehensive loss. Gains and losses on
inter-company transactions are recorded in other income
(expense), net. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002, the Company recorded foreign currency gain (loss) of
$543,000, ($44,000) and $68,000, respectively.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash held in bank deposit
accounts and short-term, highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. Cash
equivalents are carried at amortized cost, which approximates
fair value. Restricted cash consists of cash not immediately
available that is restricted or segregated for uses other than
current operations. As of December 31, 2003, the Company
had $5.0 million of restricted cash that was restricted for
the repurchase of long-term debt. As of December 31, 2004,
the Company did not have restricted cash.

Short-term marketable securities consist of high quality
corporate and government securities with original maturities of
more than three months at the date of purchase and less than one
year from the date of the balance sheet. Long-term marketable
securities consist of high quality corporate and government
securities with maturities of more than one year from the date
of the balance sheet. Short-term and long-term marketable
securities include investments that are restricted as to use. As
of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had
$3.9 million and $4.0 million, respectively, of
restricted marketable securities representing irrevocable
letters of credit related to facility leases.

The Company classifies all debt securities and equity securities
with readily determinable market values as “available for
sale” in accordance with SFAS No. 115,
“Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities.” These investments are classified as marketable
securities on the consolidated balance sheet and are carried at
fair market value with unrealized gains and losses considered to
be temporary in nature reported as a separate component of other
comprehensive income (loss). Investments in the securities of
private companies are initially carried at cost. These
investments are included in other long-term assets on the
consolidated balance sheet. The Company reviews all investments
for reductions in fair value that are other-than-temporary. When
such reductions occur, the cost of the investment is adjusted to
fair value through loss on investments on the consolidated
statement of operations. Gains and losses on investments are
calculated on the basis of specific identification.

Accounts Receivable and Related Reserves

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts
and do not bear interest. In addition to trade accounts
receivable, the Company’s accounts receivable balance
includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue recorded for
customers which is typically billed within one month. The
Company records reserves against its accounts receivable
balance. These reserves consist of allowances for doubtful
accounts, cash basis customers and service credits. Increases
and decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are
included as a component of general and administrative expenses.
The Company’s reserve for cash basis customers increases as
services are provided to customers where collection is no longer
assured. The reserve decreases and revenue is recognized when
and if cash payments are received. The Company’s reserve
for service credits increases as a result of specific service
credits that are expected to be issued to customers during the
ordinary course of business, as well as for billing disputes.
These credits result in a reduction to revenues. Decreases to
the reserve are the result of actual credits being issued to
customers which have a corresponding reduction to accounts
receivable.



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Estimates are used in determining these reserves and are based
upon the Company’s review of outstanding balances on a
customer-specific, account-by-account basis. The allowance for
doubtful accounts is based upon a review of customer receivables
from prior sales with collection issues where the Company no
longer believes that the customer has the ability to pay for
prior services provided. The Company performs on-going credit
evaluations of its customers. If such an evaluation indicates
that payment is no longer reasonably assured for current
services provided, any future services provided to that customer
will result in the creation of a reserve until the Company
receives consistent payments. The Company evaluates customer
receivable balances and revises these reserves on a monthly
basis. In addition, the Company reserves a portion of revenues
as a reserve for service credits. Reserves for service credits
are measured based on an analysis of revenue credits to be
issued after the month of billing and an estimate for future
credits. These credits typically relate to management’s
estimate of the resolution of customer disputes and billing
adjustments. The Company does not have any off-balance sheet
credit exposure related to its customers.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost, net of accumulated
depreciation and amortization. Property and equipment includes
purchases with per unit value greater than $1,000 and a useful
life greater than one year. Depreciation and amortization are
computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over
the shorter of related lease terms or their estimated useful
lives. Property and equipment acquired under capital leases are
depreciated over the shorter of the related lease terms or the
useful lives of the assets. The Company periodically reviews the
estimated useful lives of property and equipment. Changes to the
estimated useful lives are recorded prospectively from the date
of the change. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of the assets
disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are removed
from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in
income (loss) from operations. Repairs and maintenance costs are
expensed as incurred.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The Company has recorded goodwill and intangible assets as a
result of several acquisitions. In accordance with
SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets,” which the Company adopted on January 1, 2002,
the Company reclassified the balance of unamortized assembled
workforce intangible assets to goodwill as of January 1,
2002. The Company performed an impairment test of goodwill as of
January 1, 2004 and 2005. These tests did not result in an
impairment to goodwill. In accordance with
SFAS No. 142, the Company discontinued the
amortization of goodwill as of January 2002. Other intangible
assets consist of completed technology and trademarks and trade
names arising from the acquisition of businesses and acquired
license rights. These intangible assets are amortized using the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.

Valuation of Other Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment under the guidance
of SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” Under
SFAS No. 144, long-lived assets are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as
service discontinuance, technological obsolescence, a change in
the Company’s market capitalization, facility closure or
work-force reductions indicate that the carrying amount of the
asset may not be recoverable. When such events occur, the
Company compares the carrying amount of the asset to the
undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset. If
this comparison indicates that an impairment is present, the
amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between
the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. If a
readily determinable market price does not exist, fair value is
estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to
the asset.

Restructuring Charges

A restructuring liability related to employee terminations is
recorded by the Company when a one-time benefit arrangement is
communicated to an employee who is involuntarily terminated as
part of a company-wide reorganization and the amount of the
termination benefit is known, provided that the employee is not
required to render future services in order to receive the
termination benefit.

The Company previously recorded restructuring expenses and
liabilities when management approved and committed the Company
to a plan to exit a facility lease, the plan related to leased
facilities specifically identified the actions to be taken and
the actions were scheduled to begin soon after management
approved the plan. Beginning in 2003, in accordance with
SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities,” the Company records
restructuring liabilities, discounted at the appropriate rate,
for facility leases only when the space is both vacated and all
actions needed to make the space readily available for sublease
have been completed. The Company records restructuring
liabilities for estimated costs to terminate a facility lease
before the end of its contractual term or for estimated costs
that will continue to be incurred under the lease for its
remaining term when there is no economic benefit to the Company,
net of an estimate of sublease income.

Litigation

The Company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings.
The Company estimates the range of liability related to pending
litigation where the amount and range of loss can be estimated.
The Company records its best estimate of a loss when the loss is
considered probable. Where a liability is probable and there is
a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range,
the Company records the minimum estimated liability related to
the claim. As additional information becomes available, the
Company reassesses the potential liability related to the
Company’s pending litigation and revises its estimate.

Advertising Expense

The Company recognizes advertising expense as incurred. The
Company recognized total advertising expense of $130,000,
$208,000 and $7.5 million for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Included in
advertising expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 is
amortization of $5.6 million related to the prepaid
advertising contract the Company acquired as a result of its
acquisition in April 2000 of InterVu, Inc. As of
December 31, 2002, this prepaid advertising asset was fully
amortized.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based
Payment (revised 2004),” which is a revision of SFAS No.
123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” and
supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees.” SFAS No. 123R requires all share-based
payments to employees, including grants of employee stock
options, to be valued at fair value on the date of grant, and to
be expensed over the applicable vesting period. Pro forma
disclosure of the income statement effects of share-based
payments is no longer an alternative. SFAS No. 123R is
effective for all stock-based awards granted on or after
July 1, 2005. The Company expects to adopt this standard in
July 2005 under the modified prospective transition method.
Under this method, a company records compensation expense for
all new awards and awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled
after the required effective date. In addition, companies must
also recognize compensation expense related to any awards that
are not fully vested as of the effective date. Compensation
expense for the unvested awards will be measured based on the
fair value of the awards previously calculated in developing the
pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
No. 123. The Company is currently assessing the impact of
adopting SFAS No. 123R to its consolidated results of
operations but expects that the adoption will have a material
impact.

In September 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force
(“EITF”) reached consensus on Issue 04-8,
“The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted
Earnings per Share.” EITF 04-8 provides guidance on
when the dilutive effect of contingently convertible debt
securities with a market trigger should be included in diluted
earnings per share (“EPS”). The guidance states that
these securities should be treated the same as other convertible
securities and included in diluted EPS computation, regardless
of whether the market price trigger has been met. EITF 04-8
is effective for all periods ending after December 15, 2004
and is applied retrospectively. As a result of the adoption of
EITF 04-8, the Company’s 1% convertible senior
notes, convertible into 12.9 million shares, are now
included in diluted earnings per share computation for the year
ended December 31, 2004, which has resulted in a reduction
in diluted earnings per share of $0.01 for that period.

Net Income (Loss) per Share:

Basic net income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed using the

As of December 31, 2004, $4.6 million of the
Company’s marketable securities were classified as
restricted. These securities primarily represent irrevocable
letters of credit in favor of third-party beneficiaries, mostly
related to facility leases. The letters of credit are
collateralized by restricted marketable securities, of which
$3.7 million are classified as long-term marketable
securities and $932,000 are classified as short-term marketable
securities on the consolidated balance sheets. The restrictions
on these marketable securities lapse as the Company fulfills its
obligations or such obligations expire as provided by the
letters of credit. These restrictions are expected to lapse at
various times through May 2009. As of December 31, 2003,
$5.0 million of the Company’s cash was classified as
restricted. The $5.0 million represented cash held by a
third party at December 31, 2003 reflecting a commitment by
the Company to repurchase $5.0 million in aggregate
principal amount of its


/


% convertible
subordinated notes. The $5.0 million cash payment was made
in January 2004.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company recorded
net losses on investments of approximately $69,000 on the sales
of marketable securities. For the year ended December 31,
2003, the Company recorded net gains on investments of
$1.6 million, which includes a gain of $1.7 million
related to the sale of equity investments in publicly-traded
companies offset by losses of $55,000 on the sales of
investments in privately-held companies and sales of marketable
securities.

For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded
loss on investments of $6.1 million, including
$4.1 million of net investment losses for investments in
related parties. Loss on investments during 2002 includes a loss
of $4.3 million for the Company’s investment in
Netaxs, Inc., a related party, which was realized as a result of
a merger transaction between Netaxs and FASTNET Corporation in
April 2002. Loss on investments also includes a related party
investment gain of $400,000 on the Company’s sale of its
equity ownership in Akamai Technologies Japan KK to Softbank
Broadmedia Corporation (“SBBM”). In addition, in 2002,
the Company recorded losses of $1.4 million, including
$150,000 for a related party investment, to adjust the cost
basis of its equity investments in publicly-traded companies to
fair value as a result of reductions in the market values of
such investments that, in the opinion of management, were
other-than-temporary. During 2002, the Company also recorded a
loss of $960,000 to adjust the carrying amount of its investment
in a privately-held company to its estimated fair value. Loss on
investments in 2002 also included approximately $149,000 of
realized investment gains.

value. The Company identifies the impaired equipment, consisting
of servers that were not used in the Company’s deployed
network system, through a comparison of assets confirmed to
exist, through either a physical count or remote electronic
identification of the asset, to the net book value of the asset
as maintained in its financial systems. These impairment losses
were recorded as additional depreciation expense and are
included in cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of
operations for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003.
During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company
recorded an impairment charge of $979,000, which is included in
depreciation expense, for certain impaired long-lived

assets, consisting of computer and network equipment, furniture
and fixtures and licensed software. Additionally, during the
year ended December 31, 2002, the Company accelerated the
amortization of leasehold improvements at its headquarters
facility located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, as a result of the
move to a new facility. The acceleration of these leasehold
improvements resulted in an increase to amortization expense of
$5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.

During the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, as a
result of restructuring actions undertaken by the Company, the
Company wrote-down approximately $272,000 and $3.2 million,
respectively, of leasehold improvements and furniture and
fixtures. The Company recorded these impairments as non-cash
restructuring charges. (See Note 12). No impairments have
been recorded during the year ended December 31, 2004 as a
result of restructuring activities.

In January 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 143,
“Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,”
(“SFAS No. 143”). SFAS No. 143
addresses the accounting and reporting requirements for
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible
long-lived assets. As a result of adopting this statement, the
Company recorded an asset retirement obligation and associated
long-lived asset of $109,000 as of January 1, 2003 for the
fair value of a contractual obligation to remove leasehold
improvements at the conclusion of the Company’s facility
lease in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The obligation and asset are
classified on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as
of December 31, 2004 as non-current liabilities and
property and equipment, respectively. The Company will amortize
the asset and accrete the obligation over the remaining

December 31, 2004, the Company has approximately $118,000
recorded as the non-current asset obligation.

8.     Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets:

The Company acquired goodwill and other intangible assets
through business acquisitions during 2000. The Company also
acquired license rights from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in 1999. The Company reviews goodwill and other
intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets
may exceed their fair value.

The Company adopted SFAS No. 142 in January 2002.
Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 142, the carrying
amount of goodwill was $4.0 million. In accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No. 142, the Company reclassified
to goodwill its assembled workforce intangible assets of
approximately $1.0 million. SFAS No. 142 requires
the Company to test goodwill for impairment at least annually.
The Company concluded that it had one reporting unit and
assigned the entire balance of goodwill to this reporting unit
as of January 1, 2004 and 2005 for purposes of performing
an impairment test. The fair value of the reporting unit was
determined using the Company’s market capitalization as of
January 1, 2004 and 2005. The fair value on January 1,
2004 and 2005 exceeded the net assets of the reporting unit,
including goodwill, as of both dates. Accordingly, the Company
concluded that no impairment existed as of these dates. Unless
changes in events or circumstances indicate that an impairment
test is required, the Company will next test goodwill for
impairment on January 1, 2006. In accordance with
SFAS No. 142, the Company discontinued the
amortization of goodwill as of January 1, 2002.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 142, the
Company’s other intangible assets consisted of completed
technology, trademarks and trade names, assembled workforce and
acquired license rights. In 2002, the Company reclassified
assembled workforce to goodwill and concluded that the remaining
intangible assets had definite useful lives equivalent to their
original useful lives. During the first quarter of 2002, the
Company discontinued sales of a service line that utilized
technology acquired as part of its acquisition of Network


Communications, Inc. (“Network


”) in
February 2000 and recorded an impairment loss of
$2.3 million to adjust the intangible assets related to the
Network


technology to their fair value. The impairment
loss was included in amortization of other intangible assets.

Amortization expense for other intangible assets was $48,000,
$2.2 million and $11.9 million for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decline
in intangible amortization expense is due to the full
amortization of completed technology and trademarks and trade
names. Amortization expense is expected to be $48,000 in 2005
and in each year thereafter through 2008, at which time such
assets will have been fully amortized.

Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees:

Operating and Capital
Leases

The Company leases its facilities and certain equipment under
non-cancelable operating leases. These operating leases expire
at various dates through April 2010 and generally require the
payment of real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and
operating costs. The Company also leases certain equipment under
capital leases, which expire at various dates through September
2005. The minimum aggregate future obligations under
non-cancelable leases as of December 31, 2004 are as
follows (in thousands):

Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002 was $5.6 million, $6.0 million and
$9.6 million, respectively. The Company has entered into
sublease agreements with tenants of various properties
previously vacated by the Company. The contracted amounts
payable to the Company by these sublease tenants are

AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company has issued letters of credit in the amount of
$3.9 million related to certain of its real estate leases.
These letters of credit are collateralized by marketable
securities that have been restricted as to use (see
Note 5). The letters of credit expire as the Company
fulfills its operating lease obligations. Certain of the
Company’s facility leases include rent escalation clauses.
The Company normalizes rent expense on a straight-line basis
over the term of the lease for known changes in lease payments
over the life of the lease.

Purchase Commitments

The Company has long-term commitments for bandwidth usage and
co-location with various networks and ISPs. For the years ending
December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, the minimum commitments
are approximately $9.7 million, $456,000 and $41,000,
respectively. The Company had aggregate equipment purchase
commitments of approximately $500,000 as of December 31,
2004. This purchase commitment expires in August 2005.
Additionally, as of December 31, 2004, the Company has
entered into purchase orders with various vendors for aggregate
purchase commitments of $5.1 million which is expected to
be paid in 2005.

Litigation

Between July 2, 2001 and November 7, 2001, purported
class action lawsuits seeking monetary damages were filed in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York against the Company as well as against the underwriters of
its October 28, 1999 initial public offering of common
stock. The complaints were filed allegedly on behalf of persons
who purchased the Company’s common stock during different
time periods, all beginning on October  28, 1999 and
ending on various dates. The complaints are similar and allege
violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 primarily based on the allegation that the
underwriters received undisclosed compensation in connection
with the Company’s initial public offering. On
April 19, 2002, a single consolidated amended complaint was
filed, reiterating in one pleading the allegations contained in
the previously filed separate actions. The consolidated amended
complaint defines the alleged class period as October 28,
1999 through December 6, 2000. A Special Litigation
Committee of Akamai’s Board of Directors authorized
management to negotiate a settlement of the pending claims
substantially consistent with a Memorandum of Understanding that
was negotiated among class plaintiffs, all issuer defendants and
their insurers. The parties negotiated a settlement which is
subject to approval by the Court. On February 15, 2005, the
Court issued an Opinion and Order preliminarily approving the
settlement, provided that the defendants and plaintiffs agree to
a modification narrowing the scope of the bar order set forth in
the original settlement agreement. The Company believes that it
has meritorious defenses to the claims made in the complaint
and, if the settlement is not finalized and approved, it intends
to contest the lawsuit vigorously. An adverse resolution of the
action could have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s financial condition and results of operations in
the period in which the lawsuit is resolved. The Company is not
presently able to estimate potential losses, if any, related to
this lawsuit.

In February 2002, the Company filed suit against Speedera
Networks, Inc., or Speedera, in federal court in Massachusetts,
alleging patent infringement and false advertising by Speedera.
In April 2003, the Company amended its complaint to include an
allegation that Speedera infringes a newly-issued content
delivery patent held by MIT and licensed to Akamai. In response,
Speedera filed a counterclaim in this case alleging that Akamai
has infringed a Speedera patent relating to the combined
provision of traffic management and content delivery services.
In June 2004, Speedera amended its counterclaim to include a
second patent covering a similar service it offers. The Company
believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims made in
the counterclaim and intends to contest such claims vigorously;
however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be
successful. The Company is not presently able to reasonably
estimate potential losses, if any, related to this counterclaim.



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In June 2002, the Company filed suit against Speedera in
California Superior Court alleging theft of Akamai trade secrets
from an independent company that provides website performance
testing services. In connection with this suit, in September
2002, the Court issued a preliminary injunction to restrain
Speedera from continuing to access the Company’s
confidential information from the independent company’s
database and from using any data obtained from such access. In
October 2002, Speedera filed a cross-claim against the Company
seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief and alleging that
the Company engaged in various unfair trade practices, made
false and misleading statements and engaged in unfair
competition. A trial date has been set for April 18, 2005.
The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the
claims made in Speedera’s cross-claim and intends to
contest the allegations vigorously; however, there can be no
assurance that the Company will be successful. The Company is
not presently able to reasonably estimate potential losses, if
any, related to this cross-claim.

In November 2002, the Company filed suit against Speedera in
federal court in Massachusetts for infringement of a patent held
by Akamai. In January 2003, Speedera filed a counterclaim in
this case alleging that Akamai has infringed a patent held by
Speedera. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses
to the claims made in the counterclaim and intends to contest
such claims vigorously; however, there can be no assurance that
the Company will be successful. The Company is not presently
able to reasonably estimate potential losses, if any, related to
this counterclaim.

Guarantees

The Company has identified the guarantees described below as
disclosable in accordance with FASB Interpretation 45
(“FIN 45”), “Guarantor’s Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others an interpretation of FASB

Interpretation No. 34.” The Company evaluates
estimated losses for guarantees under SFAS 5,
“Accounting for Contingencies, as Interpreted by

to claims relating to infringement of a U.S. patent, or any
copyright or other intellectual property or the Company’s
negligence, willful misconduct or violation of the law (provided

joint venture partner against property damage or bodily injury
arising from the Company’s negligence or willful
misconduct; third party claims of copyright infringement or
trade secret theft associated with the software or marks
licensed from the Company by the partner; and losses arising

on June 15, 2004. Interest of $1.0 million was paid to
the holders of the 1% convertible senior notes in June 2004
and in December 2004. The 1% convertible senior notes are
senior unsecured obligations and are the same rank as all
existing and future senior indebtedness of Akamai. The
1% convertible senior notes rank senior to all of our
subordinated indebtedness, including the

Restructurings and Lease Terminations:

As of December 31, 2004, the Company had approximately
$3.6 million remaining of accrued restructuring
liabilities. No restructuring charges were recorded during the
year ended December 31, 2004. During the year ended
December 31, 2003, the Company recorded restructuring
benefits of $8.5 million. As a result of amendments to or
terminations of long-term leases, the Company reversed
$9.6 million of previously recorded restructuring
liabilities, offset by a restructuring charge of
$1.1 million for costs relating to the restructuring of a
facility located in Europe. The reversals represent the
difference between the amount previously estimated for
restructuring liabilities and the amounts payable under
negotiated agreements for certain leased properties with
applicable landlords.

During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company
recorded restructuring charges of $45.8 million. These
charges included $3.6 million for employee severance
benefit costs and $42.2 million for facility leases of
which $39.0 million represents actual and estimated
termination and modification costs, less estimated

impairment of leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures
related to the these facilities.

The following table summarizes the accrual and usage of the
restructuring charges (in millions):

The restructuring liabilities will be fully paid through August
2007. The amount of restructuring liabilities associated with
facility leases has been estimated based on the most recent
available market data and discussions with the Company’s
lessors and real estate advisors as to the likelihood that the
Company will be able to partially offset its obligations with
sublease income. As of December 31, 2004, there is
approximately $66,000 of sublease income included in the
restructuring balance.

    Stock:

On September 10, 2002, the Board of Directors of the
Company declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase
right for each outstanding share of the Company’s common
stock held by stockholders of record at the close of business on
September 23, 2002. To implement the rights plan, the Board
of Directors designated 700,000 shares of the
Company’s 5.0 million authorized shares of
undesignated preferred stock as Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per share.
Each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the
Company one one-thousandth of a share of preferred stock at a
purchase price of $9.00 in cash, subject to adjustment. No
shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock are
outstanding as of December 31, 2004. In January 2004, the
Board of Directors of the Company approved an amendment to the
rights plan in which the purchase price of each right issued
under the plan increased from $9.00 per share to
$65.00 per share.

Stock Plans:

In 1998, the Board of Directors adopted the 1998 Stock Incentive
Plan (the “1998 Plan”) for the issuance of incentive
and nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards and
other types of equity awards. Options to purchase common stock
and other equity awards are granted at the discretion of the
Board of Directors and in certain circumstances a committee
designated by the Board of Directors. In December 2001, the
Board of Directors adopted the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan (the
“2001 Plan”) for the issuance of nonqualified stock
options, restricted stock and other types of equity awards. The
total number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance
under the 1998 Plan and the 2001 Plan is 48,255,600 and
5,000,000 shares, respectively. Equity incentives may not
be issued to the Company’s directors or executive officers
under the 2001 Plan.

Under the terms of the 1998 Plan, the exercise price of
incentive stock options granted must not be less than 100% (110%
in certain cases) of the fair market value of the common stock
on the date of grant, as determined by the Board of Directors.
Incentive stock options may not be issued under the 2001 Plan.
The exercise price of nonqualified stock options issued under
the 1998 Plan and the 2001 Plan may be less than the fair market
value of the common stock on the date of grant, as determined by
the Board of Directors, but in no case may the exercise price be
less than the statutory minimum. Stock option vesting is
typically four years and is at the discretion of the Board of
Directors. The term of options granted may not exceed ten years,
or five years for incentive stock options granted to holders of
more than 10% of the voting stock of the Company.

Restricted stock awards may be issued under the 1998 Plan to
directors, officers, advisors and employees at prices determined
by the Board of Directors. Participants’ unvested shares
are subject to repurchase by the Company at the original
purchase price for between two and four years. Generally, 25% of
the shares vest between six months and one year of the date of
purchase and, thereafter, the remaining shares vest on a
quarterly basis through the fourth anniversary date of purchase.
As of December 31, 2004, the Company had the right to
repurchase up to 5,188 unvested shares at a price of
$0.01 per share.

The Company has assumed certain stock option plans and the
outstanding stock options of companies that it has acquired
(“Assumed Plans”). Stock options under the Assumed
Plans have been converted into the Company’s stock options
and adjusted to effect the appropriate conversion ratio as
specified by the applicable acquisition agreement, but are
otherwise administered in accordance with the terms of the
Assumed Plans. Stock options under the Assumed Plans generally
vest over four years and expire ten years from the date of
grant. No additional stock options will be granted under the
Assumed Plans.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In August 1999, the Board of Directors adopted the 1999 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (“1999 ESPP”). The Company
reserved 600,000 shares of common stock for issuance under
the 1999 ESPP. In May 2001, the Company approved an increase to
the amount of shares reserved for issuance under the 1999 ESPP
to 3,100,000. In May 2002, the stockholders of the Company
approved an amendment to the 1999 ESPP that allows for an
automatic increase in the number of shares of common stock
available under the 1999 ESPP each June 1 and
December 1 to restore the number of shares available for
issuance to 1.5 million shares, provided that the aggregate
number of shares issuable under the 1999 ESPP shall not exceed
20,000,000. The 1999 ESPP provides for a two-year offering
period that includes four six-month purchase periods and allows
participating employees to purchase shares of common stock at a
15% discount from the fair market value of the stock as
determined on specific dates at six-month intervals. As of
December 31, 2004, approximately $536,000 had been withheld
from employees for future purchases under the 1999 ESPP.

Equity-related compensation is comprised of the amortization of
deferred compensation, equity award modifications, equity
bonuses, equity awards to non-employees and employees and the
forgiveness of notes receivable issued in connection with the
sale of restricted common stock (see Note 14).

(a)

Deferred Compensation:

Deferred compensation is recorded for the grant of stock awards
or shares of restricted stock to employees or non-employees at
exercise or sale prices deemed to be less than the fair market
value of the Company’s common stock on the grant date.
Deferred compensation is adjusted to reflect cancellations and
forfeitures due to employee terminations. For the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, equity-related
compensation includes $1.1 million, $7.9 million and
$18.1 million, respectively, of deferred compensation
amortization. Equity-related compensation for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was affected by the
following:

Exchange Offer

In April 2001, the Company communicated to its employees an
offer to exchange (the “Exchange Offer”) certain
eligible employee stock options previously granted to them in
return for restricted shares of Akamai common stock at an
exchange ratio of two stock options for one share of restricted
stock. In addition, certain stock options granted in February
2001 were eligible to be exchanged at a ratio of one stock
option for two shares of restricted stock. Employees who
accepted the Exchange Offer were required to exchange any stock
option granted to them after November 3, 2000 (regardless
of the exercise price of any such stock option) and to forfeit
certain stock options granted to them in October 2000. Until the
restricted stock vested, such shares were subject to forfeiture
for up to three years from May 2001 in the event the employee
left the Company. Generally, 25% of the shares vested after six
months and the remaining 75% of the shares vested quarterly
thereafter until the third anniversary of the effective date of
the Exchange Offer. On April 4, 2001, the Company filed the
Exchange Offer as a tender offer with the Securities and
Exchange Commission in accordance with Rule 13e-4 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Exchange Offer
was effective on May 5, 2001, and the Company accepted all
stock options tendered.

As a result of the Exchange Offer, stock options to purchase
approximately 6.6 million shares of Akamai common stock
were exchanged for approximately 3.4 million shares of
restricted stock. In accordance with FASB Interpretation
No. 44, “Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving
Stock Compensation, an Interpretation of APB Opinion
No. 25,” the Company recorded $36.1 million as
deferred compensation for the intrinsic value of the restricted
stock issued to employees who accepted the Exchange Offer. The
deferred compensation is being amortized over the vesting period
of the restricted stock. In May 2004, these restricted shares
became fully vested. For the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, $335,000, $3.9 million and
$5.9 million, respectively, were amortized to
equity-related compensation. As of December 31, 2004,
1.4 million shares had been forfeited and retired as a
result of employee terminations, resulting in a reduction in
deferred compensation of $14.4 million.

Restricted Stock and Stock Option Awards

During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company issued
275,000 shares of restricted stock to officers in exchange
for the cancellation of previously issued stock options. The
Company recorded deferred compensation of $278,000 for the
intrinsic value of the restricted stock, which will be amortized
over the vesting period. As of December 31, 2004, these
shares were fully vested. The Company amortized $64,000,
$136,000 and $26,000 to equity-related compensation for these
awards during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively. During the year ended December 31,
2004, as a result of the acceleration of vesting of shares of
restricted stock upon termination of an employee, the Company
recorded $52,000 relating to outstanding stock-based
compensation as equity-related compensation expense.



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In 2001, deferred compensation was increased by
$15.1 million as a result of the issuance of
2.2 million shares of restricted common stock at a purchase
price of $0.01 per share and the grant of options to
purchase 53,000 shares of common stock at an exercise
price of $1.17 per share. The deferred compensation will be
amortized over the vesting periods of the equity awards. For the
years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, $227,000,
$1.1 million and $5.0 million, respectively, was
amortized to equity-related compensation for these awards. As of
December 31, 2004, 855,000 shares had been repurchased
and retired by the Company as a result of employee terminations,
resulting in a reduction in deferred compensation of
approximately $185,000 and $1.4 million for the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. No shares were
repurchased during 2004.

Deferred Stock Units

In August 2003, the Company granted 30,000 deferred stock units
(“DSUs”) under the Company’s 1998 Stock Incentive
Plan, as amended, to each of the five non-employee members of
its Board of Directors. These DSUs vest in three equal annual
installments over the three-year period following the grant
date, so long as the holder continues to provide service as a
director of the Company. During 2003, the Company recorded
deferred compensation of $615,000 for the intrinsic value of the
DSUs. The deferred compensation is being recognized as
compensation expense over the expected three-year vesting
period. In June 2004, the Company granted an additional 39,062
DSUs to non-employee members of its Board of Directors. The DSUs
vest 50% on May 25, 2005 with the remaining 50% vesting in
equal installments of 12.5% each quarter thereafter. During
2004, the Company recorded deferred compensation of $601,000 for
the intrinsic value of these DSUs. The deferred compensation is
being recognized as compensation expense over the expected
two-year vesting period. Each of the DSUs granted in 2004 and
2003 represents the right to receive one share of the
Company’s common stock upon vesting. The holder may elect
to defer receipt of all or a portion of the vested shares of
stock represented by the DSU for a period for at least one year
but not more than ten years from the grant date. For the years
ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company amortized
approximately $360,000 and $70,000, respectively, to
equity-related compensation for these awards.

(b)

Equity Award Modifications:

Equity-related compensation includes the intrinsic value of
modified stock options or restricted stock awards that would
have expired as unexercisable had the associated vesting of the
awards not been accelerated upon the termination of the
employee. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, equity-related compensation includes approximately
$52,000, $107,000 and $3.2 million, respectively, for
equity award modifications.

(c)

Equity Bonus Awards:

Equity-related compensation includes the intrinsic value of
equity awards issued to employees as incentive bonuses. These
awards are issued quarterly and annually in accordance with
incentive bonus plans. No equity bonus awards were granted in
2004 and 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2002,
equity-related compensation includes $1.4 million for
equity bonuses. Equity bonuses in 2002 consisted of the grant of
options to purchase 1.4 million shares of common stock
at a weighted average exercise price of $0.47 per share.

(d)

Equity Awards Issued to Non-Employees:

The Company has issued equity awards to advisors and other
non-employees. The Company recognizes the fair value of these
awards in equity-related compensation over the vesting period
for the awards pursuant to the requirements of
SFAS No. 123.



AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

During 2003, certain employees terminated their employment with
Akamai but continued to provide services to the Company as
consultants. Despite the employees’ change in status,
outstanding equity awards held by such individuals will vest in
accordance with the terms of their original agreements or
amendments thereto. The Company began measuring and recognizing
the fair value of the outstanding awards commencing upon the
change in the individual’s employment status. During the
years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company
recorded $92,000 and $503,000, respectively, of compensation
expense related to equity awards held by these individuals.
Additionally, during 2003, the Company recorded $244,000 of
compensation expense for modified restricted stock awards that
would have expired as unexercisable had the associated vesting
of the awards not been accelerated upon the termination of the
non-employee’s service contract.

Warrants

Prior to its initial public offering in October 1999, the
Company issued warrants to investors in connection with
borrowings. The Company also became obligated to honor warrants
that had been issued by acquired businesses.

During 2004 and 2003, warrant holders acquired 6,858 and
506,736 shares, respectively, of common stock through
warrant exercises. In lieu of the exercise price of these
warrants, the holders surrendered to Akamai additional warrants
to purchase 1,836 and 447,462 shares of common stock
as consideration during 2004 and 2003, respectively. These
transactions were in accordance with the terms of the original

these warrants to common stock and additional paid in capital at
par value of $0.01. As of December 31, 2004, no warrants
were outstanding.

The Company formed Akamai Australia in August 2002 as a joint
venture with ES Group Ventures Pty Ltd
(“ES Ventures”). The Company owned 40% of Akamai
Australia and accounted for its investment under the equity
method. No losses of the joint venture were recognized because
Akamai’s basis in its investment in Akamai Australia was
zero. Upon inception of the joint venture, the Company entered
into a five-year distribution agreement with Akamai Australia
under which Akamai Australia was required to make quarterly
payments to the Company in accordance with minimum resale
commitments. In June 2003, Akamai and ES Ventures
terminated the joint venture. In accordance with the termination
agreement, Akamai removed its representatives from the joint
venture’s board of directors and surrendered its 40%
interest in the entity. ES Ventures agreed to wind down the
affairs of the joint venture and was responsible for settling
all of the joint venture’s obligations. The distribution
agreement was terminated, and Akamai forgave all amounts due
under the agreement. The Company purchased all customer
contracts from the former joint venture for a fee of $472,000
and agreed to continue to service these customers under the
terms of their existing contracts. The fee was recorded as an
asset and was fully amortized against the revenue of these
customers during the year ended December 31, 2003.

In December 2002, Akamai sold its 40% equity interest in Akamai
Technologies Japan K.K., formerly a joint venture between Akamai
and Softbank Broadmedia (“SBBM”). For the year ended
December 31, 2002, the Company recognized $4.1 million
under a reseller agreement with Akamai Technologies Japan K.K.
Akamai also recognized $4.8 million under a technology
license agreement with SBBM during the year ended
December 31, 2002 which was considered a related party at
the time the revenue was recognized due to SBBM’s
relationship with Akamai Technologies Japan K.K. In January
2003, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary in Japan
through which it sells Akamai services and supports its reseller
relationships.

From January 2001 to November 2002, the Company held a 40%
equity interest in Sockeye Networks, Inc., which was accounted
for under the equity method. During this period, the Company
recognized $2.0 million of equity method losses, which are
included in loss on investments for the year ended
December 31, 2001. In November 2002, the Company
significantly reduced its equity interest in Sockeye and, as of
March 31, 2003, there was no longer an Akamai
representative serving on Sockeye’s board of directors. As
of September 30, 2003, the Company accounted for this
investment under the cost method due to the significant
reduction in ownership interest. In October 2003, Sockeye was
acquired by Internap Network Services Corporation. Akamai did
not receive any cash or other consideration as a result of the
merger and no longer holds any equity interest in Sockeye or its
successor.

Subsequent Events

On March 16, 2005, the Company entered into an agreement to
acquire all of the outstanding common and preferred stock,
including vested and unvested stock options, of Speedera
Networks, Inc. (“Speedera”) by issuing approximately
12 million shares of Akamai common stock, valued at
approximately $130 million based on the closing stock price
of the Akamai common stock on the NASDAQ National Market on
March 15, 2005. The acquisition is expected to be accounted
for by Akamai under the purchase method of accounting and is
expected to close during the quarter ended June 30, 2005,
subject to various regulatory approvals. The merger agreement
provides for a stay of all existing litigation between the
Company and Speedera until the closing of the merger or any
earlier termination of the merger agreement. Upon the closing,
all lawsuits between the Company and Speedera would be released.

Controls and Procedures

(a)

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2004.
Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31,
2004, our disclosure controls and procedures were
(1) effective in that they were designed to ensure that
material information relating to us, including our consolidated
subsidiaries, is made known to our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer by others within those entities,
particularly during the period in which this report was being
prepared and (2) effective, in that they provide reasonable
assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the
reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s rules and forms.

(b)

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal
control over financial reporting is defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or
under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal
financial officers and effected by the company’s board of
directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of the assets of the company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
    that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
    only in accordance with authorizations of management and
    directors of the company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004. In making this assessment, our
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO) in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

.

Based on our assessment, management concluded that, as of
December 31, 2004, our internal control over financial
reporting was effective based on those criteria at the
reasonable assurance level.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their Report which is included in
Item 8 of this annual report Form 10-K.



(c)

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

No changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act) occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31,
2004 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
