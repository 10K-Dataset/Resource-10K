TABLE OF
    CONTENTS


PART I

ITEM 1.

Business.

Overview

Discovery Communications, Inc. (“Discovery”, we”,
    “us” or “our”) is a leading global media and
    entertainment company that provides original and purchased
    programming across multiple distribution platforms in the United
    States (U.S.) and approximately 170 other countries, with over
    100 television networks offering customized programming in
    35 languages. We also develop and sell consumer and
    educational products and services as well as media sound
    services in the U.S. and internationally. In addition, we
    own and operate a diversified portfolio of website properties
    and other digital services.

We were formed on September 17, 2008 in connection with
    Discovery Holding Company (“DHC”) and Advance/Newhouse
    Programming Partnership (“Advance/Newhouse”) combining
    their respective ownership interests in Discovery Communications
    Holding, LLC (“DCH”) and exchanging those interests
    with and into Discovery (the “Newhouse Transaction”).
    Prior to the Newhouse Transaction, DCH was a stand-alone private
    company, which was owned approximately


/


%
    by DHC and


/


%
    by Advance/Newhouse. The Newhouse Transaction was completed as
    follows:

•

On September 17, 2008, DHC completed the spin-off to its
    shareholders of Ascent Media Corporation (“AMC”), a
    subsidiary holding the cash and businesses of DHC, except for
    certain businesses that provide sound, music, mixing, sound
    effects, and other related services (“Creative Sound
    Services” or “CSS”) (the “AMC
    spin-off”) (such businesses remain with us following the
    completion of the Newhouse Transaction).

•

On September 17, 2008, immediately following the AMC
    spin-off, DHC merged with a transitory merger subsidiary owned
    by us, with DHC continuing as the surviving entity and as a
    wholly-owned subsidiary owned by us.

•

On September 17, 2008, immediately following the exchange
    of shares between us and DHC, Advance/Newhouse contributed its
    ownership interests in DCH and Animal Planet to us in exchange
    for our Series A and Series C convertible preferred
    stock. The preferred stock is convertible at any time into our
    common stock representing


/


%
    of our common stock issued in connection with the Newhouse
    Transaction.

As a result of the Newhouse Transaction, we became the successor
    reporting entity to DHC under the Securities Exchange Act of
    1934, as amended. Because Advance/Newhouse was a one-third owner
    of ours prior to the completion of the Newhouse Transaction and
    is a one-third owner immediately following completion of the
    Newhouse Transaction, there was no effective change in
    ownership. Our convertible preferred stock does not have any
    special dividend rights and only a de minimis liquidation
    preference. Additionally, Advance/Newhouse retains significant
    participatory special class voting rights with respect to
    certain matters that could be submitted to a shareholder vote.

The following diagrams illustrate, at a summary level, the
    ownership interests between us, DHC, Advance/Newhouse, and DCH
    prior and subsequent to the Newhouse Transaction. The diagrams
    are in general terms and are not comprehensive. They reflect the
    economic substance of the Newhouse Transaction, but do not
    precisely reflect the legal and corporate entities used to
    implement the Newhouse Transaction. Additionally, the
    contribution of Advance/Newhouse’s interest in Animal
    Planet L.P. is not reflected in the diagrams because the value
    of this contribution was insignificant relative to the value of
    the overall transaction.



Structure
    Prior to the Newhouse Transaction

Structure
    Subsequent to the Newhouse Transaction and AMC
    Spin-off

Our media content spans nonfiction genres including science,
    exploration, survival, natural history, sustainability of the
    environment, technology, anthropology, paleontology, history,
    space, archaeology, health and wellness, engineering, adventure,
    lifestyles and current events. This type of programming tends to
    be culturally neutral and maintains its relevance for an
    extended period of time. As a result, our content translates
    well across international borders and is made even more
    accessible through extensive use of dubbing and subtitles in
    local languages, as well as the creation of local programming
    tailored to individual market preferences.

Our content is designed to target key audience demographics and
    the popularity of our programming offers a compelling reason for
    advertisers to purchase time on our channels. Our audience
    ratings are a key driver in generating advertising revenue and
    creating demand on the part of cable television operators,

direct-to-home

or “DTH” satellite operators, telephone and
    communications companies, and other content distributors to
    deliver our programming to their customers.

We have an extensive library of over 100,000 hours of
    programming and footage that provides a high-quality source of
    content for creating new services and launching into new markets
    and onto new platforms. We generally own most or all rights to
    the majority of this programming and footage, which enables us
    to exploit our library to launch new brands and services into
    new markets quickly without significant incremental



spending. Programming can be re-edited and updated to provide in
    a cost-effective manner topical versions of subject matter that
    can be utilized around the world.

In addition to growing distribution and advertising revenue for
    our branded channels, we are focused on growing revenue across
    new distribution platforms, including brand-aligned web
    properties, mobile devices,

video-on-demand

and broadband channels, which serve as additional outlets for
    advertising and affiliate sales, and provide promotional
    platforms for our television programming. We also operate
    internet sites such as HowStuffWorks.com, Treehugger.com, and
    Petfinder.com that provide supplemental news, information, and
    entertainment aligned with our television programming.

We are also exploiting our programming assets to take advantage
    of the growing demand for high definition (HD) programming in
    the U.S. and throughout the world. In 2008, we provided HD
    simulcasts of five of our U.S. Networks (Discovery Channel,
    TLC, Animal Planet, Science Channel and Planet Green) in
    addition to our U.S. HD Theater service, which was launched
    in 2002. In 2008, we also expanded our international HD
    operations to include HD channels in 23 countries outside of the
    U.S., making us one of the leading international providers of HD
    programming, based on the number of markets we serve. We believe
    we are well positioned to take advantage of the accelerating
    growth in sales of HD televisions and Blu-ray DVD players, and
    the expanding distribution of HD channels around the world.
    Where we operate HD simulcasts of our networks, we also benefit
    from the ability to aggregate audiences for advertising sales
    purposes.

Strategy

Our strategy is to deliver sustainable long-term growth at or
    above the levels our peers achieve through the development of
    high-quality media brands that build consumer viewership,
    optimize distribution growth and capture advertising sales. In
    addition, we are focused on maximizing the overall efficiency
    and effectiveness of our global operations through collaboration
    and innovation across operating units and regions around the
    world, and across all television and digital platforms.

In line with this strategy, our specific priorities include:

•

Maintaining our focus on creative excellence in nonfiction
    programming and expanding the portfolio’s brand recognition
    by developing compelling content that increases audience growth,
    builds advertising relationships, has global utility and
    supports continued distribution revenue growth on all platforms.

•

Exploiting our distribution strength in the U.S. —
    with three channels reaching more than 90 million
    U.S. subscribers each and seven channels reaching between
    45 million to 73 million U.S. subscribers
    each — to build additional branded channels and
    businesses that can sustain long-term growth and occupy a
    desired programming niche with strong consumer appeal. For
    example, in 2008, we repositioned two emerging television
    networks — Investigation Discovery and Planet
    Green — to build stronger consumer brands through
    specific category ownership that supports more passionate
    audience loyalty and increased advertiser and affiliate interest
    and integration. In late 2009 or early 2010, the current
    Discovery Health is expected to be repositioned as OWN: The
    Oprah Winfrey Network.

•

Maintaining a leadership position in nonfiction entertainment in
    international markets, and continuing to grow and improve the
    performance of the international operations. This will be
    achieved through expanding local advertising sales capabilities,
    creating licensing and digital growth opportunities, exploiting
    broadcast and other additional distribution platform
    opportunities in selected markets, and improving operating
    efficiencies by strengthening development and promotional
    collaboration between U.S. and International Network groups.

•

Developing and growing compelling and profitable content
    experiences on new platforms that are aligned with our core
    branded channels. Specifically, extending ownership of
    nonfiction entertainment and “satisfying curiosity” to
    all digital media devices around the world to enhance the
    consumer entertainment experience, further monetize our
    extensive programming library, and create additional vehicles
    through which to offer new products and services that deliver
    new revenue streams.



We operate through three segments: (1) U.S. Networks,
    (2) International Networks, and (3) Commerce,
    Education, and Other. Financial information related to our
    operating segments can be found in Note 24 to our
    consolidated financial statements found in Part II of this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

U.S.
    Networks

Reaching approximately 717 million cumulative subscribers
    (as defined below) in the United States as of December 31,
    2008, and having one of the industry’s most widely
    distributed portfolios of brands, U.S. Networks delivers 11
    cable and satellite television channels in the United States.
    The portfolio includes three channels that each reach more than
    90 million U.S. subscribers and seven channels that

    distribution and advertising sales services for Travel Channel

    U.S. subscribers to each of our U.S. channels. By way
    of example, two U.S. households that each receive five of
    our networks from their cable provider represent 10 cumulative

Our U.S. Networks are wholly-owned by us except for OWN,

U.S. Networks also includes our digital media businesses in
    the United States, which provide cross-platform sales and
    promotional opportunities with our television networks and
    additional reach for our content by leveraging the economies
    realized through programs that can be produced once and used
    often in both long-term and short-term formats across multiple
    platforms. Digital media features three main components:

•

U.S. brand-aligned organic channel websites, such as
    Discovery.com, TLC.com and AnimalPlanet.com, and acquired
    assets: HowStuffWorks.com, an award-winning online source of
    high-quality, unbiased and

easy-to-understand

explanations of how the world actually works; Treehugger.com, an
    eco-lifestyle website that complements the Planet Green
    television network; and Petfinder.com, a leading pet adoption
    destination that provides an additional promotional platform for
    the Animal Planet brand. Together, these properties attracted an
    average of more than 33 million cumulative unique monthly
    visitors in 2008, according to Omniture, Inc.

•

Discovery Mobile, which offers unique

made-for-mobile

short-form content and long-form episodes of popular titles
    through distribution arrangements with the majority of mobile
    carriers in the U.S., as well as

direct-to-consumer

mobile websites for multiple network brands including Discovery
    Channel, TLC, and Animal Planet.

•

Discovery on-demand, a free

video-on-demand

service distributed across most major U.S. affiliates,
    which features full-length programming and short-form content
    from across Discovery’s portfolio of U.S. Networks.

International
    Networks

Reaching approximately 892 million cumulative subscribers
    (as defined below) in approximately 170 countries outside the
    U.S. as of December 31, 2008, International Networks
    operates one of the largest international multi-channel
    businesses in the media industry. International Networks
    distributes a diversified portfolio of 21 brands designed to
    meet the needs of audiences, affiliates and advertisers across
    multiple regions and markets. The division maximizes the use of
    shared content and our global programming pipeline in order to
    drive consumer engagement and efficiencies across all core
    brands, and delivers local relevance by offering customized
    programming, on-air content and schedules in 35 languages
    via more than 100 localized feeds. International Networks
    encompasses four locally-managed regional operations covering
    all major foreign cable and satellite markets, including
    Asia-Pacific, Latin America, the U.K. and EMEA (Europe, the
    Middle East and Africa), and has 28 international offices with
    regional headquarters located in London, Miami and Singapore.



International subscriber statistics are derived from internal
    data review coupled with external sources when available. As
    used herein, an “international subscriber” is a single
    household that receives the applicable Discovery network or
    programming service from its cable, satellite or other
    television provider, including those who receive our networks
    from pay-television providers without charge pursuant to various
    pricing plans that include free periods

and/or

free
    carriage. The term “cumulative subscribers” outside
    the U.S. refers to the collective sum of the total number
    of international subscribers to each of our networks or
    programming services outside of the U.S. By way of example,
    two international households that each receive five of our
    networks from their cable provider represent 10 cumulative
    subscribers outside the U.S. Cumulative subscribers outside
    the U.S. include subscriptions for branded programming
    blocks in China, which are generally provided without charge to
    third-party channels and represented approximately
    280 million cumulative subscribers outside the U.S. as

    Brands

    male audience with a mix of fiction and non-fiction content. It
    has broad distribution throughout the country’s cable
    systems, reaching approximately 85% of cable homes, but does not
    get subscription fees and is therefore wholly dependent on
    advertising revenue.



•   In the U.K., DMAX is a broad-based
    service that combines fiction and non-fiction content. It is
    distributed without a subscription fee by both major
    distributors in the U.K., but is positioned in the Entertainment
    section of the electronic program guide of Sky, the largest
    distributor, and is intended to be a strong advertising sales
    vehicle because of the concentration of viewership in
    Entertainment channels.

    (DTT) platform in the U.K. The new channel is expected to launch
    in early 2009 and will offer factual, entertainment, lifestyle
    and kids programming as well as scripted acquisitions.

•   Discovery Familia is our

Spanish-language

network dedicated to bringing the best educational and
    entertaining, family-oriented programming to kids and families.

•   Target viewers are Hispanic children,
    women and families.

International Networks also operates Antenna Audio, which was
    acquired by us in 2006 and is the leading provider of audio,
    multimedia and mobile tours for museums, exhibitions, historic
    sites and visitor attractions around the world. More than
    20 million visitors purchase Antenna Audio tours in
    12 languages at 450 of the world’s most well-known and
    frequented locations each year, including museums such as the
    Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Musée du Louvre and Tate;
    historic and cultural sites including Graceland, Château de
    Versailles and Alcatraz; and popular destinations such as the
    Statue of Liberty and Yosemite National Park.

Commerce,
    Education, and Other

Commerce

Commerce represents an additional revenue stream for us. It also
    plays an important role in support of our overall strategic
    objectives by enhancing viewer loyalty through direct
    interaction with our brands. Discovery Commerce is focused on
    exploiting our on-air brands and increasing the reach of our
    products through our

e-commerce

platform and licensing arrangements.

The division’s platforms include:

•

DiscoveryStore.com

is an

e-commerce

site where customers can shop for a large assortment of our
    proprietary merchandise and other products. DiscoveryStore.com
    logged more than 12 million visitors in 2008.
    DiscoveryStore.com also reaches consumers through relationships
    with leading

e-commerce

sites such as Amazon.com. Our

e-commerce

site leverages the multi-channel traffic driven by our
    merchandise and DVD catalog with annual circulation of nearly
    nine million households.

During the first quarter of 2009, we will begin to operate a new
    business model to license the

direct-to-consumer

component of our commerce business that includes the

e-commerce

platform and catalog to a third-party company. We will receive
    royalties on merchandise and wholesale payments for DVDs sold,
    while the third party will assume management and operational
    responsibility for DiscoveryStore.com and product development
    responsibility for merchandise. As a result of this new



license agreement, our sales will be recorded on a net sales
    basis and will result in a decrease in revenues and costs. Our
    commerce operations continue to add value to our television
    assets by reinforcing consumer loyalty and creating
    opportunities for our advertising and distribution partners.

•

Domestic Licensing and Merchandising

has agreements with
    key manufacturers and retailers, including JAKKS, Activision,
    ToysRUs and others to develop long-term, strategic programs that
    translate our network brands and signature properties into an
    array of merchandising opportunities. From Animal Planet toy and
    pet products,

Mythbusters

books, DVDs and calendars to

Miami Ink

apparel and accessories, domestic licensing
    develops products that capture the look and feel of our core
    brands and programs. In June 2008, we announced an agreement
    with Blockbuster, Inc., to sell signature programs and series
    from our family of networks on DVD at more than 2,500
    participating Blockbuster stores around the U.S.

Education

Education offers a suite of curriculum-based tools designed to
    foster student achievement, as well as educator enhancement
    resources such as assessment services, professional development
    and a nationwide educator community that promotes the
    integration of media and technology in the classroom. Education
    services include:

•

Discovery Education Streaming:

an online

video-on-demand

teaching service that features 9,000 digital videos and 72,000
    content-specific video clips correlated to state K-12 curriculum
    standards. The service is made available through subscription
    services to public and private K-12 schools serving over one
    million teachers nationwide.

•

Discovery Education Assessment:

a service that enables
    K-12 educators to measure student progress toward meeting state
    reading/language arts, math and science standards on an ongoing
    basis, provide differentiated instruction, predict student
    performance, and improve student learning.

Education also publishes and distributes content on DVD, VHS,
    and CD-ROM through catalogs, an online teacher store, and a
    network of distributors, participates in licensing and
    sponsorship programs with corporate partners, and supports our
    digital initiatives by providing educational content in multiple
    formats that meet the needs of teachers and students.

Education also works with corporate partners to create
    supplemental curriculum programs and to support education-based
    student initiatives.

Creative
    Sound Services

Creative Sound Services (“CSS”) became a wholly-owned
    subsidiary of ours in September 2008 following the spinoff of
    AMC as part of the Newhouse Transaction. CSS provides sound,
    music, mixing sound effects and other related services to major
    motion picture studios, independent producers, broadcast
    networks, cable channels, advertising agencies and interactive
    producers. CSS services are marketed under the brand names
    Todd-AO, Sound One, Soundelux, POP Sound, Modern Music,
    Soundelux Design Music Group and The Hollywood Edge, with
    facilities in Los Angeles and New York.

Content
    Development

Our content development strategy is designed to increase
    viewership, maintain innovation and quality leadership, and
    provide value for our distributors and advertising customers.
    Our production agreements fall into three categories:
    commissions, co-productions, and acquisitions. Commissions refer
    to programming for which we generally own most or all rights for
    at least 10 years and, in exchange for paying for all
    production costs, retain all editorial control. Co-productions
    refer to programs where we retain significant (but more limited)
    rights to exploit the programs. The rights package retained by
    us is generally in proportion to the portion of the total
    project costs covered by us, which generally ranges from

25-70%

of
    the total project cost. Co-productions are typically high-cost
    projects for which neither we nor our co-producers wish to bear
    the



entire cost or productions in which the producer has already
    taken on an international broadcast partner. Acquisitions are
    license agreements for films or series that have already been
    produced.

As revenue and network distribution grows, our program mix has
    matured from acquired content to sharing in co-productions to
    full commissions. To minimize programming expense in the early
    stages, as an audience base begins to form, acquired programming
    is used to a greater extent and repeated frequently. The
    transition from acquired content provides for more customized
    use of programming for individual networks and broader rights
    for re-use on television networks and new platforms.

We source content from a wide range of producers, building
    long-standing relationships with some of the world’s
    leading nonfiction production companies, as well as consistently
    developing and encouraging young independent producers. We also
    have long-term relationships with some of the world’s most
    significant nonfiction program producers, including the BBC.

The programming schedule on our most widely distributed networks
    is mostly a mix of high-cost “special event”
    programming combined with miniseries and regular series.
    Large-scale programming events such as

Planet Earth,
    Nefertiti Resurrected, Walking With Cavemen

and

Blue
    Planet

bring brand prestige, favorable media coverage and
    substantial cross-promotional opportunities for other content
    platforms. Given the success of these global programming
    “tent-poles” we will continue to invest in a mix of
    programs that have the potential to draw larger audiences while
    also increasing the investment in regularly scheduled series.

We have an extensive library of over 100,000 hours of
    programming and footage that provides a high-quality source of
    programming for debuting new services quickly without
    significant incremental spending. For example, we were able to
    exploit the “long-tail” popularity of our extensive
    nonfiction library of forensics and investigation programming to
    debut the re-branded Investigation Discovery channel in January
    2008. In 2009, we launched Investigation Discovery in the U.K.
    Programming can be re-edited and updated to provide topical
    versions of subject matter in a cost-effective manner. Library
    development also provides a mechanism to share content around
    the world and repurpose for display on new digital and mobile
    platforms.

Sources
    of Revenue

We earn revenue principally from (1) the receipt of
    affiliate fees from the global delivery of nonfiction
    programming pursuant to affiliation agreements with cable
    television operators,

direct-to-home

satellite operators and other distributors, (2) advertising
    sales on our television networks and websites and
    (3) product, subscription sales and services in the
    commerce, education and media sound services businesses. No
    single customer represented more than 10% of our consolidated
    revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Distribution
    Revenue

Distribution revenue represented 48% of our consolidated total
    revenue in 2008. Distribution revenue in the
    U.S. represented 45% of U.S. Networks revenue, and
    international distribution fees represented 62% of International
    Networks revenue in 2008. Distribution revenue is generated
    through affiliation agreements with cable, satellite and other
    television distributors, which have a typical term of three to
    seven years. These affiliation agreements generally provide for
    the level of carriage our networks will receive, such as channel
    placement and package inclusion (whether on more widely
    distributed, broader packages or lesser-distributed, specialized
    packages), and for payment of a fee to us based on the numbers
    of subscribers that receive our networks. Upon the launch of a
    new channel, we may initially pay distributors to carry such
    channel (such payments are referred to as “launch
    incentives”), or may provide the channel to the distributor
    for free for a predetermined length of time. We have long-term
    contracts with distributors representing most cable and
    satellite operators around the world, including the largest
    operators in the U.S. and major international distributors.
    In the U.S., over 90% of distribution revenue comes from the top
    eight distributors, with whom we have agreements that expire at
    various times beginning in 2010 through 2017. Outside of the
    U.S., we have agreements with numerous distributors with no
    individual agreement representing more than 10% of our
    international distribution revenue.



Advertising
    Revenue

Advertising revenue comprised 41% of our consolidated total
    revenue in 2008. Advertising revenue in the
    U.S. represented 51% of U.S. Networks revenue, and
    international advertising revenue represented 29% of
    International Networks revenue in 2008. We typically build
    network brands by securing as broad a subscriber base as
    possible. After obtaining sufficient distribution to provide an
    attractive platform for advertising, we increase our investment
    in programming and marketing to build audience share and drive
    strong ratings performance in order to increase advertising
    sales opportunities. Advertising revenue generated by each
    program service depends on the number of subscribers receiving
    the service, viewership demographics, the brand appeal of the
    network and ratings as determined by third-party research
    companies such as The Nielsen Company. Revenue from advertising
    is subject to seasonality and market-based variations.
    Advertising revenue is typically highest in the second and
    fourth quarters. Revenue can also fluctuate due to the
    popularity of particular programs and viewership ratings. In
    some cases, advertising sales are subject to ratings guarantees
    that may require us to provide additional advertising time or
    refunds if the guarantees are not met.

We sell advertising time in both the upfront and scatter
    markets. In the upfront market, advertisers buy advertising time
    for the upcoming season, and by buying in advance, often receive
    discounted rates. In the scatter market, advertisers buy
    advertising time close to the time when the ads will be run, and
    often pay a premium. The mix between the upfront and scatter
    markets is based upon a number of factors such as pricing,
    demand for advertising time and economic conditions.

Our two flagship networks, Discovery Channel and TLC, target key
    demographics that have historically been considered attractive
    to advertisers, notably viewers in the

18-54

age
    range who are viewed as having significant spending power.
    Discovery Channel’s target audience skews toward male
    viewers, while TLC and Animal Planet target female viewers,
    providing a healthy gender balance in our portfolio for
    distribution and advertising clients.

We benefit by having a portfolio of networks appealing to a
    broad range of demographics. This allows us to create
    advertising packages that exploit the strength of our large
    networks to benefit smaller niche or targeted networks and
    networks on digital tiers. Utilizing the strength of our diverse
    networks, coupled with our online and digital platforms, we seek
    to create innovative programming initiatives and multifaceted
    campaigns for the benefit of a wide variety of companies and
    organizations who desire to reach key audience demographics
    unique to each network. We deliver customized, integrated
    marketing campaigns to clients worldwide by catering to the
    special needs of multi-regional advertisers who are looking for
    integrated campaigns that move beyond traditional spot
    advertising to include sponsorships, product placements and
    other opportunities.

We also generate advertising revenue from our websites. We sell
    advertising on our websites both on a stand-alone basis and as
    part of advertising packages with our television networks.

Commerce,
    Education, and Other Revenue

Commerce, Education, and Other derives revenue principally from
    the sale of products online and through our catalogs, licensing
    royalties, subscriptions to our educational streaming services,
    and other revenue including media sound services. As part of our
    commerce business, we have a domestic consumer products
    licensing business which licenses our brands in connection with
    merchandise, videogames and publishing. We are generally paid a
    royalty based upon a percentage of our licensees’ wholesale
    revenues, with an advance against future expected royalties.

E-commerce

and catalog sales are highly seasonal with a majority of the
    sales occurring in the fourth quarter due to the holiday season.
    Licensing revenue may vary from period to period depending upon
    the popularity of the properties available for license and the
    popularity of licensed products in a particular period.
    Subscription sales to our educational streaming services are
    primarily sold at the beginning of each school year as school
    budgets are appropriated and approved. The revenue derived from
    the subscription agreements are generally recognized over the
    school year. Education also provides products that are sold
    throughout the school year.



During the first quarter of 2009, we will begin to operate a new
    business model to license the

direct-to-consumer

component of our commerce business that includes the

e-commerce

platform and catalog to a third-party company. As a result, we
    will receive royalties on merchandise and wholesale payments for
    DVDs sold while the third party will assume management and
    operational responsibility for DiscoveryStore.com and product
    development responsibility for merchandise.

Operating
    Expenditures

Our principal operating costs consist of programming expense,
    sales and marketing expense, personnel expense and general and
    administrative expenses. Content amortization expense is our
    largest expense category, representing 28% of our 2008
    consolidated operating expenses, as investment in maintaining
    high-quality editorial and production values is a key
    differentiator for our content. In connection with creating
    original content, we incur production costs associated with
    acquiring new show concepts and retaining creative talent,
    including actors, writers and producers. We also incur higher
    production costs when filming in HD versus standard definition.
    We incur sales and marketing expense to promote brand
    recognition and to secure quality distribution channels
    worldwide.

Regulatory
    Matters

Our businesses are subject to and affected by regulations of
    U.S. federal, state and local government authorities, and
    our international operations are subject to laws and regulations
    of local countries and international bodies such as the European
    Union. Programming networks, such as those owned by us, are
    regulated by the FCC in certain respects if they are affiliated
    with a cable television operator. Other FCC regulations,
    although imposed on cable television operators and satellite
    operators, affect programming networks indirectly. The rules,
    regulations, policies and procedures affecting our businesses
    are constantly subject to change. These descriptions are summary
    in nature and do not purport to describe all present and
    proposed laws and regulations affecting our businesses.

Program
    Access

The FCC’s Program Access Rules prevent a satellite cable
    programming vendor in which a cable operator has an
    “attributable” ownership interest under FCC rules,
    such as those owned by us, from entering into exclusive
    contracts for programming with a cable operator and from
    discriminating among competing Multi-Channel Video Programming
    Distributors (“MVPDs”) in the price, terms and
    conditions for the sale or delivery of programming. These rules
    also permit MVPDs to initiate complaints to the FCC against
    program suppliers if an MVPD is unable to obtain rights to
    programming on nondiscriminatory terms.

Effect
    of “Must-Carry” Requirements

The Cable Act of 1992 imposed “must carry” regulations
    on cable systems, requiring them to carry the signals of local
    broadcast television stations. Direct broadcast satellite
    (“DBS”) systems are also subject to their own must
    carry rules. The FCC recently adopted an order requiring cable
    systems, following the anticipated end of analog television
    broadcasting in June 2009, to carry the digital signals of local
    television stations that have must carry status and to carry the
    same signal in analog format, or to carry the signal in digital
    format alone, provided that all subscribers have the necessary
    equipment to view the broadcast content. The FCC’s
    implementation of these “must-carry” obligations
    requires cable and DBS operators to give broadcasters
    preferential access to channel space. This reduces the amount of
    channel space that is available for carriage of our networks by
    cable television systems and DBS operators.

Obscenity
    Restrictions

Cable operators and other distributors are prohibited from
    transmitting obscene programming, and our affiliation agreements
    generally require us to refrain from including such programming
    on our networks.



Closed
    Captioning and Advertising Restrictions on Children’s
    Programming

Certain of our networks must provide closed-captioning of
    programming for the hearing impaired, and our programming and
    Internet websites intended primarily for children 12 years
    of age and under must comply with certain limits on advertising.

Regulation
    of the Internet

We operate several internet websites which we use to distribute
    information about and supplement our programs and to offer
    consumers the opportunity to purchase consumer products and
    services. Internet services are now subject to regulation in the
    United States relating to the privacy and security of personally
    identifiable user information and acquisition of personal
    information from children under 13, including the federal Child
    Online Protection Act (COPA) and the federal Controlling the
    Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act
    (CAN-SPAM). In addition, a majority of states have enacted laws
    that impose data security and security breach obligations.
    Additional federal and state laws and regulations may be adopted
    with respect to the Internet or other online services, covering
    such issues as user privacy, child safety, data security,
    advertising, pricing, content, copyrights and trademarks, access
    by persons with disabilities, distribution, taxation and
    characteristics and quality of products and services. In
    addition, to the extent we offer products and services to online
    consumers outside the United States, the laws and regulations of
    foreign jurisdictions, including, without limitation, consumer
    protection, privacy, advertising, data retention, intellectual
    property, and content limitations, may impose additional
    compliance obligations on us.

Competition

Cable and satellite network programming is a highly competitive
    business in the United States and worldwide. Our cable and
    satellite networks and websites generally compete for
    advertising revenue with other cable and broadcast television
    networks, online and mobile outlets, radio programming and print
    media. Our networks and websites also compete for their target
    audiences with all forms of programming and other media provided
    to viewers, including broadcast networks, local

over-the-air

television stations, competitors’ pay and basic cable
    television networks,

pay-per-view

and

video-on-demand

services, online activities and other forms of news, information
    and entertainment. Our networks also compete with other
    television networks for distribution and affiliate fees derived
    from distribution agreements with cable television operators,
    satellite operators and other distributors. Our commerce and
    education division also operates in highly competitive
    industries with our

e-commerce

and catalogue business competing with brick and mortar and
    online retailers and our education business competing with other
    providers of educational products to schools, including
    providers with long-standing relationships, such as Scholastic.

Employees

As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately
    4,000 employees. Approximately 3,000 of our employees were
    employed in the United States, with the remaining 1,000 employed
    outside the United States. Over 250 of CSS’ creative
    and technical personnel are subject to one of CSS’
    collective bargaining agreements with the International Alliance
    of Theatrical Stage Employees. There are no active grievances,
    strikes or work stoppages and we believe our relations with our
    union and non-union employees are strong.

Intellectual
    Property

Our intellectual property assets principally include copyrights
    in television programming, websites and other content,
    trademarks in brands, names and logos, domain names and licenses
    of intellectual property rights of various kinds.

We are fundamentally a content company and the protection of our
    brands and content are of primary importance. To protect our
    intellectual property assets, we rely upon a combination of
    copyright, trademark, unfair competition, trade secret and
    Internet/domain name statutes and laws and contract provisions.
    However, there can be no assurance of the degree to which these
    measures will be successful in any given case. Moreover,
    effective intellectual property protection may be either
    unavailable or limited in certain foreign



territories. Policing unauthorized use of our products and
    services and related intellectual property is often difficult
    and the steps taken may not always prevent the infringement by
    unauthorized third parties of our intellectual property. We seek
    to limit that threat through a combination of approaches.

Third parties may challenge the validity or scope of our
    intellectual property from time to time, and such challenges
    could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property
    rights. Irrespective of their validity, such claims may result
    in substantial costs and diversion of resources which could have
    an adverse effect on our operations. In addition, piracy,
    including in the digital environment, continues to present a
    threat to revenues from products and services based on
    intellectual property.

ITEM 1A.

Risk
    Factors.

Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk.
    In addition to the other information contained in this report,
    you should consider the following risk factors before investing
    in our securities.

Our
    business would be adversely affected if general economic
    conditions further weaken.

The current economic downturn in the United States and in other
    regions of the world in which we operate could adversely affect
    demand for any of our businesses, thus reducing our revenue and
    earnings. We derive substantial revenues from the sale of
    advertising on our networks. Expenditures by advertisers tend to
    be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions, as well as
    budgeting and buying patterns. The current economic conditions
    and any continuation of these adverse conditions may adversely
    affect the economic prospects of advertisers and could alter
    current or prospective advertisers’ spending priorities. A
    decrease in advertising expenditures likely would have an
    adverse effect on our business. The decline in economic
    conditions has impacted consumer discretionary spending. Such a
    reduction in consumer spending may impact pay television
    subscriptions, particularly to the more expensive digital
    service tiers, which could lead to a decrease in our
    distribution fees and may reduce the rates we can charge for
    advertising.

Our
    success is dependent upon U.S. and foreign audience acceptance
    of our programming and other entertainment content which is
    difficult to predict.

The production and distribution of pay television programs and
    other entertainment content are inherently risky businesses
    because the revenue we derive and our ability to distribute our
    content depend primarily on consumer tastes and preferences that
    change in often unpredictable ways. Our success depends on our
    ability to consistently create and acquire content and
    programming that meets the changing preferences of viewers in
    general, viewers in special interest groups, viewers in specific
    demographic categories and viewers in various



overseas marketplaces. The commercial success of our programming
    and other content also depends upon the quality and acceptance
    of competing programs and other content available in the
    applicable marketplace at the same time. Other factors,
    including the availability of alternative forms of entertainment
    and leisure time activities, general economic conditions,
    piracy, digital and on-demand distribution and growing
    competition for consumer discretionary spending may also affect
    the audience for our content. Audience sizes for our media
    networks are critical factors affecting both (i) the volume
    and pricing of advertising revenue that we receive, and
    (ii) the extent of distribution and the license fees we
    receive under agreements with our distributors. Consequently,
    reduced public acceptance of our entertainment content may
    decrease our audience share and adversely affect all of our
    revenue streams.

The
    loss of our affiliation agreements, or renewals with less
    advantageous terms, could cause our revenue to
    decline.

Because our networks are licensed on a wholesale basis to
    distributors such as cable and satellite operators which in turn
    distribute them to consumers, we are dependent upon the
    maintenance of affiliation agreements with these operators.
    These affiliation agreements generally provide for the level of
    carriage our networks will receive, such as channel placement
    and programming package inclusion (widely distributed, broader
    programming packages compared to lesser distributed, specialized
    programming packages), and for payment of a license fee to us
    based on the numbers of subscribers that receive our networks.
    These per-subscriber payments represent a significant portion of
    our revenue. Our affiliation agreements generally have a limited
    term which varies from market to market and from distributor to
    distributor, and there can be no assurance that these
    affiliation agreements will be renewed in the future, or renewed
    on terms that are as favorable to us as those in effect today. A
    reduction in the license fees that we receive per subscriber or
    in the number of subscribers for which we are paid, including as
    a result of a loss or reduction in carriage for our networks,
    could adversely affect our distribution revenue. Such a loss or
    reduction in carriage could also decrease the potential audience
    for our programs thereby adversely affecting our advertising
    revenue.

Consolidation among cable and satellite operators has given the
    largest operators considerable leverage in their relationship
    with programmers, including us. The two largest U.S. cable
    television system operators provide service to approximately 35%
    of U.S. households receiving cable or satellite television
    service and the two largest satellite television operators
    provide service to an additional 26% of such households. We
    currently have agreements in place with the major
    U.S. cable and satellite operators which expire at various
    times beginning in 2010 through 2017. A failure to secure a
    renewal or a renewal on less favorable terms may have a material
    adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
    position. Our affiliation agreements are complex and
    individually negotiated. If we were to disagree with one of our
    counterparties on the interpretation of an affiliation
    agreement, our relationship with that counterparty could be
    damaged and our business could be negatively affected. In
    addition, many of the overseas markets in which we distribute
    our networks also have a small number of dominant distributors.
    Continued consolidation within the industry could further reduce
    the number of distributors available to carry our programming
    and increase the negotiating leverage of our distributors which
    could adversely affect our revenue.

We
    operate in increasingly competitive industries.

The entertainment and media programming industries in which we
    operate are highly competitive. We compete with other
    programming networks for advertising, distribution and viewers.
    We also compete for viewers with other forms of media
    entertainment, such as home video, movies, periodicals and
    online and mobile activities. In particular, websites and search
    engines have seen significant advertising growth, a portion of
    which is derived from traditional cable network and satellite
    advertisers. In addition, there has been consolidation in the
    media industry and our competitors include market participants
    with interests in multiple media businesses which are often
    vertically integrated. Our online businesses compete for users
    and advertising in the enormously broad and diverse market of
    free internet-delivered services. Our commerce business competes
    against a wide range of competitive retailers selling similar
    products. Our educational video business competes with other
    providers of educational products to schools. Our ability to
    compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including
    our ability to consistently supply high quality and popular
    content, access



our niche viewerships with appealing category-specific
    programming, adapt to new technologies and distribution
    platforms and achieve widespread distribution. There can be no
    assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the
    future against existing or new competitors, or that increasing
    competition will not have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition or results of operations.

Our
    business is subject to risks of adverse laws and regulations,
    both domestic and foreign.

Programming services like ours, and the distributors of our
    services, including cable operators, satellite operators and
    Internet companies, are highly regulated by U.S. federal
    laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal
    agencies, including the FCC, as well as by state and local
    governments, in ways that affect the daily conduct of our video
    programming business. See discussion under
    “Business — Regulatory Matters” above. The
    U.S. Congress, the FCC and the courts currently have under
    consideration, and may in the future adopt, new laws,
    regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters
    that could, directly or indirectly, affect the operations of our
    U.S. media properties or modify the terms under which we
    offer our services and operate. For example, any changes to the
    laws and regulations that govern the services or signals that
    are carried by cable television operators or our other
    distributors may result in less capacity for other programming
    services, such as our networks, which could adversely affect our
    revenue.

Similarly, the foreign jurisdictions in which our networks are
    offered have, in varying degrees, government laws and
    regulations governing our businesses. Programming businesses are
    subject to regulation on a country by country basis. Changes in
    regulations imposed by foreign governments could also adversely
    affect our business, results of operations and ability to expand
    our operations beyond their current scope.

Increased
    programming production and content costs may adversely affect
    our results of operations and financial condition.

One of our most significant areas of expense is the licensing
    and production of content. In connection with creating original
    content, we incur production costs associated with, among other
    things, acquiring new show concepts and retaining creative
    talent, including actors, writers and producers. We also incur
    higher production costs when filming in HD than standard
    definition. The costs of producing programming have generally
    increased in recent years. These costs may continue to increase
    in the future, which may adversely affect our results of
    operations and financial condition.

Disruption
    or failure of satellites and facilities, and disputes over
    supplier contracts on which we depend to distribute our
    programming, could adversely affect our business.

We depend on transponders on satellite systems to transmit our
    media networks to cable television operators and other
    distributors worldwide. The distribution facilities include
    uplinks, communications satellites and downlinks. We obtain
    satellite transponder capacity pursuant to long-term contracts
    and other arrangements with third-party vendors, which expire at
    various times through 2019. Even with

back-up

and
    redundant systems, transmissions may be disrupted as a result of
    local disasters or other conditions that may impair on-ground
    uplinks or downlinks, or as a result of an impairment of a
    satellite. Currently, there are a limited number of
    communications satellites available for the transmission of
    programming. If a disruption or failure occurs, we may not be
    able to secure alternate distribution facilities in a timely
    manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our
    business and results of operations.

We
    must respond to and capitalize on rapid changes in new
    technologies and distribution platforms, including their effect
    on consumer behavior, in order to remain competitive and exploit
    new opportunities.

Technology in the video, telecommunications and data services
    industry is changing rapidly. We must adapt to advances in
    technologies, distribution outlets and content transfer and
    storage to ensure that our content remains desirable and widely
    available to our audiences while protecting our intellectual
    property interests. We may not have the right, and may not be
    able to secure the right, to distribute some of our licensed
    content across these, or any other, new platforms and must adapt
    accordingly. The ability to anticipate



and take advantage of new and future sources of revenue from
    these technological developments will affect our ability to
    expand our business and increase revenue.

Similarly, we also must adapt to changing consumer behavior
    driven by technological advances such as

video-on-demand

and a desire for more user-generated and interactive content.
    Devices that allow consumers to view our entertainment content
    from remote locations or on a time-delayed basis and
    technologies which enable users to fast-forward or skip
    advertisements may cause changes in audience behavior that could
    affect the attractiveness of our offerings to advertisers and
    could therefore adversely affect our revenue. If we cannot
    ensure that our content is responsive to the lifestyles of our
    target audiences and capitalize on technological advances, there
    could be a negative effect on our business.

Our
    revenue and operating results are subject to seasonal and
    cyclical variations.

Our business has experienced and is expected to continue to
    experience some seasonality due to, among other things, seasonal
    advertising patterns, seasonal influences on people’s
    viewing habits, and a heavy concentration of sales in our
    commerce business during the fourth quarter. For example, due to
    increased demand in the spring and holiday seasons, the second
    and fourth quarters normally have higher advertising revenue
    than the first and third quarters. In addition, advertising
    revenue in even-numbered years benefits from political
    advertising. If a short-term negative impact on our business
    were to occur during a time of high seasonal demand, there could
    be a disproportionate effect on our operating results for the
    year.

We
    continue to develop new products and services for evolving
    markets. There can be no assurance of the success of these
    efforts due to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our
    control.

There are substantial uncertainties associated with our efforts
    to develop new products and services for evolving markets, and
    substantial investments may be required. Initial timetables for
    the introduction and development of new products and services
    may not be achieved, and price and profitability targets may not
    prove feasible. External factors, such as the development of
    competitive alternatives, rapid technological change, regulatory
    changes and shifting market preferences, may cause new markets
    to move in unanticipated directions.

Risks
    associated with our international operations could harm our
    financial condition.

Our networks are offered worldwide. Inherent economic risks of
    doing business in international markets include, among other
    things, longer payment cycles, foreign taxation and currency
    exchange risk. As we continue to expand the provision of our
    products and services to overseas markets, we cannot assure you
    whether these risks and uncertainties will harm our results of
    operations.

Our international operations may also be adversely affected by
    export and import restrictions, other trade barriers and acts of
    disruptions of services or loss of property or equipment that
    are critical to overseas businesses due to expropriation,
    nationalization, war, insurrection, terrorism or general social
    or political unrest or other hostilities.

The
    loss of key talent could disrupt our business and adversely
    affect our revenue.

Our business depends upon the continued efforts, abilities and
    expertise of our corporate and divisional executive teams and
    entertainment personalities. We employ or contract with
    entertainment personalities who may have loyal audiences. These
    individuals are important to audience endorsement of our
    programs and other content. There can be no assurance that these
    individuals will remain with us or retain their current
    audiences. If we fail to retain these individuals or if our
    entertainment personalities lose their current audience base,
    our revenue could be adversely affected.



Piracy
    of our entertainment content, including digital piracy, may
    decrease revenue received from our programming and adversely
    affect our business and profitability.

The success of our business depends in part on our ability to
    maintain the intellectual property rights to our entertainment
    content. We are fundamentally a content company and piracy of
    our brands, DVDs, cable television and other programming,
    digital content and other intellectual property has the
    potential to significantly affect us. Piracy is particularly
    prevalent in many parts of the world that lack copyright and
    other protections similar to existing law in the U.S. It is
    also made easier by technological advances allowing the
    conversion of programming into digital formats, which
    facilitates the creation, transmission and sharing of high
    quality unauthorized copies. Unauthorized distribution of
    copyrighted material over the Internet is a threat to copyright
    owners’ ability to protect and exploit their property. The
    proliferation of unauthorized use of our content may have an
    adverse effect on our business and profitability because it
    reduces the revenue that we potentially could receive from the
    legitimate sale and distribution of our content.

Financial
    market conditions may impede access to or increase the cost of
    financing our operations and investments.

The recent changes in U.S. and global financial and equity
    markets, including market disruptions and tightening of the
    credit markets, may make it more difficult for us to obtain
    financing for our operations or investments or increase the cost
    of obtaining financing. In addition, our borrowing costs can be
    affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by
    independent rating agencies which are based, in significant
    part, on our performance as measured by credit metrics such as
    interest coverage and leverage ratios. A low rating could
    increase our cost of borrowing or make it more difficult for us
    to obtain future financing.

Substantial
    leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect
    us.

As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately
    $3.7 billion of consolidated debt. Our substantial level of
    indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to
    generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of,
    interest on, or other amounts due with respect to our
    indebtedness. In addition, we draw down our revolving credit
    facility in the ordinary course, which has the effect of
    increasing our indebtedness. We are also permitted, subject to
    certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness, to obtain
    additional long-term debt and working capital lines of credit to
    meet future financing needs. This would have the effect of
    increasing our total leverage.

Our substantial leverage could have significant negative
    consequences on our financial condition and results of
    operations, including:

•

impairing our ability to meet one or more of the financial ratio
    covenants contained in our debt agreements or to generate cash
    sufficient to pay interest or principal, which could result in
    an acceleration of some or all of our outstanding debt in the
    event that an uncured default occurs;

•

increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and
    market conditions;

•

limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity
    financing;

•

requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash
    flow from operations to service our debt, thereby reducing the
    amount of cash flow available for other purposes;

•

requiring us to sell debt or equity securities or to sell some
    of our core assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, to meet
    payment obligations;

•

limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to,
    changes in our business and the markets in which we
    compete; and

•

placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with less
    leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better
    access to capital resources.



Restrictive
    covenants in the loan agreements for our revolving credit
    facility and term loans, and the note purchase agreements
    governing our private placement notes, could adversely affect
    our business by limiting flexibility.

The loan agreements for our revolving credit facility and term
    loans and the note purchase agreements governing the terms of
    our private placement notes contain restrictive covenants, as
    well as requirements to comply with certain leverage and other
    financial maintenance tests. These covenants and requirements
    limit our ability to take various actions, including incurring
    additional debt, guaranteeing indebtedness and engaging in
    various types of transactions, including mergers, acquisitions
    and sales of assets. These covenants could place us at a
    disadvantage compared to some of our competitors, who may have
    fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate
    under these restrictions. Further, these covenants could have an
    adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take
    advantage of financing, mergers and acquisitions or other
    opportunities.

In addition, reporting and information covenants in our loan
    agreements and note purchase agreements require that we provide
    financial and operating information within certain time periods.
    If we are unable to timely provide the required information, we
    would be in breach of these covenants.

We are
    a holding company and could be unable in the future to obtain
    cash in amounts sufficient to service our financial obligations
    or meet our other commitments.

Our ability to meet our financial obligations and other
    contractual commitments will depend upon our ability to access
    cash. We are a holding company, and our sources of cash include
    our available cash balances, net cash from the operating
    activities of our subsidiaries, any dividends and interest we
    may receive from our investments, availability under any credit
    facilities that we may obtain in the future and proceeds from
    any asset sales we may undertake in the future. The ability of
    our operating subsidiaries, including Discovery Communications,
    LLC, to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to
    us will depend on their individual operating results and any
    statutory, regulatory or contractual restrictions, including
    restrictions in our credit facility, to which they may be or may
    become subject.

We
    cannot be certain that we will be successful in integrating any
    businesses we may acquire in the future.

Our business strategy includes growth through acquisitions in
    selected markets. Integration of new businesses may present
    significant challenges, including: realizing economies of scale
    in programming and network operations; eliminating duplicative
    overheads; and integrating networks, financial systems and
    operational systems. We cannot assure you that, with respect to
    any acquisition, we will realize anticipated benefits or
    successfully integrate any acquired business with existing
    operations. In addition, while we intend to implement
    appropriate controls and procedures as acquired companies are
    integrated, we may not be able to certify as to the
    effectiveness of these companies’ disclosure controls and
    procedures or internal control over financial reporting (as
    required by U.S. federal securities laws and regulations)
    until we have fully integrated them.

Our
    directors overlap with those of Liberty Media Corporation and
    certain related persons of

Advance/Newhouse,

which may lead to conflicting interests.

Our eleven-person board of directors includes four persons who
    are currently members of the board of directors of Liberty Media
    Corporation (“Liberty”), including John C. Malone, the
    Chairman of the board of Liberty, three persons who are
    currently members of the board of directors Liberty Global, Inc.
    (“Liberty Global”), also including Mr. Malone,
    who is Chairman of the board of Liberty Global, and three
    designees of Advance/Newhouse, including Robert J. Miron, the
    Chairman of Advance/Newhouse, and Steven A. Miron, the Chief
    Executive Officer of Advance/Newhouse. Both Liberty and the
    parent company of Advance/Newhouse own interests in a range of
    media, communications and entertainment businesses. Liberty does
    not own any interest in us. Mr. Malone beneficially owns
    stock of Liberty representing approximately 33% of the aggregate
    voting power of its outstanding stock, owns shares representing
    approximately 34% of the aggregate voting power of Liberty
    Global and owns shares representing approximately 23% of the
    aggregate voting



power (other than with respect to the election of the common
    stock directors) of our outstanding stock. Mr. Malone
    controls approximately 32% of our aggregate voting power
    relating to the election of the eight common stock directors,
    assuming that the preferred stock awarded by Advance/Newhouse
    has not been converted into shares of our common stock. Those of
    our directors who are also directors of Liberty or Liberty
    Global own Liberty or Liberty Global stock and stock incentives
    and own our stock and stock incentives. Advance/Newhouse will
    elect three directors annually for so long as it owns a
    specified minimum amount of our Series A convertible
    preferred stock, and two directors include its Chairman, Robert
    J. Miron, and its Chief Executive Officer, Steven A. Miron. The
    Advance/Newhouse Series A convertible preferred stock,
    which votes with our common stock on all matters other than the
    election of directors, represents approximately 26% of the
    voting power of our outstanding shares. The Series A
    convertible preferred stock also grants Advance/Newhouse consent
    rights over a range of our corporate actions, including
    fundamental changes to our business, the issuance of additional
    capital stock, mergers and business combinations and certain
    acquisitions and dispositions. These ownership interests

and/or

business positions could create, or appear to create, potential
    conflicts of interest when these individuals are faced with
    decisions that could have different implications for us,
    Liberty, Liberty Global,

and/or

Advance/Newhouse. For example, there may be the potential for a
    conflict of interest when we, on the one hand, or Liberty,
    Liberty Global,

and/or

Advance/Newhouse, on the other hand, look at acquisitions and
    other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for the other.

The members of our board of directors have fiduciary duties to
    our stockholders. Likewise, those persons who serve in similar
    capacities at Liberty, Liberty Global, or Advance/Newhouse have
    fiduciary duties to those companies. Therefore, such persons may
    have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of
    interest with respect to matters involving or affecting both
    respective companies. Although the terms of any transactions or
    agreements will be established based upon negotiations between
    employees of the companies involved, there can be no assurance
    that the terms of any transactions will be as favorable to us or
    our subsidiaries as would be the case where the parties are at
    arms’ length.

We may
    compete with Liberty for business opportunities.

Liberty owns interests in various U.S. and international
    programming companies that have subsidiaries that own or operate
    domestic or foreign programming services that may compete with
    the programming services we offer. We have no rights in respect
    of U.S. or international programming opportunities
    developed by or presented to the subsidiaries or Liberty, and
    the pursuit of these opportunities by such subsidiaries may
    adversely affect our interests and those of our stockholders.
    Because we and Liberty have overlapping directors, the pursuit
    of business opportunities may serve to intensify the conflicts
    of interest or appearance of conflicts of interest faced by the
    respective management teams. Our charter provides that none of
    our directors or officers will be liable to us or any of our
    subsidiaries for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the
    fact that such individual directs a corporate opportunity to
    another person or entity (including Liberty), for which such
    individual serves as a director or officer, or does not refer or
    communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to
    us or any of our subsidiaries, unless (x) such opportunity
    was expressly offered to such individual solely in his or her
    capacity as a director or officer of us or any of our
    subsidiaries and (y) such opportunity relates to a line of
    business in which we or any of our subsidiaries is then directly
    engaged.

The
    personal educational media, lifelong learning, and travel
    industry investments by John S. Hendricks, a common stock
    director and our Founder, may conflict with or compete with our
    business activities.

Our Founder, John S. Hendricks, manages his non-Discovery,
    personal business investments through Hendricks Investment
    Holdings LLC (“HIH”), a Delaware limited liability
    company of which he is the sole owner and member. HIH owns a
    travel club and travel-related properties including a resort in
    Gateway, Colorado with plans to create a learning academy for
    guests that includes online and advanced media offerings in the
    area of informal and lifelong learning. Certain video
    productions and offerings of this academy may compete with our
    educational media offerings. We and the academy may enter into a
    business arrangement for the offering of our video products for
    sale by the academy

and/or

for
    the joint-production of new educational media products.



Through HIH, Mr. Hendricks owns a number of business
    interests in the automotive field some of which are involved in
    programming offered by us, in particular the “Turbo”
    programming series we offer.

From time to time, HIH or its subsidiaries may enter into
    transactions with us or our subsidiaries. Although the terms of
    any such transactions or agreements will be established based
    upon negotiations between employees of the companies involved,
    there can be no assurance that the terms of any such
    transactions will be as favorable to us or our subsidiaries as
    would be the case where the parties are at arms’ length.

It may
    be difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so
    may be beneficial to our stockholders.

Certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may discourage,
    delay or prevent a change in control that a stockholder may
    consider favorable. These provisions include the following:

•

authorizing a capital structure with multiple series of common
    stock: a Series B that entitles the holders to ten votes
    per share, a Series A that entitles the holders to one vote
    per share and a Series C that, except as otherwise required
    by applicable law, entitles the holders to no voting rights;

•

authorizing the Series A convertible preferred stock with
    special voting rights, which prohibits us from taking any of the
    following actions, among others, without the prior approval of
    the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of such
    stock:

•

increasing the number of members of the Board of Directors above
    11;

•

making any material amendment to our charter or bylaws;

•

engaging in a merger, consolidation or other business
    combination with any other entity;

•

appointing or removing our Chairman of the Board or our CEO.

•

authorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred
    stock, which could be issued by our board of directors to
    increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover
    attempt;

•

classifying our common stock directors with staggered three year
    terms and having three directors elected by the holders of the
    Series A convertible preferred stock, which may lengthen
    the time required to gain control of our board of directors;

•

limiting who may call special meetings of stockholders;

•

prohibiting stockholder action by written consent (subject to
    certain exceptions), thereby requiring stockholder action to be
    taken at a meeting of the stockholders;

•

establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of
    candidates for election to our board of directors or for
    proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at
    stockholder meetings;

•

requiring stockholder approval by holders of at least 80% of our
    voting power or the approval by at least 75% of our board of
    directors with respect to certain extraordinary matters, such as
    a merger or consolidation, a sale of all or substantially all of
    our assets or an amendment to our charter;

•

requiring the consent of the holders of at least 75% of the
    outstanding Series B common stock (voting as a separate
    class) to certain share distributions and other corporate
    actions in which the voting power of the Series B common
    stock would be diluted by, for example, issuing shares having
    multiple votes per share as a dividend to holders of
    Series A common stock; and

•

the existence of authorized and unissued stock which would allow
    our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to
    current management, thereby protecting the continuity of our
    management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership
    of persons seeking to obtain control of us.

We have also adopted a shareholder rights plan in order to
    encourage anyone seeking to acquire us to negotiate with our
    board of directors prior to attempting a takeover. While the
    plan is designed to guard



against coercive or unfair tactics to gain control of us, the
    plan may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying
    any attempts by others to obtain control of us.

Holders
    of any single series of our common stock may not have any
    remedies if any action by our directors or officers has an
    adverse effect on only that series of common
    stock.

Principles of Delaware law and the provisions of our charter may
    protect decisions of our board of directors that have a
    disparate impact upon holders of any single series of our common
    stock. Under Delaware law, the board of directors has a duty to
    act with due care and in the best interests of all of our
    stockholders, including the holders of all series of our common
    stock. Principles of Delaware law established in cases involving
    differing treatment of multiple classes or series of stock
    provide that a board of directors owes an equal duty to all
    common stockholders regardless of class or series and does not
    have separate or additional duties to any group of stockholders.
    As a result, in some circumstances, our directors may be
    required to make a decision that is adverse to the holders of
    one series of common stock. Under the principles of Delaware law
    referred to above, stockholders may not be able to challenge
    these decisions if our board of directors is disinterested and
    adequately informed with respect to these decisions and acts in
    good faith and in the honest belief that it is acting in the
    best interests of all of our stockholders.

The
    exercise by Advance/Newhouse of its registration rights could
    adversely affect the market price of our common
    stock.

As part of the Newhouse Transaction, Advance/Newhouse has been
    granted registration rights covering all of the shares of common
    stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible preferred
    stock issued to Advance/Newhouse in the Newhouse Transaction.
    Advance/Newhouse’s preferred stock is convertible into a
    number of shares equal to one-half of the number of shares of
    common stock that were issued to former DHC stockholders in the
    merger, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. The registration
    rights, which are immediately exercisable, are transferrable
    with the sale or transfer by Advance/Newhouse of blocks of
    shares representing 10% or more of the preferred stock it
    received in the Newhouse Transaction. The exercise of the
    registration rights, and subsequent sale of possibly large
    amounts of our common stock in the public market, could
    materially and adversely affect the market price of our common
    stock.

We
    will not be fully subject to the requirements of
    Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 until the end
    of 2009. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal
    control over financial reporting, our management may not be able
    to provide the requisite certifications and our auditors may
    issue adverse attestations, which could, among other things,
    jeopardize the market’s confidence in our financial
    results.

As DHC accounted for its investment in DCH as an equity
    affiliate, to date Discovery has not been subject to the
    disclosure and internal controls for financial reporting
    requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of
    2002. We will not be subject to those requirements until the end
    of 2009. In the interim, we will be required to document,
    evaluate and test (and possibly remediate) our system of
    internal control over financial reporting. As a result, we
    expect to incur expenses and diversion of management’s time
    throughout this coming year. We cannot be certain as to the
    timing of completion of our evaluation, testing and remediation
    actions or their effect on our operations. If we are not able to
    implement the requirements of Section 404 in a timely
    manner or with adequate compliance, management may not be able
    to provide the requisite certifications and our auditors may
    issue adverse attestations, which could harm investors’
    confidence in our financial results and subject us to sanctions
    or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or
    the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Any such action
    could cause our stock price to fall.

John
    C. Malone and Advance/Newhouse will each have significant voting
    power with respect to corporate matters considered by our
    stockholders.

John C. Malone and Advance/Newhouse beneficially own shares of
    our stock representing approximately 23% and 26%, respectively,
    of the aggregate voting power represented by our outstanding
    stock (other than voting power relating to the election of
    directors). With respect to the election of directors,
    Mr. Malone is expected to control approximately 32% of the
    aggregate voting power relating to the election of the eight



common stock directors (and assuming that the convertible
    preferred stock owned by Advance/Newhouse (the A/N Preferred
    Stock) has not been converted into shares of our common stock).
    The A/N Preferred Stock carries with it the right to designate
    the three preferred stock directors to our board (subject to
    certain conditions), but will not vote with respect to the
    election of the eight common stock directors. Also, under the
    terms of the A/N Preferred Stock, Advance/Newhouse has special
    voting rights with respect to certain enumerated matters,
    including material amendments to the restated charter and
    bylaws, fundamental changes in our business, mergers and other
    business combinations, certain acquisitions and dispositions and
    future issuances of capital stock. Although there is no
    stockholder agreement, voting agreement or any similar
    arrangement between Mr. Malone and Advance/Newhouse, by
    virtue of their respective holdings, each of Mr. Malone and
    Advance/Newhouse likely will have significant influence over the
    outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted
    to our stockholders.

ITEM 6.

Selected
    Financial Data.

The following table presents our selected financial data for
    each of the past five years. The selected operating statement
    data for each of the three years during the period ended
    December 31, 2008 and the selected balance sheet data as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007 have been derived from and
    should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated
    financial statements and other financial information included
    elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

The selected operating statement data for each of the two years
    during the period ended December 31, 2005 and the selected
    balance sheet data as of December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004
    have been derived from audited consolidated financial statements
    not included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

The selected financial data set forth below reflect the Newhouse
    Transaction, including the AMC spin-off, as though it was
    consummated on January 1, 2008. Accordingly, the selected
    financial data as of and for the year ended December 31,
    2008 include the combined results of operations and financial
    position of both DHC and DCH. The selected financial data for
    years prior to 2008 reflect only the results of operations and
    financial position of DHC, as our predecessor. Prior to the
    Newhouse Transaction, DHC accounted for its ownership interest
    in DCH using the equity method. Because the Newhouse Transaction
    is presented as of January 1, 2008, the selected financial
    data for years prior to 2008 include DCH’s results of
    operations in the Equity in earnings of Discovery Communications
    Holding, LLC line item. Information regarding the Newhouse
    Transaction and DHC’s investment in DCH prior to Newhouse
    Transaction is disclosed in Note 1 and Note 2,
    respectively, to the audited consolidated financial statements
    included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

The selected financial data also reflect certain
    reclassifications of each company’s financial information
    to conform to the combined Company’s financial statement
    presentation, as follows:

•

The consolidated financial statements for 2008 have been
    adjusted to eliminate the separate presentation of DHC’s
    investment in DCH and the portion of DCH’s earnings
    recorded by DHC using the equity method during the period
    January 1, 2008 through September 17, 2008.

•

Advance/Newhouse’s interest in DCH’s earnings for the
    period January 1, 2008 through September 17, 2008 has
    been recorded as

Minority interests, net of tax

in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations.

•

All DHC share and per share data have been adjusted for all
    periods presented to reflect the exchange into our shares.

    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.

Cautionary
    Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements

This annual report on

Form 10-K,

including “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition,”
    contains both historical and forward-looking statements. All
    statements that are not statements of historical fact are, or
    may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements within the
    meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
    Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These
    forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts,
    but rather reflect our current expectations concerning future
    results and events. Forward-looking statements generally can be
    identified by the use of statements that include phrases such as
    “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,”
    “intend,” “plan,” “foresee,”
    “likely,” “continue,” “will,”
    “may,” “would” or other similar words or
    phrases. Similarly, statements that describe our objectives,
    plans or goals are or may be forward-looking statements. These
    forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks,
    uncertainties and other factors that are difficult to predict
    and which may cause our actual results, performance or
    achievements to be different from any future results,
    performance and achievements expressed or implied by these
    statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors are
    discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” above. Other
    risks, or updates to the risks discussed below, may be described
    from time to time in our news releases and other filings made
    under the securities laws, including our reports on

Form 10-Q

    Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of
    the Exchange Act, we do not have any obligation to publicly
    update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent
    events or circumstances.

Introduction

Management’s discussion and analysis of results of
    operations and financial condition is provided as a supplement
    to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes
    to help provide an understanding of our financial condition,
    cash flows and results of operations. This discussion is
    organized as follows:

•

Overview.

This section provides a general
    description of our business segments, as well as recent
    developments we believe are important in understanding the
    results of operations and financial condition, including a
    discussion of the Newhouse Transaction.

•

Results of Operations — 2008 vs.
    2007.

This section provides an analysis of our
    result of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008.
    In order to assist the reader in better understanding our
    operations, a table is provided that reconciles our and
    DHC’s prior year income statements presented in accordance
    with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
    (“U.S. GAAP”) to the financial information
    discussed in our adjusted results of operations for the years
    ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. This analysis is
    presented on both a consolidated and a business segment basis.

•

Results of Operations — 2007 vs.
    2006.

This section provides an analysis of
    DHC’s prior year income statements presented in accordance
    with U.S. GAAP, restated to reflect AMC as a discontinued
    operation, as a result of the completion of the Newhouse
    Transaction

•

Liquidity and Capital Resources.

This section
    provides an analysis of our cash flows for the three years ended
    December 31, 2008, as well as a discussion of our
    outstanding debt and commitments that existed as of
    December 31, 2008. Included in the analysis of outstanding
    debt is a discussion of the amount of financial capacity
    available to fund our future commitments, as well as other
    financing arrangements.

•

Critical Accounting Policies.

This section
    identifies those accounting policies that are considered
    important to our results of operations and financial condition,
    require significant judgment and require estimates on the part
    of management in application. All of our significant accounting
    policies, including those considered critical accounting
    policies, are also summarized in Note 2 to the accompanying
    consolidated financial statements.



•

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
    Risk.

This section discusses how we manage
    exposure to potential gains and losses arising from changes in
    market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign
    currency exchange rates, and changes in the market value of
    financial instruments.

Overview

We are a leading global media and entertainment company that
    provides original and purchased programming across multiple
    distribution platforms in the United States and approximately
    170 other countries, including television networks offering
    customized programming in 35 languages. Our strategy is to
    optimize the distribution, ratings and profit potential of each
    of our branded channels. We own and operate a diversified
    portfolio of website properties and other digital services and
    develop and sell consumer and educational products and media
    sound services in the United States and internationally. We
    operate through three divisions: (1) U.S. Networks,
    (2) International Networks, and (3) Commerce,
    Education, and Other.

Our media content is designed to target key audience
    demographics and the popularity of our programming creates a
    reason for advertisers to purchase commercial time on our
    channels. Audience ratings are a key driver in generating
    advertising revenue and creating demand on the part of cable
    television operators,

direct-to-home

or “DTH” satellite operators and other content
    distributors to deliver our programming to their customers. The
    current economic conditions, and any continuation of these
    adverse conditions, may adversely affect the economic prospects
    of advertisers and could alter their current spending priorities.

In addition to growing distribution and advertising revenue for
    our branded channels, we are focused on growing revenue across
    new distribution platforms, including brand-aligned web
    properties, mobile devices,

video-on-demand

and broadband channels, which serve as additional outlets for
    advertising and affiliate sales, and provide promotional
    platforms for our programming. We also operate internet sites,
    such as HowStuffWorks.com, providing supplemental news,
    information and entertainment content that are aligned with our
    television programming.

We will continue to incur incremental legal, accounting and
    other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. We
    will incur costs associated with public company reporting
    requirements and costs associated with corporate governance
    requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley
    Act of 2002. We are incurring additional costs to prepare for
    the management attestation requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley
    Act of 2002 and the related attestation by the independent
    registered public accounting firm to which we will first be
    subject in 2009.

U.S.
    Networks

U.S. Networks is our largest division, which owns and
    operates 11 cable and satellite channels, including Discovery
    Channel, TLC and Animal Planet, as well as a portfolio of
    website properties and other digital services.
    U.S. Networks also provides distribution and advertising
    sales services for Travel Channel and distribution services for
    BBC America and BBC World News. U.S. Networks derives
    revenue primarily from distribution fees and advertising sales,
    which comprised 45% and 51%, respectively, of revenue for this
    division for the year ended December 31, 2008. During each
    of the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006,
    Discovery Channel, TLC and Animal Planet collectively generated
    more than 73% of U.S. Networks total revenue.
    U.S. Networks earns distribution fees under multi-year
    affiliation agreements with cable operators, DTH operators and
    other distributors of television programming. Distribution fees
    are based on the number of subscribers receiving programming.
    Upon the launch of a new channel, we may initially pay
    distributors to carry such channel (such payments are referred
    to as “launch incentives”), or may provide the channel
    to the distributor for free for a predetermined length of time.
    Launch incentives are amortized on a straight-line basis as a
    reduction of revenue over the term of the affiliation agreement.
    U.S. Networks sells commercial time on our networks and
    websites. The number of subscribers to our channels, the
    popularity of our programming and our ability to sell commercial
    time over a group of channels are key drivers of advertising
    revenue.

Several of our domestic networks, including Discovery Channel,
    TLC and Animal Planet, are currently distributed to
    substantially all of the cable television and direct broadcast
    satellite homes in the U.S.



Accordingly, the rate of growth in U.S. distribution
    revenue in future periods is expected to be less than historical
    rates. Our other U.S. Networks are distributed primarily on
    the digital tier of cable systems and equivalent tiers on DTH
    platforms and have been successful in maximizing their
    distribution within this more limited universe. There is,
    however, no guarantee that these digital networks will ever be
    able to gain the distribution levels or advertising rates of our
    major networks. Our contractual arrangements with
    U.S. distributors are renewed or renegotiated from time to
    time in the ordinary course of business. In 2008, we renewed the
    distribution agreements with one of our largest distributors.

U.S. Networks’ largest single cost is the cost of
    programming, including production costs for original
    programming. U.S. Networks amortizes the cost of original
    or purchased programming based on the expected realization of
    revenue resulting in an accelerated amortization for Discovery
    Channel, TLC and Animal Planet and straight-line amortization
    over three to five years for the remaining networks.

International
    Networks

International Networks manages a portfolio of channels, led by
    the Discovery Channel and Animal Planet brands that are
    distributed in virtually every pay-television market in the
    world through an infrastructure that includes major operational
    centers in London, Singapore, New Delhi and Miami. International
    Networks’ regional operations cover most major markets
    including the U.K., Europe, Middle East and Africa
    (“EMEA”), Asia, Latin America and India. International
    Networks currently operates over 100 unique distribution feeds
    in 35 languages with channel feeds customized according to
    language needs and advertising sales opportunities. Most of the
    division’s channels are wholly owned by us with the
    exception of (1) the international Animal Planet channels,
    which are generally joint ventures in which the British
    Broadcasting Corporation (“BBC”) owns 50%,
    (2) People + Arts, which operates in Latin America and
    Iberia as a

50-50

joint
    venture with the BBC and (3) several channels in Japan,
    Canada and Poland, which operate as joint ventures with
    strategically important local partners.

Similar to U.S. Networks, the primary sources of revenue
    for International Networks are distribution fees and advertising
    sales, and the primary cost is programming. International
    Networks executes a localization strategy by offering high
    quality shared programming with U.S. Networks, customized
    content, and localized schedules via our distribution feeds.
    Distribution revenue represents approximately 62% of the
    division’s operating revenue and continues to deliver
    growth in markets with the highest potential for pay television
    expansion.

Advertising sales are increasingly important to the
    division’s financial success. International television
    markets vary in their stages of development. Some, notably the
    U.K., are among the more advanced digital multi-channel
    television markets in the world, while others remain in the
    analog environment with varying degrees of investment from
    operators in expanding channel capacity or converting to
    digital. We believe there is growth in many international
    markets including Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe
    that are in the early stage of pay TV evolution. In developing
    pay TV markets, we expect to see advertising revenue growth from
    subscriber growth, our localization strategy, and the shift of
    advertising spending from broadcast to pay TV. In relatively
    mature markets, such as the U.K., the growth dynamic is
    changing. Increased penetration and distribution are unlikely to
    drive rapid growth in those markets. Instead, growth in
    advertising sales will come from increasing viewership and
    advertising pricing on our existing

pay-TV

networks and launching new services, either in

pay-TV

or
    free television environments. One such new launch came in early
    2006 when the Company acquired a broadly-distributed-free-to-air
    cable channel in Germany and relaunched it as DMAX. Another
    launch will come in 2009, when we will launch a digital
    terrestrial channel in the U.K. on the free platform known as
    Freeview, which now has over 10 million homes. Neither of
    these channels generate distribution fees, but both are broadly
    distributed enough to have strong advertising sales potential.

Our international businesses are subject to a number of risks
    including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, regulatory
    issues, and political instability. Changes in any of these areas
    could adversely affect the performance of the International
    Networks.

International Networks’ priorities include maintaining a
    leadership position in nonfiction and certain fictional
    entertainment in international markets and continuing to grow
    and improve the performance of the



international operations. These priorities will be achieved
    through expanding local advertising sales capabilities, creating
    licensing and digital growth opportunities, and improving
    operating efficiencies by strengthening programming and
    promotional collaboration between U.S. and International
    Network groups.

Commerce,
    Education, and Other

During 2007, DCH evaluated its commerce business and made the
    decision to transition from running

brick-and-mortar

retail locations to leveraging its products through retail
    arrangements and an

e-commerce

and catalog platform. In the third quarter of 2007, DCH
    completed the closing of its 103 mall-based and stand-alone
    Discovery Channel stores. As a result of the store closures, our
    as-adjusted results of operations have been prepared to reflect
    the retail store business as discontinued operations.
    Accordingly, the revenue, costs and expenses of the retail store
    business have been excluded from the respective captions in our
    financial statements and have been reported as discontinued
    operations.

In February 2009, we announced our plan to transition our
    commerce business to a royalty model, thereby providing for
    growth in profitability and reducing the financial risk of
    holding significant product inventories. As such, we will
    outsource the commerce

direct-to-consumer

operations including our commerce website, related marketing,
    product development and fulfillment to a third party in exchange
    for royalties. We expect to complete the transition in the
    second quarter of 2009. Our new structure for our commerce
    business will enable us to continue offering high quality
    Discovery Blu-Ray and standard definition DVD programming as
    well as many merchandise categories leveraging both licensed and
    make and sell products. Although we expect this new structure to
    facilitate growth in operating income, we expect an initial
    compression in top-line revenue contribution, as well as a
    reduction in direct operating expenses in 2009. Commerce will
    continue to grow our established brand and home video licensing
    businesses to further expand our national presence in key
    retailers. Our commerce operations continue to add value to our
    television assets by reinforcing consumer loyalty and creating
    opportunities for our advertising and distribution partners.

Our education business will continue to focus on our

direct-to-school

streaming distribution subscription services as well as our
    benchmark student assessment services, publishing and
    distributing hardcopy content through a network of distribution
    channels including online, catalog and dealers. Our education
    business also participates in a growing sponsorship and global
    brand and content licensing business.

With the completion of the Newhouse Transaction, the operating
    results of the Creative Sound Services (“CSS”)
    businesses, which provide sound, music, mixing sound effects and
    other related services under brand names such as Sound One, POP
    Sound, Soundelux and Todd A-O, are reported in the Commerce,
    Education, and Other segment for the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

The
    Newhouse Transaction

On September 17, 2008, we were formed as a result of DHC
    and Advance/Newhouse Programming Partnership
    (“Advance/Newhouse”) combining their respective
    interests in Discovery and exchanging those interests with the
    Company (the “Newhouse Transaction”). The Newhouse
    Transaction provided, among other things, for the combination of
    DHC’s


/


%
    interest with Advance/Newhouse’s


/


%
    interest in DCH. The Newhouse Transaction was completed as
    follows:

•

On September 17, 2008, DHC completed the spin-off to its
    shareholders of Ascent Media Corporation (“AMC”), a
    subsidiary holding cash and all of the businesses of its
    wholly-owned subsidiaries except for CSS (which businesses
    remained with us following the completion of the Newhouse
    Transaction) (the “AMC spin-off”);

•

On September 17, 2008, immediately following the AMC
    spin-off, DHC merged with a transitory merger subsidiary of the
    Company, and DHC’s existing shareholders received common
    stock of the Company; and

•

On September 17, 2008, immediately following the DHC
    exchange of shares for ours, Advance/Newhouse contributed its
    interests in us and Animal Planet to us in exchange for shares
    of our Series A



and Series C convertible preferred stock that are
    convertible at any time into our common stock, which at the
    transaction date represented one-third of the outstanding shares
    of our common stock.

As a result of the Newhouse Transaction, we became the successor
    reporting entity to DHC under the Exchange Act. Because
    Advance/Newhouse was a one-third owner of Discovery prior to the
    completion of the Newhouse Transaction and is a one-third owner
    of us immediately following completion of the Newhouse
    Transaction, there was no effective change in ownership. Our
    convertible preferred stock does not have any special dividend
    rights and only a de minimis liquidation preference.
    Additionally, Advance/Newhouse retains significant participatory
    special class voting rights with respect to certain matters that
    could be submitted to stockholder vote. Pursuant to FASB
    Technical

Bulletin 85-5,

Issues Relating to Accounting for Business Combinations, for
    accounting purposes the Newhouse Transaction was treated as a
    non-substantive merger, and therefore, the Newhouse Transaction
    was recorded at the investor’s historical basis.

For financial reporting purposes, we are the successor reporting
    entity to DHC. Because there is no effective change in
    ownership, in accordance with Accounting Research
    Bulletin No. 51, paragraph 11, both DHC and DCH
    will be consolidated in our financial statements as if the
    transaction had occurred January 1, 2008. The presentation
    of the DCH financial statements in accordance with
    U.S. GAAP includes the results of DCH’s operations as
    an equity method investment for the period prior to
    January 1, 2008. For purposes of analyzing DCH’s
    business in this management’s discussion and analysis, we
    have presented our consolidated operating results for 2008
    consistent with our financial statement presentation, while the
    2007 results have been presented as if the Newhouse Transaction
    occurred on January 1, 2007.

The following table summarizes the defined terms concerning the
    various Discovery entities included in this analysis:

    Restructuring and Travel Channel Disposition

On May 14, 2007, Cox Communications Holdings, Inc.
    exchanged its 25% ownership interest in DCH for all of the
    capital stock of a subsidiary of DCH that held the Travel
    Channel and travelchannel.com and approximately
    $1.3 billion in cash. The result was an increase in
    DHC’s proportional ownership of DCH from 50% to


/


%.
    Consequently, DHC’s 2007 earnings in equity interests of
    DCH reflect the change in ownership.

Revenue

.

Our consolidated revenue
    increased $240 million for the year ended December 31,
    2008 when compared with 2007. Distribution revenue increased
    $163 million during the year primarily due to International
    Networks subscriber growth combined with annual contract
    increases for the fully distributed U.S. Networks, offset
    by the disposition of Travel Channel. Advertising revenue
    increased $51 million for the period, and is primarily
    attributed to higher pricing and cash sellout rates in
    U.S. Networks. Other revenue increased $26 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2008 when compared with 2007,
    primarily due to an increase in licensing revenue in the
    International Networks, increase in sales of the Planet Earth
    DVD through a joint venture, and increases in revenue from our
    representation of the Travel Channel through our
    U.S. Networks segment, offset by a decline in revenue from
    the direct to consumer business in our Commerce, Education, and
    Other business segment.

    content amortization and other production related expenses in
    addition to distribution and merchandising costs, decreased
    $203 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 when
    compared to 2007. The decrease in cost of revenues was primarily
    due to the effect of content impairment charges in the fourth
    quarter 2007 of $139 million primarily in
    U.S. Networks coupled with a $76 million decrease in
    related amortization expense. These decreases were partially
    offset by increases in costs of revenue in the International
    Networks and content impairment related to TLC.

Selling, general & administrative

.

Selling, general & administrative expenses, which
    include certain personnel, marketing and other general and
    administrative expenses, decreased $203 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2008 from 2007, primarily
    attributable to a $210 million decrease in expenses arising
    from long-term incentive plans, which were partially offset by
    slight increases in costs incurred in conjunction with DCH
    preparing to become a consolidated subsidiary of ours as a
    result of the Newhouse Transaction and an increase in personnel
    costs in International Networks. Expenses arising from long-term
    incentive plans are largely related to DCH’s unit-based,
    long-term incentive plan, the Discovery Appreciation Plan or the
    “DAP”, or “LTIP”, which was modified to
    reflect our capital structure following the Newhouse
    Transaction. Prior to the Newhouse Transaction, the value of
    units in the LTIP was indexed to the value of DHC Series A
    common stock. After the Newhouse Transaction, the units remained
    outstanding and were converted at the effective time of the
    Newhouse Transaction to track changes in the value of our
    Series A common stock. The change in unit value of LTIP
    awards outstanding is recorded as expenses arising from
    long-term incentive plans over the period outstanding. Primarily
    due to the decrease in both the DHC Series A common stock
    and our Series A common stock price during the year ended
    December 31, 2008, we recorded a benefit of
    $69 million to expenses arising from long-term incentive
    plans in 2008 compared to expenses arising from long-term
    incentive plans of $141 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007. In the fourth quarter 2008, eligible new
    hires and promoted employees received stock options that vest in
    four equal installments, and those employees with LTIP units
    that vest between September 18, 2008 and March 14,
    2009 will receive cash-settled stock appreciation awards that
    expire in March 2010. We do not intend to make additional
    cash-settled stock appreciation awards, except as may be
    required by contract or to employees in countries where stock
    option awards are not permitted.

Depreciation and amortization

.

The
    increase in depreciation and amortization for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 is due to an increase in intangible
    assets resulting from the reclassification of DHC intangibles
    following the Newhouse Transaction and the HowStuffWorks.com
    acquisition.

Asset impairment

.

During the fourth
    quarter of 2008, we recorded a write-off of intangible assets of
    $30 million related to our HowStuffWorks.com business. This
    write-off of intangible assets was due to the decline in the
    cash flows projected to be generated by the HowStuffWorks.com
    business. During the second quarter of 2007, DCH recorded an
    asset impairment of $26 million which represents write-offs
    of intangible assets related to the education business .

Exit and restructuring costs

.

During the year
    ended December 31, 2008, we recorded $31 million in
    restructuring charges, of which $11 million relates to the
    relocation and severance costs related to TLC’s
    repositioning strategy, $6 million for the termination of a
    production group, and $6 million due to the closure of our
    commerce distribution center and our store headquarters offices
    along with the transition of the remaining commerce distribution
    services to third-party service providers. During the year ended
    December 31, 2007, we recorded restructuring charges of
    $20 million related to a number of organizational and
    strategic adjustments. The purpose of these adjustments was to
    better align our organizational structure with our new strategic
    priorities and to respond to continuing changes within the media
    industry.



Gain on disposition of a business

.

In
    2007, we exchanged the capital stock of a subsidiary that held
    the Travel Channel and travelchannel.com (collectively, the
    “Travel Business”) for Cox Communications Holdings,
    Inc.’s 25% ownership interest in us and $1.3 billion
    in cash. The distribution of the Travel Business, which was
    valued at $575 million, resulted in a $135 million
    tax-free gain.

Equity in (loss) income of unconsolidated
    affiliates

.

Equity in loss of unconsolidated
    affiliates in 2008 consisted primarily of a $57 million
    other-than-temporary decline in the value of our equity method
    investment in HSWi, coupled with $13 million in equity
    losses recorded during 2008, which is offset by equity in income
    from our joint ventures in Canada and Japan. In 2007, we
    recognized $9 million of equity in income primarily from
    our joint ventures in Canada and Japan.

Interest expense, net

.

On May 14,
    2007, we entered into a $1.5 billion term loan in
    conjunction with the transaction with Cox Communications
    Holdings, Inc., offset by a $180 million payment for a
    senior note that matured. The increase in interest expense for
    the year ended December 31, 2008 when compared with 2007 is
    primarily a result of the term loan.

Other, net

.

Other, net includes our
    other non-operating income net of non-operating expenses, as
    well as, unrealized losses from derivative instruments. Other
    non-operating income consisted of a $47 million reduction
    of a liability related to the value of shares in HSWi to be
    exchanged to its former shareholders, which was recorded in
    December 2008. Offsetting this non-operating income is
    unrealized losses from derivative transactions. Unrealized
    losses from derivative transactions relate primarily to our use
    of derivative instruments to modify our exposure to interest
    rate fluctuations on our debt. These instruments include a
    combination of swaps, caps, collars and other structured
    instruments. As a result of unrealized mark to market
    adjustments, we recognized unrealized losses of $31 million
    and $9 million during the years ended December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. The foreign exchange hedging
    instruments used by us are spot, forward and option contracts.
    Additionally, we enter into non-designated forward contracts to
    hedge non-dollar denominated cash flows and foreign currency
    balances. See “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
    about Market Risk” for a more detailed discussion of our
    hedging activities.

Income tax expense

.

Our effective tax
    rate was 47% and 36% for the years ended December 31, 2008
    and 2007, respectively. Our effective tax rate for the year
    ended December 31, 2008 differed from the federal income
    tax rate of 35% primarily due to DHC’s recognition of
    deferred tax expense related to its investment in DCH (net of
    tax benefit from intangible amortization related to the spin-off
    of the Travel Channel in 2007), which is partially offset by the
    release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of
    Ascent Media Sound, Inc. Other items impacting the effective tax
    rate include the following: our conversion from deducting
    foreign taxes to claiming foreign tax credits, foreign
    unrecognized tax positions, and other miscellaneous items. Our
    effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 was
    not materially different than the federal income tax rate of
    35%. However, during this period we benefited from the tax-free
    treatment of the gain recognized on the disposition of the
    Travel Channel and the release of Travel Channel deferred tax
    liabilities, offset by the tax impact of discontinued operations.

Minority interests, net of
    tax

.

Minority interests primarily represent
    our and consolidated entities’ portion of earnings which
    are allocable to the minority partners, as well as the increases
    and decreases in the estimated redemption value of redeemable
    interests in subsidiaries. The increase in minority interest
    during the year ended December 31, 2008 is primarily a
    result of our increased profits allocated to minority partners
    prior to the Newhouse Transaction and reporting of our financial
    results in accordance with ARB 51.

On September 17, 2008, as part of the Newhouse Transaction,
    DHC completed the spin-off to its shareholders of AMC, a
    subsidiary holding the cash and businesses of DHC, except for
    CSS, which provides sound, music, mixing, sound effects and
    other related services under brand names such as Sound One, POP
    Sound, Soundelux and Todd A-O (which businesses remained with us
    following the completion of the Newhouse Transaction). The AMC
    spin-off was structured such that there was no gain or loss
    related to the transaction.

Just prior to the Newhouse Transaction, DHC sold its ownership
    interests in Ascent Media CANS, LLC

(d/b/a AccentHealth)

to AccentHealth Holdings LLC, an unaffiliated third party, for
    approximately $119 million in cash. It was determined that
    AccentHealth was a non-core asset, and the sale of AccentHealth
    was consistent with DHC’s strategy to divest non-core
    assets. DHC recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately
    $64 million in connection with the sale of AccentHealth,
    which is recorded as a component of discontinued operations. As
    there is no continuing involvement in the operations of AMC or
    AccentHealth, the financial results of their operations have
    been presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated
    financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement
    No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
    Long-Lived Assets (“FAS 144”).



Operating
    Division Results

As noted above, our operations are divided into three segments:
    U.S. Networks, International Networks and Commerce,
    Education, and Other. Corporate expenses primarily consist of
    corporate functions, executive management and administrative
    support services. Corporate expenses are excluded from segment
    results to enable executive management to evaluate business
    segment performance based upon decisions made directly by
    business segment executives. Operating results exclude LTIP
    expense, restructuring amounts, impairments, and operating
    gains, consistent with our segment reporting. See Note 24.

As noted above, in May 2007, we exchanged our subsidiary holding
    the Travel Channel, travelchannel.com and approximately
    $1.3 billion in cash for Cox’s interest in DCH.
    Accordingly, DCH’s 2007 results of operations do not
    include Travel Channel after May 14, 2007. The disposal of
    Travel Channel does not meet the requirements for discontinued
    operations presentation. The following table represents
    U.S. Networks results of operations excluding Travel
    Channel for all periods. Although this presentation is not in
    accordance with U.S. GAAP, we believe this presentation
    provides a more meaningful comparison of the U.S. Networks
    results of operations and allows the reader to better understand
    the U.S. Networks ongoing operations.

Since the disposal of Travel Channel in 2007 did not meet the
    requirements of discontinued operations presentation, and the
    results of Travel Channel are not consolidated with DCH post
    transaction, the following discussion excludes the results of
    Travel Channel for all periods so as to facilitate comparability
    of the U.S. Networks segment data.

Revenue

.

Total revenue increased
    $183 million for the year ended December 31, 2008,
    when compared with 2007. Distribution revenue increased
    $87 million over the period, driven by annual contractual
    rate increases for fully distributed networks combined with
    subscription units, principally from networks carried on the
    digital tier. Distribution revenue includes a one-time
    $8 million adjustment resulting from improvements in our
    methodology of estimating accrued revenue for certain
    distribution operators. The adjustment was recorded in its
    entirety in the second quarter of 2008 and is not material to
    the current or prior periods. Contra revenue items included in
    distribution revenue, such as launch amortization and marketing
    consideration, decreased $19 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 when compared with 2007. This decrease
    includes $3 million for replacement decoder boxes to
    support the digitization of an analog transponder recorded as
    contra revenue in the second quarter of 2007.

Advertising revenue increased $83 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008, when compared with the prior year,
    primarily due to higher pricing in the up-front and scatter
    markets, as well as higher cash sellouts, which were partially
    offset by under-delivery of committed audience levels, when
    compared with the corresponding prior year periods.

Other revenue increased $13 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, primarily from our representation of the
    Travel Channel, which increased $11 million during the
    period, coupled with an increase of $5 million in revenue
    from How Stuff Works, which was acquired in December 2007. These
    increases were partially offset by a decrease of $6 million
    of international program sales revenue, which is now reported in
    the International Networks segment.

Cost of revenue

.

For the year ended
    December 31, 2008, cost of revenue decreased
    $164 million when compared with 2007, primarily due to a
    decrease in content amortization expense of $156 million.
    The decrease in content amortization expense was primarily a
    result of the effect of the $129 million content impairment
    charge recorded in 2007 following a change in management and
    related changes in strategy. This charge coupled with the
    related $76 million decrease in content amortization
    expense was offset by $17 million of content impairment
    charges for TLC programs following a change in management and
    related changes in strategy in the second half of 2008, and
    content amortization expense for new programming on Discovery
    Channel, TLC, Planet Green and Science Channel.

Selling, general & administrative
    expenses

.

Total selling, general and
    administrative expenses increased $29 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008, when compared with 2007, which was
    primarily a result



of a $34 million increase in personnel costs, primarily
    driven by continued investment in digital media, including
    acquisitions made during the third and fourth quarters of 2007.
    This increase was partially offset by decreased marketing
    expense of $12 million for the year ended December 31,
    2008 when compared with the corresponding prior year period.

Revenue

.

Total revenue increased
    $128 million for the year ended December 31, 2008,
    when compared with 2007, driven by an increase in distribution
    revenue of $98 million. Distribution revenue increased
    $76 million in EMEA, Latin America, and Asia primarily as a
    result of a 16% increase in average paying subscription units.
    In addition, foreign exchange had a favorable impact of
    $13 million on distribution revenues for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 when compared with 2007.

Advertising revenue increased $6 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, when compared with 2007. Advertising
    revenue increased $42 million in EMEA and Latin America
    primarily due to higher viewership combined with an increased
    subscriber base in most markets worldwide. These increases were
    offset by a $35 million decrease in the U.K. due to an
    interpretation of a contract provision resulting in a limitation
    in our ability to monetize our audience in the U.K., as well as,
    a deterioration in market conditions. Advertising revenue
    decreased $4 million due to the impact of unfavorable
    foreign exchange.

Other revenue increased $24 million mainly due to
    improvement in licensing and sales of programs primarily in the
    U.K. offset by a $2 million unfavorable foreign exchange
    impact.

Cost of revenue

.

Cost of revenue
    increased $21 million for the year ended December 31,
    2008, when compared with 2007, driven by a $40 million
    increase in content amortization expense due to continued
    investment in original productions and language customization to
    support additional local feeds for growth in local ad sales
    partially offset by favorable foreign exchange of
    $10 million and a reduction in sales commissions of
    $5 million.

Selling general & administrative
    expenses

.

Selling, general &
    administrative expenses decreased $29 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008, when compared with 2007. This
    decrease was driven by a $26 million reduction in marketing
    expenditures coupled with the favorable impact of
    $3 million from foreign exchange.

Revenue

.

Commerce, Education, and Other
    total revenue decreased $29 million for the year ended 2008
    when compared with the prior year. A challenging retail
    environment in 2008 coupled with the success of the Planet Earth
    DVD in 2007 contributed to a year over year decline of 48% in
    revenue from the direct to consumer business, which was
    partially offset by higher licensing revenue. Education revenue
    increased by $6 million as the core streaming business
    continued to grow. New revenue streams in licensing and
    sponsorships were slightly offset by the decline in the hardcopy
    business as customers shifted to our digital services. Revenues
    generated by the CSS business were relatively flat compared with
    2007.

Cost of revenue

.

Cost of revenue
    decreased $35 million for the year ended December 31,
    2008, commensurate with the decrease in Commerce’s product
    revenue coupled with a decrease in Education’s content
    amortization, which resulted from the fourth quarter 2007
    write-off of capitalized content costs that were not aligned
    with Education’s product offerings.

Selling, general & administrative
    expenses

.

Selling, general &
    administrative expenses decreased $3 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008. The decrease was primarily due to
    lower personnel and marketing costs incurred in Commerce and
    Education coupled with a $2 million legal expense in 2007
    for a legal settlement. These decreases were partially offset by
    a slight increase in selling, general and administrative expense
    from the CSS business.

Corporate is mainly comprised of ancillary revenue and expenses
    from a joint venture, corporate functions, executive management
    and administrative support services. Consistent with our segment
    reporting, corporate expenses are excluded from segment results
    to enable executive management to evaluate business segment
    performance based upon decisions made directly by business
    segment executives.

Corporate revenue increased $20 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, when compared with 2007, primarily due
    to increased ancillary revenue from a joint venture, whose
    primary sales were of the Planet Earth DVD; current sales volume
    is not expected to continue. Corporate costs increased
    $32 million, for the year ended December 31, 2008,
    driven by increased costs incurred in conjunction with our
    preparing to become a public entity as a result of the Newhouse
    Transaction and costs related to the

start-up

of
    OWN.

Ascent Media’s CSS group generated revenue primarily from
    fees for sound, music, mixing sound effects and other related
    services under brand names such as Sound One, POP Sound,
    Soundelux and Todd A-O. Generally, these services pertain to the
    completion of feature films, television programs and
    advertisements. These projects normally span from a few days to
    three months or more in length, and fees for these projects
    typically range from less than $1,000 to $200,000.

Expenses related to the corporate support from DHC are reflected
    in selling, general and administrative expenses. Cost of
    services and operating expenses consists primarily of production
    wages, facility costs and other direct costs.

Revenue.

Revenue for CSS decreased
    $4 million to $76 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, when compared with the same period in
    2006. This decrease was driven by smaller feature sound projects
    and the shut down of certain audio facilities in 2006.

Total operating costs and expenses.

Total
    operating costs and expenses decreased $7 million to
    $84 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, when
    compared with the same period in 2006. This decrease was driven
    by the reduction of costs that resulted from the shut down of
    certain audio facilities and related selling, general and
    administrative expenses.

Equity in earnings of Discovery Communications Holding,
    LLC.

From January 1, 2006 through
    May 14, 2007, DHC recorded its 50% share of the earnings of
    DCH. Subsequent to May 14, 2007 and prior to



September 17, 2008, the date the Newhouse Transaction
    closed, DHC recorded its

    share of the earnings of DCH. DHC’s share of earnings in
    DCH increased $38 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, when compared with the same period in
    2006. This increase resulted from DHC’s $90 million
    share of DCH’s gain on the Cox Transaction, along with an
    $8 million increase due to DHC’s increase in share
    ownership in DCH from 50% to


/


%.
    These increases were partially offset by higher long-term
    incentive compensation expense for DCH personnel and higher
    interest at DCH as a result of debt incurred to close the Cox
    Transaction.

Net loss from Discontinued Operations.

The net
    loss from discontinued operations increased $56 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2007, from the comparable
    period in 2006, primarily as a result of a $72 million
    increase in charges related to the impairment of goodwill on the
    AMC business for the year ended December 31, 2007, when
    compared with the same period in 2006. The increase in goodwill
    impairment charges was partially offset by an improvement in
    operating performance on the AMC business.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

The following table represents a comparison of the components of
    the statement of cash flows, as reported for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, with a
    reconciliation of historical DCH statement of cash flows for the
    year ended December 31, 2007. Our as-adjusted statement of
    cash flows represents the cash flow activities as if the
    Newhouse Transaction was completed January 1, 2007. The
    table includes the cash flow activity for AMC for both periods,
    including cash provided by operating activities of
    $28 million, cash provided by investing activities of
    $128 million, and cash used in financing activities of
    $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. AMC
    cash provided by operating activities was $61 million, cash
    used in investing activities was $15 million, and cash
    provided by financing activities was $2 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2007.

Sources
    of Cash

Our principal sources of liquidity are cash in-hand, cash flows
    from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. We
    anticipate that our cash flows from operations, existing cash,
    cash equivalents and borrowing capacity under our revolving
    credit facility are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash
    requirements for at least the next 12 months.



Total Liquidity at December 31, 2008.

As
    of December 31, 2008 we had approximately $1.3 billion
    of total liquidity, comprised of approximately $100 million
    in cash and cash equivalents and the ability to borrow
    approximately $1.2 billion under our revolving credit
    facilities. In October 2008, we repaid $11 million
    outstanding under our U.K. revolving credit facility. This
    facility was closed at our election in December 2008 and would
    have expired according to its terms in April 2009.

Cash Provided by Operations.

For the year
    ended December 31, 2008, our cash provided by operating
    activities was $569 million compared to $300 million
    for the same period as adjusted in 2007.

Proceeds from the sale of business.

During the
    year ended December 31, 2008, AMC received proceeds of
    $139 million primarily from the sale of Accent Health as
    part of the spin-off of AMC.

Debt Facilities.

Our committed debt facilities
    include two term loans, a revolving loan facility and various
    senior notes payable. The second term loan was entered into on
    May 14, 2007 for $1.5 billion in connection with the
    Cox Transaction. Total commitments of these facilities were
    $4.9 billion at December 31, 2008. Debt outstanding on
    these facilities aggregated $3.7 billion at
    December 31, 2008, providing excess debt availability of
    $1.2 billion.

We currently have fixed the interest rate on the majority of our
    outstanding debt. The anticipated interest payments, together
    with the scheduled principal payments, due over the next year
    are within the available capacity on our committed facilities.
    Although we have adequate liquidity to fund our operations and
    to meet our debt service obligations over the next
    12 months, we may seek to arrange new financing in the
    current year in advance of the maturity of our debt facility in
    2010. Also, our current performance on the leverage and other
    financial maintenance tests is at levels within the established
    thresholds of the debt agreements indicating some ability to
    absorb lower than expected operating results and still remain
    within the covenant limits.

DCH’s $1.5 billion term loan is secured by its assets,
    excluding assets held by its subsidiaries. The remaining term
    loan, revolving loan and senior notes are unsecured. The debt
    facilities contain covenants that require the respective
    borrowers to meet certain financial ratios and place
    restrictions on the payment of dividends, sale of assets,
    additional borrowings, mergers, and purchases of capital stock,
    assets and investments. We were in compliance with all debt
    covenants as of December 31, 2008.

Our interest expense associated with our debt facilities is
    exposed to movements in short-term interest rates. Derivative
    instruments, including both fixed to variable and variable to
    fixed interest rate instruments, are used to modify this
    exposure. The variable to fixed interest rate instruments have a
    notional principal amount of $2.3 billion and have a
    weighted average interest rate of 4.68% against 3 month
    LIBOR at December 31, 2008. The fixed to variable interest
    rate agreements have a notional principal amount of
    $50 million and have a weighted average interest rate of
    7.90% against fixed rate private placement debt at
    December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, we held an
    unexercised interest rate swap put with a notional amount of
    $25 million at a fixed rate of 5.44%.

On January 29, 2009, we entered into interest rate swap
    transactions which will become effective on June 30, 2010,
    with a notional amount of $200 million. Under the swap
    transactions, we will make quarterly payments at a rate of
    approximately 2.935% per annum to the swap counterparties in
    exchange for a payment approximately equal to the variable rate
    payable under our Credit, Pledge and Security Agreement dated as
    of May 14, 2007. The swap transactions terminate on
    March 31, 2014, which is the interest payment date before
    the maturity date of our Credit, Pledge and Security Agreement,
    which is May 14, 2014. The terms of the swap transactions
    are governed by customary ISDA interest rate swap agreements.

By entering into these swap transactions, we have effectively
    fixed the interest rate on $200 million of the borrowings under
    its Credit, Pledge and Security Agreement at approximately
    4.935% per annum, starting as of June 30, 2010.

Uses
    of Cash

During the year ended December 31, 2008, our primary uses
    of cash were cash payments for content of $803 million,
    mandatory principal payments under our bank facilities and
    senior notes totaling $257 million,



cash payments of $125 million under our revolving loans,
    capital expenditures of $102 million, and payments under
    our LTIP of $49 million. During the year ended
    December 31, 2007, on an as-adjusted basis, our primary
    uses of cash were the redemption of Cox’s equity interests
    of $1.3 billion, cash payments for content of
    $706 million and capital expenditures of $127 million.

In 2009, we expect our uses of cash to be approximately
    $445 million for debt repayments, $225 million for
    interest expense, and $60 million for capital expenditures.
    We have no material commitments for capital expenditures. We
    will also be required to make payments under our LTIP as well as
    for stock appreciation rights issued under our Incentive Plan.
    Amounts expensed and payable under the LTIP are dependent on
    future annual calculations of unit values which are primarily
    affected by changes in our stock price, changes in units
    outstanding, and changes to the plan.

Joint Venture Arrangement.

On June 19,
    2008, we entered in to a

50-50

joint
    venture with Oprah Winfrey and Harpo, Inc. (“Harpo”)
    to rebrand Discovery Health Channel as OWN: Oprah Winfrey
    Network (“OWN Network”). It is expected that Discovery
    Health will be rebranded as OWN in late 2009 or early 2010.
    Pursuant to the agreement, we have committed to make capital
    contributions of up to $100 million through
    September 30, 2011, of which $6 million has been
    funded as of December 31, 2008. We anticipate that a
    significant portion of the $100 million funding obligation
    will occur in 2009.

Factors
    Affecting Sources of Liquidity

If we were to experience a significant decline in operating
    performance, or have to meet an unanticipated need for
    additional liquidity beyond our available commitments, there is
    no certainty that we would be able to access the needed
    liquidity. While we have established relationships with
    U.S. and international banks and investors which continue
    to participate in our various credit agreements, the current
    tightening in the credit markets may cause some lenders to have
    to reduce or withdraw their commitments if we were to seek to
    negotiate a refinancing or an increase in our total commitments.
    Covenants in existing debt agreements may constrain our capacity
    for additional debt or there may be significant increases in
    costs to refinance existing debt to access additional liquidity.
    As a public company, we may have access to other sources of
    capital such as the public bond and equity markets. However,
    access to sufficient liquidity in these markets is not assured
    given our substantial debt outstanding and the continued
    volatility in the equity markets and further tightening in the
    credit markets.

Our access to capital markets can be affected by factors outside
    of our control. In addition, our cost to borrow is impacted by
    market conditions and our financial performance as measured by
    certain credit metrics defined in our credit agreements,
    including interest coverage and leverage ratios.

Contractual
    Obligations

We have agreements covering leases of satellite transponders,
    facilities and equipment. These agreements expire at various
    dates through 2028. We are obligated to license programming
    under agreements with content suppliers that expire over various
    dates. We also have other contractual commitments arising in the
    ordinary course of business.



A summary of all of the expected payments for these commitments
    as well as future principal payments under the current debt
    arrangements and minimum payments under capital leases at
    December 31, 2008 is as follows:

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with
    U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments
    and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
    consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. On an
    ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates, which are based on
    historical experience and on various other assumptions believed
    reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these
    evaluations form the basis for making judgments about the
    carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported
    amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other
    sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under
    different assumptions. Critical accounting policies impact the
    presentation of our financial condition and results of
    operations and require significant judgment and estimates. An
    appreciation of our critical accounting policies facilitates an
    understanding of our financial results. Amounts disclosed relate
    to Discovery, as-adjusted for 2007 and Discovery for 2008.
    Unless otherwise noted, we applied critical accounting policies
    and estimates methods consistently in all material respects and
    for all periods presented. For further information regarding
    these critical accounting policies and estimates, please see the
    Notes to our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue

We derive revenue from (i) distribution revenue from cable
    systems, satellite operators and other distributors,
    (ii) advertising aired on our networks and websites, and
    (iii) other, which is largely

e-commerce

and educational sales.



Distribution.

Distributors generally pay a
    per-subscriber fee for the right to distribute our programming
    under the terms of long-term distribution contracts
    (“distribution revenue”). Distribution revenue is
    reported net of incentive costs or other consideration, if any,
    offered to system operators in exchange for long-term
    distribution contracts. We recognize distribution revenue over
    the term of the contracts based on contracted monthly license
    fee provisions and reported subscriber levels. Network
    incentives have historically included upfront cash incentives
    referred to as “launch support” in connection with the
    launch of a network by the distributor within certain time
    frames. Any such amounts are capitalized as assets upon launch
    of our programming by the distributor and are amortized on a
    straight-line basis as a reduction of revenue over the terms of
    the contracts. In instances where the distribution agreement is
    extended prior to the expiration of the original term, we
    evaluate the economics of the extended term and, if it is
    determined that the deferred launch asset continues to benefit
    us over the extended term, then we will adjust the launch
    amortization period accordingly. Other incentives are recognized
    as a reduction of revenue as incurred.

The amount of distribution revenue due to us is reported by
    distributors based on actual subscriber levels. Such information
    is generally not received until after the close of the reporting
    period. Therefore, reported distribution revenue is based upon
    our estimates of the number of subscribers receiving our
    programming for the month, plus an adjustment for the prior
    month estimate. Our subscriber estimates are based on the most
    recent remittance or confirmation of subscribers received from
    the distributor.

Advertising.

We record advertising revenue net
    of agency commissions and audience deficiency liabilities in the
    period advertising spots are broadcast. A substantial portion of
    the advertising sold in the United States includes guaranteed
    levels of audience that either the program or the advertisement
    will reach. Deferred revenue is recorded and adjusted as the
    guaranteed audience levels are achieved. Audience guarantees are
    initially developed by our internal research group and actual
    audience and delivery information is provided by third party
    ratings services. In certain instances, the third party ratings
    information is not received until after the close of the
    reporting period. In these cases, reported advertising revenue
    and related deferred revenue is based on our estimates for any
    under-delivery of contracted advertising ratings based on the
    most current data available from the third party ratings
    service. Differences between the estimated under-delivery and
    the actual under-delivery have historically been insignificant.
    Online advertising revenues are recognized as impressions are
    delivered.

Certain of our advertising arrangements include deliverables in
    addition to commercial time, such as the advertiser’s
    product integration into the programming, customized vignettes,
    and billboards. These contracts that include other deliverables
    are evaluated as multiple element revenue arrangements under

EITF 00-21,

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.

Commerce, Education, and Other.

Commerce
    revenue is recognized upon product shipment, net of estimated
    returns, which are not material to our consolidated financial
    statements. Educational service sales are generally recognized
    ratably over the term of the agreement. CSS services revenue is
    recognized when services are performed. Revenue from
    post-production and certain distribution related services is
    recognized when services are provided. Prepayments received for
    services to be performed at a later date are deferred.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,

(“FAS 133”), requires every derivative
    instrument to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as
    either an asset or a liability. The statement also requires that
    changes in the fair value of derivatives be recognized currently
    in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.
    We use financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges. The
    effective changes in fair value of derivatives designated as
    cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss). Amounts are reclassified from accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) as interest expense is recorded for
    debt. We use the cumulative dollar offset method to assess
    effectiveness. To be highly effective, the ratio calculated by
    dividing the cumulative change in the value of the actual swap
    by the cumulative change in the hypothetical swap must be
    between 80% and 125%. The ineffective portion of a
    derivative’s change in fair value is immediately recognized
    in earnings. We use derivative instruments principally to manage
    the risk associated



with the movements of foreign currency exchange rates and
    changes in interest rates that will affect the cash flows of our
    debt transactions. Refer to Note 12 for additional
    information regarding derivative instruments held by us and risk
    management strategies.

Content
    Rights

Costs incurred in the direct production, co-production or
    licensing of content rights are capitalized and stated at the
    lower of unamortized cost, fair value, or net realizable value.
    In accordance with

SOP 00-2,

Accounting by Producers or Distributors of Films

, we
    amortize our content assets based upon the ratio of current
    revenue to total estimated revenue (“ultimate
    revenue”). To determine this ratio, we analyze historical
    and projected usage for similar programming and apply such usage
    factors to projected revenue by network adjusted for any future
    significant programming strategy changes.

The result of this policy is an accelerated amortization pattern
    for the fully distributed U.S. Networks segment (Discovery
    Channel, TLC, Animal Planet) and Discovery Channel in the
    International Networks segment over a period of no more than
    four years. The accelerated amortization pattern results in the
    amortization of approximately 40% to 50% of the program cost
    during the first year. Topical or current events programming is
    amortized over shorter periods based on the nature of the
    programming and may be expensed upon its initial airing. All
    other networks in the U.S. Networks segment and
    International Networks segment utilize up to five year useful
    life. For these networks, with programming investment levels
    lower than the established networks and higher reuse of
    programming, straight-line amortization is considered a
    reasonable estimate of the use of content consistent with the
    pace of earning ultimate revenue.

Ultimate revenue assessments include advertising and affiliate
    revenue streams. Ancillary revenue is considered immaterial to
    the assessment. Changes in management’s assumptions, such
    as changes in expected use, could significantly alter our
    estimates for amortization. Amortization is approximately
    $658 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and
    the unamortized programming balance at December 31, 2008 is
    $1.2 billion.

Programming that we expect to alter planned use by reduction or
    removal from a network because of changes in network strategy is
    written down to its net realizable value based on adjusted
    ultimate revenues when identified. On a periodic basis,
    management evaluates the net realizable value of content in
    conjunction with our strategic review of the business. Changes
    in management’s assumptions, such as changes in expected
    use, could significantly alter our estimates for write-offs.
    During the third quarter 2008, we implemented significant
    changes in brand strategies for TLC. As a result, we recorded a
    content impairment charge of $17 million, which is included
    as a component of content amortization expense. Consolidated
    content impairment, including accelerated amortization of
    certain programs is approximately $39 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008.

Expenses
    Arising from Long-Term Incentive Plans

Expenses arising from liability awards based on long-term
    incentive plans are primarily related to our unit-based,
    long-term incentive plan (LTIP), for our employees who meet
    certain eligibility criteria. Units were awarded to eligible
    employees and vest at a rate of 25% per year. Prior to the
    Newhouse Transaction, we accounted for the LTIP in accordance
    with FAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Financial
    Instruments and

EITF 02-08,

Accounting for Options Granted to Employees in Unrestricted,
    Publicly Traded Shares of an Unrelated Entity, as the value of
    units in the LTIP was indexed to the value of DHC Series A
    common stock. Upon redemption of the LTIP awards, participants
    received a cash payment based on the difference between the
    market price of DHC Series A common stock on the vesting
    date and the market price on the date of grant. Following the
    Newhouse Transaction, units remained outstanding and were
    adjusted to track changes in the value of our publicly traded
    stock. We account for these cash settled stock appreciation
    awards in accordance with FAS 123(R),

Share-Based
    Payment

.

The value of units in the LTIP is calculated using the
    Black-Scholes model each reporting period, and the change in
    unit value of LTIP awards outstanding is recorded as
    compensation expense over the period outstanding. We elected to
    attribute expense for the units in accordance with
    FAS 123R. We use volatility of



DHC common stock or our common stock, if available, in our
    Black-Scholes models. However, if the term of the units is in
    excess of the period common stock has been outstanding, we use a
    combination of historical and implied volatility. Different
    assumptions could result in different market valuations. However
    the most significant factor in determining the unit value is the
    price of common stock.

Goodwill
    and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested
    annually for impairment during the fourth quarter or earlier
    upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in
    circumstances. Our 2008 annual goodwill impairment analysis,
    which was performed during the fourth quarter, did not result in
    any impairment charges. However, over the past year, the decline
    in our stock price suggests in a lower estimated fair value for
    each of our reporting units. As a result of this decline, the
    estimated fair value of the U.K. reporting unit approximates its
    carrying value. Accordingly, future declines in estimated fair
    values may result in goodwill impairment charges. It is possible
    that such charges, if required, could be recorded prior to the
    fourth quarter of 2009 (i.e., during an interim period) if our
    stock price, our results of operations, or other factors require
    such assets to be tested for impairment at an interim date.

Goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process. The
    first step of the process is to compare the fair value of a
    reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. In
    performing the first step, we determine the fair value of a
    reporting unit by using two valuation techniques: a discounted
    cash flow (“DCF”) analysis and a market-based
    approach. Determining fair value requires the exercise of
    significant judgments, including judgments about appropriate
    discount rates, perpetual growth rates, relevant comparable
    company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected
    future cash flows. The cash flows employed in the DCF analyses
    are based on our budget and long-term business plan. In
    assessing the reasonableness of its determined fair values, we
    evaluate our results against other value indicators such as
    comparable company public trading values, research analyst
    estimates and values observed in market transactions. If the
    fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount,
    goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second
    step of the impairment test is not necessary. If the carrying
    amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second
    step of the goodwill impairment test is required to be performed
    to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second
    step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair
    value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying
    amount of that goodwill and

non-amortizing

trademarks. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in
    the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a
    business combination. In other words, the estimated fair value
    of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and
    liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible
    assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business
    combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the
    purchase price paid. If the carrying amount of the reporting
    unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that
    goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to
    the excess.

The impairment test for other intangible assets not subject to
    amortization involves a comparison of the estimated fair value
    of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying
    value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an
    impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
    The estimates of fair value of intangible assets not subject to
    amortization are determined using a DCF valuation analysis.

Long-lived
    Assets

Long-lived assets (e.g., amortizing trademarks, customer lists,
    other intangibles and property, plant and equipment) do not
    require that an annual impairment test be performed; instead,
    long-lived assets are tested for impairment upon the occurrence
    of a triggering event. Triggering events include the likely
    (i.e., more likely than not) disposal of a portion of such
    assets or the occurrence of an adverse change in the market
    involving the business employing the related assets. Once a
    triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is
    based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued
    use or to hold the asset for sale. If the intent is to hold the
    asset for continued use, the impairment test first requires a
    comparison of undiscounted future cash flows against the
    carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value of the asset
    exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, the asset would be deemed
    to be impaired. Impairment would then be measured as the
    difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying
    value. Fair value is generally determined by discounting the
    future cash flows associated with that asset. If the intent is
    to hold the asset for sale and certain other



criteria are met (e.g., the asset can be disposed of currently,
    appropriate levels of authority have approved the sale, and
    there is an active program to locate a buyer), the impairment
    test involves comparing the asset’s carrying value to its
    fair value. To the extent the carrying value is greater than the
    asset’s fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for
    the difference.

Significant judgments in this area involve determining whether a
    triggering event has occurred, determining the future cash flows
    for the assets involved and determining the proper discount rate
    to be applied in determining fair value. In 2007, there were no
    significant long-lived asset impairments.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded
    long-lived asset impairments of $30 million for HSW and
    $2 million for exit costs of certain operations.

The determination of recoverability of goodwill and other
    intangibles and long-lived assets requires significant judgment
    and estimates regarding future cash flows, fair values, and the
    appropriate grouping of assets. Such estimates are subject to
    change and could result in impairment losses being recognized in
    the future. If different reporting units, asset groupings, or
    different valuation methodologies had been used, the impairment
    test results could have differed.

Deferred
    Launch Incentives

Consideration issued to cable and satellite distributors in
    connection with the execution of long-term network distribution
    agreements is deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis as
    a reduction to revenue over the terms of the agreements.
    Obligations for fixed launch incentives are recorded at the
    inception of the agreement. Following the renewal of a
    distribution agreement, the remaining deferred consideration is
    amortized over the extended period. Amortization of deferred
    launch incentives was $75 million and $100 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    During 2007, in connection with the settlement of terms under a
    pre-existing distribution agreement, we completed negotiations
    for the renewal of long-term distribution agreements for certain
    of our U.K. networks and paid a distributor $196 million,
    most of which is being amortized over a five year period.

Redeemable
    Interests in Subsidiaries

For those instruments with an estimated redemption value,
    redeemable interests in subsidiaries are accreted or amortized
    to an estimated redemption value ratably over the period to the
    redemption date. Accretion and amortization are recorded as a
    component of minority interest expense.

Income
    Taxes

Income taxes are recorded using the asset and liability method
    of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect
    the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying
    amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
    purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A
    valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is
    more likely than not such assets will be unrealized.

Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation
    No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the
    accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a
    company’s financial statements, and prescribes a
    recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the
    financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
    position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In
    instances where we have taken or expect to take a tax position
    in its tax return and we believe it is more likely than not that
    such tax position will be upheld by the relevant taxing
    authority upon settlement, we may record the benefits of such
    tax position in our consolidated financial statements. The tax
    benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of
    benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being
    realized upon ultimate settlement. The adoption of FIN 48
    did not materially impact our consolidated financial statements.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
    (“FSP”) Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
    Issue

No. 03-6-1,

Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based
    Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities

(“FSP

No. EITF 03-6-1”).

This FSP provides that all outstanding unvested share-based
    payment awards that contain rights to non-forfeitable dividends
    or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are



considered participating securities. Because such awards are
    considered participating securities, the issuing entity is
    required to apply the two-class method of computing basic and
    diluted earnings per share. The provisions of FSP

No. EITF 03-6-1

will be effective for us on January 1, 2009, and will be
    applied retrospectively to all prior-period earnings per share
    computations. The adoption of FSP

No. EITF 03-6-1

will not have a material impact on our earnings per share
    amounts.

In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. 142-3,

Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets

(“FSP 142-3”),

which amends the factors that should be considered in developing
    renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful
    life of a recognized intangible asset pursuant to
    FAS No. 142. The provisions of

FSP 142-3

will be effective for us on January 1, 2009, and will be
    applied prospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact
    that the provisions of

FSP 142-3

will have on our consolidated financial statements.

In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities, an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133

, as
    amended (“FAS 161”). FAS No. 161 amends
    and expands the disclosure requirements of FASB Statement
    No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
    Hedging Activities

(“FAS 133”), to include
    information about how and why an entity uses derivative
    instruments; how derivative instruments and related hedged items
    are accounted for under FAS 133 and its related
    interpretations; and how derivative instruments and related
    hedged items affect an entity’s financial position,
    financial performance and cash flows. The provisions of
    FAS 161 will be effective for us on January 1, 2009.
    The adoption of FAS 161 is not expected to have a material
    impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141
    (revised 2007),

Business Combinations

(“FAS 141R”). This Statement requires, among
    other things, that companies: (1) expense business
    acquisition transaction costs, which are presently included in
    the cost of the acquisition, (2) record an asset for
    in-process research and development, which is presently expensed
    at the time of the acquisition, (3) record at fair value
    amounts for contingencies, including contingent consideration,
    as of the purchase date with subsequent adjustments recognized
    in operations, which is presently accounted for as an adjustment
    of purchase price, (4) recognize decreases in valuation
    allowances on acquired deferred tax assets in operations, which
    were are presently considered to be subsequent changes in
    consideration and are recorded as decreases in goodwill, and
    (5) measure at fair value any non-controlling interest in
    the acquiree. The provisions of FAS 141R will be effective
    for us on January 1, 2009, and will be applied
    prospectively to new business combinations consummated on or
    subsequent to the effective date. Generally, the effects of
    FAS 141R will depend on future acquisitions.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements

(“FAS 160”). FAS 160 establishes
    accounting and reporting standards for the non-controlling
    interest in a subsidiary, commonly referred to as minority
    interest. Among other matters, FAS 160 requires that
    non-controlling interests be reported within equity in the
    balance sheet and that the amount of consolidated net income
    attributable to the parent and to the non-controlling interest
    to be clearly presented in the statement of income. The
    provisions of FAS 160 will be effective for us on
    January 1, 2009, and will be applied prospectively, except
    for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which shall be
    applied retrospectively to all periods presented. The adoption
    of FAS 160 is not expected to have a material impact on our
    consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued EITF Issue

No. 07-1,

Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements

(“EITF 07-1”).

EITF 07-1

defines collaborative arrangements and establishes accounting
    and reporting requirements for transactions between participants
    in the arrangement and third parties. A collaborative
    arrangement is a contractual arrangement that involves a joint
    operating activity, for example an agreement to co-produce and
    distribute programming with another media company. The
    provisions of

EITF 07-1

will be effective for us on January 1, 2009, and will be
    applied retrospectively to all periods presented. We are
    currently evaluating the impact that

EITF 07-1

will have on our consolidated financial statements.



ITEM 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

We continually monitor our economic exposure to changes in
    foreign exchange rates and may enter into foreign exchange
    agreements where and when appropriate. Substantially all of our
    foreign transactions are denominated in foreign currencies,
    including the liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries. Although
    our foreign transactions are not generally subject to
    significant foreign exchange transaction gains or losses, the
    financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated
    into United States dollars as part of our consolidated financial
    reporting. As a result, fluctuations in exchange rates affect
    our financial position and results of operations.

Our earnings and cash flow are exposed to market risk and can be
    affected by, among other things, economic conditions, interest
    rate changes, and foreign currency fluctuations. We have
    established policies, procedures and internal processes
    governing our management of market risks and the use of
    financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks. We
    use derivative financial instruments to modify our exposure to
    market risks from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange
    rates. We do not hold or enter into financial instruments for
    speculative trading purposes.

The nature and amount of our long-term debt are expected to vary
    as a result of future requirements, market conditions and other
    factors. Our interest expense is exposed to movements in
    short-term interest rates. Derivative instruments, including
    both fixed to variable and variable to fixed interest rate
    instruments, are used to modify this exposure. These instruments
    include swaps and swaptions to modify interest rate exposure.
    The variable to fixed interest rate instruments had a notional
    principal amount of $2.3 billion and a weighted average
    interest rate of 4.68% at December 31, 2008 for us and
    December 31, 2007 for DCH. The fixed to variable interest
    rate agreements had a notional principal amount of
    $50 million and $225 million and had a weighted
    average interest rate of 7.90% and 9.65% at December 31,
    2008 for us and December 31, 2007 for DCH, respectively. At
    December 31, 2008, we held an unexercised interest rate
    swap put with a notional amount of $25 million at a fixed
    rate of 5.44%. The fair value of these derivative instruments,
    which aggregate ($106) million and ($50) million at
    December 31, 2008 for us and December 31, 2007 for
    DCH, respectively, is recorded as a component of long-term
    liabilities and other current liabilities in the consolidated
    balance sheets.

Of the total of $2.9 billion principal amount, a notional
    amount of $2 billion of these derivative instruments are
    highly effective cash flow hedges. The value of these hedges at
    December 31, 2008 was ($71) million with changes in
    the mark-to-market value recorded as a component of other
    comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes. Should any portion of
    these instruments become ineffective due to a restructuring in
    our debt, the monthly changes in fair value would be reported as
    a component of other income on the Statement of Operations. We
    do not expect material hedge ineffectiveness in the next twelve
    months. As of December 31, 2008, a parallel shift in the
    interest rate yield curve equal to one percentage point would
    change the fair value of our interest rate derivative portfolio
    by approximately $49 million. In addition, a change of one
    percentage point in interest rates on variable rate debt would
    impact interest expense by approximately $6 million on a
    yearly basis.

Our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency
    fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow.
    Accordingly, we may enter into foreign currency derivative
    instruments that change in value as foreign exchange rates
    change. The foreign exchange instruments used are spot, forward,
    and option contracts. Additionally, we enter into non-designated
    forward contracts to hedge non-dollar denominated cash flows and
    foreign currency balances. At December 31, 2008 for us, and
    December 31, 2007 for DCH, the notional amount of foreign
    exchange derivative contracts was $75 million and
    $174 million, respectively. The fair value of these
    derivative instruments is recorded as a component of long-term
    liabilities and other current liabilities in the consolidated
    balance sheets. These derivative instruments did not receive
    hedge accounting treatment. As of December 31, 2008, an
    estimated 10% adverse movement in exchange rates against the US
    dollar would decrease the fair value of our portfolio by
    approximately $5 million.

We continually monitor our positions with, and the credit
    quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties
    to our financial instruments and do not anticipate
    nonperformance by the counterparties. In addition, we limit the
    amount of investment credit exposure with any one institution.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and

Shareholders of Discovery Communications, Inc.:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and
    the related consolidated statements of operations, of
    stockholders’ equity and of cash flows present fairly, in
    all material respects, the financial position of Discovery
    Communications, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31,
    2008 and the results of their operations and their cash flows
    for the year ended December 31, 2008 in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. These financial statements are the responsibility of
    the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express
    an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We
    conducted our audit of these statements in accordance with the
    standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
    (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
    audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
    the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
    assessing the accounting principles used and significant
    estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
    financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit
    provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Discovery Holding Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
    Discovery Holding Company and subsidiaries (DHC) as of
    December 31, 2007, and the related consolidated statements
    of operations, cash flows, and stockholders’ equity for
    each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31,
    2007. These consolidated financial statements are the
    responsibility of DHC’s management. Our responsibility is
    to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements
    based on our audits. We did not audit the financial statements
    of Discovery Communications Holding, LLC (a


/


%
    owned investee company as of December 31, 2007). DHC’s
    investment in Discovery Communications Holding, LLC at
    December 31, 2007 was $3,271,553,000, and its equity in the
    earnings of Discovery Communications Holding, LLC was
    $141,781,000 and $103,588,000 during the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The financial
    statements of Discovery Communications Holding, LLC and its
    predecessor were audited by other auditors whose reports have
    been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to
    the amounts included for Discovery Communications Holding, LLC,
    is based solely on the reports of the other auditors.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits and the
    reports of the other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

In our opinion, based on our audits and the reports of the other
    auditors, the consolidated financial statements referred to
    above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Discovery Holding Company and subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2007, and the results of their operations and
    their cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period
    ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

DESCRIPTION
    OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Description
    of Business

Discovery Communications, Inc. (“Discovery” or the
    “Company”) is a leading global media and entertainment
    company that provides original and purchased programming across
    multiple distribution platforms in the United States (U.S.) and
    approximately 170 other countries, with over 100 television
    networks offering customized programming in 35 languages.
    Discovery also develops and sells consumer and educational
    products and services as well as media sound services in the
    U.S. and internationally. In addition, the Company owns and
    operates a diversified portfolio of website properties and other
    digital services. The Company manages and reports its operations
    in three segments: U.S. Networks, consisting principally of
    domestic cable and satellite television network programming, web
    brands, and other digital services; International Networks,
    consisting principally of international cable and satellite
    television network programming; and Commerce, Education, and
    Other, consisting principally of e-commerce, catalog, sound
    production, and domestic licensing businesses. Financial
    information for Discovery’s reportable segments is
    presented in Note 24.

Newhouse
    Transaction and AMC Spin-off

Discovery was formed in connection with Discovery Holding
    Company (“DHC”) and Advance/Newhouse Programming
    Partnership (“Advance/Newhouse”) combining their
    respective ownership interests in Discovery Communications
    Holding, LLC (“DCH”) and exchanging those interests
    with and into Discovery, which was consummated on
    September 17, 2008 (the “Newhouse Transaction”).
    Prior to the Newhouse Transaction, DCH was a stand-alone private
    company, which was owned approximately


/


%
    by DHC and


/


%
    by Advance/Newhouse. The Newhouse Transaction was completed as
    follows:

•

On September 17, 2008, DHC completed the spin-off to its
    shareholders of Ascent Media Corporation (“AMC”), a
    subsidiary holding the cash and businesses of DHC, except for
    certain businesses that provide sound, music, mixing, sound
    effects, and other related services (“Creative Sound
    Services” or “CSS”) (the “AMC
    spin-off”) (such businesses remain with the Company
    following the completion of the Newhouse Transaction). The AMC
    spin-off was effected as a distribution by DHC to holders of its
    Series A and Series B common stock. In connection with
    the AMC spin-off, each holder of DHC Series A common stock
    received 0.05 of a share of AMC Series A common stock and
    each holder of DHC Series B common stock received 0.05 of a
    share of AMC Series B common stock. The AMC spin-off did
    not involve the payment of any consideration by the holders of
    DHC common stock and was structured as a tax free transaction
    under Sections 368(a) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of
    1986, as amended. There was no gain or loss related to the
    spin-off. Subsequent to the AMC spin-off, the companies no
    longer have any ownership interests in each other and operate
    independently.

•

On September 17, 2008, immediately following the AMC
    spin-off, DHC merged with a transitory merger subsidiary of
    Discovery, with DHC continuing as the surviving entity and as a
    wholly-owned subsidiary of Discovery. In connection with the
    merger, each share of DHC Series A common stock was
    converted into the right to receive 0.50 of a share of Discovery
    Series A common stock and 0.50 of a share of Discovery
    Series C common stock. Similarly, each share of DHC
    Series B common stock was converted into the right to
    receive 0.50 of a share of Discovery Series B common stock and
    0.50 of a share of Discovery Series C common stock. A
    description of Discovery’s common stock, including
    pertinent rights and preferences, is disclosed in Note 14.

•

On September 17, 2008, immediately following the exchange
    of shares between Discovery and DHC, Advance/Newhouse
    contributed its ownership interests in DCH and Animal Planet to
    Discovery in exchange for Discovery Series A and
    Series C convertible preferred stock. The preferred stock
    is convertible at any time into Discovery common stock
    representing


/


%
    of the Discovery common stock issued in connection with the
    Newhouse Transaction, subject to certain anti-dilution
    adjustments.



DISCOVERY
    COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

A description of Discovery’s preferred stock, including
    pertinent rights and preferences, is disclosed in Note 14.

As a result of the Newhouse Transaction, DHC and DCH became
    wholly-owned subsidiaries of Discovery, with Discovery becoming
    the successor reporting entity.

Basis
    of Presentation

Newhouse
    Transaction and AMC Spin-off

In accordance with Accounting Research
    Bulletin No. 51,

Consolidated Financial Statements

(“ARB 51”), as amended, paragraph 11, the
    consolidated financial statements and notes present the Newhouse
    Transaction as though it was consummated on January 1,
    2008. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements and
    notes for 2008 include the gross combined assets and
    liabilities, revenues and expenses, and cash flows of both DHC
    and DCH. Prior to the Newhouse Transaction, DHC accounted for
    its ownership interest in DCH using the equity method.
    Accordingly, DHC recorded its portion of DCH’s earnings as
    an adjustment to the carrying value of its investment. Because
    the Newhouse Transaction is presented as of January 1,
    2008, the 2008 financial statements have been adjusted to
    eliminate DHC’s investment in DCH and the portion of
    DCH’s earnings recorded by DHC during the period
    January 1, 2008 through September 17, 2008. The
    Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations present
    Advance/Newhouse’s ownership interest in DCH as

Minority
    interests, net of tax

for the period from January 1,
    2008 through September 17, 2008.

The accompanying historical consolidated financial statements
    and notes for 2007 and 2006 include only the gross assets and
    liabilities, revenues and expenses, and cash flows of DHC and
    continue to present DCH’s results of operations as an
    equity method investment. Information regarding DHC’s
    investment in DCH prior to the Newhouse Transaction is disclosed
    in Note 3.

Pursuant to FASB Technical

Bulletin No. 85-5,

Issues Relating to Accounting for Business Combinations

(“FTB

85-5”),

Discovery accounted for the Newhouse Transaction as a
    non-substantive merger. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities
    of DCH and DHC were accounted for at the investors’
    historical bases prior to the Newhouse Transaction. The Newhouse
    Transaction was determined to be a non-substantive merger
    because of the following: (i) as Advance/Newhouse was a


/


%
    owner of DCH prior to the completion of the Newhouse Transaction
    and is a


/


%
    owner of Discovery (whose only significant asset is 100% of DCH)
    immediately following completion of the Newhouse Transaction,
    there was no effective change in ownership, (ii) the
    Company’s convertible preferred stock does not provide
    Advance/Newhouse any special dividend rights and only provides a
    de minimis liquidation preference, effectively resulting in
    no additional economic interest being obtained by
    Advance/Newhouse as compared to its interest in DCH, and
    (iii) Advance/Newhouse retains significant participatory
    special class voting rights with respect to the Company’s
    matters that are consistent with the voting rights it held with
    respect to DCH prior to the Newhouse Transaction.

The consolidated financial statements reflect certain
    reclassifications of each company’s financial information
    to conform to Discovery’s financial statement presentation,
    as follows:

•

The consolidated financial statements for 2008 have been
    adjusted to eliminate the separate presentation of DHC’s
    investment in DCH and the portion of DCH’s earnings
    recorded by DHC using the equity method during the period
    January 1, 2008 through September 17, 2008.

•

Advance/Newhouse’s interest in DCH’s earnings for the
    period January 1, 2008 through September 17, 2008 has
    been recorded as

Minority interests, net of tax

in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations. Additionally,

Minority
    interests, net of tax

has been reclassified from a component
    of

Other (expense) income

to a separate account in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations.

All DHC share and per share data have been adjusted for all

    information for AMC is presented in Note 5.

Other
    Discontinued Operations

During 2008, DHC sold its ownership interests in Ascent Media
    CANS, LLC (DBA “AccentHealth”) and Ascent Media
    Systems & Technology Services, LLC
    (“AMSTS”). As DHC’s financial position, results
    of operations, and cash flows are included in Discovery’s
    consolidated financial statements for all periods presented, the
    assets and liabilities and results of operations of AccentHealth
    and AMSTS are presented as

Assets and liabilities of
    discontinued operations

and

Income (loss) from
    discontinued operations, net of tax

in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Operations,
    respectively, for all periods presented. Cash flows from
    AccentHealth and AMSTS have not been segregated as discontinued
    operations in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. A
    description of the transactions and summarized financial
    information for AccentHealth and AMSTS are presented in
    Note 5.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in
    conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles requires management to make estimates, judgments, and
    assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated
    financial statements and notes thereto. Management continually
    re-evaluates its estimates, judgments, and assumptions and
    management’s assessments could change. Actual results may
    differ from those estimates, judgments, and assumptions and
    could have a material impact on the consolidated financial
    statements.

Significant estimates, judgments, and assumptions inherent in
    the preparation of the consolidated financial statements include
    consolidation of variable interest entities, accounting for
    business acquisitions, dispositions, allowances for doubtful
    accounts, content rights, asset impairments, redeemable
    interests in subsidiaries, estimating fair value, revenue
    recognition, depreciation and amortization, share-based
    compensation, income taxes, and contingencies.

Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    Discovery, all majority-owned subsidiaries in which a
    controlling interest is maintained, and variable interest
    entities for which the Company is the primary beneficiary.
    Controlling interest is determined by majority ownership
    interest and the ability to unilaterally direct or cause the
    direction of management and policies of an entity after
    considering any third-party participatory rights. The Company
    applies the guidelines set forth in Financial Accounting
    Standards

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 46R,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an
    Interpretation of ARB No. 51

(“FIN 46R”), in evaluating whether it has
    interests in variable interest entities and in determining
    whether to consolidate any such entities. All significant
    inter-company accounts and transactions between consolidated
    companies have been eliminated in consolidation.

The effects of any changes in the Company’s ownership
    interest resulting from the issuance of equity capital by
    consolidated subsidiaries or equity investees to unaffiliated
    parties and certain other equity transactions recorded by
    consolidated subsidiaries or equity investees are accounted for

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Recently
    Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Accounting
    Pronouncements Adopted

On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted certain provisions
    of FASB Statement No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“FAS 157”), which establishes the
    authoritative definition of fair value, sets out a framework for
    measuring fair value, and expands the required disclosures about
    fair value measurement. The provisions of FAS 157 related
    to financial assets and liabilities as well as other assets and
    liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis were
    adopted prospectively on January 1, 2008 and did not have a
    material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements. Information related to financial assets and
    liabilities as well as other assets and liabilities carried at
    fair value on a recurring basis is presented in Note 6. The
    provisions of FAS 157 related to other non-financial assets
    and liabilities became effective for Discovery on
    January 1, 2009, and are being applied prospectively. The
    adoption of FAS 157 related to non-financial assets and
    liabilities is not expected to have a significant impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted the provisions of
    FASB Statement No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for
    Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities — Including
    an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115

(“FAS 159”), which permits entities to choose
    to measure certain financial instruments and other items at fair
    value. The fair value option generally may be applied instrument
    by instrument, is irrevocable, and is applied only to entire
    instruments and not to portions of instruments. The Company did
    not elect the fair value option for any financial instruments or
    other items under FAS 159.

Accounting
    Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

In June 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
    (“FSP”) Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
    Issue

No. 03-6-1,

Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based
    Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities

(“FSP
    EITF

No. 03-6-1”).

This FSP provides that all outstanding unvested share-based
    payment awards that contain rights to non-forfeitable dividends
    or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are considered
    participating securities. Because such awards are considered
    participating securities, the issuing entity is required to
    apply the two-class method of computing basic and diluted
    earnings per share. The provisions of FSP EITF

No. 03-6-1

became effective for Discovery on January 1, 2009, and are
    being applied retrospectively to all prior-period earnings per
    share computations. The adoption of FSP EITF

No. 03-6-1

will not have a significant impact on earnings per share amounts
    for prior periods.

In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. 142-3,

Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets

(“FSP 142-3”),

which amends the factors that should be considered in developing
    renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful
    life of a recognized intangible asset pursuant to FASB Statement
    No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

(“FAS 142”). The provisions of

FSP 142-3

became effective for Discovery on January 1, 2009, and are
    being applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired
    subsequent



DISCOVERY
    COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

to the effective date. Generally, the impact of FSP 142-3
    will depend on future acquisitions of intangible assets.

In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities, an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133

, as
    amended (“FAS 161”). FAS 161 amends and
    expands the disclosure requirements of FASB Statement
    No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
    Hedging Activities

(“FAS 133”), to include
    information about how and why an entity uses derivative
    instruments; how derivative instruments and related hedged items
    are accounted for under FAS 133 and its related
    interpretations; and how derivative instruments and related
    hedged items affect an entity’s financial position,
    financial performance, and cash flows. The provisions of
    FAS 161 became effective for Discovery on January 1,
    2009. The Company will include the relevant disclosures in the
    consolidated financial statements beginning with the first
    quarter of 2009.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141
    (revised 2007),

Business Combinations

(“FAS 141R”). This Statement requires, among
    other things, that companies: (i) expense business
    acquisition transaction costs, which are presently included in
    the cost of the acquisition, (ii) record an asset for
    in-process research and development, which is presently expensed
    at the time of the acquisition, (iii) record at fair value
    amounts for contingencies, including contingent consideration,
    as of the purchase date with subsequent adjustments recognized
    in operations, which is presently accounted for as an adjustment
    of purchase price, (iv) recognize decreases in valuation
    allowances on acquired deferred tax assets in operations, which
    are presently considered to be subsequent changes in
    consideration and are recorded as decreases in goodwill, and
    (v) measure at fair value any non-controlling interest in
    the acquired entity. The provisions of FAS 141R became
    effective for Discovery on January 1, 2009 and will be
    applied prospectively to new business combinations consummated
    on or subsequent to the effective date. While FAS 141R
    applies to new business acquisitions consummated on or
    subsequent to the effective date, the amendments to FASB
    Statement No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

(“FAS 109”), with respect to deferred tax
    valuation allowances and liabilities for income tax
    uncertainties will be applied to all deferred tax valuation
    allowances and liabilities for income tax uncertainties
    recognized in prior business acquisitions. Generally, the impact
    of FAS 141R will depend on future acquisitions.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements

(“FAS 160”). FAS 160 establishes
    accounting and reporting standards for the non-controlling
    interest in a subsidiary, commonly referred to as minority
    interest. Among other matters, FAS 160 requires that
    non-controlling interests be reported within the
    shareholders’ equity section of the balance sheet and that
    the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent
    and to the non-controlling interest to be clearly presented in
    the statement of income. The provisions of FAS 160 became
    effective for Discovery on January 1, 2009, and are being
    applied prospectively, except for the presentation and
    disclosure requirements, which shall be applied retrospectively
    to all periods presented.

In December 2007, the FASB issued EITF Issue

No. 07-1,

Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements

(“EITF 07-1”).

EITF 07-1

defines collaborative arrangements and establishes accounting
    and reporting requirements for transactions between participants
    in the arrangement and third parties. A collaborative
    arrangement is a contractual arrangement that involves a joint
    operating activity, for example an agreement to co-produce and
    distribute programming with another media company. The
    provisions of

EITF 07-1

became effective for Discovery on January 1, 2009 and will
    not have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Highly liquid investments with original maturities of ninety
    days or less are recorded as cash equivalents. There were no

Investments

Investments in entities of 20% to 50%, without a controlling
    interest, and other investments over which the Company has the
    ability to exercise significant influence but not control are
    accounted for using the equity method. Investments in entities
    of less than 20% over which the Company has no significant
    influence are accounted for at fair value or using the cost
    method.

Content
    Rights

Costs incurred in the direct production, co-production, or
    licensing of content rights are capitalized and stated at the
    lower of unamortized cost, fair value, or net realizable value.
    The Company periodically evaluates the net realizable value of
    content by considering expected future revenue generation.

The costs of produced and co-produced content airing on the
    Company’s networks are capitalized and amortized based on
    the expected realization of revenues, resulting in an
    accelerated basis over four years for developed networks
    (Discovery Channel, TLC and Animal Planet in the
    U.S. Networks segment and Discovery Channel in the
    International Networks segment), and a straight-line basis over
    a period up to five years for developing networks (all other
    networks in the U.S. Networks segment and International
    Networks segment). The cost of licensed content is capitalized
    and amortized over the term of the license period based on the
    expected realization of revenues, resulting in an accelerated
    basis for developed networks in the United States, and a
    straight-line basis for all educational ventures. The costs of
    produced educational content for electronic, video and hardcopy
    supplements are amortized on a straight-line basis over a three
    to five year period.

All produced and co-produced content is classified as long-term.
    The portion of the unamortized licensed content balance that
    will be amortized within one year is classified as a current
    asset. The Company’s co-production arrangements generally
    represent the sharing of production cost. The Company records
    its share of costs gross and records no amounts for the portion
    of costs borne by the other party as the Company does not share
    any associated economics of exploitation.

Property
    and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
    depreciation. Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line
    basis over the estimated useful lives, which is 15 to
    39 years for buildings and three to five years for
    furniture and fixtures. Leasehold improvements are amortized on
    a straight-line basis over the lesser of their estimated useful
    lives or the terms of the related leases, beginning on the date
    the asset is put into use. Equipment under capital lease
    represents the present value of the minimum lease payments at
    the inception of the lease, net of accumulated depreciation.

Capitalized
    Software Costs

All capitalized software costs are for internal use.
    Capitalization of costs occurs during the application
    development stage. Costs incurred during the preliminary project
    and post implementation stages are expensed as incurred.
    Capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over
    their estimated useful lives of two to five years.

Goodwill
    and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets

Goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process. The
    first step of the process is to compare the fair value of a
    reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. In
    performing the first step, the Company determines the fair value
    of a reporting unit by using two valuation techniques: a
    discounted cash flow (“DCF”) analysis and a
    market-based approach. Determining fair value requires the
    exercise of significant judgments, including judgments about
    appropriate discount rates, perpetual growth rates, relevant
    comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing
    of expected future cash flows. The cash flows



DISCOVERY
    COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

employed in the DCF analyses are based on the Company’s
    budget and long-term business plan. In assessing the
    reasonableness of its determined fair values, the Company
    evaluates its results against other value indicators such as
    comparable company public trading values, research analyst
    estimates and values observed in market transactions. If the
    fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount,
    goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second
    step of the impairment test is not necessary. If the carrying
    amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second
    step of the goodwill impairment test is required to be performed
    to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second
    step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair
    value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying
    amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is
    determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill
    recognized in a business combination. In other words, the
    estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all
    of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any
    unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had
    been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of
    the reporting unit was the purchase price paid. If the carrying
    amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied
    fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in
    an amount equal to that excess.

The impairment test for other intangible assets not subject to
    amortization involves a comparison of the estimated fair value
    of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying
    value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an
    impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
    The estimates of fair value of intangible assets not subject to
    amortization are determined using a DCF valuation analysis.

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested
    annually for impairment during the fourth quarter or earlier
    upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in
    circumstances. The Company’s 2008 annual impairment
    analysis, which was performed during the fourth quarter, did not
    result in any impairment charges. However, over the past year,
    the decline in the Company’s stock price has resulted in
    lower estimated fair values for certain of the Company’s
    reporting units. The result of this decline is that the
    estimated fair value of the United Kingdom reporting unit
    approximates its carrying value. Accordingly, future declines in
    estimated fair values may result in goodwill impairment charges.
    It is possible that such charges, if required, could be recorded
    prior to the fourth quarter of 2009 (i.e., during an interim
    period) if the Company’s stock price, its results of
    operations, or other factors require such assets to be tested
    for impairment at an interim date.

Long-lived
    Assets

Long-lived assets (e.g., amortizing trademarks, customer lists,
    other intangibles and property, plant and equipment) do not
    require that an annual impairment test be performed; instead,
    long-lived assets are tested for impairment upon the occurrence
    of a triggering event. Triggering events include the likely
    (i.e., more likely than not) disposal of a portion of such
    assets or the occurrence of an adverse change in the market
    involving the business employing the related assets. Once a
    triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is
    based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued
    use or to hold the asset for sale. If the intent is to hold the
    asset for continued use, the impairment test first requires a
    comparison of undiscounted future cash flows against the
    carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value of the asset
    exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, the asset would be deemed
    to be impaired. Impairment would then be measured as the
    difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying
    value. Fair value is generally determined by discounting the
    future cash flows associated with that asset. If the intent is
    to hold the asset for sale and certain other criteria are met
    (e.g., the asset can be disposed of currently, appropriate
    levels of authority have approved the sale, and there is an
    active program to locate a buyer), the impairment test involves
    comparing the asset’s carrying value to its fair value. To
    the extent the carrying value is greater than the asset’s
    fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference.

Significant judgments in this area involve determining whether a
    triggering event has occurred, determining the future cash flows
    for the assets involved and determining the proper discount rate
    to be applied in determining fair value.

Discontinued
    Operations

In determining whether a group of assets disposed of should be
    presented as a discontinued operation, the Company makes a
    determination as to whether the group of assets being disposed
    of comprises a component of the entity, which requires cash
    flows that can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the
    entity. The Company also determines whether the cash flows
    associated with the group of assets have been or will be
    significantly eliminated from the ongoing operations of the
    Company as a result of the disposal transaction and whether the
    Company has no significant continuing involvement in the
    operations of the group of assets after the disposal
    transaction. If these determinations can be made affirmatively,
    the results of operations of the group of assets being disposed
    of (as well as any gain or loss on the disposal transaction) are
    aggregated for separate presentation apart from continuing
    operating results of the Company in the consolidated financial
    statements. The Company has elected not to segregate the cash
    flows from discontinued operations in its presentation of the
    statements of cash flows.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

(“FAS 133”), requires every derivative
    instrument to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as
    either an asset or a liability. The statement also requires that
    changes in the fair value of derivatives be recognized currently
    in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.
    The Company uses financial instruments designated as cash flow
    hedges. The effective changes in fair value of derivatives
    designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss). Amounts are reclassified from
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as interest
    expense is recorded for debt. The Company uses the cumulative
    dollar offset method to assess effectiveness. To be highly
    effective, the ratio calculated by dividing the cumulative
    change in the value of the actual swap by the cumulative change
    in the hypothetical swap must be between 80% and 125%. The
    ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value
    is immediately recognized in earnings. The Company uses
    derivative instruments principally to manage the risk associated
    with the movements of foreign currency exchange rates and
    changes in interest rates that will affect the cash flows of its
    debt transactions. See Note 12 for additional information
    regarding derivative instruments held by the Company and risk
    management strategies.

Redeemable
    Interests in Subsidiaries

For those instruments with an estimated redemption value,
    redeemable interest in subsidiaries is accreted or amortized to
    an estimated redemption value ratably over the period to the
    redemption date. Accretion and amortization are recorded as a
    component of

Minority interests, net of tax

. Cash
    receipts and payments for the sale or purchase of redeemable
    interests in subsidiaries are included as a component of
    investing cash flows.

Share-Based
    and Other Long-term Incentive Compensation

The Company measures the cost of employee services received in
    exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the
    grant-date fair value of the award. FASB Statement
    No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment

(“FAS 123R”) also requires that the Company
    record liability awards at fair value each reporting period and
    that the change in fair value be reflected as stock compensation
    expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. These
    costs are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations
    over the period during which an employee is required to provide
    service in exchange for the award. FAS 123R also requires
    that excess tax benefits, as defined, realized from the exercise
    of stock options be reported as a financing cash inflow rather
    than as a reduction of taxes paid in cash flow from operations.

The grant-date fair value of a stock option and the fair value
    of liability awards are estimated using the Black-Scholes model,
    consistent with the provisions of FAS 123R and SEC Staff
    Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 107,

Share-Based Payment

(“SAB 107”). Because
    the Black-Scholes model requires the use of subjective



DISCOVERY
    COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

assumptions, changes in these assumptions can materially affect
    the fair value of the equity awards. The Company recognizes
    equity-based compensation expense for awards with graded vesting
    as a single award and recognizes equity-based compensation
    expense on a straight-line basis (net of estimated forfeitures)
    over the employee service period. Equity-based compensation
    expense is recorded as a component of

Selling, general and
    administrative

expense. When recording compensation cost for
    equity awards, FAS 123R requires companies to estimate the
    number of equity awards granted that are expected to be
    forfeited.

The Company classifies as a current liability the intrinsic
    value of long-term incentive compensation units and stock
    appreciation rights that are vested or will become vested within
    one year. Upon voluntary termination of employment, the Company
    distributes 100% of vested unit benefits if employees agree to
    certain provisions.

Foreign
    Currency Translation

The Company’s foreign subsidiaries’ assets and
    liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the
    balance sheet date, while results of operations are translated
    at average exchange rates for the respective periods. The
    resulting translation adjustments are included as a separate
    component of

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)

in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity.
    Intercompany accounts of a trading nature are revalued at
    exchange rates in effect at each month end and are included as
    part of operating income in the consolidated statements of
    operations.

Revenue
    Recognition

Discovery derives revenue from: (i) distribution revenue
    from cable systems, satellite operators and other distributors,
    (ii) advertising aired on Discovery’s networks and
    websites, and (iii) other, which is largely

e-commerce,

educational, and post-production sound services sales.

Distribution.

Distributors generally pay a
    per-subscriber fee for the right to distribute Discovery
    programming under the terms of long-term distribution contracts
    (“distribution revenue”). Distribution revenue is
    reported net of incentive costs or other consideration, if any,
    offered to system operators in exchange for long-term
    distribution contracts. Discovery recognizes distribution
    revenue over the term of the contracts based on contracted
    monthly license fee provisions and reported subscriber levels.
    Network incentives have historically included upfront cash
    incentives referred to as “launch support” in
    connection with the launch of a network by the distributor
    within certain time frames. Any such amounts are capitalized as
    assets upon launch of Discovery programming by the distributor
    and are amortized on a straight line basis as a reduction of
    revenue over the terms of the contracts. In instances where the
    distribution agreement is extended prior to the expiration of
    the original term, Discovery evaluates the economics of the
    extended term and, if it is determined that the deferred launch
    asset continues to benefit Discovery over the extended term,
    then Discovery will adjust the launch amortization period
    accordingly. Other incentives are recognized as a reduction of
    revenue as incurred. Following the renewal of a distribution
    agreement, the remaining deferred consideration is amortized
    over the extended period. Amortization of deferred launch
    incentives for the year ended December 31, 2008 was
    $75 million.

The amount of distribution revenue due to Discovery is reported
    by distributors based on actual subscriber levels. Such
    information is generally not received until after the close of
    the reporting period. Therefore, reported distribution revenue
    is based upon Discovery’s estimates of the number of
    subscribers receiving Discovery programming for periods for
    which the distributor has not yet reported. Discovery’s
    subscriber estimates are based on the most recent remittance or
    confirmation of subscribers received from the distributor.

Advertising.

Discovery records advertising
    revenue net of agency commissions and audience deficiency
    liabilities in the period advertising spots are broadcast. A
    substantial portion of the advertising sold in the United States
    includes guaranteed levels of audience that either the program
    or the advertisement will reach. Deferred revenue is recorded
    and adjusted as the guaranteed audience levels are achieved.
    Audience guarantees



DISCOVERY
    COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

are initially developed by Discovery’s internal research
    group and actual audience and delivery information is provided
    by third party ratings services. In certain instances, the third
    party ratings information is not received until after the close
    of the reporting period. In these cases, reported advertising
    revenue and related deferred revenue is based on
    Discovery’s estimates for any under-delivery of contracted
    advertising ratings based on the most current data available
    from the third party ratings service. Differences between the
    estimated under-delivery and the actual under-delivery have
    historically been insignificant. Online advertising revenues are
    recognized as impressions are delivered.

Certain of Discovery’s advertising arrangements include
    deliverables in addition to commercial time, such as the
    advertiser’s product integration into the programming,
    customized vignettes, and billboards. These contracts are
    evaluated as multiple element revenue arrangements under

EITF 00-21,

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables

.

Other.

Commerce revenue is recognized upon
    product shipment, net of estimated returns, which are not
    material to Discovery’s consolidated financial statements.
    Educational service sales are generally recognized ratably over
    the term of the agreement. Revenue from post-production and
    certain distribution related services is recognized when
    services are provided.

Prepayments received for services to be performed at a later
    date are deferred.

Concentration
    of Credit Risk and Significant Customers

For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, no
    single customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated
    revenue.

Advertising
    Costs

The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising
    costs during the year ended December 31, 2008 totaled
    $145 million. No material advertising costs were recorded
    by DHC during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Income
    Taxes

Income taxes are recorded using the asset and liability method
    of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect
    the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying
    amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
    purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A
    valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is
    more likely than not such assets will be unrealized.

Effective January 1, 2007, Discovery adopted FASB
    Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the
    accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a
    company’s financial statements, and prescribes a
    recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the
    financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
    position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In
    instances where the Company has taken or expects to take a tax
    position in its tax return and the Company believes it is more
    likely than not that such tax position will be upheld by the
    relevant taxing authority upon settlement, the Company may
    record the benefits of such tax position in its consolidated
    financial statements. The tax benefit to be recognized is
    measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than
    fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
    The adoption of FIN 48 did not materially impact the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Minority
    Interests

In addition to the accretion and amortization on redeemable
    minority interests, the Company records minority interest
    expense for the portion of the earnings of consolidated entities
    which are applicable to the minority interest partners.

    HOLDING COMPANY INVESTMENT IN DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS HOLDING,
    LLC

Prior to the Newhouse Transaction described in Note 1, DCH
    was a stand-alone private company, which was owned approximately


/


%
    by DHC and


/


%
    by Advance/Newhouse. DHC previously accounted for its investment
    in DCH using the equity method. In connection with the Newhouse
    Transaction, DHC and

Advance/Newhouse

combined their respective ownership interests in DCH to create
    Discovery. Pursuant to ARB 51 and FTB

85-5,

the
    2008 consolidated financial statements and notes present the
    Newhouse Transaction as a non-substantive merger consummated as
    of January 1, 2008. Accordingly, the consolidated financial
    statements and notes for 2008 include the gross combined assets
    and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and cash flows of both
    DHC and DCH. Additionally, the consolidated financial statements
    for 2008 have been adjusted to eliminate the presentation of
    DHC’s investment in DCH and the portion of DCH’s
    earnings recorded by DHC using the equity method during the
    period January 1, 2008 through September 17, 2008. The
    following information has been disclosed as it is relevant for
    understanding DHC’s historical accounting for its
    investment in DCH prior to the Newhouse Transaction.

Through May 14, 2007, DCH was owned by DHC (50% ownership
    interest), Advance/Newhouse (25% ownership interest), and Cox
    Communications Holdings, Inc. (“Cox”) (25% ownership
    interest). On May 14, 2007, DCH was reorganized.
    Immediately following the reorganization, DHC, Advance/Newhouse,
    and Cox each held the same ownership interests in DCH.

On May 14, 2007, subsequent to the reorganization of DCH,
    Cox exchanged its 25% ownership interest in DCH for all of the
    capital stock of a DCH subsidiary that held Travel Channel and
    travelchannel.com (collectively, the “Travel
    Business”) and approximately $1.3 billion in cash (the
    “Cox Transaction”). DCH retired the membership
    interest previously owned by Cox. Accordingly, the ownership
    interests in DCH held by DHC and Advance/Newhouse were increased
    to


/


%
    and


/


%,
    respectively. Although it held a majority ownership interest,
    subsequent to the Cox Transaction DHC continued to account for
    its investment in DCH using the equity method because of certain
    governance rights held by Advance/Newhouse that restricted
    DHC’s ability to control DCH.

The Cox Transaction resulted in no additional investments in
    DCH. However, the Cox Transaction resulted in a new basis of
    accounting that created a combined basis differential of
    $929 million between the carrying values of DHC’s and
    Advance/Newhouse’s investments in DCH and their share of
    the underlying net assets of DCH. The following table presents a
    summary of the allocation of the basis differential.

The September 30, 2008 consolidated financial statements

    the underlying net assets of DCH. The adjustment results from
    the revision of the original fair value assessment used to
    allocate the basis differential between goodwill and other
    intangible assets.

In connection with the Newhouse Transaction, Discovery has
    recorded the total basis differential of $929 million to
    the respective asset accounts in the Consolidated Balance

CONSOLIDATION
    OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

Discovery holds investments in multiple ventures, most of which
    were determined to be variable interest entities. Pursuant to
    FIN 46R, it was determined that Discovery is the primary
    beneficiary of the ventures determined to be variable interest
    entities and is required to consolidate them accordingly. The
    following table provides a list of variable interest entities
    consolidated by Discovery as of December 31, 2008.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, $11 million
    of net income generated by the ventures was allocated to other
    venture partners, which was recorded as a component of

Minority interests, net of tax

in the Consolidated
    Statements of Operations.

Ventures
    with the British Broadcasting Corporation

The Company and the British Broadcasting Corporation
    (“BBC”) formed several cable and satellite television
    network ventures, other than JVN, to produce and acquire
    factual-based content. The JVN venture was formed to provide
    debt funding to the other ventures. In addition to its own
    funding requirements, Discovery has assumed the BBC’s
    funding requirements, giving the Company preferential cash
    distribution for these joint ventures. As the BBC does not have
    risk of loss, no cumulative operating losses generated by the
    ventures are allocated to the BBC’s minority interests.

Pursuant to the venture agreements, the BBC has the right to
    require the Company to purchase the BBC’s interests in the
    People & Arts Latin America venture and the Animal
    Planet ventures if certain conditions are not met. Additional
    information regarding the BBC’s put right is disclosed in
    Note 13.

Oprah
    Winfrey Network

On June 19, 2008, Discovery entered into a

50-50

joint
    venture with Oprah Winfrey and Harpo, Inc. (“Harpo”)
    to rebrand Discovery Health Channel as OWN: The Oprah Winfrey
    Network (“OWN Network”). It is expected that Discovery
    Health will be rebranded as the OWN Network in late 2009 or
    early 2010. Pursuant to the arrangement, Discovery will
    contribute its interest in the Discovery Health Channel and
    certain DiscoveryHealth.com content and Harpo will contribute
    the Oprah.com website (which will serve as the platform for the
    venture website) and certain Oprah.com content. Discovery and
    Harpo are required make these contributions on the launch date
    unless it is mutually agreed that certain contributions will be
    made prior to the launch date for the benefit of the venture. As
    of December 31, 2008, the Company and Harpo have not made
    any contributions to the OWN Network venture. During the year
    ended December 31, 2008, the Company incurred
    $7 million in transaction costs related to the formation of
    the OWN Network. Such costs are not credited to Discovery’s
    funding commitment disclosed below.

Pursuant to the venture agreement, Discovery is committed to
    fund up to $100 million of the venture’s operations
    through September 2011. To the extent funding the joint venture
    in excess of $100 million is necessary, the Company may
    provide additional funds through a member loan or require the
    venture to seek third party financing. During the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the Company funded $6 million of
    the OWN

Network’s operating costs. As Harpo has not yet contributed
    any assets to the venture, the Company is recording 100% of the
    losses.

Pursuant to the venture agreement, Harpo has the right to
    require the Company to purchase its interest in the OWN Network
    venture if certain conditions are not met. Additional
    information regarding Harpo’s put right is disclosed in
    Note 13.

Ascent
    Media Corporation Spin-off

On September 17, 2008, as part of the Newhouse Transaction,
    DHC completed the spin-off to its shareholders of AMC, a
    subsidiary holding the cash and businesses of DHC, except for
    certain businesses that provide sound, music, mixing, sound
    effects and other related services. The AMC spin-off did not
    involve the payment of any consideration by the holders of DHC
    common stock and was structured as a tax free transaction under
    Sections 368(a) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of
    1986, as amended. There was no gain or loss related to the
    spin-off. Subsequent to the AMC spin-off, the companies no
    longer have any ownership interests in each other and operate
    independently. As there is no continuing involvement in the
    operations of AMC, the assets and liabilities and results of
    operations of AMC are presented as discontinued operations in

    $3 million in connection with the sale of AMSTS, which is
    recorded as a component of

Income (loss) from Discontinued
    Operations, net of tax

. As there is no continuing
    involvement in the operations of AMSTS, the assets and
    liabilities and results of operations of AMSTS are presented as
    discontinued operations in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and
    Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented
    in accordance with FAS 144. Cash flows from AMSTS have not

FAIR
    VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted FAS 157
    for all financial instruments accounted for at fair value on a
    recurring basis. In accordance with FAS 157, a fair value
    measurement is determined based on the assumptions that a market
    participant would use in pricing an asset or liability.
    FAS 157 also established a three-tiered hierarchy that
    draws a distinction between market participant assumptions based
    on: (i) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active
    markets (Level 1), (ii) inputs other than quoted
    prices in active markets that are observable either directly or
    indirectly (Level 2), and (iii) unobservable inputs
    that require the Company to use present value and other
    valuation techniques in the determination of fair value
    (Level 3). The following table presents information about
    assets and liabilities required to be carried at fair value on a
    recurring basis as of December 31, 2008.

For assets that are measured using quoted prices in active
    markets, the total fair value is the published market price per
    unit multiplied by the number of units held without
    consideration of transaction costs. Generally, liabilities that
    are measured using significant other observable inputs are
    primarily valued by reference to quoted prices of similar
    liabilities in active markets, adjusted for any terms specific
    to that liability and nonperformance risk. Through
    September 30, 2008, the fair value of the Company’s
    liability to sell and distribute the proceeds of its investment
    in HSW International, Inc. (HSWI) to former shareholders of HSW
    was determined by using a discounted cash flow analysis. During
    the quarter-ended December 31, 2008, the Company began
    using a Black-Scholes option pricing model to value this
    liability. Information regarding the Company’s investment
    in HSWI and the HSWI liability is disclosed in Note 7. The
    fair value of the redeemable interests in subsidiaries was
    determined based on the Company’s best estimate of a
    negotiated value. Information regarding the redeemable interests
    in subsidiaries is disclosed in Note 13.

Other
    Equity-Method Investments

As of December 31, 2008, investments accounted for using
    the equity method primarily included Discovery Japan (50%
    owned), a cable and satellite television network joint venture,
    HSWI (43% owned), an online source with a perpetual royalty free
    license to exploit HSW online content in certain foreign
    markets, and Discovery Canada (20% owned), a cable and satellite
    television network joint venture. Such investments were recorded
    as a component of

Other noncurrent assets

in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company
    recognized pretax impairment charges of $57 million related
    to the investment in HSWI, which is recorded as a component of

Equity in loss of unconsolidated affiliates

in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations. The impairment charge for
    HSWI reflects an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value
    of HSWI’s common stock following lower than expected
    operating performance. As of December 31, 2008, the stock
    price for HSWI was below its liquidation value, and the Company
    utilized the HSWI liquidation value per share to determine the
    equity investment asset value.

The carrying value of the Company’s equity-method
    investments approximates its portion of the underlying net
    assets of the investees.

    Securities

Trading securities primarily include investments in mutual funds
    owned as part of the Company’s supplemental retirement plan
    and are used to offset changes in certain liabilities associated
    with the Company’s deferred compensation plan. Such
    investments are recorded at fair value as a component of

    in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The gains or
    losses from changes in the fair value of the trading securities
    and the supplemental retirement liability were not material for
    all periods presented.

Available-for-Sale
    Securities

As of December 31, 2008, the Company held
    available-for-sale securities with a fair value of
    $15 million, including a cost basis of $9 million and
    gross unrealized gains of $6 million. Available-for-sale
    securities primarily include investments in common stock of
    publicly traded companies. Such securities are recorded as a
    component of

Other noncurrent assets

in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. The Company records changes in the fair value of
    available-for-sale securities as a component of

Impairments

Goodwill and

non-amortizing

trademarks are tested annually for impairment during the fourth
    quarter, or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or
    substantive changes in circumstances. Information regarding the
    Company’s methodology for determining whether goodwill and

non-amortizing

trademarks or long-lived assets are impaired is disclosed in
    Note 2. Based on its annual impairment test, the Company
    concluded there was no impairment of goodwill or

non-amortizing

trademarks during the year ended December 31, 2008.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, an impairment
    review in accordance with FAS 144 was required for HSW,
    following lower than expected operating performance and changes
    in long term expectations. The Company determined that
    intangible assets of HSW, an asset group within the
    U.S. Networks segment, were impaired. Accordingly, a pretax
    charge to amortizing trademarks and customer relationships of
    $25 million and $5 million, respectively, was recorded
    during the year ended December 31, 2008. To determine the
    fair value of intangible assets, the Company used discounted
    cash flow analyses, including a discount factor of 18% and a
    long-term growth rate of 11%.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company
    recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $165 million
    related to its Network Services Group segment, which was
    disposed of as part of the AMC spin-off. The Company used a
    discounted cash flows analysis to measure the fair value of the
    Network Services Group segment and the implied value of goodwill
    related to this reporting unit. The goodwill impairment was the
    result of lower estimates of future net operating cash flows due
    to a continued decline in operating cash flow margins as a
    percent of revenue, resulting from competitive conditions in the
    entertainment and media services industries and increasingly
    complex customer requirements.

During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company
    recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $93 million
    related to its Creative Services Group segment, which was
    disposed of as part of the AMC spin-off. The Company principally
    used market multiples of revenues and operating cash flows of
    similar companies to measure the fair value of the Creative
    Services Group segment and the implied value of goodwill related
    to this reporting unit. The goodwill impairment was the result
    of the Company realigning its operations into two global
    divisions and declining revenues and operating cash flows
    related to this reporting unit. The Company restructured its
    operations to better align the organization with the
    Company’s strategic goals and to respond to changes within
    the industry driven by technology and customer requirements.

These impairment charges were noncash in nature and did not
    affect the Company’s liquidity or result in non-compliance
    of any debt covenants. The impairment charges incurred during
    the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are recorded in

Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax

in
    the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

In May 2007, DCH, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company,
    entered into a $1.5 billion seven year term loan credit
    agreement. Borrowings under this agreement bear interest at
    London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus an
    applicable margin of 2.0% or the higher of (a) the Federal
    Funds Rate plus


/


of 1% or (b) “prime rate” set by Bank of America
    plus an applicable margin of 1.0% at the Company’s
    discretion. The company capitalized $5 million of deferred
    financing costs as a result of this transaction. As of
    December 31, 2008, there was approximately
    $1.5 billion outstanding under the term loan agreement with
    an interest rate of 3.46%, excluding interest rate hedges.
    During 2008, the weighted average interest rate under this
    credit agreement was 5.6%.

In October 2008, the Company’s United Kingdom subsidiary,
    Discovery Communications Europe Limited (“DCEL”), a
    wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, executed a
    £10 million uncommitted facility on similar terms to
    the prior facility in order to supplement working capital
    requirements. The facility has a one year term or may be
    cancelled earlier by either DCEL or the financial institution
    and is guaranteed by Discovery Communications, LLC (a
    wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company). As of December 31,
    2008 the Company had no outstanding debt under this facility.

In December 2008, DCEL also cancelled its €260 million
    three year multicurrency revolving credit agreement which was
    due to mature in April 2009.

In March 2008, DCL borrowed additional funds under its
    U.S. Credit Facility (Revolving Loan and Term Loan
    A) to redeem the maturing $180 million Senior Notes.
    As of December 31, 2008, the Company had $1.3 billion
    outstanding ($938 million Term Loan A and $315 million
    Revolving Loan) under the facility with a weighted average
    interest rate of 2.67%. The amount available under the revolving
    facility was $1.2 billion, net of amounts committed for
    standby letters of credit of $3 million issued. During
    2008, the average interest rate under the U.S. Credit
    Facility was 4.09%. The Company’s debt agreements have
    certain restrictions on the payment of dividends from
    subsidiaries.

Discovery’s $1.5 billion term loan is secured by the
    assets of DCH, excluding assets held by DCH’s subsidiaries.
    The remaining Term Loan, Revolving Loans and Senior Notes are
    unsecured.

The Company uses derivative instruments to modify its exposure
    to interest rate fluctuations on its debt. The Term Loans,
    Revolving Facility, and Senior Notes contain covenants that
    require the Company to meet certain financial ratios and place
    restrictions on the payment of dividends, sale of assets,
    borrowing level, mergers, and purchases of capital stock,
    assets, and investments. The Company is in compliance with all
    debt covenants as of December 31, 2008.

Future minimum payments under capital leases are as follows:
    $18 million in 2009, $17 million in 2010,
    $17 million in 2011, $13 million in 2012,
    $7 million in 2013, and $10 million thereafter. Total
    interest to be paid in relation to these future minimum payments
    is approximately $15 million.

DERIVATIVE
    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to modify its
    exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates and
    foreign exchange rates. The Company does not hold or enter into
    financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.

The Company’s interest expense is exposed to movements in
    short-term interest rates. Derivative instruments, including
    both fixed to variable and variable to fixed interest rate
    instruments, are used to modify this exposure. These instruments
    include swaps and swaptions to modify interest rate exposure.
    The variable to fixed interest rate instruments are based on the
    three-month LIBOR rate and have a notional principal amount of
    $2.3 billion and have a weighted average interest rate of
    4.68% at December 31, 2008. The fixed to variable interest
    rate agreements have a notional principal amount of
    $50 million and have a weighted average interest rate of
    7.90% at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the
    Company held an unexercised interest rate swap put with a
    notional amount of $25 million at a fixed rate of 5.44%. On
    December 19, 2008, the Company entered into a
    $560 million forward starting swap with a fixed rate of
    2.44%, based on the three-month LIBOR rate, starting
    December 31, 2009 and maturing on March 31, 2014. As a
    result of unrealized mark-to-market adjustments $58 million
    in losses on these instruments were recorded in 2008.

The fair value of these interest rate derivative instruments,
    which aggregate ($107) million at December 31, 2008,
    is recorded as a component of long-term liabilities and other
    current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Changes
    in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recorded
    as a component of operating cash flows.

Of the total notional amount of $2.9 billion in interest
    rate derivatives, a notional amount of $2 billion of these
    derivative instruments are effective cash flow hedges. The value
    of these hedges at December 31, 2008 was ($71) million
    with changes in the mark-to-market value recorded as a component
    of other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes. Should any
    portion of these instruments become ineffective due to a
    restructuring in the Company’s debt, the monthly changes in
    fair value would be reported as a component of other income on
    the Statement of Operations. The Company does not expect
    material hedge ineffectiveness in the next twelve months.

The foreign exchange instruments used are spot, forward, and
    option contracts. Additionally, the Company enters into
    non-designated forward contracts to hedge non-dollar denominated
    cash flows and foreign currency balances. At December 31,
    2008, the notional amount of foreign exchange derivative
    contracts was $75 million. During the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the Company recorded unrealized
    mark-to-market adjustments of $4 million in losses related
    to these instruments as a component of

Accumulated other
    comprehensive loss

. There were no unrealized mark-to-market
    adjustments in 2007 and

2006. The fair value of these derivative instruments is recorded
    as a component of long-term liabilities and

Other current
    liabilities

in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These
    derivative instruments did not receive hedge accounting
    treatment.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, and
    accounts payable approximate their carrying values. Marketable
    equity securities are carried at fair value and fluctuations in
    fair value are recorded through other comprehensive income
    (loss). Losses on investments that are other than temporary
    declines in value are recorded in the statement of operations.

The carrying amount of the Company’s borrowings was
    $3.8 billion and the fair value was $3.4 billion at
    December 31, 2008 which was estimated based on current
    market rates and credit pricing for similar debt type and
    maturity.

The carrying amount of all derivative instruments represents
    their fair value. The net fair value of the Company’s short
    and long-term derivative instruments is ($114) million at
    December 31, 2008; 27%, 49%, 24%, and less than 1% of these
    derivative instrument contracts will expire in 2009, 2010, 2011,
    and 2012 and thereafter, respectively.

The fair value of derivative contracts was estimated by
    management including information regarding interest rate and
    volatility market data from brokers. As of December 31,
    2008, an estimated 100 basis point parallel shift in the
    interest rate yield curve would change the fair value of the
    Company’s portfolio by approximately $49 million.

Credit
    Concentrations

The Company continually monitors its positions with, and the
    credit quality of, the financial institutions that are
    counterparties to its financial instruments and does not
    anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties. In addition,
    the Company limits the amount of investment credit exposure with
    any one institution.

The Company’s trade receivables and investments do not
    represent a significant concentration of credit risk at
    December 31, 2008 due to the wide variety of customers and
    markets in which the Company operates and their dispersion
    across many geographic areas.

REDEEMABLE
    INTERESTS IN SUBSIDIARIES

People+Arts
    Latin America and Animal Planet Channel Group

As disclosed in Note 4, Discovery and the BBC have formed
    several cable and satellite television network joint ventures to
    develop and distribute programming content. Under certain terms
    outlined in the contract, the BBC has the right every three
    years, commencing December 31, 2002, to put to the Company
    its interests in: (i) People+Arts Latin America, and/or
    (ii) certain Animal Planet channels outside of the U.S.
    (the “Channel Groups”), in each case for a value
    determined by a specified formula. In January 2009, the BBC
    requested that a determination be made whether such conditions
    have occurred with respect to both Channel Groups as of
    December 31, 2008. The contractual redemption value is
    based upon an estimate of the proceeds from a hypothetical sale
    of the Channel Groups and a distribution of the proceeds to the
    venture partners based on various rights and preferences. As the
    Company has funded all operations from inception of the ventures
    through December 31, 2008, the Company believes that it has
    accumulated rights and preferences in excess of the fair market
    value of the Channel Groups. However, due to the complexities of
    the redemption formula, the Company has accrued the minority
    interest to an estimated negotiated value of $49 million as of
    December 31, 2008. Changes in contractual interpretations
    and assumptions used to estimate the redemption value could
    materially impact current estimates. The Company recorded no
    accretion to the redemption value during the period ended
    December 31, 2008.

OWN
    Network

As disclosed in Note 4, Discovery and Harpo have formed a
    venture to rebrand Discovery Health Channel as OWN: The Oprah
    Winfrey Network. Pursuant to the venture agreement, Discovery
    provided a put right to Harpo which is exercisable on four
    separate put exercise dates within 12.5 years of the
    venture’s formation date. The put arrangement provides
    Harpo with the right to require Discovery to purchase its 50%
    ownership interest at fair market value up to a maximum put
    amount. The maximum put amount ranges between $100 million
    on the first put exercise date up to $400 million on the
    fourth put exercise date. As of December 31, 2008, no
    amounts have been recorded for this put right as Harpo has not
    made any contributions to the venture and the venture has not
    yet begun its operations.

STOCKHOLDERS’
    EQUITY

Common
    Stock

In connection with the Newhouse Transaction, the existing
    shareholders of DHC received shares of Discovery’s common
    stock. DHC Series A common stockholders and DHC
    Series B common stockholders received 0.50 shares of
    the same series of Discovery common stock and 0.50 shares
    of Discovery Series C common stock. As a result of this
    transaction, Discovery issued 134 million, 7 million,
    and 141 million shares of its Series A common stock,
    Series B common stock, and Series C common stock,
    respectively.

All three series of Discovery common stock (Series A, B and
    C) have the same rights and preferences, except:
    (i) the Series B common stock is convertible into the
    Series A common stock, and (ii) the Series B
    common stock has 10 votes per share, the Series A common
    stock has one vote per share, and the Series C common stock
    does not have any voting rights except as required by Delaware
    law.

Subject to any preferential rights of any outstanding series of
    Discovery’s preferred stock created by Discovery’s
    board from time to time, the holders of Discovery’s common
    stock are entitled to such dividends as may be declared from
    time to time by Discovery’s board from available funds.
    Generally, when a dividend is paid to the holders of one series
    of common stock, Discovery will also pay to the holders of the
    other series of common stock an equal per share dividend.

In the event of Discovery’s liquidation, dissolution, or
    winding up, after payment or provision for payment of
    Discovery’s debts and liabilities and subject to the prior
    payment in full of any preferential amounts to which
    Discovery’s preferred stock holders may be entitled
    including the liquidation preference granted to holders of
    Series A convertible preferred stock and Series C
    convertible preferred stock, the holders of Series A common
    stock, Series B common stock, Series C common stock,
    Series A convertible preferred stock and Series C
    convertible preferred stock will share equally, on a share for
    share basis (and in case of holders of Series A convertible
    preferred stock and Series C convertible preferred stock,
    on an as converted into common stock basis), in Discovery’s
    assets remaining for distribution to the holders of
    Discovery’s common stock.

Preferred
    Stock

In connection with the Newhouse Transaction, Advance/Newhouse
    received shares of Discovery’s Series A convertible
    preferred stock and Series C convertible preferred stock.
    As a result of this transaction, Discovery issued
    70 million of each of its Series A convertible
    preferred stock and Series C convertible preferred stock.

Both series of Discovery preferred stock (Series A and
    C) are convertible at any time into Discovery common stock
    initially representing


/


%
    of the outstanding shares of Discovery common stock and 26% of
    the aggregate voting power of Discovery (other than with respect
    to the election of directors and select matters) based upon the
    number of shares of common stock issued in connection with the
    Newhouse Transaction. The Series A convertible preferred
    stock is convertible into a number of shares of Discovery
    Series A common stock equal to 50% of the aggregate number
    of shares of Discovery Series A and Series B



DISCOVERY
    COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

common stock issued in the Newhouse Transaction, and the
    Series C convertible preferred stock is convertible into a
    number of shares of Discovery Series C common stock equal
    to 50% of the shares of Discovery Series C common stock
    issued in the Newhouse Transaction, in each case subject to
    anti-dilution adjustments. Advance/Newhouse is entitled to
    additional shares of the same series of convertible preferred
    stock if the stock options and stock appreciation rights
    outstanding immediately after the Newhouse Transaction are
    exercised into Discovery common stock. In order to satisfy this
    anti-dilution provision, the Company is required to place
    approximately 1.6 million shares of preferred stock into an
    escrow account upon the closing of the Newhouse Transaction for
    the benefit of Advance/Newhouse. The preferred shares will be
    released from escrow upon the exercise of the stock options or
    stock appreciation rights. The 1.6 million preferred shares
    will be issued and placed into escrow to avoid dilution to
    Advance/Newhouse, if necessary, as a result of certain stock
    options and stock appreciation rights converted to exercise into
    Discovery common stock as part of the Newhouse Transaction. The
    Company will place the preferred shares in escrow in 2009. In
    the event that shares are released from escrow to
    Advance/Newhouse, the distribution will be accounted for as a
    dividend measured using the fair value of the underlying shares
    as of the Newhouse Transaction date.

The Discovery preferred stock has a right to vote with holders
    of common stock on an as-converted to common stock basis, voting
    together as a single class on all matters submitted for vote to
    the common stockholders of Discovery, except for the election of
    directors. The Discovery preferred stock has the right to elect
    three directors (preferred stock directors), and has special
    voting rights on select matters for so long as Advance/Newhouse
    or its permitted transferee owns at least 80% of the shares of
    Series A convertible preferred stock outstanding
    immediately following the closing of the Newhouse Transaction,
    including fundamental changes in the business of Discovery,
    mergers and business combinations, certain acquisitions and
    dispositions and future issuances of Discovery capital stock.

Subject to the prior preferences and other rights of any senior
    stock, whenever a cash dividend is paid to the holders of
    Discovery common stock, Discovery will also pay to the holders
    of the Series A convertible preferred stock and
    Series C convertible preferred stock an equal per share
    cash dividend on an as converted to common stock basis.

In the event of Discovery’s liquidation, dissolution and
    winding up, after payment or provision for payment of
    Discovery’s debts and liabilities and subject to the prior
    payment with respect to any stock ranking senior to
    Series A convertible preferred stock or Series C
    convertible preferred stock, the holders of Series A
    convertible preferred stock and Series C convertible
    preferred stock will receive, before any payment or distribution
    is made to the holders of any common stock or other junior
    stock, an amount (in cash or property) equal to $0.01 per share.
    Following payment of such amount and the payment in full of all
    amounts owing to the holders of securities ranking senior to
    Discovery’s common stock, holders of Series A
    convertible preferred stock and Series C convertible
    preferred stock will be entitled to share ratably, on an
    as-converted to common stock basis, with the holders of
    Discovery’s common stock, as to any amounts remaining for
    distribution to such holders.

SHARE
    BASED AND OTHER LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION

The Company has various active equity plans under which it is
    authorized to grant equity awards to employees including the
    Discovery Holding Company 2005 Incentive Plan and the Discovery
    Holding Company 2005 Non-Employee Director Incentive Plan
    (collectively the “Incentive Plans”). On
    September 17, 2008, Discovery assumed the Discovery Holding
    Company Transitional Stock Adjustment Plan and converted the
    awards under this plan, but the Company has no ability to issue
    new awards under this plan. Share based grants under the
    Incentive Plans may consist of non-qualified stock options,
    stock appreciation rights (“SAR”), restricted shares,
    stock units, cash awards, performance awards or any combination
    of the foregoing. The



DISCOVERY

Discovery Appreciation Plan (“DAP” or
    “LTIP”) is a long-term incentive plan under which
    qualifying employees are granted

cash-settled

stock appreciation rights. All share-based compensation activity
    is presented on an as-converted basis as if the Newhouse
    Transaction had occurred on January 1, 2008. The Company
    also has a long term incentive plan associated with its
    acquisition of HSW for the benefit of the subsidiary’s
    employees (“HSW Plan”). The HSW plan is cash settled
    and is determined based on the share price of HSWI and the
    achievement of certain performance criteria. No new grants will
    be made out of the plan, which is expected to terminate in 2010.
    Compensation expense related to the HSW plan was $4 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Incentive
    Plans

Options are granted with exercise prices equal to, or in excess
    of, the fair market value at the date of grant. Generally, the
    stock options vest 25% per year over a four-year vesting period
    beginning one year after the grant date and expire seven to ten
    years from the date of grant. Certain stock option awards
    provide for accelerated vesting upon an election to retire
    pursuant to the Company’s incentive plans or after reaching
    a specified age and years of service.

Prior to September 17, 2008, certain directors were granted
    stock options to acquire DHC stock. As of September 18,
    2008, the stock options were converted pursuant to the merger
    agreement into options to acquire Discovery common stock. The
    conversion was based on the volume weighted average price of
    DHC’s common stock for the last five trading days prior to
    September 17, 2008 and Discovery’s common stock for
    the first ten trading days including and subsequent to
    September 17, 2008. The conversion of DHC stock options to
    stock options of the Company did not require the recognition of
    additional compensation expense as the value of the respective
    awards remained unchanged. As of December 31, 2008, the
    directors held approximately 2 million options to purchase
    the Company’s common stock.

During 2008, the Company issued approximately 7.7 million
    stock options under the Incentive Plans. These options vest 25%
    per year, beginning one year after the grant date, and expire
    after seven to ten years. Included in this issuance were 500,000
    options issued to a non-employee of the Company, which did not
    include a substantive performance requirement. This resulted in
    the recognition of $3 million of cost for the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

The fair value of each stock option issued under the Incentive
    Plans is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
    model, using factors set forth in the table below. Risk-free
    interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in
    effect at the time of grant. The expected term, which represents
    the period of time that options granted are expected to be
    outstanding, is estimated based on the simplified method as
    allowed by Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107,

Share-Based Payment

. The simplified method allows
    companies who issue “plain-vanilla” options to
    estimate the option term without analyzing historical data. The
    volatility assumption considers both historical volatility and
    implied volatility which may be impacted by the Company’s
    performance as well as changes in economic and market
    conditions. Dividend yield is assumed to be 0%, because the
    Company does not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable
    future. The assumptions presented in the table below represent
    the weighted-average value of the applicable assumptions used
    during the year to value the Company’s stock options at

As of December 31, 2008, the number, weighted-average
    exercise price, aggregate intrinsic value and weighted-average
    remaining contractual term of stock options vested and expected
    to vest approximate amounts for options outstanding. At
    December 31, 2008, there was $41 million of
    unrecognized compensation cost, net of expected forfeitures,
    related to unvested stock options, which the Company expects to
    recognize over a weighted average period of 4 years.

The weighted-average fair value of a stock option granted during
    the year ended December 31, 2008 was $6.11. An immaterial
    number of stock options were exercised during the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

Stock
    Appreciation Rights

SARs are granted with exercise prices equal to the fair market
    value at the date of grant. SARs entitle the recipient to
    receive a payment in cash equal to the excess value of the stock
    over the base price specified in the grant. During 2008, the
    Company issued 5.5 million SARs under the Incentive Plans.
    These SAR grants consist of two separate vesting tranches with
    the first tranche vesting 100% on March 15, 2009 and the
    second tranche vesting 100% on March 15, 2010. The first
    tranche expires one year after vesting. All SARs in the second
    tranche are automatically exercised on March 15, 2010. Upon
    vesting, grantees may exercise the SARs included in the first
    tranche at any time prior to March 15, 2010.

Cash-settled

SARs are required to be classified as liabilities in accordance
    with FASB Statement No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment
    (FAS 123(R)

. The fair value of each SAR is recalculated
    at the end of each reporting period and the liability and
    expense adjusted based on the new fair value. The assumptions
    used to determine the fair value of each SAR at
    December 31, 2008, were as follows:

As of December 31, 2008, no SARs issued under the Incentive
    Plans are exercisable. At December 31, 2008, there was
    $8 million of unrecognized compensation cost, net of
    estimated forfeitures, related to unvested stock appreciation
    rights, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted
    average period of 1.2 years.

Long-Term
    Incentive Plan

These awards, which are cash-settled, consist of a number of
    units which represent an equivalent number of shares of
    Series A common stock of the Company and have a base price
    which is determined based on the Company’s stock price.
    Each award vests as to 25% of the units on each of the four
    anniversaries of the date of grant. Upon voluntary termination
    of employment, the Company distributes 100% of vested unit
    benefits if employees agree to certain provisions.

Prior to September 17, 2008, the LTIP units were accounted
    for in accordance with FASB Statement No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments

(“FAS 133”), and EITF Issue

No. 02-8,

Accounting for Options Granted to Employees in Unrestricted,
    Publicly Traded Shares of an Unrelated Entity

(“EITF 02-8”),

as the value of the units were indexed to the value of DHC
    Series A common stock. The Company accounted for the units
    similar to a derivative, by determining their fair value each
    reporting period and attributed compensation expense for the
    awards on a straight-line basis, based on the grant-date fair
    value and scheduled vesting of the share units. As of
    September 18, 2008, the LTIP units were converted at the
    effective time of the Newhouse Transaction to reflect the
    changes in DHC’s stock and are now indexed to the share
    price of Discovery’s Series A common stock and subject
    to the provisions of FAS 123(R), which requires the Company
    to estimate the number of shares that are not expected to vest
    due employee turnover. Upon conversion, there were approximately
    31 million LTIP units outstanding. Application of the
    estimated forfeiture rate, which was not required by
    FAS 133, resulted in a decrease in the accrued compensation
    liability of $1 million. The Company does not intend to
    make additional cash-settled stock appreciation awards, except
    as may be required by contract or to employees in countries
    where stock option awards are not permitted.

In accordance with FAS 123(R), the fair value of each LTIP
    unit award is recalculated at the end of each reporting period
    and the liability and expense adjusted based on the new fair
    value. The assumptions used to determine the fair value of each
    LTIP unit at December 31, 2008, were as follows:

Restricted
    Stock Units

Pursuant to the Incentive Plans, Discovery may grant restricted
    stock units (“RSUs”). RSUs entitle the grantee to
    receive a specific number of shares of the Company’s common
    stock at a future vesting date. RSUs may be subject to
    forfeiture during a specified period or periods prior to
    vesting. The Company issued an immaterial number of RSUs in the
    fourth quarter. RSUs generally vest over a one to four year
    period in equal annual installments. The compensation arising
    from a restricted stock grant is based upon the market price at
    the grant date, which is deferred and amortized to expense over
    the vesting period.

    Compensation Expense

Compensation expense (benefit) and the related tax expense

RETIREMENT
    SAVINGS PLANS

Defined
    Contribution Plans

Discovery has certain domestic and international defined
    contribution savings plans. Under the plans, employees may elect
    to contribute a portion of their eligible compensation, subject
    to certain statutory limitations. The Company pays a
    discretionary matching contribution up to a certain percentage
    of the participant’s eligible compensation depending on the
    terms of the plan. The Company paid matching contributions of
    $12 million, $3 million, and $3 million during
    the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and

2006, which is classified as a component of

Selling, general
    and administrative

in the Consolidated Statements of
    Operations.

Supplemental
    Retirement Plan

The Company administers the Supplemental Retirement Plan (the
    “SRP”) through which members of the Company’s
    management team may elect to defer for contribution to the SRP
    up to 50% of their compensation. A Rabbi Trust has been
    established to hold and provide a measure of security for the
    investments that finance benefit payments. Distributions from
    the SRP are made upon retirement, termination, death, or total
    disability.

SRP obligations due to participants totalled $36 million at
    December 31, 2008 which is included in

Accrued
    liabilities

in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.
    SRP obligations decreased by $1 million during the year
    ended December 31, 2008, consisting of participant
    compensation deferrals of $9 million and Company
    contributions of $1 million, offset by $7 million of
    distributions and $4 million of investment losses.

The Company maintains investment assets in a Rabbi Trust to
    offset the obligations under the SRP. The value of the
    investments in the Rabbi Trust was $36 million at
    December 31, 2008. Investment losses were $4 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2008.

    Education, and Other segment incurred costs relate to the
    closure of its distribution center and its stores’
    headquarter offices, and the transition from merchandising
    services to licensing of consumer products. The purpose of these
    adjustments was to better align Discovery’s organizational

Discovery’s 2008 effective tax rate differed from the
    federal income tax rate of 35% primarily due to DHC’s
    recognition of $91 million of deferred tax expense related
    to its investment in DCH during the period prior to the
    completion of the Newhouse Transaction, which is partially
    offset by the release of an $18 million valuation allowance
    on deferred tax assets of CSS and the release of a
    $10 million valuation allowance on deferred tax assets
    related to net operating loss carryforwards of AMC.

In accordance with ARB 51, DHC and DCH are combined in
    Discovery’s financial statements as if the Newhouse
    Transaction had occurred January 1, 2008. This presentation
    impacts Discovery’s effective tax rate



DISCOVERY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

for the year. Prior to the Newhouse Transaction, DHC’s book
    basis in DCH was increased by its share of DCH’s net
    income. However, DHC’s tax basis in DCH remained the same.
    This book vs. tax difference required the recognition of a
    deferred tax expense of $91 million related to DHC’s
    investment in DCH (in addition to the tax expense already
    recognized by DCH prior to the Newhouse Transaction). As a
    result of the Newhouse Transaction, the $1.3 billion
    deferred tax liability relating to the book vs. tax difference
    in DHC’s basis in its investment in DCH was reversed to
    additional paid-in capital.

Pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement relating to the Newhouse
    Transaction, the Company and AMC have each assumed certain tax
    liabilities and have indemnified one another for certain tax
    payments. As of December 31, 2008, the Company received
    $17 million from AMC and recorded a $17 million
    payable under the Tax Sharing Agreement. The Company will be
    required to repay AMC for such payments if and when it realizes
    the future benefit of the certain tax assets that arose prior to
    the Newhouse Transaction.

In 2008, the Company concluded that it would be more beneficial
    to claim foreign tax credits than to deduct foreign income taxes
    on its 2008 federal income tax return based on a combination of
    current results and revised expectations about future earnings.
    The net effect of the conversion from taking foreign tax
    deductions to claiming foreign tax credits was a
    $24 million benefit in 2008.

FIN 48

The Company has adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

. A
    reconciliation of the 2008 beginning and ending amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits (without related interest amounts) is

Balance at December 31, 2008

As of January 1, 2008, the Company’s unrecognized tax
    benefit (excluding related interest expense) was
    $89 million. The balance decreased by $15 million
    (excluding related interest expense) during the twelve months
    ended December 31, 2008 to $74 million
    ($52 million inclusive of interest but net of related
    deferred tax assets and other offsets). Reductions for tax
    positions of prior years in the amount of $8 million were
    attributable to the Company’s determination that certain
    revenues were not subject to

non-U.S. income

tax. Additions for tax positions of prior years in the amount of
    $5 million were related to an adjustment in the computation
    of the Company’s potential liability for foreign tax
    returns.

Discovery and its subsidiaries file U.S. federal, state,
    and foreign income tax returns. With few exceptions, the Company
    is no longer subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service
    (“IRS”), state tax authorities, or

non-U.S. tax

authorities for years prior to 2004. The IRS is not currently
    examining Discovery. Some of the Company’s joint ventures
    are currently under examination for the 2006 tax year. The
    Company does not expect any significant adjustments.



DISCOVERY
    COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized
    tax benefits related to tax positions could decrease by as much
    as $33 million within the next twelve months as a result of
    settlement of audit issues

and/or

payment of uncertain tax liabilities.

Included in the balance at December 31, 2008 are
    $9 million of tax positions for which the ultimate
    deductibility is highly certain but for which there is
    uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Because of
    the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and
    penalties, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period
    would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would
    accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an
    earlier period.

The Company’s policy is to classify tax interest and
    penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as tax expense.
    The Company had accrued approximately $8 million of total
    interest payable related to uncertain tax positions as of
    December 31, 2008. The Company had accrued no significant
    interest payable related to uncertain tax positions as of
    December 31, 2007. The $8 million of interest payable
    relates primarily to 2008 activity and the impact of the
    Newhouse Transaction.

NET
    INCOME PER SHARE

Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by
    the weighted average number of common and preferred shares
    outstanding during the period. Preferred shares are included in
    the weighted average number of shares outstanding when
    calculating both basic and diluted income per share as the
    common shares and preferred shares participate equally in any
    dividends paid.

Years Ended December 31,




(Amounts in millions)

Average number of common and preferred shares

Weighted-average common shares for 2008 represent the
    outstanding shares of Discovery’s common stock as though
    the Newhouse Transaction was consummated on January 1,
    2008. The weighted average number of common and preferred shares
    for the year ended December 31, 2008 includes
    Series A, B, and C Common Shares, as well as Series A
    and C Convertible Preferred Shares. Weighted-average common
    shares for 2007 represent the outstanding shares of DHC’s
    common stock (Note 1).

Diluted income per common share adjusts basic income per common
    share for the dilutive effects of stock options, and other
    potentially dilutive financial instruments, as if they had been
    converted at the beginning of the periods presented. For the
    year ended December 31, 2008, options to purchase
    9 million shares were excluded from the calculation of
    diluted net income per share because they do not have a dilutive
    effect. In addition, the net income per share calculation
    excludes any contingently issuable shares to be placed in escrow
    for which specific conditions have not yet been met. Due to the
    relative insignificance of the dilutive securities in 2007 and
    2006, they had no impact on the net income per share amounts as
    reported.

DISCOVERY
    COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In December 2007, Discovery acquired HSW and a 49.5% interest in
    HSWi. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Discovery has the
    option to: (i) distribute the HSWi stock to the former HSW
    shareholders, or (ii) sell the HSWi stock and distribute
    substantially all of the proceeds to former HSW shareholders.
    Discovery recognized a liability for its estimated obligation
    with respect to the HSWi shares to the former HSW shareholders.

In addition to the amounts disclosed above, the Company has
    committed to fund up to $100 million of the OWN
    venture’s operations through September 2011 as discussed in
    Note 4.

Advance/Newhouse is entitled to additional shares of the same
    series of convertible preferred stock if the DHC stock options
    and stock appreciation rights converted in connection with the
    Newhouse Transaction are exercised for Discovery common stock.
    In order to satisfy this anti-dilution provision, the Company is
    required to place approximately 1.6 million shares of
    preferred stock into an escrow account. The preferred stock will
    be released from escrow upon the exercise of the stock options
    or stock appreciation rights. The 1.6 million preferred
    shares will be issued and placed into escrow to avoid dilution
    to Advance/Newhouse as a result of certain stock options and
    stock appreciation rights converted to exercise into Discovery
    common stock as part of the Newhouse Transaction. The Company
    will place the preferred shares in escrow in 2009. In the event
    that shares are released from escrow to Advance/Newhouse, the
    distribution will be accounted for as a dividend measured using
    the fair value of the underlying shares as of the Newhouse
    Transaction date.

In the normal course of business, the Company has pending claims
    and legal proceedings. It is the opinion of the Company’s
    management, based on information available at this time, that
    none of the other current claims and proceedings will have a
    material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

24.

REPORTABLE
    SEGMENTS

The Company has three reportable segments: U.S. Networks,
    consisting principally of domestic cable and satellite
    television network programming, web brands, and other digital
    services; International Networks, consisting principally of
    international cable and satellite television network
    programming; and Commerce, Education, and Other, consisting
    principally of e-commerce, catalog, and domestic licensing
    businesses.

Prior to the Newhouse Transaction and related AMC spin-off
    (Note 1), DHC had three reportable segments: Creative
    Services Group, which provided various technical and creative
    services necessary to complete principal photography into final
    products such as films, trailers, shows, and other media;
    Network Services Group, which provided the facilities and
    services necessary to assemble and distribute programming
    content for cable and broadcast network; and DCH, as a
    significant equity method investee. In connection with the
    Newhouse Transaction, DHC spun-off its interest in AMC, which
    included the Creative Services Group segment, except for CSS,
    and the Network Services Group segment. The discontinued
    operations of the Creative Services Group and Network Services
    Group segments have been excluded from the reportable segment
    information presented below.

The CSS business, which remains with Discovery subsequent to the
    Newhouse Transaction and AMC spin-off, is included in the
    Commerce, Education, and Other segment. In accordance with ARB
    51, the financial results of both DHC and DCH have been combined
    in Discovery’s financial statements as if the Newhouse
    Transaction occurred January 1, 2008. Accordingly, the
    Commerce, Education, and Other segment information for 2008
    includes amounts for CSS since January 1, 2008.

The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same
    as those described in the summary of significant accounting
    policies, except that certain inter-segment transactions that
    are eliminated at the consolidated level are not eliminated at
    the segment level as they are treated similar to third-party
    sales transactions in determining segment performance.
    Inter-segment transactions primarily include the purchase of
    advertising and content between segments. Inter-segment
    transactions are not material to the periods presented.



DISCOVERY
    COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company evaluates the operating performance of segments
    based on financial measures such as revenues and adjusted
    operating income before depreciation and amortization
    (“Adjusted OIBDA”). Adjusted OIBDA is defined as
    revenues less: (i) cost of revenues and selling, general
    and administrative expense excluding mark-to-market share-based
    compensation expense, (ii) restructuring and impairment
    charges, (iii) amortization of deferred launch incentives,
    and (iv) gains on asset dispositions. Management uses
    Adjusted OIBDA to assess the operational strength and
    performance of its operating segments. Management uses this
    measure to view operating results, perform analytical
    comparisons, identify strategies to improve performance and
    allocate resources to each operating segment. The Company
    believes Adjusted OIBDA is an important measure to investors
    because it allows them to analyze operating performance of each
    business using the same metric management uses and also provides
    investors a measure to analyze operating performance of each
    business division against historical data. The Company excludes
    these charges from the calculation of Adjusted OIBDA due to
    their significant volatility. The Company also excludes the
    amortization of deferred launch incentive payments because these
    payments are infrequent and the amortization does not represent
    cash payments in the current reporting period. Since Adjusted
    OIBDA is a non-GAAP measure, it should be considered in addition
    to, but not a substitute for, operating income, net income, cash
    flow provided by operating activities and other measures of
    financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP.

The Company’s reportable segments are determined based on:
    (i) financial information reviewed by the chief operating
    decision maker (“CODM”), the Chief Executive Officer,
    (ii) internal management and related reporting structure,
    and (iii) the basis upon which the CODM makes resource
    allocation decisions.

    for each of the Company’s reportable segments.

SUBSEQUENT
    EVENTS

On January 29, 2009, the Company entered into interest rate
    swap transactions which will become effective on June 30,
    2010, with a notional amount of $200 million. Under the
    swap transactions, the Company will make quarterly payments at a
    rate of approximately 2.935% per annum to the swap
    counterparties in exchange for a payment approximately equal to
    the variable rate payable under the Company’s Credit,
    Pledge and Security Agreement dated as of May 14, 2007. The
    swap transactions terminate on March 31, 2014, which is the
    interest payment date before the maturity date of the
    Company’s Credit, Pledge and Security Agreement, which is
    May 14, 2014. The terms of the swap transactions are
    governed by customary ISDA interest rate swap agreements.

By entering into these swap transactions, the Company has
    effectively fixed the interest rate on $200 million of the
    borrowings under its Credit, Pledge and Security Agreement at
    approximately 4.935% per annum, starting as of June 30,
    2010.

26.

SELECTED
    QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA (UNAUDITED)

The following tables present the Company’s selected
    quarterly financial data, by quarter, for the years ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007. The selected quarterly
    financial data set forth below reflect the Newhouse Transaction,
    including the AMC spin-off, as though it was consummated on
    January 1, 2008. Accordingly, the selected quarterly
    financial data for the year ended December 31, 2008 include
    the gross combined results of operations of both DHC and DCH.
    The presentation for the first two quarters of 2008 will be
    recast when filed with the corresponding 2009

Form 10-Q.

The selected quarterly financial data for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 reflect only the results of operations of
    DHC, as predecessor to Discovery. Prior to the Newhouse
    Transaction, DHC accounted for its ownership interest in DCH
    using the equity method. Because the Newhouse Transaction is
    presented as of January 1, 2008, the selected quarterly
    financial data for the year ended December 31, 2007 include
    DCH’s results of operations as an equity-method investment.
    Information regarding the Newhouse Transaction and DHC’s
    investment in DCH prior to Newhouse Transaction is disclosed in
    Note 1 and Note 2, respectively.

The selected quarterly financial data also reflect certain
    reclassifications of each company’s financial information
    to conform to the combined Company’s financial statement
    presentation, as follows:

•

The portion of DCH’s earnings recorded by DHC using the
    equity method during the period January 1, 2008 through
    September 17, 2008 have been eliminated.

•

The results of operations of AMC have been reclassified and
    presented as

Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net
    of tax

for the quarters ended March 31, 2007 through
    September 30, 2008.

ITEM 9.

Changes
    in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and
    Financial Disclosure.

Prior to the completion of the merger of DHC with a wholly-owned
    subsidiary of Discovery on September 17, 2008,
    KPMG LLP (“KPMG”) was DHC’s independent
    registered public accounting firm. As the transaction was
    treated as a non-substantive merger for accounting purposes, DHC
    is considered our predecessor registrant. In connection with the
    merger, we made the decision to change our independent
    registered public accounting firm to PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP
    and dismissed KPMG as our independent registered public
    accounting firm as of September 18, 2008. This change was
    approved by our Audit Committee.

During DHC’s two most recent fiscal years and through the
    date of dismissal of KPMG, there were no disagreements with KPMG
    on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial
    statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which
    disagreement(s), if not resolved to the satisfaction of KPMG,
    would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of
    the disagreement(s) in connection with its report. There were no
    reportable events under Item 304(a)(l)(v) of Regulation

S-K

that
    occurred during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2007
    and 2006 and through September 18, 2008.

ITEM 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures.

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

The Company’s management, with the participation of our
    chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated
    the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as
    of the end of the period covered by this report. The term
    “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
    Act”), means controls and other procedures of a company
    that are designed to ensure that information required to be
    disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits
    under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
    rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
    without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure
    that information required to be disclosed by a company in the
    reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
    accumulated and communicated to the company’s management,
    including its principal executive and principal financial
    officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and
    procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can
    provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives
    and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating
    the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and
    procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls
    and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this
    report, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer
    concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and
    procedures were effective.

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

No changes were made to the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended
    December 31, 2008, that have materially affected, or are
    reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting.

As a result of the Newhouse Transaction, as of
    September 18, 2008, the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting largely consists of DCH’s
    controls, instead of DHC’s.

Prior to the transaction, DHC accounted for DCH as an equity
    investment. Accordingly, DHC’s annual management assessment
    of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to
    Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act did not cover
    DCH’s internal controls. Due to the consummation of the
    Newhouse Transaction late in the fiscal year, DHC and DCH
    submitted a request to the staff of the SEC for concurrence that
    the Company would not be required to complete an assessment of
    internal control over financial reporting in accordance with
    Section 404 for the year ended December 31, 2008. The
    Company has been advised by the staff of the SEC that it has no
    objection to this request.

As of December 31, 2009, the Company is required to comply
    with the management certification and auditor attestation
    requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
    2002. In the interim, the Company will be required to perform
    the documentation, evaluation and testing required to make these
    assessments.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and
    the related consolidated statements of operations, of changes in
    members’ equity and of cash flows, present fairly, in all
    material respects, the financial position of Discovery
    Communications Holding, LLC and its subsidiaries at
    December 31, 2007 and the results of their operations and
    their cash flows for the period from May 15, 2007 through
    December 31, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. These
    financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We
    conducted our audit of these statements in accordance with the
    standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
    (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
    audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
    the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
    assessing the accounting principles used and significant
    estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
    financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

DESCRIPTION
    OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Description
    of Business

Discovery Communications Holding, LLC (“Discovery” or
    the “Company”) is a global media and entertainment
    company that provides original and purchased cable and satellite
    television programming across multiple platforms in the United
    States and over 170 other countries. Discovery also develops and
    sells proprietary merchandise, other products and educational
    product lines in the United States and internationally.
    Discovery operates through three divisions:
    (1) U.S. Networks, (2) International Networks,

Basis
    of Presentation

Discovery was formed through a conversion completed by Discovery

    Communications Holding, LLC, and not the current registrant)
    (“DCI” or “the Predecessor Company”) on
    May 14, 2007. As part of the conversion, DCI became
    Discovery Communications, LLC (“DCL”), a wholly-owned
    subsidiary of Discovery, and the former shareholders of DCI,
    including Cox Communications Holdings, Inc. (“Cox”),
    Advance/Newhouse Programming Partnerships, and Discovery Holding
    Company (“DHC”) became members of Discovery.
    Subsequent to this conversion, each of the members of Discovery
    held the same ownership interests in Discovery as their previous
    capital stock ownership interest had been in DCI.

The formation of Discovery required “pushdown”
    accounting and each shareholder’s basis has been pushed
    down to Discovery. The pushdown of the investors’ bases
    resulted in the recording of approximately $4.6 billion of
    additional goodwill, which had been previously recorded on the
    investors’ books. No other basis differentials existed on
    the investors’ books; therefore, no other assets or
    liabilities were adjusted. The application of push down
    accounting represents the termination of the predecessor
    reporting entity, DCI, and the creation of the successor
    reporting entity, Discovery. Accordingly, the results for the
    year ended December 31, 2007 are required to be presented
    as two distinct periods. The “Predecessor” period
    refers to the period from January 1, 2007 through
    May 14, 2007, and the “Successor” period refers
    to the period from May 15, 2007 through December 31,
    2007. Accordingly, a vertical black line is shown to separate
    the Company financial statements from those of the Predecessor
    Company for periods ended prior to May 15, 2007. As the
    entire pushdown was associated with

non-amortizable

goodwill, there was no adjustment to the income statement during
    the Successor period as a result of this transaction.

Subsequent to the formation of Discovery, Cox exchanged its 25%
    ownership interest in Discovery for all of the capital stock of
    a subsidiary of Discovery that held the Travel Channel and
    travelchannel.com (collectively, the “Travel
    Business”) and approximately $1.3 billion in cash.
    Discovery retired the membership interest previously owned by
    Cox. The distribution of the Travel Business, which was valued
    at $575 million, resulted in a $135 million tax-free
    gain included in continuing operations. The gain was net of
    $280 million in reporting unit goodwill and
    $160 million in net assets. The net impact to goodwill as a
    result of the pushdown of investor basis and disposition of the
    Travel Business was $4.3 billion.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    all majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries. In addition, the
    Company evaluates its relationships with other entities to
    identify whether they are variable interest entities as defined
    by Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
    Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable
    Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51,

as
    revised in December 2003 (“FIN 46R”) and to
    assess whether it is the primary beneficiary of such entities.
    Variable Interest Entities (“VIEs”) are generally
    entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities
    without additional financial

support from other parties or whose equity holders possess
    rights not proportionate to their ownership. The equity method
    of accounting is used for affiliates over which the Company
    exercises significant influence but does not control.

All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated
    in consolidation.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
    of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
    reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
    periods. Actual results may differ from those estimates and
    could have a material impact on the consolidated financial
    statements.

Reclassifications
    and Revisions

Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2007 and 2006
    financial statements to separately present exit and
    restructuring costs and asset impairments charges where such
    amounts were previously included within cost of revenues and
    depreciation and amortization expense, respectively.

Additionally, certain marketing costs were incorrectly
    classified between cost of revenues and selling, general and
    administrative expenses. The Company has revised its financial
    statements to reclassify these marketing costs, which resulted
    in a net decrease to cost of revenues and a corresponding
    increase to selling, general and administrative expenses of
    $8 million during the period from May 15, 2007 through
    December 31, 2007, a net increase to cost of revenues and a
    corresponding decrease to selling, general and administrative
    expenses of $2 million during the period from
    January 1, 2007 through May 14, 2007, and a net
    decrease to cost of revenues and a corresponding increase to
    selling, general and administrative expenses of $10 million
    during the year ended December 31, 2006, respectively. The
    revisions did not have any effect on amounts previously reported
    for revenues, total operating expenses, operating income, net
    income, or cash flows and are not material to our overall
    financial statements.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for
    Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities — including
    an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115

(“FAS 159”). FAS 159 gives entities the
    irrevocable option to carry most financial assets and
    liabilities at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized
    in earnings. FAS 159 is effective for the Company as of the
    beginning of the Company’s 2008 fiscal year. The Company
    expects to adopt fair value accounting for its equity investment
    in HSWi (see Note 4). The impact could be material to the
    financial statements depending upon changes in fair value. The
    Company is currently assessing the potential effect of
    FAS 159 on its other assets and liabilities.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“FAS 157”). FAS 157 defines fair value
    and establishes a framework to make the measurement of fair
    value in generally accepted accounting principles more
    consistent and comparable. FAS 157 requires expanded
    disclosures about the extent to which fair value is used to
    measure assets and liabilities, the methods and assumptions used
    to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measures on
    earnings. FAS 157 will be effective for the Company’s
    2008 fiscal year. The Company is currently assessing the
    potential effect of FAS 157 on its financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 141 (revised 2007),

Business
    Combinations

(“FAS 141R”). FAS 141R
    replaces Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 141,

Business Combinations

(“FAS 141”), although it retains the
    fundamental requirement in FAS 141 that



DISCOVERY
    COMMUNICATIONS HOLDING, LLC

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

the acquisition method of accounting be used for all business
    combinations. FAS 141R establishes principles and
    requirements for how the acquirer in a business combination
    (a) recognizes and measures the assets acquired,
    liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the
    acquiree, (b) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired
    in a business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and
    (c) determines what information to disclose regarding the
    business combination. FAS 141R applies prospectively to
    business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or
    after the beginning of the Company’s 2009 fiscal year.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests
    in Consolidated Financial Statements

(“FAS 160”). FAS 160 establishes
    accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling
    interest in a subsidiary, commonly referred to as minority
    interest. Among other matters, FAS 160 requires
    (a) the noncontrolling interest be reported within equity
    in the balance sheet and (b) the amount of consolidated net
    income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling
    interest to be clearly presented in the statement of income.
    FAS 160 is effective for the Company’s 2009 fiscal
    year. FAS 160 is to be applied prospectively, except for
    the presentation and disclosure requirements, which shall be
    applied retrospectively for all periods presented. The Company
    is currently assessing the potential effect of FAS 160 on
    its financial statements.

Revenue
    Recognition

The Company derives revenues from three primary sources:
    (1) distribution revenues from cable system and satellite
    operators (distributors), (2) advertising revenues for
    commercial spots aired on the Company’s networks and
    websites), and (3) other revenues, which is largely

e-commerce

and educational sales.

Distribution revenues are recognized over the service period,
    net of launch incentives and other vendor consideration.
    Advertising revenues are recorded net of agency commissions and
    audience deficiency liabilities in the period advertising spots
    are broadcast.

E-commerce

and educational product revenues are recognized either at the
    point-of-sale or upon product shipment. Educational service
    sales are generally recognized ratably over the term of the
    agreement.

Advertising
    Costs

The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising
    costs of $108 million, $72 million, and
    $208 million were incurred from May 15, 2007 through
    December 31, 2007, from January 1, 2007 through
    May 14, 2007, and in 2006, respectively.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Highly liquid investments with original maturities of ninety
    days or less are recorded as cash equivalents. Restricted cash
    of $8 million is included in other current assets as of
    December 31, 2007. Book overdrafts representing outstanding
    checks in excess of funds on deposit are recorded as a component
    of accounts payable and totaled $11 million as of
    December 31, 2007.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,

(“FAS 133”), requires every derivative
    instrument to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as
    either an asset or a liability. The statement also requires that
    changes in the fair value of derivatives be recognized currently
    in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.
    The Company uses financial instruments designated as cash flow
    hedges. The effective changes in fair value of derivatives
    designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss). Amounts are reclassified from
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as interest
    expense is recorded for debt. The Company uses the cumulative
    dollar offset method to assess effectiveness. To be highly
    effective, the ratio



DISCOVERY
    COMMUNICATIONS HOLDING, LLC

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

calculated by dividing the cumulative change in the value of the
    actual swap by the cumulative change in the hypothetical swap
    must be between 80% and 125%. The ineffective portion of a
    derivative’s change in fair value is immediately recognized
    in earnings. The Company uses derivatives instruments
    principally to manage the risk associated with the movements of
    foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates
    that will affect the cash flows of its debt transactions. Refer
    to Note 17 for additional information regarding derivative
    instruments held by the Company and risk management strategies.

Inventories

Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
    determined using the weighted average cost method.

Content
    Rights

Costs incurred in the direct production, co-production or
    licensing of content rights are capitalized and stated at the
    lower of unamortized cost, fair value, or net realizable value.
    The Company evaluates the net realizable value of content by
    considering the fair value of the underlying produced and
    co-produced content and the net realizable values of the
    licensed content quarterly.

The costs of produced and co-produced content airing on the
    Company’s networks are capitalized and amortized based on
    the expected realization of revenues, resulting in an
    accelerated basis over four years for developed networks
    (Discovery Channel, TLC and Animal Planet) in the United States,
    and a straight-line basis over no longer than five years for
    developing networks (all other networks in the United States)
    and all networks in the International division. The cost of
    licensed content is capitalized and amortized over the term of
    the license period based on the expected realization of
    revenues, resulting in an accelerated basis for developed
    networks in the United States, and a straight-line basis for all
    International Networks, developing networks in the United States
    and educational ventures. The costs of content for electronic,
    video and hardcopy educational supplements are amortized on a
    straight-line basis over a three to five year period.

All produced and co-produced content is classified as long-term.
    The portion of the unamortized licensed content balance that
    will be amortized within one year is classified as a current
    asset. The Company’s co-production arrangements generally
    represent the sharing of production cost. The Company records
    its share of costs gross and records no amounts for the portion
    of costs borne by the other party as the Company does not share
    any associated economics of exploitation.

Property
    and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
    depreciation. Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line
    basis over the estimated useful lives of three to seven years
    for equipment, furniture and fixtures, five to forty years for
    building structure and construction, and six to twelve years for
    satellite transponders. Leasehold improvements are amortized on
    a straight-line basis over the lesser of their estimated useful
    lives or the terms of the related leases, beginning on the date
    the asset is put into use. Equipment under capital lease
    represents the present value of the minimum lease payments at
    the inception of the lease, net of accumulated depreciation.

Capitalized
    Software Costs

All capitalized software costs are for internal use.
    Capitalization of costs occurs during the application
    development stage. Costs incurred during the pre and post
    implementation stages are expensed as incurred. Capitalized
    costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over their
    estimated useful lives of one to five years. Unamortized
    capitalized costs totaled $57 million at December 31,
    2007. Software costs of $9 million, $7 million, and
    $22 million were capitalized from May 15, 2007 through
    December 31, 2007, from January 1,



DISCOVERY
    COMMUNICATIONS HOLDING, LLC

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

2007 through May 14, 2007, and in 2006, respectively.
    Amortization of capitalized software costs totaled
    $13 million, $7 million, and $18 million, from
    May 15, 2007 through December 31, 2007, from
    January 1, 2007 through May 14, 2007, and in 2006,
    respectively. There were no write-offs for capitalized software
    costs during 2007 or 2006.

Recoverability
    of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill, and Intangible
    Assets

The Company annually assesses the carrying value of its acquired
    intangible assets, including goodwill, and its other long-lived
    assets, including deferred launch incentives, to determine
    whether impairment may exist, unless indicators of impairment
    become evident requiring immediate assessment. Goodwill
    impairment is identified by comparing the fair value of the
    reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the
    reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment
    loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of
    the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying
    value. Intangible assets and other long-lived assets are grouped
    for purposes of evaluating recoverability at the lowest level
    for which independent cash flows are identifiable. If the
    carrying amount of an intangible asset, long-lived asset, or
    asset grouping exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is
    recognized. Fair values for reporting units, goodwill and other
    asset groups are determined based on discounted cash flows,
    market multiples, or comparable assets as appropriate. During
    the Predecessor period, DCI recorded asset impairments of
    $26 million for education assets related to its consumer
    business. During the Successor period, the Company recorded a
    $28 million write-off of leasehold improvements related to
    store closures which is included in loss from discontinued
    operations.

The determination of recoverability of goodwill and other
    intangibles and long-lived assets requires significant judgment
    and estimates regarding future cash flows, fair values, and the
    appropriate grouping of assets. Such estimates are subject to
    change and could result in impairment losses being recognized in
    the future. If different reporting units, asset groupings, or
    different valuation methodologies had been used, the impairment
    test results could have differed.

Deferred
    Launch Incentives

Consideration issued to cable and satellite distributors in
    connection with the execution of long-term network distribution
    agreements is deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis as
    a reduction to revenue over the terms of the agreements.
    Obligations for fixed launch incentives are recorded at the
    inception of the agreement. Following the renewal of a
    distribution agreement, the remaining deferred consideration is
    amortized over the extended period. Amortization of deferred
    launch incentives and interest on unpaid deferred launch
    incentives was $61 million, $39 million, and
    $79 million from May 15, 2007 through
    December 31, 2007, from January 1, 2007 through
    May 14, 2007, and in 2006, respectively. During 2007, in
    connection with the settlement of terms under a pre-existing
    distribution agreement, Discovery completed negotiations for the
    renewal of long-term distribution agreements for certain of its
    U.K. networks and paid a distributor $196 million, most of
    which is being amortized over a five year period.

Foreign
    Currency Translation

The Company’s foreign subsidiaries’ assets and
    liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the
    balance sheet date, while results of operations are translated
    at average exchange rates for the respective periods. The
    resulting translation adjustments are included as a separate
    component of stockholders’ deficit/ members’ equity in
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Intercompany
    accounts of a trading nature are revalued at exchange rates in
    effect at each month end and are included as part of operating
    income in the consolidated Statements of Operations.



DISCOVERY
    COMMUNICATIONS HOLDING, LLC

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

Long-term
    Incentive Plans

Prior to August 2005, DCI maintained two unit-based, cash
    settled, long-term incentive plans. Under these plans, unit
    awards, which vest over a period of years, were granted to
    eligible employees and increased or decreased in value based on
    a specified formula of DCI’s business metrics. DCI
    accounted for these units similar to stock appreciation rights
    and applied the guidance in FASB Interpretation No. 28,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

(“FIN 28”). Accordingly, DCI adjusted
    compensation expense for changes in the accrued value of these
    awards over the period outstanding.

In August 2005, DCI discontinued one of its long-term incentive
    plans and settled all amounts with cash payments. In October
    2005, DCI established a new long-term incentive plan for certain
    eligible employees. Substantially all participants in the
    remaining plan redeemed their vested units for cash payment and
    received units in the new plan.

Under the new plan, eligible employees receive cash settled unit
    awards indexed to the price of Class A DHC stock. As the
    units are indexed to the equity of another entity, the Company
    treats the units similar to a derivative, by determining their
    fair value each reporting period. The Company attributes
    compensation expense for the new awards on a straight-line
    basis; the Company attributes compensation expense for the
    initial grant of partially vested units by continuing to apply
    the FIN 28 model that was utilized over the awards’
    original vesting periods. Once units are fully vested, the
    Company recognizes all mark-to-market adjustments to fair value
    in each period as compensation expense. In March 2005, the
    Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) issued
    Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107,

Share-Based
    Payment

(“SAB 107”), regarding the
    classification of compensation expense associated with
    share-based payment awards. By applying the provisions of
    SAB 107, all long term incentive compensation expense is
    recorded as a component of selling, general and administrative
    expenses.

The Company classifies as a current liability the lesser of 100%
    of the intrinsic value of the units that are vested or will
    become vested within one year or the Black-Scholes value of
    units that have been attributed. Upon voluntary termination of
    employment, the Company distributes 100% of unit benefits if
    employees agree to certain provisions. Prior to a plan amendment
    in August 2007, the Company classified as a current liability
    75% of the intrinsic value of vested units or units vesting
    within one year, as this amount corresponded to the value
    potentially payable should all participants separate from the
    Company. Upon voluntary termination of employment, the Company
    distributed 75% of unit benefits. The remainder was paid at the
    one-year anniversary of termination date. The August 2007 plan
    amendment eliminated the deferral of the final 25%. As such,
    employees are paid 100% of their vested amount upon separation
    from the Company.

Redeemable
    Interests in Subsidiaries

For those instruments with an estimated redemption value,
    redeemable interests in subsidiaries are accreted or amortized
    to an estimated redemption value ratably over the period to the
    redemption date. Accretion and amortization are recorded as a
    component of minority interest expense. For instruments with a
    specified rate of return, DCI records interest expense as
    incurred. Cash receipts and payments for the sale or purchase of
    redeemable interests in subsidiaries are included as a component
    of investing cash flows.

Minority
    Interests

In addition to the accretion and amortization on redeemable
    minority interests, the Company records minority interest
    expense for the portion of the earnings of consolidated entities
    which are applicable to the minority interest partners.

Treasury
    Units

Treasury units are accounted for using the cost method by DCI,
    the Predecessor. The repurchased units are held in treasury and
    are presented as if retired. There was no treasury unit activity
    from January 1, 2007 through May 14, 2007 or for the
    year ended December 31, 2006. Discovery, the Successor,
    purchased and retired the membership units owned by Cox. (Refer
    to Note 1 Description of Business and Basis of
    Presentation.)

Discontinued
    Operations

In determining whether a group of assets disposed of should be
    presented as a discontinued operation, the Company makes a
    determination as to whether the group of assets being disposed
    of comprises a component of the entity, which requires cash
    flows that can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the
    entity. The Company also determines whether the cash flows
    associated with the group of assets have been or will be
    significantly eliminated from the ongoing operations of the
    Company as a result of the disposal transaction and whether the
    Company has no significant continuing involvement in the
    operations of the group of assets after the disposal
    transaction. If these determinations can be made affirmatively,
    the results of operations of the group of assets being disposed
    of (as well as any gain or loss on the disposal transaction) are
    aggregated for separate presentation apart from continuing
    operating results of the Company in the consolidated financial
    statements. The Company has elected not to segregate the cash
    flows from discontinued operations in its presentation of the
    Statements of Cash Flows.

Income
    Taxes

Income taxes are recorded using the asset and liability method
    of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect
    the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying
    amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
    purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A
    valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is
    more likely than not such assets will be unrealized.

Effective January 1, 2007, DCI adopted FASB Interpretation
    No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the
    accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a
    company’s financial statements, and prescribes a
    recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the
    financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
    position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In
    instances where the Company has taken or expects to take a tax
    position in its tax return and the Company believes it is more
    likely than not that such tax position will be upheld by the
    relevant taxing authority upon settlement, the Company may
    record the benefits of such tax position in its consolidated
    financial statements. The tax benefit to be recognized is
    measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than
    50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Upon
    adoption of FIN 48, DCI recorded a $5 million net tax
    liability recorded directly to accumulated deficit.

BUSINESS
    ACQUISITIONS

On December 17, 2007, Discovery completed its acquisition
    of HowStuffWorks.com (“HSW”), an on-line source of
    explanations of how the world actually works. This acquisition
    provides an additional platform for Discovery’s library of
    video content and positions its brands as a hub for satisfying
    curiosity on both television and on-line. The results of
    operations have been included in the consolidated financial
    statements since December 17, 2007. The aggregate purchase
    price was $265 million, including $15 million of
    transaction costs. The Company also assumed net working capital
    of $1 million, content of $9 million, and deferred tax
    liabilities of $45 million. As of December 31, 2007,
    $5 million of the purchase price has not yet been paid. Of
    the $270 million of acquired intangibles, $96 million
    was ascribed to intangibles subject to amortization with useful
    lives between two and five years and the balance of
    $174 million to non-tax deductible goodwill. Acquired
    intangibles include trademarks, customer lists, and other items
    with weighted average useful lives of four years. The Company
    funded the purchase through additional borrowings under its
    credit facilities. HSW’s content is highly ranked by the
    world’s leading search engines and provides a natural link
    to the Company’s video library. The purchase provides the
    Company with an expanded platform for content, additional ad
    sales outlet, and brand enhancement.

As part of the transaction, Discovery acquired approximately
    49.5% of HSW International, Inc. (“HSWi”) outstanding
    shares, resulting in an investment balance of $79 million.
    Discovery has gained voting rights which are capped at 45% of
    the outstanding votes, three non-controlling board seats and
    certain other governance rights. As a result of its
    noncontrolling interest, the Company has recorded its investment
    in HSWi under the equity method. Discovery will hold
    approximately 77% of these shares over a period of at least one
    to two years. Per terms of the agreement, the Company may
    distribute the HSWi stock or sell and distribute substantially
    all of the proceeds to former HSW shareholders. The Company
    initially recorded a liability of $54 million at closing,
    which represents its estimated obligation to the HSW
    shareholders. The Company has estimated the fair value of its
    investment and associated liability with information from an
    investment bank. The Company will adjust the liability each
    period to fair value through adjustments to earnings. The
    valuation considers forecasted operating results and market
    valuation factors. The estimated liability at December 31,
    2007 is unchanged from December 17, 2007. HSWi has a
    perpetual royalty free license to exploit HSW content in certain
    foreign markets.

On July 31, 2007, the Company acquired Treehugger.com, an
    eco-lifestyle website for $10 million. As of
    December 31, 2007, $2 million of this purchase price
    has not yet been paid. The results of operations have been
    included in the consolidated financial statements since that
    date. The acquisition furthers the Company’s goal of
    developing original programming related to the environment,
    sustainable development, conservation and organic living. The
    Company also has certain contingent considerations in connection
    with this acquisition

payable in the event specific business metrics are achieved
    totaling up to $6 million over two years, which could
    result in the recording of additional goodwill.

Subsequent to the formation of Discovery, the Company acquired
    an additional 5% interest in Animal Planet L.P.
    (“APLP”) from Cox for $37 million. This
    transaction increased the Company’s ownership interest in
    APLP from 80% to 85% and has been recorded as a step
    acquisition. The $37 million has been recorded as brand
    intangibles of $7 million, affiliate relationships of
    $10 million, and goodwill of $20 million. The brand
    intangibles and affiliate relationships will be amortized over
    ten years.

The following table summarizes the combined estimated fair
    values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the
    dates of acquisition in 2007 for HSW, Animal Planet additional
    5% interest and Treehugger.com. The HSW fair value allocation of
    assets and liabilities is preliminary because the acquisition
    closed December 17, 2007 and the fair value determination
    of assets and liabilities are subject to finalization.

During February 2006, DCI acquired 98% of DMAX (formerly known
    as XXP), a free-to-air network in Germany. The results of
    operations have been included in the consolidated financial
    statements since that date. The acquisition of a free-to-air
    network is intended to support strengthening global presence.
    The aggregate purchase price was $60 million primarily in
    cash. Of the $54 million of acquired intangible assets,
    $23 million was assigned to contract-based distribution
    channels subject to amortization with a useful life of
    approximately five years and the remaining balance of
    $31 million to goodwill. During 2007, Discovery acquired
    the remaining 2% in conjunction with the return of purchase
    escrow balances, for a net cash return amount of $8 million.

In March 2006, DCI acquired all of the outstanding common shares
    of Antenna Audio Limited (“Antenna”), a provider of
    audio tours and multimedia at museums and cultural attractions
    around the globe. The results of Antenna’s operations have
    been included in the consolidated financial statements since
    that date. DCI acquired Antenna to facilitate the expansion of
    its Travel brand and media content to other platforms. The
    aggregate purchase price was $65 million, primarily in
    cash. Of the $49 million of acquired intangibles,
    $6 million was assigned to assets subject to amortization
    with useful lives between two and seven years and the balance of
    $43 million to goodwill. Antenna and the Travel Channel had
    been integrated within a single reporting.

In 2006, DCI also acquired the following four entities for a
    total cost of $70 million, which was paid primarily in cash:

•

Petfinder.com, a facilitator of pet adoptions and
    PetsIncredible, a producer and distributor of pet-training
    videos. During 2007, the former owners earned payment of certain
    contingent consideration in connection with this acquisition,
    resulting in the addition of $11 million in goodwill.

DISCONTINUED
    OPERATIONS

Following a comprehensive strategic review of its businesses,
    the Company decided to close its 103 mall based and stand alone
    Discovery Stores (Retail) in the third quarter of 2007. The
    Company will continue to leverage its products through retail
    arrangements and its

e-commerce

platform. As there is no continuing involvement in the retail
    stores or significant migration of retail customers to

e-commerce,

the results of the Retail business are accounted for as
    discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements
    for the periods presented herein, in accordance with Statement
    of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144,

Accounting
    for the Impairment and Disposal of Long-lived Assets

    Goodwill of $12 million and intangible assets of
    $9 million were written-off as a component of amortization
    expense.

Goodwill is not amortized. Trademarks are amortized on a
    straight-line basis over three to ten years. Customer lists are
    amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
    lives of three to seven years. Non-compete assets are amortized
    on a straight-line basis over the contractual term of one to
    seven years. Other intangibles are amortized on a straight-line
    basis over the estimated useful lives of three to ten years. The
    weighted-average amortization period for intangible assets is
    5.1 years.

Amortization of intangible assets, totaled $22 million,

    years as follows: $53 million in 2008, $41 million in
    2009, $37 million in 2010, $20 million in 2011, and

Joint
    Ventures with the BBC

The Company and the BBC have formed several cable and satellite
    television network joint ventures, JVP, a venture to produce and
    acquire factual-based content, and JVN, a venture to provide
    debt funding to these joint ventures.

In addition to its own funding requirements, the Company has
    assumed the BBC funding requirements, giving the Company
    preferential cash distribution with these ventures. The Company
    controls substantially all of the BBC ventures and consolidates
    them accordingly. As the BBC does not have risk of loss, no BBC
    cumulative losses were allocated to minority interest for
    consolidated joint ventures with the BBC, and the Company
    recognizes both its and the BBC’s share of cumulative
    losses in the equity method venture with the BBC. After
    December 31, 2006, JVP obtained a level of cumulative
    profitability. Minority interest expense of $4 million and
    $1 million for the BBC’s share of earnings in JVP was
    recognized from May 15, 2007 through December 31, 2007
    and from January 1, 2007 through May 14, 2007,
    respectively.

Other
    Ventures

The Company is a partner in international joint venture cable
    and satellite television networks. The Company also acquired an
    equity interest in HSWi stock as a result of its acquisition of
    HSW. DCI provided no funding to the equity ventures in 2007 or
    2006. At December 31, 2007, the Company’s maximum
    exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with the equity
    joint ventures is the $47 million investment book value and
    future operating losses, should they occur, of the equity joint
    ventures that the Company is obligated to fund.

In May 2007, Discovery entered into a $1.5 billion seven
    year term loan credit agreement. Borrowings under this agreement
    bear interest at London Interbank Offered Rate
    (“LIBOR”) plus an applicable margin of 2.0% or the
    higher of (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus


/


of 1% or (b) “prime rate” set by Bank of America
    plus an applicable margin of 1.0%. The Company capitalized
    $5 million of deferred financing costs as a result of this
    transaction. At the end of 2007 there was $1.5 billion
    outstanding under the term loan agreement (net of mandatory
    principal repayments) with a weighted average interest rate of
    6.83%. The average interest rate under this credit agreement was
    7.44% for the period May 15, 2007 through December 31,
    2007.

In September 2007, the Company’s United Kingdom subsidiary,
    Discovery Communications Europe Limited (“DCEL”)
    executed a £10 million uncommitted facility to
    supplement working capital requirements. The facility is
    available through August 1, 2008 and is guaranteed by
    Discovery. At December 31, 2007 there was
    £4 million (approximately $9 million) outstanding
    under this facility.

In March 2006, DCEL entered into a €70 million three
    year multicurrency revolving credit agreement (“U.K. credit
    agreement”) which enables the Company to draw Euros and
    British Pounds. In April 2006, the U.K. credit agreement was
    amended and restated to provide for syndication and to increase
    the revolving commitments to €260 million. The Company
    guarantees DCEL’s obligations under the U.K. credit
    agreement. Borrowings under this agreement bear interest at
    LIBOR plus an applicable margin based on the Company’s
    leverage ratios. The cost of the U.K. credit agreement also
    includes a fee on the revolving commitments (ranging from 0.1%
    to 0.3%) based on the Company’s leverage ratio. DCEL
    capitalized £1 million (approximately $1 million)
    of deferred financing costs as a result of this transaction. At
    the end of 2007 there was £48 million (approximately
    U.S. $94 million) outstanding under the multicurrency
    credit agreement with a weighted average interest rate of 6.75%.
    The interest rate averaged 7.05% and 6.42% from May 15,
    2007 through December 31, 2007 and from January 1,
    2007 through May 14, 2007, respectively. The U.K. credit
    agreement matures April 2009.

In March 2006 DCI borrowed additional funds under its
    U.S. Credit Facility (Revolving Loan and Term A) to
    redeem the maturing $300 million Senior Notes. At the end
    of 2007 there was $1.3 billion outstanding
    ($1.0 billion Term A and $338 million Revolving Loan)
    under the facility with a weighted average interest rate of
    5.61%. The amount available under the facility was
    $1.2 billion, net of amounts committed for standby letters
    of credit of $3 million issued. The average interest rate
    under the U.S. Credit Facility was 6.11% and 6.22% from
    May 15, 2007 through December 31, 2007, and from
    January 1, 2007 through May 14, 2007, respectively.
    The Company’s debt agreements have certain restrictions on
    the payment of dividends from subsidiaries.

The Company uses derivative instruments to modify its exposure
    to interest rate fluctuations on its debt. The Term Loans,
    Revolving Facility, and Senior Notes contain covenants that
    require the Company to meet certain financial ratios and place
    restrictions on the payment of dividends, sale of assets,
    borrowing level, mergers, and purchases of capital stock,
    assets, and investments.

Future principal payments under the current debt arrangements,
    excluding obligations under capital leases and other notes
    payable, are as follows: $266 million in 2008,
    $539 million in 2009, $915 million in 2010,
    $235 million in 2011, $340 million in 2012 and
    $1.8 billion thereafter. Of the $266 million of
    principal payments due in 2008, $243 million is excluded
    from the current portion of long-term debt as of
    December 31, 2007 because the Company has the intent and
    ability to refinance its obligations on a long-term basis.

Future minimum payments under capital leases are as follows:
    $9 million in 2008 and 2009, $7 million in 2010,
    $6 million in 2011, $3 million in 2012, and
    $10 million thereafter.

REDEEMABLE
    INTERESTS IN SUBSIDIARIES

Animal
    Planet LP

As of December 31, 2006, one of the DCI’s stockholders
    held 44,000 senior preferred partnership units of Animal Planet
    LP (“APLP”) that had a redemption value of
    $44 million and carried a rate of return ranging from 8.75%
    to 13%. APLP’s senior preferred partnership units were
    called by DCI in January 2007 for $44 million, plus accrued
    interest of $1 million. Preferred returns were recorded as
    a component of interest expense based on a constant rate of
    return of 10.75% through the full term and aggregated
    $5 million in 2006. DCI reversed $5 million of accrued
    interest upon exercise of the call.

People &
    Arts Latin America and Animal Planet Channel Group

The BBC has the right, upon a failure of the People &
    Arts Latin America or the Animal Planet Channel Group (comprised
    of Animal Planet Europe, Animal Planet Asia, and Animal Planet
    Latin America), the Channel Groups, to achieve certain financial
    performance benchmarks to put its interests back to the Company
    for a value determined by a specified formula every three years
    which commenced December 31, 2002. The Company accretes the
    mandatorily redeemable equity in a subsidiary to its estimated
    redemption value through the applicable redemption date. The
    redemption value estimate is based on a contractual formula
    considering the projected results of each network within the
    channel group.

Based on the Company’s calculated performance benchmarks,
    the Company believes the BBC has the right to put their
    interests as of December 2005. The BBC has 90 days
    following the valuation of the Channel Groups by an independent
    appraiser to exercise their right. During 2006 DCI was notified
    that the BBC is evaluating whether to execute their rights under
    the agreement. As of December 31, 2007, the BBC and the
    Company are assigning a valuation firm to formally assess the
    performance benchmarks and the BBC’s right to put. The
    Company has accreted to an estimated redemption value of
    $49 million as of December 31, 2007, based on certain
    estimates and legal interpretations. Changes in these
    assumptions could materially impact current estimates. Accretion
    to the redemption value has been recorded as a component of

Expenses recorded in connection with operating leases, including
    rent expense, for continuing and discontinued operations were
    $91 million, $53 million, and $143 million from
    May 15, 2007 through December 31, 2007, from
    January 1, 2007 through May 14, 2007, and in 2006,
    respectively. Expenses recorded in connection with operating
    leases, including rent expense, for discontinued operations were
    $37 million, $9 million, and $24 million from
    May 15, 2007 through December 31, 2007, from
    January 1, 2007 through May 14, 2007, and in 2006,
    respectively. The Company receives contributions from certain
    landlords to fund leasehold improvements. Such contributions are
    recorded as deferred rent and amortized as reductions to lease
    expense over the lease term. Certain of the Company’s
    leases provide for rental rates that increase or decrease over
    time. The Company recognizes operating lease minimum rentals on
    a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company’s
    deferred rent balance was $24 million at December 31,
    2007. Approximately $7 million of Discovery’s deferred
    rent balance was written off and included in discontinued
    operations following the closure of the retail stores.

Discovery has certain contingent considerations in connection
    with the acquisition of Treehugger.com payable in the event
    specific business metrics are achieved totaling up to
    $6 million over two years (refer to Note 4).

The Company is involved in litigation incidental to the conduct
    of its business. In addition, the Company is involved in
    negotiations with organizations holding the rights to music used
    in the Company’s content. As global music rights societies
    evolve, the Company uses all information available to estimate
    appropriate obligations. During 2005, DCI analyzed its music
    rights reserves and recorded a net reduction to cost of revenue
    of approximately $11 million. The Company believes the
    reserves related to these music rights are adequate and does not
    expect the outcome of such litigation and negotiations to have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s results of
    operations, cash flows, or financial position.

EMPLOYEE
    SAVINGS PLANS

The Company maintains employee savings plans, defined
    contribution savings plans and a supplemental deferred
    compensation plan for certain management employees, together the
    “Savings Plans.” The Company contributions to the
    Savings Plans were $6 million, $6 million, and
    $10 million from May 15, 2007 through
    December 31, 2007, from January 1, 2007 through
    May 14, 2007, and in 2006, respectively.

LONG-TERM
    INCENTIVE PLANS

In October 2005, DCI established a new long-term incentive plan.
    At inception of the plan, eligible participants in one of
    DCI’s previously established long-term incentive plans
    chose to either continue in that plan or to redeem their vested
    units at the December 31, 2004 valuation and receive
    partially vested units in the new plan. Substantially all
    participants in the previously established plan redeemed their
    vested units and received partially vested units in the new
    plan. Certain eligible employees were granted new units in the
    new plan.

Units partially vested in the new plan have vesting similar to
    units in the previously established plan. New units awarded vest
    25% per year. The units in the new plan are indexed to the
    market price of Class A DHC stock. On August 17, 2007,
    the Company amended the plan so that each year 25% of the units
    awarded will expire and the employees will receive a cash
    payment for the increase in value. Prior to the amendment, units
    were paid out every two years over an eight year period. The
    Company has authorized the issuance of up to 32 million
    units under this plan.

Prior to October 2005, DCI maintained two unit-based, long-term
    incentive plans with substantially similar terms. Units were
    awarded to eligible employees following their one-year
    anniversary of hire and vested 25% per year thereafter. Upon
    exercise, participants received the increase in value from the
    date of issuance. The value of the units was based on changes in
    DCI’s value as estimated by an external investment-banking
    firm utilizing a specified formula of DCI business metrics. The
    valuation also included a business group specific discount rate
    and terminal value based on business risk. The intrinsic value
    for unit appreciation had been recorded as compensation expense
    over the period the units were outstanding. In August 2005, DCI
    discontinued one of these plans, which resulted in the full
    vesting and cash redemption of units at the December 31,
    2004 valuation, including a 25% premium on appreciated value.

Upon voluntary termination of employment, the Company
    distributes the intrinsic value of the participant’s vested
    units, if participants agree to comply with post-employment
    obligations for one year in order to receive remaining benefits.
    The Company’s cash disbursements under the new plan
    aggregated $76 million, $8 million and $0 million
    from May 15, 2007 through December 31, 2007, from
    January 1, 2007 through May 14, 2007, and in 2006,
    respectively.

The fair value of the units issued under the new plan has been
    determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The
    expected volatility represents the calculated volatility of the
    DHC stock price over each of the various contractual terms. As a
    result of the limited trading history of the DHC stock, this
    amount for units paid out after two years is determined based on
    an analysis of DHC’s industry peer group over the
    corresponding periods. The weighted average assumptions used in
    this option-pricing model were as follows:

The Company classified as a current liability the entire long
    term incentive plan liability of $141 million. At
    December 31, 2007, there was $137 million of
    unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested units, which
    the Company expects to recognize over a weighted average period
    of 2.4 years. The weighted average remaining years of
    contractual life for outstanding and vested unit awards was 1.48
    and 0.75, respectively, for unit awards outstanding as of
    December 31, 2007. The aggregate intrinsic value of units
    outstanding at December 31, 2007 is $228 million. The
    vested intrinsic value of outstanding units was $94 million
    at December 31, 2007.

The disposal of the Travel Business resulted in a gain of
    $135 million for book purposes, but the transaction was not
    recognized for tax purposes under Internal Revenue Code
    Sections 355 and 368. The transaction also resulted in a
    reduction of the Company’s deferred tax liabilities related
    to the Travel Channel of $54 million.

As of December 31, 2007, the Company has federal operating
    loss carry-forwards of $93 million that begin to expire in
    2021 and state operating loss carry-forwards of
    $297 million in various state jurisdictions available to
    offset future taxable income that expire in various amounts
    through 2025. In 2007, the Company acquired federal operating
    loss carry-forwards of $90 million. The state operating
    loss carry-forwards are subject to a valuation allowance of
    $5 million. The change in the valuation allowance from
    prior year reflects the elimination of fully reserved state
    operating loss carry-forwards upon disposal of the Retail
    business.

Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance
    relating to the state tax benefits attributable to net operating
    losses in certain jurisdictions where realizability is not more
    likely than not.

The Company’s ability to utilize foreign tax credits is
    currently limited by its overall foreign loss under
    Section 904(f) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company
    has no alternative minimum tax credits.

The Company files U.S. federal, state, and foreign income
    tax returns. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer
    subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service
    (“IRS”), state tax authorities, or

non-U.S. tax

authorities for years prior to 2003.

It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized
    tax benefits related to tax positions taken (or expected to be
    taken) on 2006 and 2007

non-U.S. tax

returns could decrease by as much as $33 million within the
    next twelve months as a result of settlement of audit issues

and/or

payment of uncertain tax liabilities, which could impact the
    effective tax rate.

The IRS is not currently examining the Company’s
    consolidated federal income tax return. However, some of the
    Company’s joint ventures are under examination for the 2004
    tax year. The Company does not expect any significant
    adjustments.

As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the Company
    recognized an increase of $36 million in its liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits, which was offset in part by a
    corresponding increase of $31 million in



DISCOVERY
    COMMUNICATIONS HOLDING, LLC

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

deferred tax assets. The remaining $5 million was accounted
    for as a reduction to the January 1, 2007 balance of
    retained earnings. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending
    amount of unrecognized tax benefits (without related interest
    amounts) is as follows:

Included in the balance at December 31, 2007, are
    $10 million of tax positions for which the ultimate
    deductibility is highly certain but for which there is
    uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Because of
    the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and
    penalties, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period
    would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would
    accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an
    earlier period.

FIN 48 requires uncertain tax positions to be recognized
    and presented on a gross basis (i.e., without regard to likely
    offsets for deferred tax assets, deductions,

and/or

credits that would result from payment of uncertain tax
    amounts). On a net basis, the balance at December 31, 2007
    is $45 million (including related interest amounts) after
    offsetting deferred tax assets, deductions,

and/or

credits on the Company’s tax returns.

The Company’s policy is to classify tax interest and
    penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as tax expense.
    Interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits recognized
    was approximately $2 million, $1 million, and
    $1 million from May 15, 2007 through December 31,
    2007, from January 1, 2007 through May 14, 2007, and
    in 2006, respectively. The Company had accrued approximately
    $6 million of total interest payable in the tax accounts as
    of December 31, 2007. Additional interest of
    $1 million was accrued upon adoption of FIN 48 in the
    first quarter of its fiscal year 2007, with a corresponding
    reduction to retained earnings.

17.

FINANCIAL
    INSTRUMENTS

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to modify its
    exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates and
    foreign exchange rates. The Company does not hold or enter into
    financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.

The Company’s interest expense is exposed to movements in
    short-term interest rates. Derivative instruments, including
    both fixed to variable and variable to fixed interest rate
    instruments, are used to modify this exposure. These instruments
    include swaps and swaptions to modify interest rate exposure.
    The variable to fixed interest rate instruments have a notional
    principal amount of $2.3 billion and have a weighted
    average interest rate of 4.68% at December 31, 2007. The
    fixed to variable interest rate agreements have a notional
    principal amount of $225 million and have a weighted
    average interest rate of 9.65% at December 31, 2007. At
    December 31, 2007, the Company held an unexercised interest
    rate swap put with a notional amount of $25 million at a
    fixed rate of 5.44%. As a result of unrealized mark-to-market
    adjustments, ($10) million, $1 million, and
    $10 million in (losses) gains on these instruments were
    recorded from May 15, 2007 through December 31, 2007,
    from January 1, 2007 through May 14, 2007, and in
    2006, respectively.

The fair value of these derivative instruments, which aggregate
    ($50) million at December 31, 2007, is recorded as a
    component of long-term liabilities and other current liabilities
    in the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the fair value of
    these derivative instruments are recorded as a component of
    operating cash flows.

Of the total of $2.3 billion, a notional amount of
    $1.5 billion of these derivative instruments are 100%
    effective cash flow hedges. The value of these hedges at
    December 31, 2007 was ($33) million with changes



DISCOVERY
    COMMUNICATIONS HOLDING, LLC

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

in the mark-to-market value recorded as a component of other
    comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes. Should any portion of
    these instruments become ineffective due to a restructuring in
    the Company’s debt, the monthly changes in fair value would
    be reported as a component of other income on the Statement of
    Operations. The Company does not expect any hedge
    ineffectiveness in the next twelve months.

The foreign exchange instruments used are spot, forward, and
    option contracts. Additionally, the Company enters into
    non-designated forward contracts to hedge non-dollar denominated
    cash flows and foreign currency balances. At December 31,
    2007, the notional amount of foreign exchange derivative
    contracts was $174 million. As a result of unrealized
    mark-to-market adjustments, ($3) million,
    ($1) million, and $2 million in (losses) gains were
    recognized on these instruments from May 15, 2007 through
    December 31, 2007, from January 1, 2007 through
    May 14, 2007, and in 2006, respectively. The fair value of
    these derivative instruments is recorded as a component of
    long-term liabilities and other current liabilities in the
    consolidated balance sheets. These derivative instruments did
    not receive hedge accounting treatment.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, and
    accounts payable approximate their carrying values. Marketable
    equity securities are carried at fair value and fluctuations in
    fair value are recorded through other comprehensive income
    (loss). Losses on investments that are other than temporary
    declines in value are recorded in the statement of operations.

The carrying amount of the Company’s borrowings was
    $4.1 billion and the fair value was $4.2 billion at
    December 31, 2007.

The carrying amount of all derivative instruments represents
    their fair value. The net fair value of the Company’s short
    and long-term derivative instruments is ($51) million at
    December 31, 2007; 4%, 11%, 61%, 23%, and 1% of these
    derivative instrument contracts will expire in 2008, 2009, 2010,
    2011, and thereafter, respectively.

The fair value of derivative contracts was estimated by
    obtaining interest rate and volatility market data from brokers.
    As of December 31, 2007, an estimated 100 basis point
    parallel shift in the interest rate yield curve would change the
    fair value of the Company’s portfolio by approximately
    $45 million.

Credit
    Concentrations

The Company continually monitors its positions with, and the
    credit quality of, the financial institutions that are
    counterparties to its financial instruments and does not
    anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties. In addition,
    the Company limits the amount of investment credit exposure with
    any one institution.

The Company’s trade receivables and investments do not
    represent a significant concentration of credit risk at
    December 31, 2007 due to the wide variety of customers and
    markets in which the Company operates and their dispersion
    across many geographic areas.

RELATED
    PARTY TRANSACTIONS

The Company identifies related parties as investors in their
    consolidated subsidiaries, the Company’s joint venture
    partners and equity investments, and the Company’s
    executive management. Transactions with related parties
    typically result from distribution of networks, production of
    content, or media uplink services. Gross revenue earned from
    related parties was $21 million, $47 million, and
    $90 million from May 15, 2007 through
    December 31, 2007, from January 1, 2007 through
