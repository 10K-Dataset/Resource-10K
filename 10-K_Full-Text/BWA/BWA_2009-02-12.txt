PART I

Item 1.

Business

BorgWarner Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) is a Delaware corporation that was
    incorporated in 1987. We are a leading, global supplier of
    highly engineered automotive systems and components, primarily
    for powertrain applications. Our products help improve vehicle
    performance, fuel efficiency, stability and air quality. These
    products are manufactured and sold worldwide, primarily to
    original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) of
    light-vehicles (passenger cars, sport-utility vehicles, vans and
    light-trucks). The Company’s products are also sold to
    other OEMs of commercial trucks, buses and agricultural and
    off-highway vehicles. We also manufacture and sell our products
    to certain Tier One vehicle systems suppliers and into the
    aftermarket for light and commercial vehicles. The Company
    operates manufacturing facilities serving customers in the
    Americas, Europe and Asia, and is an original equipment supplier
    to every major automotive OEM in the world.

    $676 million in 2006.

Engine

The Engine Group develops products to manage engines for fuel
    efficiency, reduced emissions, and enhanced performance. Concern
    about fuel prices and availability, and the need to lower
    CO


emissions are driving demand for the Company’s products in
    smaller, more efficient gasoline and diesel engines and
    alternative powertrains in hybrid vehicles. Engine Group
    products currently fall into the following major categories:
    turbochargers, chain products, emissions systems, thermal
    systems, diesel cold start and gasoline ignition technology and
    diesel cabin heaters.

The Engine Group provides turbochargers for light-vehicle,
    commercial-vehicle and off-road applications for diesel and
    gasoline engine manufacturers in Europe, North America, South
    America and Asia. The Engine Group has greatly benefited from
    the growth in turbocharger demand in Europe. This growth is
    linked to increasing demand for diesel engines in light vehicles
    which typically use turbochargers and for turbocharged gasoline
    engines. Benefits of turbochargers in both light-vehicle and
    commercial-vehicle applications include increased power for a
    given engine size, improved fuel economy and significantly
    reduced emissions.

Sales of turbochargers for light-vehicles represented
    approximately 24%, 21%, and 18% of the Company’s total
    revenues for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company
    currently supplies light-vehicle turbochargers to many OEMs
    including VW/Audi, Renault, PSA, Daimler, Hyundai, Fiat and BMW.
    The Company also supplies commercial-vehicle turbochargers to
    Caterpillar, John Deere, Daimler, International, Deutz and MAN.



The Company’s newest technologies are its regulated
    two-stage turbocharging system known as
    R2S

®

,

    variable turbine geometry (“VTG”) turbochargers and
    turbochargers for gasoline direct injected engines. In 2006, the
    Company launched a high temperature VTG turbocharger for a
    Porsche 3.6 liter gasoline application, an R2S application for a
    Daimler light-truck called the Sprinter and VTG turbochargers
    for the Hyundai

A-engine

family. In 2007, the Company began supplying its R2S
    turbocharger technology combined with variable turbine geometry
    to International Engine Group’s PowerStroke 6.4-liter V8
    diesel engine used in Ford’s F-Series heavy-duty pickup
    trucks. In 2008, the Company announced the start of production
    of its award winning R2S technology for Daimler’s new 4
    cylinder diesel engine range. The Company also began shipping
    VTG turbochargers for VW’s new common-rail engine range and
    announced the launch of a VTG turbocharger for use with
    low-pressure exhaust gas recirculation to reduce emissions on
    VW’s Jetta Clean Diesel TDI.

The Engine Group also designs and manufactures products to
    control emissions and improve fuel economy. These products
    include electric air pumps, turbo actuators that use integrated
    electronics to precisely control turbocharger speed and pressure
    ratio, and exhaust gas recirculation valves for gasoline and
    diesel applications. The Engine Group also manufactures a wide
    variety of fluid pumps, including engine oil pumps for engine
    and transmission lubrication, and products for engine air intake
    management.

The Engine Group’s chain and chain systems products include
    timing chain and timing drive systems, variable cam timing
    (“VCT”) systems, crankshaft and camshaft sprockets,
    tensioners, guides and snubbers,

HY-VO

®

front-wheel drive (“FWD”) transmission chain and
    four-wheel drive (“4WD”) chain, and MORSE
    GEMINI

®

chain systems for light-vehicle and commercial-vehicle
    applications.

The Company’s timing chain systems are used in Ford’s
    family of overhead cam engines, including the Duratec and
    Modular, and in-line 4 cylinder engines, as well as on
    Chrysler’s 2.7 liter, 3.7 liter and 4.7 liter, overhead cam
    engines, as well as the 4 cylinder World Engine family of
    engines. In addition, the Company provides timing systems to a
    number of Asian OEMs and their North American transplant
    operations, including Honda, Nissan, and Hyundai, and to several
    European OEMs. The Company believes that it is the world’s
    leading manufacturer of timing chain systems.

The Engine Group has successfully launched its latest VCT
    product; Cam Torque
    Actuated

tm

(“CTA”) VCT. VCT is a means of precisely controlling
    the flow of air into and out of an engine by allowing the
    camshaft to be dynamically phased relative to its crankshaft.
    The Company’s CTA technology utilizes camshaft torque as
    its main actuation energy, instead of the conventional
    oil-pressure actuated approach. The CTA system has been launched
    on Ford’s 3.0 liter Duratec engine featured in the Ford
    Escape, Ford Fusion, Mazda 6, and Mercury Mariner.

The Company believes it is the world’s leading manufacturer
    of chain for FWD transmissions and 4WD transfer cases. HY-VO
    chain is used to transfer power from the engine to the
    drivetrain. The Company’s MORSE GEMINI transmission chain
    system emits significantly less chain pitch frequency noise than
    conventional transmission chain systems. The chain in a transfer
    case distributes power between a vehicle’s front and rear
    output shafts which, in turn, provide torque to the front and
    rear wheels.

The Engine Group believes it is a leading global provider of
    engine thermal solutions for truck, agricultural and off-highway
    applications. The group designs, manufactures and markets
    viscous fan drives that control fans to sense and respond to
    multiple cooling requirements. The Engine Group also
    manufactures and markets polymer fans for engine cooling
    systems. The Company’s thermal products provide improved
    vehicle fuel economy and reduced engine emissions while
    minimizing parasitic horsepower loss. The Company has been
    awarded the “standard position” (the OEM-designated
    preferred supplier of component systems available to the
    end-customer) at the major global heavy truck producers.

In 2005, the Company acquired approximately 69.4% of the
    outstanding shares of BERU Aktiengesellschaft
    (“BERU”), headquartered in Ludwigsburg, Germany. In
    2007, the Company increased its ownership to approximately
    82.2%. In the second quarter of 2008, the Company and BERU
    completed a Domination and Profit Transfer Agreement
    (“DPTA”), giving BorgWarner full control of BERU.
    Refer to Note 20, “Recent Transactions” of the
    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of
    this report for further information related to the
    Company’s DPTA agreement with BERU.



As a result of the tendering of shares in 2008 in accordance
    with the DPTA, the Company owns approximately 96% of all
    BERU’s outstanding shares. On January 7, 2009, the
    Company informed BERU of its intention to purchase the remaining
    outstanding shares of approximately 4%, using the required
    German legal process referred to as a

“squeeze-out”

to complete the 100% ownership.

BERU’s operating results are included within the
    Company’s Engine Group segment. BERU is a leading global
    automotive supplier of diesel cold starting technology (glow
    plugs and instant starting systems); gasoline ignition
    technology (spark plugs and ignition coils); and electronic
    control units and sensor technology (tire pressure sensors,
    diesel cabin heaters and selected sensors). In 2008, BERU
    launched its new Pressure Sensor Glow Plug with which the
    combustion processes of a diesel engine allowing the lowest
    CO


and

emissions possible.

Drivetrain

The Drivetrain Group leverages the Company’s expertise in
    clutching and control systems to enable efficient transmission
    of engine torque through the vehicle drivetrain and management
    of torque distribution to the driven wheels. The Company’s
    technology can improve fuel efficiency and help reduce emissions
    in all types of powertrains. The Drivetrain Group’s major
    products are transmission components and systems, and AWD torque
    management systems.

The Drivetrain Group designs and manufactures automatic
    transmission components and modules and is a supplier to
    virtually every major automatic transmission manufacturer in the
    world for both conventional automatic and new dual-clutch
    transmissions (“DCT”).

“Shift quality” products are provided in four
    principal categories. DCT products include dual-clutch modules,
    torsional vibration dampers and mechatronic control modules.
    Friction products include friction plates, transmission bands,
    torque converter clutches, and friction clutch modules.

One-way clutches and torsional vibration dampers are mechanical
    products. The controls products line features electro-hydraulic
    solenoids, solenoid modules and high pressure solenoids for
    automated manual transmissions (“AMT”s).

The Company’s 50%-owned joint venture in Japan, NSK-Warner
    Kabushiki Kaisha (“NSK-Warner”), is a leading producer
    of friction plates and one-way clutches in Japan. NSK-Warner is
    also the joint venture partner with a 40% interest in the
    Drivetrain Group’s Korean subsidiary, BorgWarner
    Transmission Systems Korea, Inc.

The Company has led the globalization of today’s DCT
    technology for over ten years. Following the development of its
    DCT technology in the 1990s, the Company established its
    industry-leading position in Europe in 2003 with the production
    launch of its award-winning
    DualTronic

®

innovations with VW/Audi. In 2006, the Company was awarded the
    first dual-clutch program in China with SAIC. In 2007, the
    Company launched its first dual-clutch technology application in
    a Japanese transmission with Nissan.

The Company has announced programs with customers that include
    VW, Audi, Bugatti, SAIC and Nissan, in addition to Getrag DCT
    programs with five additional global automakers. Also, the
    Company is working on over 20 programs with OEMs around the
    world. BorgWarner DualTronic technology provides both better
    fuel-efficiency and a great driving experience, enabling a
    conventional, manual gearbox to function as a fully automatic
    transmission by eliminating the interruption in power flow that
    occurs when a single clutch manual transmission shifts gears.

In conventional automatic transmissions, there has been a global
    market trend from four and five speeds to six, seven, and even
    eight speed transmissions. Transmissions with more speeds
    improve fuel economy and vehicle performance and offer growth
    opportunities.

In 2006 the Drivetrain Group acquired the high-pressure solenoid
    product lines of Eaton Corporation. Among these solenoids are
    those used in AMTs. AMTs are a growing niche of the entry-level
    city-car and light commercial-vehicle segments in Europe and
    some Asian markets. High pressure control systems are also
    serving a growing share of the DCT market segment.



The Drivetrain Group’s torque management products include
    rear-wheel drive (“RWD”)/all-wheel drive
    (“AWD”) transfer case systems, FWD/AWD electromagnetic
    coupling systems and advanced products. The Company’s focus
    is on electronically controlled (active) torque management
    devices and systems for their vehicle dynamics, fuel economy and
    stability benefits. Additional torque management products
    include synchronizer rings and systems for application in
    manual, automated manual and DCT.

Transfer cases are installed primarily on light-trucks,
    sport-utility vehicles (“SUV”s), rear-wheel drive
    based cross-over utility vehicles (“CUV”s) and
    passenger cars. A transfer case attaches to the transmission and
    distributes torque to the front and rear axles improving vehicle
    traction and stability in dynamic driving conditions. Sales of
    rear-wheel drive based transfer cases and components have
    declined to approximately 7%, 9% and 10% of the Company’s
    total revenues for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The Company is involved in the FWD/AWD market with
    electromagnetic couplings that use electronically controlled
    clutches to distribute power to the rear wheels instantly as
    traction is required.
    NexTrac

®

is our latest product innovation that produces outstanding
    stability and traction while promoting better fuel economy.
    NexTrac launched in 2008 on the Hyundai Santa Fe, Tucson
    and KIA Sportage.

With the trend toward vehicle electrification gaining momentum,
    the Company is also applying its years of expertise to deliver
    robust and highly efficient single and multiple speed electric
    gear reduction solutions for hybrids and electric vehicles.

Joint
    Ventures

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had 10 joint ventures
    in which it had a less-than-100% ownership interest. Results
    from the six ventures in which the Company is the majority owner
    are consolidated as part of the Company’s results. Results
    from the four ventures in which the Company’s effective
    ownership interest is 50% or less, were reported by the Company
    using the equity method of accounting.

Management of the unconsolidated joint ventures is shared with

Financial
    Information About Geographic Areas

Refer to Note 21, “Reporting Segments and Related
    Information” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this report for financial
    information about geographic areas.

Approximately 72% of the Company’s consolidated sales for
    2008 were outside the United States, including exports. However,
    a portion of such sales was to OEMs headquartered outside the
    United States that produce vehicles that are, in turn, exported
    to the United States.

Customers

Approximately 72% of the Company’s total sales in 2008 were
    for light-vehicle applications, with the remaining 28% of the
    Company’s sales to a diversified group of commercial truck,
    bus, construction and agricultural vehicle manufacturers, and to
    distributors of aftermarket replacement parts.

For the most recent three-year period, the Company’s
    worldwide sales to the following customers were approximately as
    follows:

Customer




Volkswagen

%

Daimler


%


%


%

Daimler divested Chrysler in 2007. No other single customer
    accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated sales in any
    year of the periods presented.

The Company’s automotive products are generally sold
    directly to OEMs substantially pursuant to negotiated annual
    contracts, long-term supply agreements or terms and conditions
    as may be modified by the parties. Deliveries are subject to
    periodic authorizations based upon the production schedules of
    the OEMs. The Company typically ships its products directly from
    its plants to the OEMs.

Sales and
    Marketing

Each of the Company’s business units within its two
    reporting segments has its own sales function. Account
    executives for each of our business units are assigned to serve
    specific OEM customers for one or more of a business unit’s
    products. Our account executives spend the majority of their
    time in direct contact with OEM purchasing and engineering
    employees and are responsible for servicing existing business
    and for identifying and obtaining new business. Because of their
    close relationship with OEMs, account executives are able to
    identify and meet customers’ needs based upon their
    knowledge of our customer’s needs and our products and
    design and manufacturing capabilities. Upon securing a new
    order, account executives participate in product launch team
    activities and serve as a key interface with the customers.



In addition, the sales and marketing employees of our Engine
    segment and Drivetrain segment often work together to explore
    cross-development opportunities for the business units. The
    development of DualTronic, the Company’s wet-clutch and
    control-system technology for a new-concept automated
    transmission, is an example of a successful collaboration.

Seasonality

The Company’s business is moderately seasonal because the
    Company’s largest North American customers typically halt
    vehicle production for approximately two weeks in July and one
    week in December. Additionally, customers in Europe and Asia
    typically shut down vehicle production during portions of July
    or August and one week in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, the
    Company’s third and fourth quarters may reflect those
    practices.

Research
    and Development

The Company conducts advanced engine and drivetrain research at
    the segment level. This advanced engineering function looks to
    leverage electronics and the Company’s expertise across
    product lines to create new engine and drivetrain systems and
    modules that can be commercialized. A venture capital fund that
    was created by the Company as seed money for new innovation and
    collaboration across businesses is managed by this function.

In addition, each of the Company’s operating segments has
    its own research and development (“R&D”)
    organization. The Company has approximately 800 employees,
    including engineers, mechanics and technicians, engaged in
    R&D activities at facilities worldwide. The Company also
    operates testing facilities such as prototype, measurement and
    calibration, life cycle testing and dynamometer laboratories.

By working closely with the OEMs and anticipating their future
    product needs, the Company’s R&D personnel conceive,
    design, develop and manufacture new proprietary automotive
    components and systems. R&D personnel also work to improve
    current products and production processes. The Company believes
    its commitment to R&D will allow it to obtain new orders
    from its OEM customers.

The following table presents the Company’s gross and net
    expenditures on R&D activities:

    Consolidated Statements of Operations. Customer reimbursements
    are netted against gross R&D expenditures upon billing of
    services performed. The Company has contracts with several
    customers at the Company’s various R&D locations. No
    such contract exceeded $6.0 million in any of the years
    presented.

Patents
    and Licenses

The Company has approximately 3,800 active domestic and foreign
    patents and patent applications pending or under preparation,
    and receives royalties from licensing patent rights to others.
    While it considers its patents on the whole to be important, the
    Company does not consider any single patent, any group of
    related patents or any single license essential to its
    operations in the aggregate or to the operations of any of the
    Company’s business groups individually. The expiration of
    the patents individually and in the aggregate is not expected to
    have a material effect on the Company’s financial position
    or future operating results. The Company owns numerous
    trademarks, some of which are valuable, but none of which are
    essential to its business in the aggregate.

The Company owns the “BorgWarner” and
    “Borg-Warner Automotive” trade names and housemarks,
    and variations thereof, which are material to the Company’s
    business.



Competition

The Company’s operating segments compete worldwide with a
    number of other manufacturers and distributors which produce and
    sell similar products. Many of these competitors are larger and
    have greater resources than the Company. Price, quality,
    delivery, technological innovation, application engineering
    development and program launch support are the primary elements
    of competition.

The Company’s major competitors by product type follow:

Product Type: Engine

Name of Competitor

Turbochargers:

Honeywell

IHI

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI)

Schaeffler Group

In addition, a number of the Company’s major OEM customers
    manufacture, for their own use and for others, products which
    compete with the Company’s products. Although these OEM
    customers have indicated that they will continue to rely on
    outside suppliers, the OEMs could elect to manufacture products
    to meet their own requirements or to compete with the Company.
    There can be no assurance that the Company’s business will
    not be adversely affected by increased competition in the
    markets in which it operates.

For many of its products, the Company’s competitors include
    suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic
    advantages such as lower labor costs, lower health care costs
    and, in some cases, export subsidies

and/or

raw
    materials subsidies. Also, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Employees

As of December 31, 2008, the Company and its consolidated
    subsidiaries had approximately 13,800 salaried and hourly
    employees (as compared with approximately 17,700 employees
    at December 31, 2007), of which approximately 4,100 were
    U.S. employees. Approximately 13% of the Company’s
    U.S. workforce is unionized. The hourly employees at
    certain of our international facilities are also unionized. The
    Company believes its present relations with employees to be
    satisfactory.



Our two domestic collective bargaining agreements are for our
    Muncie, Indiana plant and our Ithaca and Cortland, New York
    facilities. The Muncie agreement expires on April 24, 2009.
    The agreement covering the New York facilities expires in
    September 2012.

Raw
    Materials

Continuing a trend which began in 2004, several raw materials
    used in the Company’s products hit record pricing levels in
    the second quarter of 2008, including steel, aluminum, copper,
    resins and certain alloying elements. This was due to a host of
    supply and demand factors.

Despite these challenges, the Company used a variety of tactics
    in order to limit the impact of inflationary prices and supply
    shortages. The Company formed a global procurement organization
    to accelerate: cost reductions, purchases from lower cost
    regions, risk mitigation efforts, and collaborative buying
    activities. In addition, the Company used long-term contracts,
    cost sharing arrangements, design changes, customer buy
    programs, and hedging instruments to help control costs. The
    Company intends to use similar measures in 2009 and beyond.
    Refer to Note 11, “Financial Instruments” of the
    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of
    this report for information related to the Company’s
    hedging activities.

For 2009, the Company believes that its supplies of raw
    materials and energy are adequate and available from multiple
    sources to support its manufacturing requirements. Manufacturing
    operations for each of the Company’s operating segments are
    dependent upon natural gas, fuel oil, and electricity.

Environmental
    Regulation and Proceedings

The Company and certain of its current and former direct and
    indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have
    been identified by the United States Environmental Protection
    Agency and certain state environmental agencies and private
    parties as potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) at
    various hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive
    Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
    (“Superfund”) and equivalent state laws and, as such,
    may presently be liable for the cost of

clean-up

and
    other remedial activities at 35 such sites. Responsibility for

clean-up

and
    other remedial activities at a Superfund site is typically
    shared among PRPs based on an allocation formula.

The Company believes that none of these matters, individually or
    in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its
    results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
    Generally, this is because either the estimates of the maximum
    potential liability at a site are not large or the liability
    will be shared with other PRPs, although no assurance can be
    given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter.

Based on information available to the Company (which in most
    cases includes: an estimate of allocation of liability among
    PRPs; the probability that other PRPs, many of whom are large,
    solvent public companies, will fully pay the cost apportioned to
    them; currently available information from PRPs

and/or

federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of
    contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs;
    remediation alternatives; and estimated legal fees), the Company
    has established an accrual for indicated environmental
    liabilities with a balance at December 31, 2008 of
    $11.9 million. The Company has accrued amounts that do not
    exceed $3.4 million related to any individual site and we
    do not believe that the costs related to any of these sites will
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of
    operations, cash flows or financial condition. The Company
    expects to pay out substantially all of the amounts accrued for
    environmental liability over the next three to five years.

In connection with the sale of Kuhlman Electric Corporation, the
    Company agreed to indemnify the buyer and Kuhlman Electric for
    certain environmental liabilities, then unknown to the Company,
    relating to certain operations of Kuhlman Electric that pre-date
    the Company’s 1999 acquisition of Kuhlman Electric. During
    2000, Kuhlman Electric notified the Company that it discovered
    potential environmental contamination at its Crystal Springs,
    Mississippi plant while undertaking an expansion of the plant.
    The Company is continuing to work with the Mississippi
    Department of Environmental Quality and Kuhlman Electric to
    investigate and remediate to the extent necessary, historical
    contamination at the plant and surrounding area. Kuhlman
    Electric and others, including the Company, were sued in
    numerous related lawsuits, in which multiple claimants alleged



personal injury and property damage. In 2005, the Company and
    other defendants entered into settlements that resolved
    approximately 99% of the then known personal injury and property
    damage claims relating to the alleged environmental
    contamination. Those settlements involved payments by the
    Company of $28.5 million in the second half of 2005 and
    $15.7 million in the first quarter of 2006, in exchange
    for, among other things, dismissal with prejudice of these
    lawsuits.

In December 2007, a lawsuit was filed against Kuhlman Electric
    and others, including the Company, on behalf of approximately
    209 plaintiffs, alleging personal injury relating to the alleged
    environmental contamination. In August 2008, two similar
    lawsuits were filed against Kuhlman Electric and others,
    including the Company, on behalf of approximately 100 plaintiffs
    and 30 plaintiffs, respectively, alleging personal injury
    related to the alleged environmental contamination. Given the
    early stage of the litigation, the Company cannot make any
    predictions as to the outcome, but its current intent is to
    vigorously defend against the suits.

Conditional
    Asset Retirement Obligations

In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47,
    Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
    Obligations — an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 143 (“FIN 47”), which requires the
    Company to recognize legal obligations to perform asset
    retirements in which the timing

and/or

method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may
    or may not be within the control of the entity. Certain
    government regulations require the removal and disposal of
    asbestos from an existing facility at the time the facility
    undergoes major renovations or is demolished. The liability
    exists because the facility will not last forever, but it is
    conditional on future renovations (even if there are no
    immediate plans to remove the materials, which pose no health or
    safety hazard in their current condition). Similarly, government
    regulations require the removal or closure of underground
    storage tanks (“USTs”) and above ground storage tanks
    (“ASTs”) when their use ceases, the disposal of
    polychlorinated biphenyl (“PCB”) transformers and
    capacitors when their use ceases, and the disposal of used
    furnace bricks and liners, and lead-based paint in conjunction
    with facility renovations or demolition. The Company currently
    has 32 manufacturing locations that have been identified as
    containing these items. The fair value to remove and dispose of
    this material has been estimated and recorded at
    $1.4 million as of December 31, 2008 and
    $1.0 million as of December 31, 2007.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

The following risk factors and other information included in
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

should be considered. The risks and uncertainties described
    below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and
    uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently
    deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. If any
    of the following risks occur, our business including its
    financial performance, financial condition, operating results
    and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

Our
    industry is cyclical and our results of operations will be
    adversely affected by industry downturns.

Automotive and truck production and sales are cyclical and
    sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors
    including interest rates, consumer credit, and consumer spending
    and preferences. Further economic decline that results in
    further significant reduction in automotive or truck production
    would have a material adverse effect on our sales to original
    equipment manufacturers.

We have initiated steps to realign and resize our production
    capacity and cost structure to meet current and projected
    operational and market requirements. Further significant
    declines in the automotive industry and financial declines and
    restructurings by our significant customers may make it
    necessary to take further restructuring actions and charges.

We are
    dependent on market segments that use our key products and would
    be affected by decreasing demand in those
    segments.

Some of our products, in particular turbochargers, are currently
    used primarily in diesel passenger cars and commercial vehicles.
    Any significant reduction in production in these market segments
    or loss of business in these market segments could have a
    material adverse effect on our sales to original equipment
    manufacturers.

We
    face strong competition.

We compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and
    distributors that produce and sell products similar to ours.
    Price, quality and technological innovation are the primary
    elements of competition. Our competitors include vertically
    integrated units of our major original equipment manufacturer
    customers, as well as a large number of independent domestic and
    international suppliers. We are not as large as a number of
    these companies and do not have as many financial or other
    resources. The competitive environment has changed dramatically
    over the past few years as our traditional U.S. original
    equipment manufacturer customers, faced with intense
    international competition, have expanded their worldwide
    sourcing of components. As a result, we have experienced
    competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that
    enjoy economic advantages, such as lower labor costs, lower
    health care costs and, in some cases, export or raw materials
    subsidies. Increased competition could adversely affect our
    businesses.



We are
    under substantial pressure from original equipment manufacturers
    to reduce the prices of our products.

There is substantial and continuing pressure on original
    equipment manufacturers to reduce costs, including costs of
    products we supply. Although original equipment manufacturers
    have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside
    suppliers, a number of our major original equipment manufacturer
    customers manufacture products for their own uses that directly
    compete with our products. These original equipment
    manufacturers could elect to manufacture such products for their
    own uses in place of the products we currently supply. We
    believe that our ability to develop proprietary new products and
    to control our costs will allow us to remain competitive.
    However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to improve or
    maintain our gross margins on product sales to original
    equipment manufacturers or that the recent trend by original
    equipment manufacturers towards increased outsourcing will
    continue.

Annual price reductions to original equipment manufacturer
    customers appear to have become a permanent feature of our
    business environment. To maintain our profit margins, we seek
    price reductions from our suppliers, improve production
    processes to increase manufacturing efficiency, update product
    designs to reduce costs and develop new products, the benefits
    of which support stable or increased prices. Our ability to pass
    through increased raw material costs to our original equipment
    manufacturer customers is limited, with cost recovery often less
    than 100% and often on a delayed basis. We cannot assure you
    that we will be able to reduce costs in an amount equal to
    annual price reductions and increases in raw material costs.

We are
    sensitive to the effects of our major customers’ labor
    relations.

All three of our primary North American customers, Ford,
    Chrysler and General Motors, have major union contracts with the
    United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers
    of America. Because of domestic original equipment
    manufacturers’ dependence on a single union, we are
    affected by labor difficulties and work stoppages at original
    equipment manufacturers’ facilities. Similarly, a majority
    of our global customers’ operations outside of North
    America are also represented by various unions. Any extended
    work stoppage could have an adverse effect on our business.

Part
    of our labor force is unionized which could subject us to work
    stoppages.

As of December 31, 2008, approximately 13% of our
    U.S. workforce was unionized. Our two domestic collective
    bargaining agreements are for our Muncie, Indiana plant and our
    Ithaca and Cortland, New York facilities. The Muncie agreement
    expires on April 24, 2009. The agreement covering the New
    York facilities expires in September 2012. The hourly employees
    at certain of our international facilities are also unionized.
    While we believe that our relations with our employees are
    satisfactory, a prolonged dispute with our employees could have
    an adverse effect on our business.

We are
    subject to extensive environmental regulations.

Our operations are subject to laws governing, among other
    things, emissions to air, discharges to waters and the
    generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and
    disposal of waste and other materials. We believe that our
    business, operations and activities have been and are being
    operated in compliance in all material respects with applicable
    environmental, health and safety laws. However, the operation of
    automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in these
    areas, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur material
    costs or liabilities as a result. Furthermore, through various
    acquisitions over the years, we have acquired a number of
    manufacturing facilities, and we cannot assure you that we will
    not incur materials costs and liabilities relating to activities
    that predate our ownership. In addition, potentially significant
    expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving
    environmental, health and safety laws that may be adopted in the
    future.



We
    have contingent liabilities related to environmental, product
    warranties, regulatory matters, litigation and other
    claims.

We and certain of our current and former direct and indirect
    corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have been
    identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency
    and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as
    potentially responsible parties at various hazardous waste
    disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
    Compensation and Liability Act and equivalent state laws. As a
    result, as of December 31, 2008, we may be liable for the
    cost of

clean-up

and
    other remedial activities at 35 of these sites.

We work with outside experts to determine a range of potential
    liability for environmental sites. The ranges for each
    individual site are then aggregated into a loss range for the
    total accrued liability. Management’s estimate of the loss
    range for environmental liability, including conditional asset
    retirement obligations, for 2008 is between $12.4 million
    and $26.1 million. We record an accrual at the most
    probable amount within the range unless one cannot be
    determined; in which case we record the accrual at the low end
    of the range. Based on information available to us, we have
    established an accrual in our financial statements for indicated
    environmental liabilities, including our conditional asset
    retirement obligation under FIN 47, with a total balance of
    $1.4 million at December 31, 2008. We currently expect
    the substantial portion of this amount to be expended over the
    next three to five years.

We provide warranties to our customers for some of our products.
    Under these warranties, we may be required to bear costs and
    expenses for the repair or replacement of these products. We
    cannot assure you that costs and expenses associated with these
    product warranties will not be material, or that those costs
    will not exceed any amounts accrued for such warranties in our
    financial statement. Based upon information available to us, we
    have established an accrual in our financial statements for
    product warranties of $82.1 million at December 31,
    2008.

We are also party to, or have an obligation to defend a party
    to, various legal proceedings, including those described in
    Note 15 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in the Company’s Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

We are currently, and may in the future become, subject to legal
    proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes. These claims
    typically arise in the normal course of business and may
    include, but not be limited to, commercial or contractual
    disputes with our suppliers, intellectual property matters and
    employment claims. There is a possibility that such claims may
    have an adverse impact on our business that is greater than we
    anticipate.

Our
    growth strategy may prove unsuccessful.

We have a stated goal of increasing revenues and operating
    revenues at a rate greater than global vehicle production by
    increasing content per vehicle with innovative new components
    and through select acquisitions. We may not meet our goal
    because of any of the following: (a) the failure to develop
    new products which will be purchased by our customers;
    (b) technology changes rendering our products obsolete;
    (c) a reversal of the trend of supplying systems (which
    allows us to increase content per vehicle) instead of
    components; and (d) the failure to find suitable
    acquisition targets or the failure to integrate operations of
    acquired businesses quickly and cost effectively.

We are
    subject to risks related to our international
    operations.

We have manufacturing and technical facilities in many regions
    and countries, including North America, Europe, China, India,
    South Korea, Japan, and Brazil and sell our products worldwide.
    For 2008, approximately 68% of our sales were outside North
    America. Consequently, our results could be affected by changes
    in trade, monetary and fiscal policies, trade restrictions or
    prohibitions, import or other charges or taxes, and fluctuations
    in foreign currency exchange rates, limitations on the
    repatriation of funds changing economic conditions, social
    unrest, political instability and disputes, and international
    terrorism. Compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting
    laws and regulations of various countries is burdensome and
    expensive. See Note 21, “Reporting



Segments and Related Information” to Consolidated Financial
    Statements in the Company’s Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

We may
    not realize sales represented by awarded business.

We base our growth projections, in part, on commitments made by
    our customers. These commitments generally renew yearly during a
    program life cycle. If actual production orders from our
    customers do not approximate such commitments, it could
    adversely affect our business.

We are
    impacted by the rising cost of providing pension and other post
    employment benefits.

The automotive industry, like other industries, continues to be
    impacted by the rising cost of providing pension and other post
    employment benefits. To partially address this impact, we
    announced adjustments to certain retiree medical and pension
    plans to be effective January 1, 2009. See Note 12,
    “Retirement Benefit Plans” to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements in the Company’s Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Certain
    defined benefit pension plans we sponsor are currently
    underfunded.

We sponsor certain defined benefit pension plans worldwide that
    are underfunded and will require cash payments. Additionally, if
    the performance of the assets in our pension plans does not meet
    our expectations, or if other actuarial assumptions are
    modified, our required contributions may be higher than we
    expect. See Note 12, “Retirement Benefit Plans”
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company’s
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Negative
    or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our
    business.

Adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial
    outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to
    changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets
    and other tax accruals that could adversely affect our financial
    performance.

Additionally, we are subject to tax audits by governmental
    authorities in the U.S. and numerous

non-U.S. jurisdictions.

Because the results of tax audits are inherently uncertain,
    negative or unexpected results from one or more such tax audits
    could adversely affect our business.

We
    rely on sales to major customers.

We rely on sales to original equipment manufacturers around the
    world. Supply to several of these customers requires significant
    investment by the Company in working capital, plant and
    equipment. Some of our customers are rated by the credit rating
    agencies as below investment grade. The loss of sales to a major
    customer, due to any of a variety of factors including
    non-renewal of purchase orders, the customer’s financial
    hardship or other unforeseen reasons, could adversely affect our
    business.

Furthermore, some of our sales are concentrated. Our worldwide
    sales in 2008 to Volkswagen and Ford constituted approximately
    19% and 9%, respectively, of our 2008 consolidated sales.

Suppliers’
    economic distress could result in the disruption of our
    operations and have a material effect on our
    business.

Unfavorable industry conditions such as lower production
    volumes; credit tightness; changes in foreign currencies; raw
    material, commodity, transportation, and energy price
    escalation; drastic changes in consumer preferences; and others
    could adversely affect our supply chain, and sometimes with
    little advanced notice. These conditions could also result in
    increased commercial disputes and supply interruption risks. In
    certain instances, it would be difficult and expensive for us to
    change suppliers that are critical to our business. On occasion,
    we must provide financial support to distressed suppliers or
    take other measures to protect our supply lines. While we have
    taken definite actions to mitigate these factors, we can not
    predict with certainty the potential adverse effects these costs
    might have on our business.



We
    continue to face highly volatile commodity costs used in the
    production of our products.

The Company uses a variety of commodities (including steel,
    nickel, copper, aluminum, plastic resins, other raw materials
    and energy) and materials purchased in various forms such as
    castings, powder metal, forgings, stampings, and bar stock.
    Increasing commodity costs will have an impact on our results.
    We have sought to alleviate the impact of increasing costs by
    selectively hedging certain commodity exposures or by including
    a material pass-through provision in our customer contracts
    wherever possible. Customers frequently challenge these
    contractual provisions and rarely pay the full cost of any
    materials increases. The continuation of this practice would
    adversely affect our business.

From time to time, commodity prices may also fall rapidly. When
    this happens, suppliers may withdraw capacity from the market
    until prices improve which may cause periodic supply
    interruptions. The same may be true of our transportation
    carriers and energy providers.

We
    could be adversely affected by supply shortages of components
    from our suppliers.

In an effort to manage and reduce the cost of purchased goods
    and services, we have been rationalizing our supply base. As a
    result, we are dependent on fewer sources of supply for certain
    components used in the manufacture of our products. The Company
    selects suppliers based on total value (including total landed
    price, quality, delivery, and technology), taking into
    consideration their production capacities and financial
    condition. We expect that they will deliver to our stated
    written expectations.

However, there can be no assurance that capacity limitations,
    labor unrest, weather emergencies, commercial disputes,
    government actions, riots, wars, sabotage, non-conforming parts,
    acts of terrorism, “Acts of God”, or other problems
    experienced by our suppliers will not result in occasional
    shortages or delays in their supply of components to us. If we
    were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of
    critical components from any of our suppliers and could not
    procure the components from other sources, we would be unable to
    meet the production schedules for some of our key products and
    could miss customer delivery expectations. This would adversely
    affect our customer relations and business.

A
    downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability
    to access the debt capital markets.

Changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt
    may ultimately impact our access to the debt capital markets and
    the costs we incur to borrow funds. If ratings for our debt fall
    below investment grade, our access to the debt capital markets
    would become restricted. The tightening in the credit markets
    and the low level of liquidity in many financial markets due to
    the current turmoil in the financial and banking industries
    could also affect our access to the debt capital markets. In the
    event the Company is unable to access the debt capital markets,
    we would have the ability to draw on our $600 million
    revolving credit facility; however, this agreement is scheduled
    to expire July 22, 2009.

Additionally, our revolving credit agreement includes an
    increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are
    downgraded. Further, an increase in the level of our
    indebtedness and related interest costs may increase our
    vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry
    conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional
    financing.

Conditions
    in the automotive industry may adversely affect our
    business.

Our financial performance depends on conditions in the global
    automotive industry. Ford Motor Company, General Motors
    Corporation and Chrysler LLP (collectively “the Detroit
    3”) have experienced declining market shares and are
    burdened with significant structural costs that have affected
    their profitability and labor relations and may ultimately
    result in severe financial difficulty, including possible
    bankruptcy. If the Detroit 3 cannot fund their operations or if
    major customers reach similar levels of financial distress we
    may incur significant write-offs of accounts receivable, incur
    impairment charges or require additional restructuring actions
    beyond those already taken. Automakers across Europe are also
    experiencing difficulties from a weakened economy and tightening
    credit markets. If our customers reduce their orders to us, it
    would adversely affect our results of operations. A prolonged
    downturn in the North American or European automotive industries
    or a significant



product mix shift due to consumer demand could require us to
    shut down plants or incur impairment charges. Continued
    uncertainty relating to the financial condition of the Detroit 3
    and other automakers would have a negative impact on our
    business.

We are
    subject to possible insolvency of financial
    counterparties.

The Company engages in numerous financial transactions and
    contracts including insurance policies, letters of credit,
    credit line agreements, financial derivatives, and investment
    management agreements involving various counterparties. The
    Company is subject to the risk that one or more of these
    counterparties may become insolvent and therefore be unable to
    discharge its obligations under such contracts.

We are
    subject to possible insolvency of outsourced service
    providers.

The Company relies on third party service providers for
    administration of workers’ compensation claims, health care
    benefits, pension benefits, stockholder and bondholder
    registration and similar services. These service providers
    contribute to the efficient conduct of the Company’s
    business, so the Company could be adversely affected in the
    event of insolvency of one or more of these service providers.

A
    variety of other factors could adversely affect our
    business.

Any of the following could materially and adversely affect our
    business: the loss of or changes in supply contracts or sourcing
    strategies of our major customers or suppliers; start—up
    expenses associated with new vehicle programs or delays or
    cancellation of such programs, underutilization of our
    manufacturing facilities, which can be dependent on a single
    product line or customer; inability to recover engineering and
    tooling costs; market and financial consequences of recalls that
    may be required on products we supplied; delays or difficulties
    in new product development; the possible introduction of similar
    or superior technologies by others; and global overcapacity and
    vehicle platform proliferation.

Item 1B.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

The Company is subject to a number of claims and judicial and
    administrative proceedings (some of which involve substantial
    amounts) arising out of the Company’s business or relating
    to matters for which the Company may have a contractual
    indemnity obligation. Refer to Note 15,
    “Contingencies” of the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for a
    discussion of environmental, asbestos and other litigation.



In January 2006, BorgWarner Diversified Transmission Products
    Inc (“DTP”), a subsidiary of the Company, filed a
    declaratory judgment action in United States District Court,
    Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis Division) against the
    United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implements
    Workers of America (“UAW”) Local No. 287 and
    Gerald Poor, individually and as the representative of a
    defendant class. DTP sought the Court’s affirmation that
    DTP did not violate the Labor-Management Relations Act or the
    Employee Retirement Income Security Act by unilaterally amending
    certain medical plans effective April 1, 2006 and
    October 1, 2006, prior to the expiration of the current
    collective bargaining agreements. On September 10, 2008,
    the Court found that DTP’s reservation of the right to make
    such amendments reducing the level of benefits provided to
    retirees was limited by its collectively bargained health
    insurance agreement with the UAW, which does not expire until
    April 24, 2009. Thus, the amendments were untimely. In 2008
    the Company recorded a charge of $4.0 million as a result
    of the Court’s decision.

The Company has communicated its plan to reduce the level of
    benefits provided to the retirees to make them comparable to
    other Company retiree benefit plans. The change will be
    effective following expiration of the health insurance agreement
    in April 24, 2009.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

INTRODUCTION

BorgWarner Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) is a leading global supplier of highly
    engineered systems and components primarily for powertrain
    applications. Our products help improve vehicle performance,
    fuel efficiency, air quality and vehicle stability. They are
    manufactured and sold worldwide, primarily to original equipment
    manufacturers (“OEMs”) of light vehicles (i.e.
    passenger cars, sport-utility vehicles (“SUVs”),
    cross-over vehicles, vans and light trucks). Our products are
    also manufactured and sold to OEMs of commercial trucks, buses
    and agricultural and off-highway vehicles. We also manufacture
    for and sell our products to certain Tier One vehicle
    systems suppliers and into the aftermarket for light and
    commercial vehicles. We operate manufacturing facilities serving
    customers in the Americas, Europe and Asia, and are an original
    equipment supplier to every major automaker in the world.

The Company’s products fall into two reporting segments:
    Engine and Drivetrain. The Engine segment’s products
    include turbochargers, timing chain systems, air management,
    emissions systems, thermal systems, as well as diesel and gas
    ignition systems. The Drivetrain segment’s products include
    all-wheel drive transfer cases, torque management systems, and
    components and systems for automated transmissions.

Stock
    Split

On November 14, 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors
    approved a

two-for-one

stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend on its
    common stock. To implement this stock split, shares of common
    stock were issued on December 17, 2007 to stockholders of
    record as of the close of business on December 6, 2007. All
    prior year share and per share amounts disclosed in this
    document have been restated to reflect the

two-for-one

stock split.

A summary of major factors impacting the Company’s net
    earnings for the year ended December 31, 2008 in comparison
    to 2007 and 2006 is as follows:

•

Global financial market and economic crisis in the second half
    of 2008 significantly impacted consumer demand for light
    vehicles and negatively impacted our sales.

•

Continued demand for our products in both Engine and Drivetrain
    segments.

•

Lower North American production of light trucks and SUVs.

•

Continued benefits from our cost reduction programs, including
    containment of raw material and energy cost increases, health
    care cost inflation and the costs related to global expansion.

•

Restructuring expenses in the third and fourth quarters of 2006
    to adjust headcount and capacity levels, primarily in North
    America and primarily in the Drivetrain segment.

•

Restructuring expenses in the third and fourth quarters of 2008
    to adjust headcount and capacity levels, in North America,
    Europe and Asia.

•

The write-offs of the excess purchase price allocated to
    in-process research and development (“IPR&D”),
    order backlog and beginning inventory related to the 2007
    acquisition of approximately 12.8% of BERU AG (“BERU”)
    stock and the 2008 completion of a Domination and Profit
    Transfer Agreement (“DPTA”) between the Company and
    BERU.

•

The write-offs of the excess purchase price allocated to
    IPR&D, order backlog and beginning inventory related to the
    2006 acquisition of the European Transmission and Engine
    Controls (“ETEC”) product lines from Eaton in Monaco.

•

Favorable currency impact of $13.0 million,
    $15.2 million and $0.4 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

•

Adjustments to tax accounts in 2008, 2007 and 2006 upon
    conclusion of certain tax audits and changes in circumstances,
    including changes in tax laws.

•

An approximate $14 million provision in 2007 for a
    warranty-related issue surrounding a product, built during a

15-month

period in 2004 and 2005, that is no longer in production.

•

An approximate $23.5 million warranty-related issue
    associated with the company’s transmission product sold in
    Europe, limited to mid-2007 through May 2008 production.

•

An €111.5 million $(156.8 million) impairment
    charge in 2008 to adjust BERU’s goodwill to its estimated
    fair value.

•

Recognition in 2008 of a $4.0 million charge related to an
    untimely change in the level of benefits provided to BorgWarner
    Diversified Transmission Products Inc (“DTP”) retirees.

•

The establishment of a valuation allowance for foreign tax
    credit carryforwards in 2008 of $13.5 million.



The Company’s earnings (loss) per diluted share were
    $(0.31), $2.45 and $1.83 for the years ended December 31,
    2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company believes the
    following table is useful in highlighting non-recurring or
    non-comparable items that impacted its earnings per diluted

Data provided by CSM Worldwide.

Our net sales decrease in 2008 of 1.2% was slightly better than
    the estimated worldwide market production decrease of 3.7%. Our
    net sales increase in 2007 of 16.2% was strong in light of the
    estimated worldwide market production increase of 5.0%. The
    effect of changing currency rates had a positive impact on the
    Company’s net sales and net earnings in 2008 and 2007. The
    effect of

non-U.S. currencies,

primarily the Euro, increased net sales by $191.0 million
    and reduced the Company’s net loss by $13.0 million in
    2008. In 2007,

non-U.S. currencies,

primarily the Euro, added $262.1 million to net sales and
    $15.2 million to net earnings. The year over year decrease
    in net sales, excluding the favorable impact of currency, was
    4.8% in 2008. The year over year increase in net sales,
    excluding the favorable impact of currency, was 10.5% in 2007.

Consolidated net sales included sales to Volkswagen of
    approximately 19%, 15%, and 13%; to Ford of approximately 9%,
    12%, and 13%; and to Daimler of approximately 6%, 6%, and 11%
    for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Daimler divested Chrysler in 2007. Both of our
    reporting segments had significant sales to all three of the
    customers listed above. Such sales consisted of a variety of
    products to a variety of customer locations and regions. No
    other single customer accounted for more than 10% of
    consolidated sales in any year of the periods presented.



Outlook

The Company is very cautious about 2009. The recent crisis in
    the financial sector and deteriorating global economic
    conditions have increased uncertainty about automotive vehicle
    sales in every geographic region of the world. The Company
    expects the unprecedented current global economic environment to
    continue to affect near-term results and to create difficult
    conditions through 2009.

The Company maintains a positive long-term outlook for its
    global business and is committed to new product development and
    strategic capital investments to enhance its product leadership
    strategy. The trends that are driving our long-term growth are
    expected to continue, including the growth of direct injection
    diesel and gasoline engines worldwide, the increased adoption of
    automated transmissions in Europe and Asia-Pacific, and the move
    to chain engine timing systems in both Europe and Asia-Pacific.

The impact of

non-U.S. currencies

is currently expected to be a decline in 2009. When the recovery
    from current global economic conditions occur, we expect
    long-term sales and net earnings growth to resume to historical
    rates.

Results
    By Reporting Segment

The Company’s business is comprised of two reporting
    segments: Engine and Drivetrain. These segments are strategic
    business groups, which are managed separately as each represents
    a specific grouping of related automotive components and systems.

The Company allocates resources to each segment based upon the
    projected after-tax return on invested capital
    (“ROIC”) of its business initiatives. The ROIC is
    comprised of projected earnings before interest and taxes
    (“EBIT”) adjusted for taxes compared to the projected
    average capital investment required.

EBIT is considered a “non-GAAP financial measure.”
    Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure
    of a company’s financial performance, financial position or
    cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included
    in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure
    calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. EBIT is
    defined as earnings before interest, taxes and minority
    interest. “Earnings” is intended to mean net earnings
    as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations under
    GAAP.

The Company believes that EBIT is useful to demonstrate the
    operational profitability of its segments by excluding interest
    and taxes, which are generally accounted for across the entire
    Company on a consolidated basis. EBIT is also one of the
    measures used by the Company to determine resource allocation
    within the Company. Although the Company believes that EBIT
    enhances understanding of its business and performance, it
    should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful
    than, net earnings or cash flows from operations as determined
    in accordance with GAAP.

The

Engine

segment 2008 net sales were up 2.7% from
    2007, with a 5.5% decrease in Segment EBIT over the same period.
    The Engine segment continued to benefit from Asian automaker
    demand for turbochargers and timing systems, European automaker
    demand for turbochargers, timing systems, exhaust gas
    recirculation (“EGR”) valves and diesel engine
    ignition systems. This benefit was offset by lower North
    American production of light truck and sport-utility vehicles.
    The Segment EBIT margin was 10.2% in 2008, down from 11.1% in
    2007 (which includes the one-time write-off in 2008 of the
    excess purchase price allocated to BERU’s IPR&D, order
    backlog and inventory), due to the significant reduction in
    customer production schedules in the U.S. and European markets,
    and increased costs for raw materials, principally steel.

The Engine segment 2007 net sales were up 19.2% from 2006,
    with a 14.3% increase in Segment EBIT over the same period. The
    Engine segment continued to benefit from Asian automaker demand
    for turbochargers and timing systems, European automaker demand
    for turbochargers, timing systems, exhaust gas recirculation
    (“EGR”) valves and diesel engine ignition systems, the
    continued roll-out of its variable cam timing systems with
    General Motors high-value V6 engines, stronger EGR valve sales
    in North America, and higher turbocharger and thermal products
    sales due to stronger global commercial vehicle production. The
    Segment EBIT margin was 11.1% in 2007 down from 11.6% in 2006
    (which includes the one-time write-off in 2007 of the excess
    purchase price allocated to BERU’s IPR&D, order
    backlog and inventory), due to the significant reduction in
    customer production schedules in the U.S. market and
    increased costs for raw materials, principally nickel.

The

Drivetrain

segment 2008 net sales decreased
    10.8% from 2007 with a 104.1% decrease in Segment EBIT over the
    same period. The group was negatively impacted by lower
    U.S. production of light trucks and SUVs equipped with its
    torque transfer products and lower sales of its traditional
    transmission products. Segment EBIT margin was (0.3)% in 2008,
    down from 7.4% in the prior year, due to the combined effect of
    DCT product

start-up

cost pressures and lower North American production of light
    trucks and sport-utility vehicles equipped with its torque
    transfer products.

The Drivetrain segment 2007 net sales increased 9.4% from
    2006 with a 30.4% increase in Segment EBIT over the same period.
    The segment continued to benefit from growth outside of North
    America including the continued ramp up of dual-clutch
    transmission and torque transfer product sales in Europe. In the
    U.S., the group was negatively impacted by lower production of
    light trucks and SUVs equipped with its torque transfer products
    and lower sales of its traditional transmission products.
    Segment EBIT margin was 7.4% in 2007, up from 6.2% in the prior
    year, due to the benefits of restructuring in its North American
    operations and growth outside of the U.S.

Corporate

is the difference between calculated total
    Company EBIT and the total of the Segments’ EBIT. It
    represents corporate headquarters’ expenses, expenses not
    directly attributable to the individual segments and



equity in affiliates’ earnings. This net expense was
    $52.9 million in 2008, $71.0 million in 2007 and
    $61.2 million in 2006.

Gross profit

as a percentage of net sales was 15.9%,
    17.8% and 18.5% in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our gross
    profit decrease in 2008 is due to unfavorable product mix as a
    result of the sudden decline in the North American and
    European automotive markets, including a 15.8% decrease in light
    truck and SUV production in North America. The Company has
    restructured its North American and European operations in the
    third and fourth quarters of 2008 to align the Company’s
    workforce with forecasted production.

Selling, general and administrative

expenses
    (“SG&A”) as a percentage of net sales were 10.3%,
    10.0% and 10.9% in 2008, 2007 and 2006 respectively. The 2008
    increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily
    due to $8.0 million of amortization for the recognition of
    the remaining 17.8% of the fair value of BERU. $3.3 million
    of the amortization recognized in the second quarter of 2008 is
    for the immediate write off of in process R&D and order
    backlog, the remaining $4.7 million increase is
    amortization on other intangible assets. The Company also
    recorded an increase in bad debt expense of $2.7 million in
    2008 related to a decline in the financial condition of certain
    customers.

Research and development (“R&D”) is a major
    component of our SG&A expenses. R&D spending, net of
    customer reimbursements, was $205.7 million, or 3.9% of
    sales in 2008, compared to $210.8 million, or 4.0% of sales
    in 2007, and $187.7 million, or 4.1% of sales in 2006. We
    currently intend to continue to increase our spending in
    R&D, although the growth rate in the future may not
    necessarily match the rate of our sales growth. We also intend
    to continue to invest in a number of cross-business R&D
    programs, as well as a number of other key programs, all of
    which are necessary for short and long-term growth. Our current
    long-term expectation for R&D spending is approximately
    4.0% of sales. We intend to maintain our commitment to R&D
    spending while continuing to focus on controlling other
    SG&A costs.

Restructuring expense

of $127.5 million in 2008 and
    $84.7 million in 2006 was in response to declines in global
    customer production levels, customer restructurings and a
    subsequent evaluation of our headcount levels in North America,
    Europe and Asia (in 2008 only) and our long-term capacity needs.

On July 31, 2008, the Company announced a restructuring of
    its operations to align ongoing operations with a continuing,
    fundamental market shift in the auto industry. As a continuation
    of the Company’s third quarter restructuring, on
    December 11, 2008, the Company announced plans for
    additional restructuring actions. As a



result of these third and fourth quarter restructuring actions,
    the Company has reduced its North American workforce by
    approximately 2,400 people, or 33%; its European workforce
    by approximately 1,600 people, or 18%; and its Asian
    workforce by approximately 400 people, or 17%. The
    restructuring expense recognized for employee termination
    benefits is $54.6 million, of which $10.3 million was
    paid out in the third and fourth quarters of 2008. The remaining
    liability will be paid out by the middle of 2010. In addition to
    employee termination costs, the Company recorded
    $72.9 million of asset impairment charges related to the
    North American and European restructuring. The combined
    restructuring expenses of $127.5 million are broken out by
    segment as follows: Engine $85.3 million, Drivetrain
    $40.9 million and Corporate $1.3 million. Refer to
    Note 19, “Restructuring” of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report
    for further discussion.

On September 22, 2006, the Company announced the reduction
    of its North American workforce by approximately
    850 people, or 13%, spread across its 19 operations in the
    U.S., Canada and Mexico. This third quarter reduction of the
    North American workforce addressed an immediate need to adjust
    employment levels to meet customer restructurings and
    significantly lower production schedules going forward. In
    addition to employee related costs of $6.7 million, the
    Company recorded $4.8 million of asset impairment charges
    related to the North American restructuring. The third quarter
    restructuring expenses of $11.5 million broken out by
    segment were as follows: Engine $7.3 million, Drivetrain
    $3.6 million and Corporate $0.6 million.

During the fourth quarter 2006, the Company evaluated the
    competitiveness of its North American facilities, as well as its
    long-term capacity needs. As a result, the Company will be
    closing the drivetrain plant in Muncie, Indiana and has adjusted
    the carrying values of other assets, primarily related to its
    four-wheel drive transfer case product line. Production activity
    at the Muncie facility is scheduled to cease no later than the
    expiration of the current labor contract in April 24, 2009.
    As a result of the fourth quarter restructuring, the Company
    recorded employee related costs of $14.8 million, asset
    impairments of $51.6 million and pension curtailment
    expense of $6.8 million. The fourth quarter restructuring
    expenses of $73.2 million broken out by segment were as
    follows: Engine $5.9 million and Drivetrain
    $67.3 million.

Other income

was $(3.1) million, $(6.8) million
    and $(7.5) million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
    The 2008 income was comprised primarily of interest income,
    offset by the realization of a loss on the sale of a product
    line and other asset disposals. The 2007 income was comprised
    primarily of interest income. The 2006 income was comprised
    primarily of a $(4.8) million gain from a previous
    divestiture and $(3.2) million of interest income.

Equity in affiliates’ earnings, net of tax

was
    $38.4 million, $40.3 million and $35.9 million in
    2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. This line item is primarily
    driven by the results of our 50% owned Japanese joint venture,
    NSK-Warner, and our 32.6% owned Indian joint venture, Turbo
    Energy Limited (“TEL”). For more discussion of
    NSK-Warner, see Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Interest expense and finance charges

were
    $38.8 million, $34.7 million and $40.2 million in
    2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in 2008 expense
    over 2007 expense was primarily due to costs related to
    BERU’s DPTA. The decrease in 2007 expense over 2006 expense
    was primarily due to reduced debt levels.

The provision for income taxes

resulted in an effective
    tax rate for 2008 of 237.9% compared with rates of 26.5% in 2007
    and 12.0% in 2006. The effective tax rate of 237.9% for 2008
    differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the
    non-deductibility of the $156.8 million impairment charge
    in 2008 related to BERU goodwill; a reduction in
    U.S. income; foreign rates, which differ from those in the
    U.S.; the realization of certain business tax credits including
    R&D and foreign tax credits and favorable permanent
    differences between book and tax treatment for items, including
    equity in affiliates’ earnings. If the effects of tax
    accrual changes and the Company’s third quarter
    $13.5 million valuation allowance are not taken into
    account, the Company’s effective tax rate associated with
    its on-going business operations was 23.0%. This rate was lower
    than the 2007 tax rate for on-going operations of 27.1%
    primarily due to the decline in U.S. earnings.

Minority interest, net of tax

of $16.3 million
    decreased by $11.7 million from 2007 and by
    $10.0 million from 2006. The decrease is primarily related
    to the Company’s DPTA with BERU, giving BorgWarner full
    control of BERU.

Operating
    Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was
    $400.8 million, $603.5 million and $442.1 million
    in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The $202.7 million
    decrease in 2008 from 2007 was primarily due to lower earnings
    and increased working capital needs. The $161.4 million
    increase in 2007 from 2006 was primarily due to higher earnings
    and improved working capital usage. The $400.8 million of
    net cash provided by operating activities in 2008 consists of a
    net loss of $35.6 million, increased for non-cash charges
    of $530.7 million and a $94.3 million decrease in net
    operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges are primarily
    comprised of $286.8 million in depreciation and
    amortization expense and a $156.8 million goodwill
    impairment charge.

Accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued expenses
    decreased a total of $163.9 million and
    $195.6 million, respectively, excluding the impact of
    currency, due to lower business levels, particularly in
    North America and Europe. Certain of our European customers
    tend to have longer payment terms than our North American
    customers. Inventory increased by $26.3 million excluding
    the impact of currency, while our full year average inventory
    turns decreased to 9.8 times from 10.5 in 2007.



Investing
    Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $485.1 million,
    $368.0 million and $341.1 million in 2008, 2007 and
    2006, respectively. Capital expenditures, including tooling
    outlays (“capital spending”) of $369.7 million in
    2008, or 7.0% of sales, increased $75.8 million over the
    2007 level of $293.9 million, or 5.5% of sales. Selective
    capital spending remains an area of focus for us, both in order
    to support our book of new business and for cost reduction and
    other purposes. Heading into 2009, we plan to continue to spend
    capital to support the launch of our new applications and for
    cost reductions and productivity improvement projects, but at
    levels considerably lower than 2008.

In 2008, the Company purchased approximately 1.34 million
    BERU shares, at a cost of $133.6 million. See Note 20,
    “Recent Transactions” for further information.

The Company acquired approximately 12.8% of additional BERU
    shares in 2007 for $138.8 million, including transaction
    fees.

In 2006, the Company acquired the ETEC product lines from Eaton
    for $63.7 million, net of cash acquired.

Financing
    Activities and Liquidity

Liquidity:

The Company had $103.4 million of cash on
    hand at December 31, 2008. The Company has a multi-currency
    revolving credit facility, which provides for borrowings up to
    $600 million through July 22, 2009. We intend to
    extend or renew our existing multi-currency credit facility with
    terms sufficient for our ongoing financing needs before
    July 22, 2009. However, if the Company is unable to
    negotiate a new credit facility or similar access to credit
    lines, it could adversely affect the Company’s ability to
    operate. At December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007
    there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility. The
    credit agreement is subject to the usual terms and conditions
    applied by banks to an investment grade company. The two key
    covenants of the credit agreement are a net worth test and a
    debt compared to EBITDA (“Earnings Before Interest, Taxes,
    Depreciation and Amortization”) test. The Company was in
    compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2008 and
    expects to be compliant in future periods. In addition to the
    credit facility, the Company has $750 million available
    under a universal shelf registration statement on file with the
    Securities and Exchange Commission under which a variety of debt
    and equity instruments could be issued. The Company also has
    access to the commercial paper market through a $50 million
    accounts receivable securitization facility, which is rolled
    over annually. The current facility matures on April 25, 2009.
    From a credit quality perspective, the Company has an investment
    grade credit rating of BBB from Standard & Poor’s
    and Baa3 from Moody’s. The current outlook from
    Standard & Poor’s is negative and we are under
    review for a potential further downgrade from Moody’s. None
    of the Company’s debt agreements require accelerated
    repayment in the event of a decrease in credit ratings.

The Company’s significant contractual obligation payments
    at December 31, 2008 are as follows:

We believe that the combination of cash from operations, cash
    balances, available credit facilities and the shelf registration
    will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for our current
    level of operations and our planned operations for the
    foreseeable future. We will continue to balance our needs for
    internal growth, external growth, debt reduction, dividends and
    share repurchase.

Financing Activities:

Net debt increases were
    $107.5 million in 2008 excluding the impact of currency
    translation. Net debt reductions were $101.7 million in
    2007 excluding the impact of currency translation. Proceeds from
    stock options exercised, net of tax benefit were
    $17.1 million, $46.3 million and $27.1 million in
    2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company paid dividends to
    BorgWarner stockholders of $51.1 million,
    $39.4 million and $36.7 million in 2008, 2007 and
    2006, respectively. The Company had treasury stock purchases of
    $55.9 million and $47.0 million in 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

Off
    Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of December 31, 2008, the accounts receivable
    securitization facility was sized at $50 million and has
    been in place with its current funding partner since January
    1994. This facility sells accounts receivable without recourse.

The Company has certain leases that are recorded as operating
    leases. Types of operating leases include leases on the
    headquarters facility, an airplane, vehicles, and certain office
    equipment. The Company also has a lease obligation for
    production equipment at one of its facilities. The total
    expected future cash outlays for all lease obligations at the
    end of 2008 is $65.9 million. See Note 16 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on
    operating leases, including future minimum payments.

The Company has guaranteed the residual values of certain leased
    machinery and equipment at one of its facilities. The guarantees
    extend through the maturity of the underlying lease, which is in
    September 2010. In the event the Company exercises its option
    not to purchase the machinery and equipment, the Company has
    guaranteed a residual value of $7.7 million. The Company
    has accrued $4.1 million as a loss on this guarantee, which
    is expected to be paid in 2009.



Pension
    and Other Post Employment Benefits

The Company’s policy is to fund its defined benefit pension
    plans in accordance with applicable government regulations and
    to make additional contributions when management deems it
    appropriate. At December 31, 2008, all legal funding
    requirements had been met. The Company contributed
    $13.3 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2008
    and $12.4 million in 2007. The Company expects to
    contribute a total of $10 million to $20 million in
    2009.

The funded status of all pension plans was a net unfunded
    position of $(253.5) million and $(136.5) million at
    the end of 2008 and 2007, respectively. Of these amounts,
    $(110.9) million and $(111.1) at the end of 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, were related to plans in Germany, where there is
    not a tax deduction allowed under the applicable regulations to
    fund the plans, hence, the common practice is that they are
    unfunded plans.

Other post employment benefits primarily consist of post
    employment health care benefits for certain employees and
    retirees of the Company’s U.S. operations. The Company
    funds these benefits as retiree claims are incurred. Other post
    employment benefits had an unfunded status of
    $(328.5) million at the end of 2008 and
    $(373.1) million at the end of 2007. The unfunded levels
    decreased due to an increase in the discount rate assumption and
    changes in certain plan designs.

The Company believes it will be able to fund the requirements of
    these plans through cash generated from operations or other
    available sources of financing for the foreseeable future.

See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee
    retirement benefits.

OTHER
    MATTERS

Contingencies

In the normal course of business the Company and its
    subsidiaries are parties to various commercial and legal claims,
    actions and complaints, including matters involving warranty
    claims, intellectual property claims, general liability and
    various other risks. See Notes 8 and 15 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements. It is not possible to predict with
    certainty whether or not the Company and its subsidiaries will
    ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal
    matters or, if not, what the impact might be. The Company’s
    environmental and product liability contingencies are discussed
    separately below. The Company’s management does not expect
    that the results in any of these commercial and legal claims,
    actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect on
    the Company’s results of operations, financial position or
    cash flows.

Litigation
    Outcome

In January 2006, BorgWarner Diversified Transmission Products
    Inc (“DTP”), a subsidiary of the Company, filed a
    declaratory judgment action in United States District Court,
    Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis Division) against the
    United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implements
    Workers of America (“UAW”) Local No. 287 and
    Gerald Poor, individually and as the representative of a
    defendant class. DTP sought the Court’s affirmation that
    DTP did not violate the Labor-Management Relations Act or the
    Employee Retirement Income Security Act by unilaterally amending
    certain medical plans effective April 1, 2006 and
    October 1, 2006, prior to the expiration of the current
    collective bargaining agreements. On September 10, 2008,
    the Court found that DTP’s reservation of the right to make
    such amendments reducing the level of benefits provided to
    retirees was limited by its collectively bargained health
    insurance agreement with the UAW, which does not expire until
    April 24, 2009. Thus, the amendments were untimely. In 2008
    the Company recorded a charge of $4.0 million as a result
    of the Court’s decision.

The Company has communicated its plan to reduce the level of
    benefits provided to the retirees to make them comparable to
    other Company retiree benefit plans. The change will be
    effective following expiration of the health insurance agreement
    in April 24, 2009.



Environmental

The Company and certain of its current and former direct and
    indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have
    been identified by the United States Environmental Protection
    Agency and certain state environmental agencies and private
    parties as potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) at
    various hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive
    Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
    (“Superfund”) and equivalent state laws and, as such,
    may presently be liable for the cost of

clean-up

and
    other remedial activities at 35 such sites. Responsibility for

clean-up

and
    other remedial activities at a Superfund site is typically
    shared among PRPs based on an allocation formula.

The Company believes that none of these matters, individually or
    in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its
    results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
    Generally, this is because either the estimates of the maximum
    potential liability at a site are not large or the liability
    will be shared with other PRPs, although no assurance can be
    given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter.

Based on information available to the Company (which in most
    cases includes: an estimate of allocation of liability among
    PRPs; the probability that other PRPs, many of whom are large,
    solvent public companies, will fully pay the cost apportioned to
    them; currently available information from PRPs

and/or

federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of
    contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs;
    remediation alternatives; and estimated legal fees), the Company
    has established an accrual for indicated environmental
    liabilities with a balance at December 31, 2008 of
    $11.9 million. The Company has accrued amounts that do not
    exceed $3.4 million related to any individual site and we
    do not believe that the costs related to any of these sites will
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of
    operations, cash flows or financial condition. The Company
    expects to pay out substantially all of the amounts accrued for
    environmental liability over the next three to five years.

In connection with the sale of Kuhlman Electric Corporation, the
    Company agreed to indemnify the buyer and Kuhlman Electric for
    certain environmental liabilities, then unknown to the Company,
    relating to certain operations of Kuhlman Electric that pre-date
    the Company’s 1999 acquisition of Kuhlman Electric. During
    2000, Kuhlman Electric notified the Company that it discovered
    potential environmental contamination at its Crystal Springs,
    Mississippi plant while undertaking an expansion of the plant.
    The Company is continuing to work with the Mississippi
    Department of Environmental Quality and Kuhlman Electric to
    investigate and remediate to the extent necessary, historical
    contamination at the plant and surrounding area. Kuhlman
    Electric and others, including the Company, were sued in
    numerous related lawsuits, in which multiple claimants alleged
    personal injury and property damage. In 2005, the Company and
    other defendants entered into settlements that resolved
    approximately 99% of the then known personal injury and property
    damage claims relating to the alleged environmental
    contamination. Those settlements involved payments by the
    Company of $28.5 million in the second half of 2005 and
    $15.7 million in the first quarter of 2006, in exchange
    for, among other things, dismissal with prejudice of these
    lawsuits.

In December 2007, a lawsuit was filed against Kuhlman Electric
    and others, including the Company, on behalf of approximately
    209 plaintiffs, alleging personal injury relating to the alleged
    environmental contamination. In August 2008, two similar
    lawsuits were filed against Kuhlman Electric and others,
    including the Company, on behalf of approximately 100 plaintiffs
    and 30 plaintiffs, respectively, alleging personal injury
    related to the alleged environmental contamination. Given the
    early stage of the litigation, the Company cannot make any
    predictions as to the outcome, but its current intent is to
    vigorously defend against the suits.

Conditional
    Asset Retirement Obligations

In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47,
    Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
    Obligations — an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 143 (“FIN 47”), which requires the
    Company to recognize legal obligations to perform asset
    retirements in which the timing

and/or

method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may
    or may not be within the control of the entity. Certain
    government regulations require the removal and disposal of
    asbestos from an existing facility at the time the facility
    undergoes major renovations or is demolished. The liability
    exists because the facility will not last forever, but it is



conditional on future renovations (even if there are no
    immediate plans to remove the materials, which pose no health or
    safety hazard in their current condition). Similarly, government
    regulations require the removal or closure of underground
    storage tanks (“USTs”) and above ground storage tanks
    (“ASTs”) when their use ceases, the disposal of
    polychlorinated biphenyl (“PCB”) transformers and
    capacitors when their use ceases, and the disposal of used
    furnace bricks and liners, and lead-based paint in conjunction
    with facility renovations or demolition. The Company currently
    has 32 manufacturing locations that have been identified as
    containing these items. The fair value to remove and dispose of
    this material has been estimated and recorded at
    $1.4 million as of December 31, 2008 and
    $1.0 million as of December 31, 2007.

Product
    Liability

Like many other industrial companies who have historically
    operated in the U.S., the Company (or parties the Company is
    obligated to indemnify) continues to be named as one of many
    defendants in asbestos-related personal injury actions. We
    believe that the Company’s involvement is limited because,
    in general, these claims relate to a few types of automotive
    friction products that were manufactured many years ago and
    contained encapsulated asbestos. The nature of the fibers, the
    encapsulation and the manner of use lead the Company to believe
    that these products are highly unlikely to cause harm. As of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had approximately
    27,000 and 42,000 pending asbestos-related product liability
    claims, respectively. Of the 27,000 outstanding claims at
    December 31, 2008, approximately 16,000 are pending in just
    three jurisdictions, where significant tort and judicial reform
    activities are underway.

The Company’s policy is to aggressively defend against
    these lawsuits and the Company has been successful in obtaining
    dismissal of many claims without any payment. The Company
    expects that the vast majority of the pending asbestos-related
    product liability claims where it is a defendant (or has an
    obligation to indemnify a defendant) will result in no payment
    being made by the Company or its insurers. In 2008, of the
    approximately 17,500 claims resolved, only 210 (1.2%) resulted
    in any payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the
    Company. In 2007, of the approximately 4,400 claims resolved,
    only 194 (4.4%) resulted in any payment being made to a claimant
    by or on behalf of the Company.

Prior to June 2004, the settlement and defense costs associated
    with all claims were covered by the Company’s primary layer
    insurance coverage, and these carriers administered, defended,
    settled and paid all claims under a funding arrangement. In June
    2004, primary layer insurance carriers notified the Company of
    the alleged exhaustion of their policy limits. This led the
    Company to access the next available layer of insurance
    coverage. Since June 2004, secondary layer insurers have paid
    asbestos-related litigation defense and settlement expenses
    pursuant to a funding arrangement. To date, the Company has paid
    $50.1 million in defense and indemnity in advance of
    insurers’ reimbursement and has received $14.2 million
    in cash from insurers. The outstanding balance of
    $35.9 million is expected to be fully recovered. Timing of
    the recovery is dependent on final resolution of the declaratory
    judgment action referred to below. At December 31, 2007,
    insurers owed $20.6 million in association with these
    claims.

At December 31, 2008, the Company has an estimated
    liability of $34.7 million for future claims resolutions,
    with a related asset of $34.7 million to recognize the
    insurance proceeds receivable by the Company for estimated
    losses related to claims that have yet to be resolved. Insurance
    carrier reimbursement of 100% is expected based on the
    Company’s experience, its insurance contracts and decisions
    received to date in the declaratory judgment action referred to
    below. At December 31, 2007, the comparable value of the
    insurance receivable and accrued liability was
    $39.6 million.

The Company cannot reasonably estimate possible losses, if any,
    in excess of those for which it has accrued, because it cannot
    predict how many additional claims may be brought against the
    Company (or parties the Company has an obligation to indemnify)
    in the future, the allegations in such claims, the possible
    outcomes, or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be
    enacted at the State or Federal levels.

A declaratory judgment action was filed in January 2004 in the
    Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois by Continental Casualty
    Company and related companies (“CNA”) against the
    Company and certain of its other historical general liability
    insurers. CNA provided the Company with both primary and
    additional layer insurance, and, in conjunction with other
    insurers, is currently defending and indemnifying the Company in
    its pending asbestos-related product liability claims. The
    lawsuit seeks to determine the extent of insurance coverage
    available to the Company including whether the available limits
    exhaust on a “per occurrence” or an
    “aggregate” basis, and to determine how the applicable
    coverage responsibilities should be apportioned. On
    August 15, 2005, the Court issued an interim order
    regarding the apportionment matter. The interim order has the
    effect of making insurers responsible for all defense and
    settlement costs pro rata to

time-on-the-risk,

with the pro-ration method to hold the insured harmless for
    periods of bankrupt or unavailable coverage. Appeals of the
    interim order were denied. However, the issue is reserved for
    appellate review at the end of the action. In addition to the
    primary insurance available for asbestos-related claims, the
    Company has substantial additional layers of insurance available
    for potential future asbestos-related product claims. As such,
    the Company continues to believe that its coverage is sufficient
    to meet foreseeable liabilities.

Although it is impossible to predict the outcome of pending or
    future claims or the impact of tort reform legislation that may
    be enacted at the State or Federal levels, due to the
    encapsulated nature of the products, the Company’s
    experiences in aggressively defending and resolving claims in
    the past, and the Company’s significant insurance coverage
    with solvent carriers as of the date of this filing, management
    does not believe that asbestos-related product liability claims
    are likely to have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial
    condition.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity
    with GAAP. In preparing these financial statements, management
    has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts
    included in the financial statements, giving due consideration
    to materiality. Critical accounting policies are those that are
    most important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial
    condition and results of operations. These policies require
    management’s most difficult, subjective or complex
    judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and
    accompanying notes. Management makes estimates and assumptions
    about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain,
    relating to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues,
    expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities. Our most critical accounting policies are discussed
    below.



Revenue
    Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss pass
    to the customer, which is usually upon shipment of product.
    Although the Company may enter into long-term supply agreements
    with its major customers, each shipment of goods is treated as a
    separate sale and the price is not fixed over the life of the
    agreements.

Impairment
    of Long-Lived Assets

The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of its
    long-lived assets, whether held for use or disposal, including
    other intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant
    such a review. This review is performed using estimates of
    future cash flows. If the carrying value of a long-lived asset
    is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the
    amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset
    exceeds its fair value. Management believes that the estimates
    of future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable;
    however, changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could
    affect the evaluations. Significant judgments and estimates used
    by management when evaluating long-lived assets for impairment
    include: (i) an assessment as to whether an adverse event
    or circumstance has triggered the need for an impairment review;
    and (ii) undiscounted future cash flows generated by the
    asset. The Company recognized $72.9 million and
    $56.4 million in impairment of long-lived assets as part of
    restructuring expenses in 2008 and 2006, respectively.

See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information regarding the Company’s 2006 and 2008
    impairment of long-lived assets.

Goodwill

The Company annually reviews its goodwill for impairment in the
    fourth quarter of each year for all of its reporting units, or
    when events and circumstances warrant such a review. This review
    utilizes the “two-step impairment test” required under
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangibles,

and requires us to make
    significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and
    timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates.
    The cash flows are estimated over a significant future period of
    time, which makes those estimates and assumptions subject to an
    even higher degree of uncertainty. We also utilize market
    valuation models and other financial ratios, which require us to
    make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the
    applicability of those models to our assets and businesses. We
    believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the
    estimated fair values of each of our reporting units are
    reasonable. However, different assumptions could materially
    affect the estimated fair value. The goodwill impairment test
    was performed in December and September 2008, December 2007 and
    December 2006. The Company recognized goodwill impairment of
    $156.8 million in the Engine segment in 2008 and
    $0.2 million in the Drivetrain segment in 2006. No goodwill
    impairment was recorded in 2007.

See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information regarding goodwill.

Environmental
    Accrual

We work with outside experts to determine a range of potential
    liability for environmental sites. The ranges for each
    individual site are then aggregated into a loss range for the
    total accrued liability. Management’s estimate of the loss
    range for environmental liability, including conditional asset
    retirement obligations, for 2008 is between $12.4 million
    and $26.1 million. We record an accrual at the most
    probable amount within the range unless one cannot be
    determined; in which case we record the accrual at the low end
    of the range. At the end of 2008, our total accrued
    environmental liability was $13.3 million, which includes
    our conditional asset retirement obligation under FIN 47 of
    $1.4 million.

See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information regarding environmental accrual.



Product
    Warranty

The Company provides warranties on some of its products. The
    warranty terms are typically from one to three years. Provisions
    for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at
    the time products are sold. These estimates are established
    using historical information about the nature, frequency, and
    average cost of warranty claim settlements; as well as product
    manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from
    third parties. Management actively studies trends of warranty
    claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize
    warranty claims. Management believes that the warranty accrual
    is appropriate; however, actual claims incurred could differ
    from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to the
    accrual. The accrual is represented in both current and
    non-current liabilities on the balance sheet.

See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information regarding product warranty.

Other
    Loss Accruals and Valuation Allowances

The Company has numerous other loss exposures, such as customer
    claims, workers’ compensation claims, litigation, and
    recoverability of assets. Establishing loss accruals or
    valuation allowances for these matters requires the use of
    estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and
    ultimate realization. We estimate losses under the programs
    using consistent and appropriate methods; however, changes to
    our assumptions could materially affect our recorded accrued
    liabilities for loss or asset valuation allowances.

Pension
    and Other Post Employment Defined Benefits

The Company provides post employment defined benefits to a
    number of its current and former employees. Costs associated
    with post employment defined benefits include pension and post
    employment health care expenses for employees, retirees and
    surviving spouses and dependents. The Company’s employee
    defined benefit pension and post employment health care expenses
    are dependent on management’s assumptions used by actuaries
    in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount
    rates, health care cost trend rates, inflation, long-term return
    on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other
    factors. Health care cost trend assumptions are developed based
    on historical cost data, the near-term outlook, and an
    assessment of likely long-term trends. The inflation assumption
    is based on an evaluation of external market indicators.
    Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual
    plan experience. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions
    on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions
    based on current rates and trends when appropriate. The effects
    of the modifications are recorded currently or amortized over
    future periods in accordance with GAAP.

The Company’s approach to establishing the discount rate is
    based upon the market yields of high-quality corporate bonds,
    with appropriate consideration of each plan’s defined
    benefit payment terms and duration of the liabilities. The
    discount rate assumption is typically rounded up or down to the
    nearest 25 basis points for each plan. As a sensitivity
    measure for the Company’s pension plans, a decrease of
    25 basis points to the discount rate would increase the
    Company’s 2009 expense by approximately $0.9 million.
    As for the Company’s other post employment benefit plans, a
    decrease of 25 basis points to the discount rate would
    increase the Company’s 2009 expense by approximately
    $0.3 million.

The Company determines its expected return on plan asset
    assumptions by evaluating estimates of future market returns and
    the plans’ asset allocation. The Company also considers the
    impact of active management of the plans’ invested assets.
    The Company’s expected return on assets assumption reflects
    the asset allocation of each plan. For 2009, the Company is
    changing its expected return on U.S. plan assets to 7.50%
    from 8.75% to reflect adjustments made to its targeted asset
    allocations. For sensitivity purposes, a 25 basis point
    decrease in the long-term return on assets would increase the
    2009 pension expense by approximately $0.8 million.

The Company determines its health care inflation rate for its
    other post employment benefit plans by evaluating the
    circumstances surrounding the plan design, recent experience and
    health care economics. For sensitivity purposes, a one
    percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend
    would increase the



Company’s projected benefit obligation by
    $18.9 million at December 31, 2008, and would increase
    the 2009 expense by $1.4 million.

Based on the information provided by its independent actuaries
    and other relevant sources, the Company believes that the
    assumptions used are reasonable; however, changes in these
    assumptions, or experience different from that assumed, could
    impact the Company’s financial position, results of
    operations, or cash flows.

See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee
    retirement benefits.

Income
    Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with
    SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

.
    Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
    future tax consequences attributable to differences between
    financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
    liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss
    and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
    apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
    differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company
    records a valuation allowance that primarily represents foreign
    operating and other loss carryforwards for which utilization is
    uncertain. Management judgment is required in determining the
    Company’s provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets
    and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the
    Company’s net deferred tax assets. In calculating the
    provision for income taxes on an interim basis, the Company uses
    an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the
    facts and circumstances known at each interim period. In
    determining the need for a valuation allowance, the historical
    and projected financial performance of the operation recording
    the net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other
    pertinent information. Since future financial results may differ
    from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to the
    Company’s valuation allowance may be necessary.

The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and
    numerous

non-U.S. jurisdictions.

Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide
    provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and
    liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are
    many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax
    determination is less than certain. The Company is regularly
    under audit by the various applicable tax authorities. Accruals
    for income tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with
    the requirements of FASB interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation
    of FASB Statement No. 109

. The Company’s federal
    and certain state income tax returns and certain

non-U.S. income

tax returns are currently under various stages of audit by
    applicable tax authorities. Although the outcome of tax audits
    is always uncertain, management believes that it has appropriate
    support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its
    annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay
    assessments, if any, which may be proposed by the taxing
    authorities. At December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded
    a liability for its best estimate of the probable loss on
    certain of its tax positions, which is included in other
    non-current liabilities. Nonetheless, the amounts ultimately
    paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing
    authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for
    each year.

See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information regarding income taxes.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2006, the FASB issued interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation
    of FASB Statement No. 109

(“FIN 48”).
    The interpretation prescribes a consistent recognition threshold
    and measurement attribute, as well as clear criteria for
    subsequently recognizing, derecognizing and measuring such tax
    positions for financial statement purposes. FIN 48 also
    requires expanded disclosure with respect to the uncertainty in
    income taxes. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48
    on January 1, 2007. As a result of the implementation of
    FIN 48, the Company recognized a $16.6 million
    reduction to its January 1, 2007 retained earnings balance.



In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“FAS 157”). FAS 157 defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP and
    expands disclosures about fair value measurements. On
    January 1, 2008, the Company partially adopted as required,
    FAS 157. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for more information regarding the implementation of
    FAS 157.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for
    Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

(“FAS 159”). FAS 159 allows entities to
    irrevocably elect to recognize most financial assets and
    financial liabilities at fair value on an

instrument-by-instrument

basis. The stated objective of FAS 159 is to improve
    financial reporting by giving entities the opportunity to elect
    to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair
    value in order to mitigate earnings volatility caused when
    related assets and liabilities are measured differently.
    FAS 159 is effective for the Company beginning with its
    quarter ending March 31, 2008. The Company chose to not
    make the election to adopt.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 141 (Revised 2007),

Business
    Combinations

(“FAS 141(R)”). FAS 141(R)
    establishes principles and requirements for recognizing
    identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed,
    noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, goodwill acquired in
    the combination or the gain from a bargain purchase, and
    disclosure requirements. Under this revised statement, all costs
    incurred to effect an acquisition will be recognized separately
    from the acquisition. Also, restructuring costs that are
    expected but the acquirer is not obligated to incur will be
    recognized separately from the acquisition. FAS 141(R) is
    effective for the Company beginning with its quarter ending
    March 31, 2009. The adoption of FAS 141(R) is not
    expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests
    in Consolidated Financial Statements

(“FAS 160”). FAS 160 requires that
    ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than
    the parent are clearly identified. In addition, it requires that
    the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent
    and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and
    presented on the face of the income statement. FAS 160 is
    effective for the Company beginning with its quarter ending
    March 31, 2009. The adoption of FAS 160 is not
    expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position

No. FAS 157-2

(“FSP

FAS 157-2”).

FSP

FAS 157-2

delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial
    assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or
    disclosed in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis to
    fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. Refer to
    Note 10, “Fair Value Measurements” of the Notes
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion
    of the Company’s partial adoption of FSP

FAS 157-2.

In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments
    and Hedging Activities (“FAS 161”). FAS 161
    requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures about how and
    why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative
    instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under
    Statement 133 and its related interpretations, and how
    derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an
    entity’s financial position, financial performance, and
    cash flows. FAS 161 is effective for the Company beginning
    with its quarter ending March 31, 2009. The adoption of
    FAS 161 is not expected to have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

In December 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position 132(R)-1,
    Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan
    Assets (“FAS 132(R)-1”). FAS 132(R)-1
    requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures about how
    investment allocation decisions are made, the major categories
    of plan assets, the inputs and valuation techniques used to
    measure fair value of plan assets, the effect of fair value
    measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in
    plan assets for the period, and significant concentrations of
    risk within plan assets. FAS 132(R)-1 is effective for the
    Company beginning with its year ending December 31, 2009.
    The Company is currently assessing the potential impacts, if
    any, on its consolidated financial statements.



In December 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position

140-4

and
    Financial Interpretation 46(R)-8, Disclosures by Public Entities
    (Enterprises) about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests
    in Variable Interest Entities

(“FSP 140-4

and FIN 46(R)-8”).

FSP 140-4

and FIN 46(R)-8 requires entities to provide enhanced
    disclosures about how an entity accounts for transfers of
    financial assets, the nature of involvement, if any, after the
    financial asset sale and the nature of any restrictions on
    assets reported by an entity in its statement of financial
    position that relates to a transferred financial asset,
    including the carrying amounts of such assets. The Company has
    adjusted its disclosures to be compliant with

FSP 140-4

and FIN

46(R)-8

at
    December 31,2008.

QUALITATIVE
    AND QUANTITIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company’s primary market risks include fluctuations in
    interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We are also
    affected by changes in the prices of commodities used or
    consumed in our manufacturing operations. Some of our commodity
    purchase price risk is covered by supply agreements with
    customers and suppliers. Other commodity purchase price risk is
    addressed by hedging strategies, which include forward
    contracts. The Company enters into derivative instruments only
    with high credit quality counterparties and diversifies its
    positions across such counterparties in order to reduce its
    exposure to credit losses. We do not engage in any derivative
    instruments for purposes other than hedging specific operating
    risks.

We have established policies and procedures to manage
    sensitivity to interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and
    commodity purchase price risk, which include monitoring the
    level of exposure to each market risk.

Interest
    Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic
    losses due to adverse changes in interest rates. The Company
    manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to
    fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its
    interest costs. The Company selectively uses interest rate swaps
    to reduce market value risk associated with changes in interest
    rates (fair value hedges). At the end of 2008, the amount of net
    debt with fixed interest rates was 38.5% of total debt,
    including the impact of the interest rate swaps. Our earnings
    exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is
    primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt
    instruments that are indexed to floating money market rates. A
    10% increase or decrease in the average cost of our variable
    rate debt would result in a change in pre-tax interest expense
    for 2008 of approximately $2.1 million, and
    $1.8 million in 2007.

We also measure interest rate risk by estimating the net amount
    by which the fair value of all of our interest rate sensitive
    assets and liabilities would be impacted by selected
    hypothetical changes in market interest rates. Fair value is
    estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis. Assuming a
    hypothetical instantaneous 10% change in interest rates as of
    December 31, 2008, the net fair value of these instruments
    would increase by approximately $24 million if interest
    rates decreased and would decrease by approximately
    $22 million if interest rates increased. Our interest rate
    sensitivity analysis assumes a constant shift in interest rate
    yield curves. The model, therefore, does not reflect the
    potential impact of changes in the relationship between
    short-term and long-term interest rates. Interest rate
    sensitivity at December 31, 2007, measured in a similar
    manner, was slightly less than at December 31, 2008.

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Rate Risk

Foreign currency risk is the risk that we will incur economic
    losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates. Currently, our most significant currency exposures relate
    to the British Pound, the Euro, the Hungarian Forint, the
    Japanese Yen, and the South Korean Won. We mitigate our foreign
    currency exchange rate risk principally by establishing local
    production facilities and related supply chain participants in
    the markets we serve, by invoicing customers in the same
    currency as the source of the products and by funding some of
    our investments in foreign markets through local currency loans
    and cross currency swaps. Such

non-U.S. Dollar

debt was $495.8 million as of December 31, 2008 and
    $413.5 million as of December 31, 2007. We also
    monitor our foreign currency exposure in each country and
    implement strategies to respond to changing



economic and political environments. In addition, the Company
    periodically enters into forward currency contracts in order to
    reduce exposure to exchange rate risk related to transactions
    denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. As
    of December 31, 2008, the Company was holding foreign
    exchange derivatives with positive and negative fair market
    values of $10.2 million and $(61.8) million,
    respectively, of which $9.9 million in gains and
    $(36.3) million in losses mature in less than one year. As
    of December 31, 2008, $1.0 million in gains and
    $(8.2) million in losses did not qualify for deferral.

Commodity
    Price Risk

Commodity price risk is the possibility that we will incur
    economic losses due to adverse changes in the cost of raw
    materials used in the production of our products. Commodity
    forward and option contracts are executed to offset our exposure
    to the potential change in prices mainly for various non-ferrous
    metals and natural gas consumption used in the manufacturing of
    vehicle components. As of December 31, 2008, the Company
    had forward and option commodity contracts with a total notional
    value of $50.2 million. As of December 31, 2008, the
    Company was holding commodity derivatives with positive and
    negative fair market values of $2.1 million and
    $(16.3) million, respectively, of which $1.0 million
    in gains and $(15.1) million in losses mature in less than
    one year.

Disclosure
    Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

Statements contained in this Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations may
    contain forward-looking statements as contemplated by the 1995
    Private Securities Litigation Reform Act that are based on

REPORT OF
    MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
    REPORTING

The information in this report is the responsibility of
    management. BorgWarner Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) has in place reporting guidelines and
    policies designed to ensure that the statements and other
    information contained in this report present a fair and accurate
    financial picture of the Company. In fulfilling this management
    responsibility, we make informed judgments and estimates
    conforming with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America.

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been
    audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent
    registered public accounting firm.

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting.

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
    a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
    America. The internal control process includes those policies
    and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
    detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
    dispositions of the assets of the Company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
    that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made
    only in accordance with authorizations of management and
    directors of the Company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Any system of internal control, no matter how well designed, has
    inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined
    to be effective may not prevent or detect misstatements and can
    provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
    statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any
    evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
    risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
    conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
    or procedures may deteriorate.

The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2008. In making this assessment, the
    Company’s management used the criteria set forth by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (“COSO”) in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

.

Based on management’s assessment and those criteria, we
    believe that, as of December 31, 2008, the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting is effective.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Company’s independent
    registered public accounting firm, who audited the
    Company’s financial statements included in this Annual
    Report, and has issued an attestation report appearing in
    item 9A of

Form 10-K

on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2008.

The Company’s Audit Committee, composed entirely of
    directors of the Company who are not employees, meets
    periodically with the Company’s management and independent
    registered public accounting firm to review financial results
    and procedures, internal financial controls and internal and
    external audit plans and recommendations. In carrying out these
    responsibilities, the Audit Committee and the independent
    registered public accounting firm have unrestricted access to
    each other with or without the presence of management
    representatives.

Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of BorgWarner Inc.

Auburn Hills, Michigan

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    BorgWarner Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and
    the related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss), and
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2008. These financial statements are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial
    statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
    BorgWarner Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed its method of accounting in 2007
    for income taxes as a result of adopting FASB Interpretation
    No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,

and in 2006 for defined benefit pension and other
    postretirement plans as a result of adopting
    SFAS No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2008, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated February 12, 2009 expressed
    an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INTRODUCTION

BorgWarner Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) is a leading global supplier of highly
    engineered systems and components primarily for powertrain
    applications. These products are manufactured and sold
    worldwide, primarily to original equipment manufacturers of
    passenger cars, sport-utility vehicles, crossover vehicles,
    trucks, commercial transportation products and industrial
    equipment and to certain Tier One vehicle systems
    suppliers. The Company’s products fall into two reporting
    segments: Engine and Drivetrain.

NOTE 1

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following paragraphs briefly describe the Company’s
    significant accounting policies.

Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements
    in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
    the United States of America requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
    and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
    differ from those estimates.

Concentrations of risk

Cash is maintained with several
    financial institutions. Deposits held with banks may exceed the
    amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these
    deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with
    financial institutions of reputable credit and therefore bear
    minimal risk.

The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its suppliers
    and customers and, with the exception of certain financing
    transactions, does not require collateral from its customers.
    The Company’s customers are primarily original equipment
    manufacturers of passenger cars, sport-utility vehicles,
    crossover vehicles, trucks, commercial transportation products
    and industrial equipment.

Some automotive parts suppliers continue to experience commodity
    cost pressures and the effects of industry overcapacity. These
    factors have increased pressure on the industry’s supply
    base, as suppliers cope with higher commodity costs, lower
    production volumes and other challenges. The Company receives
    certain of its raw materials from sole suppliers or a limited
    number of suppliers. The inability of a supplier to fulfill
    supply requirements of the Company could materially affect
    future operating results.

Principles of consolidation

The Consolidated Financial
    Statements include all majority-owned subsidiaries. All
    inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
    consolidation.

Revenue recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when
    title and risk of loss pass to the customer, which is usually
    upon shipment of product. Although the Company may enter into
    long-term supply agreements with its major customers, each
    shipment of goods is treated as a separate sale and the price is
    not fixed over the life of the agreements.

Cash

Cash is valued at fair market value. It is the
    Company’s policy to classify all highly liquid investments
    with original maturities of three months or less as cash.

Marketable securities

Marketable securities are
    classified as available-for-sale. These investments are stated
    at fair value with any unrealized holding gains or losses, net
    of tax, included as a component of stockholders’ equity
    until realized.

See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information on marketable securities.

Accounts receivable

The Company securitizes and sells
    certain receivables through third party financial institutions
    without recourse. The amount sold can vary each month based on
    the amount of underlying receivables. The Company continues to
    administer the collection of these receivables on behalf of the
    third party. The maximum size of the facility has been set at
    $50 million since fourth quarter 2003.

During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, total
    cash proceeds from sales of accounts receivable were
    $600 million. The Company paid servicing fees related to
    these receivables of $1.9 million, $2.9 million and
    $2.7 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. These
    amounts are recorded in interest expense and finance



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

charges in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. At
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had sold
    $50 million of receivables under a Receivables Transfer
    Agreement for face value without recourse.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost
    or market. Cost of U.S. inventories is determined by the

last-in,

first-out (“LIFO”) method, while the foreign
    operations use the

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) or average-cost methods. Inventory
    held by U.S. operations was $124.1 million and
    $135.9 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. Such inventories, if valued at current cost
    instead of LIFO, would have been greater by $16.6 million
    in 2008 and $13.5 million in 2007.

See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information on inventories.

Pre-production costs related to long-term supply arrangements

Engineering, research and development, and other design and
    development costs for products sold on long-term supply
    arrangements are expensed as incurred unless the Company has a
    contractual guarantee for reimbursement from the customer. Costs
    for molds, dies and other tools used to make products sold on
    long-term supply arrangements for which the Company either has
    title to the assets or has the non-cancelable right to use the
    assets during the term of the supply arrangement are capitalized
    in property, plant and equipment. Capitalized items specifically
    designed for a supply arrangement are amortized to cost of sales
    over the shorter of the term of the arrangement or over the
    estimated useful lives of the assets, typically 3 to
    5 years. Carrying values of assets capitalized according to
    the foregoing policy are reviewed for impairment when events and
    circumstances warrant such a review. Costs for molds, dies and
    other tools used to make products sold on long-term supply
    arrangements for which the Company has a contractual guarantee
    for lump sum reimbursement from the customer are capitalized in
    prepayments and other current assets.

Property, plant and equipment and depreciation

Property,
    plant and equipment are valued at cost less accumulated
    depreciation. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and renewals
    of relatively minor items are generally charged to expense as
    incurred. Renewals of significant items are capitalized.
    Depreciation is computed generally on a straight-line basis over
    the estimated useful lives of the assets. Useful lives for
    buildings range from 15 to 40 years and useful lives for
    machinery and equipment range from 3 to 12 years. For
    income tax purposes, accelerated methods of depreciation are
    generally used.

See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information on property, plant and equipment and
    depreciation.

Impairment of long-lived assets

The Company reviews the
    carrying value of its long-lived assets, whether held for use or
    disposal, including other intangible assets, when events and
    circumstances warrant such a review. This review is performed
    using estimates of future cash flows. If the carrying value of a
    long-lived asset is considered impaired, an impairment charge is
    recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the
    long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. Management believes
    that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value
    assumptions are reasonable; however, changes in assumptions
    underlying these estimates could affect the evaluations.
    Long-lived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of
    their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.
    Significant judgments and estimates used by management when
    evaluating long-lived assets for impairment include: (i) an
    assessment as to whether an adverse event or circumstance has
    triggered the need for an impairment review; and
    (ii) undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset.
    The Company recognized $72.9 million and $56.4 million
    in impairment of long-lived assets as part of restructuring
    expenses in 2008 and 2006, respectively.

See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information regarding the Company’s 2006 and 2008
    impairment of long-lived assets.

Goodwill and other intangible assets

Under Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,

Goodwill and
    Other Intangible Assets

, goodwill is no longer amortized;
    however, it must be tested for impairment at least annually. In
    the fourth quarter of each year, or when events and
    circumstances warrant such a review, the Company reviews the
    goodwill of all of its reporting units for impairment. The fair
    value of the Company’s businesses used in the determination
    of goodwill impairment is computed using the expected present



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

value of associated future cash flows. This review requires the
    Company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the
    extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and
    growth rates. The cash flows are estimated over a significant
    future period of time, which makes those estimates and
    assumptions subject to an even higher degree of uncertainty. The
    Company also utilizes market valuation models and other
    financial ratios, which require the Company to make certain
    assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those
    models to its assets and businesses. The Company believes that
    the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated
    fair values of each of its reporting units are reasonable.
    However, different assumptions could materially affect the
    estimated fair value. The Company recognized goodwill impairment
    of $156.8 million in the Engine segment in 2008 and
    $0.2 million in the Drivetrain segment in 2006. No goodwill
    impairment was recorded in 2007.

See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information regarding goodwill.

Product warranty

The Company provides warranties on some
    of its products. The warranty terms are typically from one to
    three years. Provisions for estimated expenses related to
    product warranty are made at the time products are sold. These
    estimates are established using historical information about the
    nature, frequency, and average cost of warranty claim
    settlements as well as product manufacturing and industry
    developments and recoveries from third parties. Management
    actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to
    improve product quality and minimize warranty claims. Management
    believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate; however,
    actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates,
    requiring adjustments to the accrual. The accrual is represented
    in both current and non-current liabilities on the balance sheet.

See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information on product warranties.

Other loss accruals and valuation allowances

The Company
    has numerous other loss exposures, such as customer claims,
    workers’ compensation claims, litigation, and
    recoverability of assets. Establishing loss accruals or
    valuation allowances for these matters requires the use of
    estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and
    ultimate realization. The Company estimates losses under the
    programs using consistent and appropriate methods; however,
    changes to its assumptions could materially affect its recorded
    accrued liabilities for loss or asset valuation allowances.

Derivative financial instruments

The Company recognizes
    that certain normal business transactions generate risk.
    Examples of risks include exposure to exchange rate risk related
    to transactions denominated in currencies other than the
    functional currency, changes in cost of major raw materials and
    supplies, and changes in interest rates. It is the objective and
    responsibility of the Company to assess the impact of these
    transaction risks, and offer protection from selected risks
    through various methods including financial derivatives.
    Virtually all derivative instruments held by the Company are
    designated as hedges, have high correlation with the underlying
    exposure and are highly effective in offsetting underlying price
    movements. Accordingly, gains and losses from changes in
    qualifying hedge fair values are matched with the underlying
    transactions. All hedge instruments are carried at their fair
    value based on quoted market prices for contracts with similar
    maturities. The Company does not engage in any derivative
    transactions for purposes other than hedging specific risks.

See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information on derivative financial instruments.

Foreign currency

The financial statements of foreign
    subsidiaries are translated to U.S. Dollars using the
    period-end exchange rate for assets and liabilities and an
    average exchange rate for each period for revenues, expenses,
    and capital expenditures. The local currency is the functional
    currency for substantially all the Company’s foreign
    subsidiaries. Translation adjustments for foreign subsidiaries
    are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss) in stockholders’ equity. The Company
    recognizes transaction gains and losses arising from
    fluctuations in currency exchange rates on transactions
    denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in
    earnings as incurred, except for those transactions which hedge
    purchase commitments and for those intercompany balances which
    are designated as long-term investments. Net income



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

included a foreign currency transaction loss of
    $5.8 million in 2008. Net income included foreign currency
    transaction gains of $4.4 million and $1.6 million in
    2007 and 2006, respectively.

See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information on other comprehensive income (loss).

New Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2006, the FASB
    issued Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty
    in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109

(“FIN 48”). FIN 48
    prescribes a consistent recognition threshold and measurement
    attribute, as well as clear criteria for subsequently
    recognizing, derecognizing and measuring such tax positions for
    financial statement purposes. FIN 48 also requires expanded
    disclosure with respect to the uncertainty in income taxes. The
    Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on January 1,
    2007. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the
    Company recognized a $16.6 million reduction to its
    January 1, 2007 retained earnings balance.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“FAS 157”). FAS 157 defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP and
    expands disclosures about fair value measurements. On
    January 1, 2008, the Company partially adopted as required,
    FAS 157. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for more information regarding the implementation of
    FAS 157.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for
    Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

(“FAS 159”). FAS 159 allows entities to
    irrevocably elect to recognize most financial assets and
    financial liabilities at fair value on an

instrument-by-instrument

basis. The stated objective of FAS 159 is to improve
    financial reporting by giving entities the opportunity to elect
    to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair
    value in order to mitigate earnings volatility caused when
    related assets and liabilities are measured differently.
    FAS 159 is effective for the Company beginning with its
    quarter ending March 31, 2008. The Company chose to not
    make the election to adopt.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 141 (Revised 2007),

Business
    Combinations

(“FAS 141(R)”). FAS 141(R)
    establishes principles and requirements for recognizing
    identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed,
    noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, goodwill acquired in
    the combination or the gain from a bargain purchase, and
    disclosure requirements. Under this revised statement, all costs
    incurred to effect an acquisition will be recognized separately
    from the acquisition. Also, restructuring costs that are
    expected but the acquirer is not obligated to incur will be
    recognized separately from the acquisition. FAS 141(R) is
    effective for the Company beginning with its quarter ending
    March 31, 2009. The Company has incurred $3.2 million
    of on-going acquisition related costs, which will be expensed
    upon adoption of FAS 141(R) in the first quarter of 2009.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests
    in Consolidated Financial Statements

(“FAS 160”). FAS 160 requires that
    ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than
    the parent are clearly identified. In addition, it requires that
    the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent
    and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and
    presented on the face of the income statement. FAS 160 is
    effective for the Company beginning with its quarter ending
    March 31, 2009. The adoption of FAS 160 is not
    expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position

No. FAS 157-2

(“FSP

FAS 157-2”).

FSP

FAS 157-2

delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial
    assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or
    disclosed in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis to
    fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. Refer to
    Note 10, “Fair Value Measurements” of the Notes
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion
    of the Company’s partial adoption of FSP

FAS 157-2.

In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments
    and Hedging Activities (“FAS 161”). FAS 161
    requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures about how and
    why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative
    instruments and related



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

hedged items are accounted for under Statement 133 and its
    related interpretations, and how derivative instruments and
    related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position,
    financial performance, and cash flows. FAS 161 is effective
    for the Company beginning with its quarter ending March 31,
    2009. The adoption of FAS 161 is not expected to have a
    material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

In December 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position 132(R)-1,
    Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan
    Assets (“FAS 132(R)-1”). FAS 132(R)-1
    requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures about how
    investment allocation decisions are made, the major categories
    of plan assets, the inputs and valuation techniques used to
    measure fair value of plan assets, the effect of fair value
    measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in
    plan assets for the period, and significant concentrations of
    risk within plan assets. FAS 132(R)-1 is effective for the
    Company beginning with its year ending December 31, 2009.
    The Company is currently assessing the potential impacts, if
    any, on its consolidated financial statements.

In December 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position

140-4

and
    Financial Interpretation 46(R)-8, Disclosures by Public Entities
    (Enterprises) about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests
    in Variable Interest Entities

(“FSP 140-4

and FIN 46(R)-8”).

FSP 140-4

and FIN 46(R)-8 requires entities to provide enhanced
    disclosures about how an entity accounts for transfers of
    financial assets, the nature of involvement, if any, after the
    financial asset sale and the nature of any restrictions on
    assets reported by an entity in its statement of financial
    position that relates to a transferred financial asset,
    including the carrying amounts of such assets. The Company has
    adjusted its disclosures to be complaint with

FSP 140-4

and

FIN 46(R)-8

at December 31, 2008.

The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate
    for 2008 of 237.9% compared with rates of 26.5% in 2007 and
    12.0% in 2006. The effective tax rate of 237.9% for 2008 differs
    from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the
    non-deductibility of the $156.8 million impairment charge
    in 2008 related to BERU goodwill; a reduction in
    U.S. income; foreign rates, which differ from those in the
    U.S.; the realization of certain business tax credits including
    R&D and foreign tax credits; and favorable permanent
    differences between book and tax treatment for items, including
    equity in affiliates’ earnings.

The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation
    No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
    (“FIN 48”), on January 1, 2007. As a result
    of the implementation of FIN 48, the Company recognized a
    $16.6 million reduction to the January 1, 2007 balance
    of retained earnings. At December 31, 2007, the Company
    reported $71.7 million of unrecognized tax benefits;
    approximately $62.5 million represent the amount that, if
    recognized, would affect the Company’s global effective
    income tax rate in future periods.

Following is a reconciliation of the Company’s total gross
    unrecognized tax benefits for the year-to-date periods ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Of the total
    $61.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of
    December 31, 2008, approximately $51.1 million of this
    total represents the amount that, if recognized, would affect
    the Company’s effective income tax rate in future periods.
    This amount differs from the gross unrecognized tax benefits
    presented in the table due to the decrease in the
    U.S. federal income taxes which would occur upon
    recognition of the state tax benefits included therein.

In the first quarter of 2008, the Company made a
    $6.6 million cash payment to the IRS to resolve agreed upon
    issues of the ongoing IRS examination of the Company’s

2002-2004

tax years. There was a reduction in the first quarter of 2008 of
    $6.7 million related to the Company’s unrecognized tax
    benefits balance due to the settlement of the agreed upon issues
    primarily related to the Extraterritorial Income Exclusion for
    the

2002-2004

tax years. The Company is currently in the appeals process on
    disputed issues related to the



NOTES TO

IRS audit, which is not expected to be resolved by
    December 31, 2009. Other possible changes in the
    unrecognized tax benefits balance related to other examinations
    cannot be reasonably estimated within the next 12 months.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The Company had
    $9.7 million accrued at January 1, 2008 for the
    payment of any such interest and penalties. The Company had
    approximately $11.4 million for the payment of interest and
    penalties accrued at December 31, 2008.

The Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns
    in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various states and
    foreign jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to
    income tax examinations by tax authorities in its major tax
    jurisdictions as follows:

    amounts from the U.S. and Korea. The other non-current
    liabilities are primarily comprised of amounts from Germany,
    Hungary, Italy, Monaco and the U.K.

The Company has a U.S. capital loss carryforward of
    $20.4 million, which will expire in 2010, 2011, 2012 and
    2013. A valuation allowance of $16.9 million has been
    recorded for the tax effect of some of this loss carryforward.

The foreign tax credits of $78.3 million will expire
    beginning in 2013 through 2018. A valuation allowance of
    $13.5 million has been recorded for the tax effect of some
    of this carryforward.

At December 31, 2008, certain

non-U.S. subsidiaries

have net operating loss carryforwards totaling
    $63.5 million that are available to offset future taxable
    income. Carryforwards of $34.6 million expire at various
    dates from 2009 through 2016 and the balance has no expiration
    date. A valuation allowance of $1.5 million has been
    recorded for the tax effect on $5.5 million of the loss
    carryforwards. Any benefit resulting from the utilization of
    $6.0 million of the operating loss carryforwards will be
    applied to reduce goodwill related to the BERU acquisition.
    Certain U.S. subsidiaries have state net operating loss
    carryforwards totaling $240.7 million and
    235.2 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, for which a
    non-current deferred tax asset has been established in 2008 on
    $7.7 million of the loss carryforward and the remainder is
    completely offset by a valuation allowance due to risk of
    realization. Certain non-U.S. subsidiaries located in China and
    Korea have tax exemptions or tax holidays. The cumulative impact
    of these tax exemptions or tax holidays to the effective tax
    rate in 2008 was negligible.

No deferred income taxes have been provided on the excess of the
    amount for financial reporting over the tax basis of investments
    in foreign subsidiaries or foreign equity affiliates totaling
    $1,465.6 million in 2008, as these amounts are essentially
    permanent in nature. The excess amount will become taxable upon
    repatriation of assets, sale, or liquidation of the investment.
    It is not practicable to determine the unrecognized deferred tax
    liability on the excess amount because the actual tax liability
    on the excess amount, if any, is dependent on circumstances
    existing when remittance occurs.

NOTE 5

MARKETABLE
    SECURITIES

As of December 31, 2008 the Company had no investments in
    marketable securities. At December 31, 2007, the Company
    had $14.6 million in marketable securities, primarily bank
    notes. The securities are carried at fair value with the
    unrealized gain or loss, net of tax, reported in other
    comprehensive income (loss). As of December 31, 2007,
    $7.3 million of the contractual maturities are within one
    to five years and $7.3 million are due beyond five years.
    Gross proceeds from sales of marketable securities were
    $14.6 million and $60.4 million in 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. No gain or loss was realized in 2008. A net
    realized loss of $0.1 million, based on specific
    identification of securities sold, has been reported in other
    income for the year ended December 31, 2007.

GOODWILL
    AND OTHER INTANGIBLES

As of September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2008, the
    Company recorded an impairment charge of €104.3
    $(146.8) million and €7.2 $(10.0) million,
    respectively, to adjust BERU’s goodwill to its estimated
    fair value. The impairment charge is attributable to a decrease
    in the operating unit’s estimated fair value based
    primarily upon



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the effect of the decline in European market conditions on
    current and projected operating results. The impairment charge
    was also impacted by the recognition of additional goodwill in
    the second quarter of 2008, which was based on the court
    determined buy out value of €71.32 per share related to the
    Domination and Profit Transfer Agreement. Any differences in
    future results compared to management’s estimates could
    result in fair values different from estimated fair values,
    which could materially impact the Company’s future results
    of operations and financial condition.

See Note 20, “Recent Transactions”, for further
    discussion on the BERU AG Domination and Profit Transfer
    Agreement.

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the twelve

The Company’s long-term debt includes various financial
    covenants, none of which are expected to restrict future
    operations.

The Company has a multi-currency revolving credit facility,
    which provides for borrowings up to $600 million through
    July 22, 2009. At December 31, 2008 and
    December 31, 2007 there were no outstanding borrowings
    under the facility. The credit agreement is subject to the usual
    terms and conditions applied by banks to an investment grade
    company. The two key covenants of the credit agreement are a net
    worth test and a debt compared to EBITDA (“Earnings Before
    Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization”) test. The
    Company was in compliance with all covenants at
    December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the
    Company had



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

outstanding letters of credit of $21.4 million and
    $22.0 million, respectively. The letters of credit
    typically act as a guarantee of payment to certain third parties
    in accordance with specified terms and conditions.

As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the estimated fair values
    of the Company’s senior unsecured notes totaled
    $532.3 million and $572.4 million, respectively. The
    estimated fair values were $6.7 million lower in 2008 and
    $33.7 million higher in 2007 than their respective carrying
    values. Fair market values are developed by the use of estimates
    obtained from brokers and other appropriate valuation techniques
    based on information available as of year-end. The fair value
    estimates do not necessarily reflect the values the Company
    could realize in the current markets.

NOTE 10

FAIR
    VALUE MEASUREMENTS

On January 1, 2008, the Company partially adopted as
    required, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 157 — “Fair Value Measurements”
    (“SFAS 157”) which expands the disclosure of fair
    value measurements and its impact on the Company’s
    financial statements. In February 2008, the FASB issued

FSP 157-2,

which delayed the effective date of adoption with respect to
    certain non-financial assets and liabilities until 2009. We
    intend to defer the adoption of SFAS 157 with respect to
    certain non-financial assets and liabilities as permitted.

Statement No. 157 emphasizes that fair value is a
    market-based measurement, not an entity specific measurement.
    Therefore, a fair value measurement should be determined based
    on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an
    asset or liability. As a basis for considering market
    participant assumptions in fair value measurements,
    SFAS 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy, which
    prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair values as follows:

Level 1:

Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;

Level 2:

Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are
    observable either directly or indirectly; and

Level 3:

Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data,
    which require the reporting entity to develop its own
    assumptions.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are based on one
    or more of the following three valuation techniques noted in
    SFAS 157:

A.

Market approach: Prices and other relevant information generated
    by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets
    or liabilities.

B.

Cost approach: Amount that would be required to replace the
    service capacity of an asset (replacement cost).

C.

Income approach: Techniques to convert future amounts to a
    single present amount based upon market expectations (including
    present value techniques, option-pricing and excess earnings
    models).

NOTE 11

FINANCIAL
    INSTRUMENTS

The Company’s financial instruments include cash,
    marketable securities, trade receivables, trade payables, and
    notes payable. Due to the short-term nature of these
    instruments, the book value approximates fair value. The
    Company’s financial instruments also include long-term
    debt, interest rate and currency swaps, commodity forward
    contracts, and foreign currency forward contracts. All
    derivative contracts are placed with counterparties that have an
    S&P, or equivalent, credit rating of “A−”
    or better at the time of the contract placement.

The Company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its
    exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to
    minimize its interest costs. The Company selectively uses
    interest rate swaps to reduce market value risk associated with
    changes in interest rates (fair value hedges). The Company also
    selectively uses cross-currency swaps to hedge the foreign
    currency exposure associated with our net investment in certain
    foreign operations (net investment hedges).

(a)

The maturity of the swaps corresponds with the maturity of the
    hedged item as noted in the debt summary, unless otherwise
    indicated.

Effectiveness for fair value and net investment hedges is
    assessed at the inception of the hedging relationship. If
    specified criteria for the assumption of effectiveness are not
    met at hedge inception, effectiveness is assessed quarterly.
    Ineffectiveness is measured quarterly and results are recognized
    in earnings.

The interest rate swaps that are fair value hedges were
    determined to be exempt from ongoing tests of their
    effectiveness as hedges at the time of the hedge inception. This
    determination was made based upon the fact that the swaps
    matched the underlying debt terms for the following factors:
    notional amount, fixed interest rate, interest settlement dates,
    and maturity date. Additionally, the fair value of the swap was
    zero at the time of inception, the variable rate is based on a
    benchmark, with no floor or ceiling, and the interest bearing
    liability is not pre-payable at a price other than its fair
    value.

Fair values of fixed to floating interest rate swaps are based
    on observable inputs, such as interest rate, yield curves,
    credit risks, and other external valuation methodology
    (Level 2 inputs under SFAS 157). See Note 10 for
    further discussion of fair value measurements. As of
    December 31, 2008, the fair values of the fixed to floating
    interest rate swaps were recorded as a current asset of
    $0.2 million and a non-current asset of $43.4 and a
    corresponding increase in short-term debt of $0.2 million
    and an increase in long-term debt of $43.4 million. As of
    December 31, 2007, the fair values of the fixed to floating
    interest rate swaps were recorded as a non-current asset of
    $9.1 million and a corresponding increase in long-term debt
    of $9.1 million. No hedge ineffectiveness was recognized in
    relation to fixed to floating swaps.

Fair values of cross currency swaps are based on observable
    inputs, such as interest rate, yield curves, credit risks,
    currency exchange rates and other external valuation methodology
    (Level 2 inputs under SFAS 157). See Note 10 for
    further discussion of fair value measurements. As of
    December 31, 2008, the fair values of the cross currency
    swaps were recorded as a current liability of $9.0 million
    and a non-current liability of $55.1 million.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Hedge ineffectiveness of $4.6 million was recognized as of
    December 31, 2008 in relation to cross currency swaps. As
    of December 31, 2007, the fair values of the cross currency
    swaps were recorded as a non-current liability of
    $33.7 million. As of December 31, 2008, the fair value
    of a foreign currency forward contract designated as a net
    investment hedge was recorded as a current asset of
    $0.2 million. As of December 31, 2007, the fair value
    of foreign currency forward contracts designated as a net
    investment hedge was negligible.

The Company also entered into certain commodity derivative
    instruments to protect against commodity price changes related
    to forecasted raw material and supplies purchases. The primary
    purpose of the commodity price hedging activities is to manage
    the volatility associated with these forecasted purchases. The
    Company primarily utilizes forward and option contracts, which
    are designated as cash flow hedges. As of December 31,
    2008, the Company had forward and option commodity contracts
    with a total notional value of $50.2 million. The fair
    values for certain commodity derivative instruments are based on
    Level 2 evidence (for example, future prices reported on
    commodity exchanges) under SFAS 157. See Note 10 for
    further discussion of fair value measurements. As of
    December 31, 2008, the Company was holding commodity
    derivatives with positive and negative fair market values of
    2.1 million and $(16.3) million, respectively, of
    which $1.0 million in gains and $(15.1) million in
    losses mature in less than one year. To the extent that
    derivative instruments are deemed to be effective as defined by
    FAS 133, gains and losses arising from these contracts are
    deferred in other comprehensive income (loss). Such gains and
    losses will be reclassified into income as the underlying
    operating transactions are realized. Gains and losses not
    qualifying for deferral treatment have been credited/charged to
    income as they are recognized. Losses not qualifying for
    deferral associated with these contracts for December 31,
    2008 were $(0.9) million, all of which mature in less than
    one year. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had forward
    and option commodity contracts with a total notional value of
    $67.3 million. As of December 31, 2007, the Company
    was holding commodity derivatives with positive and negative
    fair market values of $0.1 million and
    $(18.4) million, respectively, of which $0.1 million
    in gains and $(14.5) million in losses mature in less than
    one year. At December 31, 2007, losses not qualifying for
    deferral were $(0.1) million.

The Company uses foreign exchange forward and option contracts
    to protect against exchange rate movements for forecasted cash
    flows for purchases, operating expenses or sales transactions
    designated in currencies other than the functional currency of
    the operating unit. Most contracts mature in less than one year,
    however, certain long-term commitments are covered by forward
    currency arrangements to protect against currency risk through
    2011. Foreign currency contracts require the Company, at a
    future date, to either buy or sell foreign currency in exchange
    for the operating units’ local currency. At
    December 31, 2008, contracts were outstanding to buy or
    sell the British Pound Sterling, Brazilian Real, Euro, Hungarian
    Forint, Indian Rupee, Japanese Yen, Mexican Peso, South Korean
    Won and U.S. Dollar. To the extent that derivative
    instruments are deemed to be effective as defined by
    FAS 133, gains and losses arising from these contracts are
    deferred in other comprehensive income. Such gains and losses
    will be reclassified into income as the underlying operating
    transactions are realized. Any gains or losses not qualifying
    for deferral are credited/charged to income as they are
    recognized. The fair value of foreign exchange forward and
    option contracts are based on Level 2 inputs under
    SFAS 157, such as quoted exchange rates by various
    exchanges. See Note 10 for further discussion of fair value
    measurements. As of December 31, 2008, the Company was
    holding foreign exchange derivatives with positive and negative
    fair market values of $10.2 million and
    $(61.8) million, respectively, of which $9.9 million
    in gains and $(36.3) million in losses mature in less than
    one year. As of December 31, 2008, $1.0 million of
    gains and $(8.2) million of losses did not qualify for
    deferral. As of December 31, 2007, the Company was holding
    foreign exchange derivatives with a positive market value of
    $1.9 million, all maturing in less than one year, and
    derivatives contracts with a negative value of
    $(9.9) million, with $(5.9) million maturing in less
    than one year. As of December 31, 2007, there were no gains
    or losses which did not qualify for deferral.

RETIREMENT
    BENEFIT PLANS

The Company sponsors various defined contribution savings plans
    primarily in the U.S. that allow employees to contribute a
    portion of their pre-tax

and/or

after-tax income in accordance with plan specified guidelines.
    Under specified conditions, the Company will make contributions
    to the plans

and/or

match

percentage of the employee contributions up to certain limits.
    Total expense related to the defined contribution plans was
    $22.1 million in 2008 and $23.7 million in 2007 and
    2006.

The Company has a number of defined benefit pension plans and
    other post employment benefit plans covering eligible salaried
    and hourly employees and their dependents. The defined pension
    benefits provided are primarily based on (i) years of
    service and (ii) average compensation or a monthly
    retirement benefit amount. The Company provides defined benefit
    pension plans in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Japan, South Korea,
    Italy, France, Ireland, Monaco and Mexico. The other post
    employment benefit plans, which provide medical and life
    insurance benefits, are unfunded plans. The pension and other
    post employment benefit plans in the U.S. have been closed
    to new employees since 1995. The measurement date for all plans
    is December 31.

In September 2008 and 2007, the Company made changes to its
    U.S. retiree medical program that impact certain union and
    non-union active employees with a future retiree benefit and
    current retirees participating in a health care plan. The effect
    of the changes to both groups is that most members will pay a
    higher percentage of the annual premium for Company-sponsored
    retiree medical coverage between ages 60 to 64, and neither
    group will receive Company-sponsored Medicare Supplemental
    coverage once entitled to Medicare. Instead, certain active
    employees will receive a lump sum credit into a non-contributory
    cash balance pension plan earning interest each year. Current
    retirees will receive an annual per member allowance toward the
    purchase of individual Medicare Supplemental coverage and for
    reimbursement of medical

out-of-pocket

expenses.

During fourth quarter 2006, the Company evaluated the
    competitiveness of its North American facilities, as well as its
    long-term capacity needs. As a result, the Company will be
    closing the drivetrain plant in Muncie, Indiana and has adjusted
    the carrying values of other assets, primarily related to its
    four-wheel drive transfer case product line. One of the impacts
    of this fourth quarter restructuring was the Company’s
    recognition of a $6.8 million pension curtailment expense.
    See Note 19 for further details on the Company’s 2006
    restructuring activities.

    Company’s defined contribution and defined benefit pension
    plans and the other post employment defined benefit plans.

The Company’s investment strategy is to maintain actual
    asset weightings within a preset range of target allocations.
    The Company believes these ranges represent an appropriate risk
    profile for the planned benefit payments of the plans based on
    the timing of the estimated benefit payments. Within each asset
    category, separate portfolios are maintained for additional
    diversification. Investment managers are retained within each
    asset category to manage each portfolio against its benchmark.
    Each investment manager has appropriate investment guidelines.
    In addition, the entire portfolio is evaluated against a
    relevant peer group. The defined benefit pension plans did not
    hold any Company securities as investments as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007. A portion of pension assets are
    invested in common and comingled trusts.

The Company expects to contribute a total of $10 million to
    $20 million into all of its defined benefit pension plans
    during 2009.

The estimated net loss for the defined benefit pension plans
    that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive

    prior service credit for the other post employment plans that
    will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss) into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year
    are $11.1 million and $(14.0) million, respectively.

The Company’s approach to establishing the discount rate is
    based upon the market yields of high-quality corporate bonds,
    with appropriate consideration of each plan’s defined
    benefit payment terms and duration of the liabilities. The
    discount rate assumption is typically rounded up or down to the
    nearest 25 basis points for each plan.

The Company determines its expected return on plan asset
    assumptions by evaluating estimates of future market returns and
    the plans’ asset allocation. The Company also considers the
    impact of active management of the plans’ invested assets.
    The Company’s expected return on assets assumption reflects
    the asset allocation of each plan. The Company’s assumed
    long-term rate of return on assets for its U.S. pension
    plans was 8.75% for 2008, 2007 and 2006. The Company anticipates
    a change in the long-term rate of return on U.S. pension
    plan assets to 7.50% for 2009. The Company’s assumed
    long-term rate of return on assets for its U.K. pension plan was
    7.25% for 2008, 2007 and 2006. The Company anticipates a change
    in the long-term rate of return on U.K. pension plan assets to
    7.50% for 2009.

NOTE 13

STOCK
    INCENTIVE PLANS

On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(“FAS 123R”), which
    required the Company to measure all employee stock-based
    compensation awards using a fair value method and record the
    related expense in the financial statements. The Company elected
    to use the modified prospective transition method, which
    requires that compensation cost be recognized in the financial
    statements for all awards granted after the date of adoption as
    well as for existing awards for which the requisite service has
    not been rendered as of the date of adoption and requires that
    prior periods not be restated. All periods presented prior to
    January 1, 2006 were accounted for in accordance with
    Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting
    for Stock Issued to Employees

(“APB No. 25”).
    Accordingly, no compensation cost was recognized for fixed stock
    options prior to January 1, 2006 because the exercise price
    of the stock options exceeded or equaled the market value of the
    Company’s common stock at the date of grant, which is the
    measurement date.

Under the Company’s 1993 Stock Incentive Plan (“1993
    Plan”), the Company granted options to purchase shares of
    the Company’s common stock at the fair market value on the
    date of grant. The options vest over periods up to three years
    and have a term of ten years from date of grant. As of
    December 31, 2003, there were no options available for
    future grants under the 1993 plan. The 1993 plan expired at the
    end of 2003 and was replaced by the Company’s 2004 Stock
    Incentive Plan, which was amended at the Company’s 2006
    Annual Stockholders Meeting, among other things, to increase the
    number of shares available for issuance under the plan. Under
    the BorgWarner Inc. Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive
    Plan (“2004 Stock Incentive Plan”), the number of
    shares authorized for grant was 10,000,000, of which
    approximately 1,648,000 shares are available for future
    issuance. As of December 31, 2008, there were a total of
    5,797,675 outstanding options under the 1993 and 2004 Stock
    Incentive Plans.

Stock option compensation expense reduced income before income
    taxes and net earnings by $12.2 million and
    $9.1 million $(0.08 per basic and diluted share) and by
    $16.3 million and $11.9 million $(0.10 per basic and
    diluted share) for the years ended December 31, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. Stock option compensation expense affected
    both operating activities $(21.2 million and
    $16.3 million non-cash charge backs) and financing
    activities $(3.1 million and $4.4 million tax
    benefits) of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the
    years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock
    options at December 31, 2008 is approximately
    $8.7 million. This cost is expected to be recognized over
    the next 1.1 years. On a weighted average basis, this cost
    is expected to be recognized over 0.5 year.

Restricted Stock

At its November 2007 meeting, our
    Compensation Committee decided that restricted common stock
    would be awarded in place of stock options for the 2008
    long-term incentive award grants to employees. These restricted
    shares for employees vest fifty percent after two years and the
    remainder after three years from the date of grant. The Company
    also grants restricted common stock to its non-employee
    directors. For non-employee directors restricted shares vest
    ratably on the anniversary of the date of the grant over a
    period of three years. The market value of the Company’s
    restricted common stock at the date of grant determines the
    value of the restricted common stock. In February 2008, a grant
    of 390,873 restricted shares was awarded to employees under the
    2004 Stock Incentive Plan. The value of the awards is recorded
    as unearned compensation within capital in excess of par value
    in stockholders’ equity, and is amortized as compensation
    expense over the restriction periods. The Company recognized
    compensation expense of $8.9 million in 2008 and
    $1.6 million in 2007 related to restricted stock for
    employees. The Company recognized compensation expense of
    $0.7 million in 2008 and $0.6 million in 2007 and 2006
    related to restricted stock for non-employee directors.

CONTINGENCIES

In the normal course of business the Company and its
    subsidiaries are parties to various commercial and legal claims,
    actions and complaints, including matters involving warranty
    claims, intellectual property claims, general liability and
    various other risks. It is not possible to predict with
    certainty whether or not the Company and its subsidiaries will
    ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal
    matters or, if not, what the impact might be. The Company’s
    environmental and product liability contingencies are discussed
    separately below. The Company’s management does not expect
    that the results in any of these commercial and legal claims,
    actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect on
    the Company’s results of operations, financial position or
    cash flows.

Litigation
    Outcome

In January 2006, BorgWarner Diversified Transmission Products
    Inc (“DTP”), a subsidiary of the Company, filed a
    declaratory judgment action in United States District Court,
    Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis Division) against the
    United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implements
    Workers of America (“UAW”) Local No. 287 and
    Gerald Poor, individually and as the representative of a
    defendant class. DTP sought the Court’s affirmation that
    DTP did not violate the Labor-Management Relations Act or the
    Employee Retirement Income Security Act by unilaterally amending
    certain medical plans effective April 1, 2006 and
    October 1, 2006, prior to the expiration of the current
    collective bargaining agreements. On September 10, 2008,
    the Court found that DTP’s reservation of the right to make
    such amendments reducing the level of benefits provided to
    retirees was limited by its collectively bargained health
    insurance agreement with the UAW, which does not expire until
    April 24, 2009. Thus, the amendments were untimely. In 2008
    the Company recorded a charge of $4.0 million as a result
    of the Court’s decision.

The Company has communicated its plan to reduce the level of
    benefits provided to the retirees to make them comparable to
    other Company retiree benefit plans. The change will be
    effective following expiration of the health insurance agreement
    in April 24, 2009.

Environmental

The Company and certain of its current and former direct and
    indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have
    been identified by the United States Environmental Protection
    Agency and certain state environmental agencies and private
    parties as potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) at
    various hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive
    Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
    (“Superfund”) and equivalent state laws and, as such,
    may presently be liable for the cost of

clean-up

and
    other remedial activities at 35 such sites. Responsibility for

clean-up

and
    other remedial activities at a Superfund site is typically
    shared among PRPs based on an allocation formula.

The Company believes that none of these matters, individually or
    in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its
    results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
    Generally, this is because either the estimates of the maximum
    potential liability at a site are not large or the liability
    will be shared with other PRPs, although no assurance can be
    given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter.

Based on information available to the Company (which in most
    cases includes: an estimate of allocation of liability among
    PRPs; the probability that other PRPs, many of whom are large,
    solvent public companies, will fully pay the cost apportioned to
    them; currently available information from PRPs

and/or

federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of
    contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs;
    remediation alternatives; and estimated legal fees), the Company
    has established an accrual for indicated environmental
    liabilities with a balance at December 31, 2008 of
    $11.9 million. The Company has accrued amounts that do not
    exceed $3.4 million related to any individual site and we
    do not believe that the costs related to any of these sites will
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of
    operations, cash flows or financial condition. The Company
    expects to pay out substantially all of the amounts accrued for
    environmental liability over the next three to five years.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In connection with the sale of Kuhlman Electric Corporation, the
    Company agreed to indemnify the buyer and Kuhlman Electric for
    certain environmental liabilities, then unknown to the Company,
    relating to certain operations of Kuhlman Electric that pre-date
    the Company’s 1999 acquisition of Kuhlman Electric. During
    2000, Kuhlman Electric notified the Company that it discovered
    potential environmental contamination at its Crystal Springs,
    Mississippi plant while undertaking an expansion of the plant.
    The Company is continuing to work with the Mississippi
    Department of Environmental Quality and Kuhlman Electric to
    investigate and remediate to the extent necessary, historical
    contamination at the plant and surrounding area. Kuhlman
    Electric and others, including the Company, were sued in
    numerous related lawsuits, in which multiple claimants alleged
    personal injury and property damage. In 2005, the Company and
    other defendants entered into settlements that resolved
    approximately 99% of the then known personal injury and property
    damage claims relating to the alleged environmental
    contamination. Those settlements involved payments by the
    Company of $28.5 million in the second half of 2005 and
    $15.7 million in the first quarter of 2006, in exchange
    for, among other things, dismissal with prejudice of these
    lawsuits.

In December 2007, a lawsuit was filed against Kuhlman Electric
    and others, including the Company, on behalf of approximately
    209 plaintiffs, alleging personal injury relating to the alleged
    environmental contamination. In August 2008, two similar
    lawsuits were filed against Kuhlman Electric and others,
    including the Company, on behalf of approximately 100 plaintiffs
    and 30 plaintiffs, respectively, alleging personal injury
    related to the alleged environmental contamination. Given the
    early stage of the litigation, the Company cannot make any
    predictions as to the outcome, but its current intent is to
    vigorously defend against the suits.

Conditional
    Asset Retirement Obligations

In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47,
    Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
    Obligations — an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 143 (“FIN 47”), which requires the
    Company to recognize legal obligations to perform asset
    retirements in which the timing

and/or

method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may
    or may not be within the control of the entity. Certain
    government regulations require the removal and disposal of
    asbestos from an existing facility at the time the facility
    undergoes major renovations or is demolished. The liability
    exists because the facility will not last forever, but it is
    conditional on future renovations (even if there are no
    immediate plans to remove the materials, which pose no health or
    safety hazard in their current condition). Similarly, government
    regulations require the removal or closure of underground
    storage tanks (“USTs”) and above ground storage tanks
    (“ASTs”) when their use ceases, the disposal of
    polychlorinated biphenyl (“PCB”) transformers and
    capacitors when their use ceases, and the disposal of used
    furnace bricks and liners, and lead-based paint in conjunction
    with facility renovations or demolition. The Company currently
    has 32 manufacturing locations that have been identified as
    containing these items. The fair value to remove and dispose of
    this material has been estimated and recorded at
    $1.4 million as of December 31, 2008 and
    $1.0 million as of December 31, 2007.

Product
    Liability

Like many other industrial companies who have historically
    operated in the U.S., the Company (or parties the Company is
    obligated to indemnify) continues to be named as one of many
    defendants in asbestos-related personal injury actions. We
    believe that the Company’s involvement is limited because,
    in general, these claims relate to a few types of automotive
    friction products that were manufactured many years ago and
    contained encapsulated asbestos. The nature of the fibers, the
    encapsulation and the manner of use lead the Company to believe
    that these products are highly unlikely to cause harm. As of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had approximately
    27,000 and 42,000 pending asbestos-related product liability
    claims, respectively. Of the 27,000 outstanding claims at
    December 31, 2008, approximately 16,000 are pending in just
    three jurisdictions, where significant tort and judicial reform
    activities are underway.

The Company’s policy is to aggressively defend against
    these lawsuits and the Company has been successful in obtaining
    dismissal of many claims without any payment. The Company
    expects that the vast majority of the pending asbestos-related
    product liability claims where it is a defendant (or has an
    obligation to indemnify a



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

defendant) will result in no payment being made by the Company
    or its insurers. In 2008, of the approximately 17,500 claims
    resolved, only 210 (1.2%) resulted in any payment being made to
    a claimant by or on behalf of the Company. In 2007, of the
    approximately 4,400 claims resolved, only 194 (4.4%) resulted in
    any payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the
    Company.

Prior to June 2004, the settlement and defense costs associated
    with all claims were covered by the Company’s primary layer
    insurance coverage, and these carriers administered, defended,
    settled and paid all claims under a funding arrangement. In June
    2004, primary layer insurance carriers notified the Company of
    the alleged exhaustion of their policy limits. This led the
    Company to access the next available layer of insurance
    coverage. Since June 2004, secondary layer insurers have paid
    asbestos-related litigation defense and settlement expenses
    pursuant to a funding arrangement. To date, the Company has paid
    $50.1 million in defense and indemnity in advance of
    insurers’ reimbursement and has received $14.2 million
    in cash from insurers. The outstanding balance of
    $35.9 million is expected to be fully recovered. Timing of
    the recovery is dependent on final resolution of the declaratory
    judgment action referred to below. At December 31, 2007,
    insurers owed $20.6 million in association with these
    claims.

At December 31, 2008, the Company has an estimated
    liability of $34.7 million for future claims resolutions,
    with a related asset of $34.7 million to recognize the
    insurance proceeds receivable by the Company for estimated
    losses related to claims that have yet to be resolved. Insurance
    carrier reimbursement of 100% is expected based on the
    Company’s experience, its insurance contracts and decisions
    received to date in the declaratory judgment action referred to
    below. At December 31, 2007, the comparable value of the
    insurance receivable and accrued liability was
    $39.6 million.

The amounts recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets related
    to the estimated future settlement of existing claims are as
    follows:

The Company cannot reasonably estimate possible losses, if any,
    in excess of those for which it has accrued, because it cannot
    predict how many additional claims may be brought against the
    Company (or parties the Company has an obligation to indemnify)
    in the future, the allegations in such claims, the possible
    outcomes, or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be
    enacted at the State or Federal levels.

A declaratory judgment action was filed in January 2004 in the
    Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois by Continental Casualty
    Company and related companies (“CNA”) against the
    Company and certain of its other historical general liability
    insurers. CNA provided the Company with both primary and
    additional layer insurance, and, in conjunction with other
    insurers, is currently defending and indemnifying the Company in
    its pending asbestos-related product liability claims. The
    lawsuit seeks to determine the extent of insurance coverage
    available to the Company including whether the available limits
    exhaust on a “per occurrence” or an
    “aggregate” basis, and to determine how the applicable
    coverage responsibilities should be apportioned. On
    August 15, 2005, the Court issued an interim order
    regarding the apportionment matter. The interim order has the
    effect of making insurers responsible for all defense and
    settlement costs pro rata to

time-on-the-risk,

with the pro-ration method to hold the insured harmless for
    periods of bankrupt or unavailable coverage. Appeals of



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the interim order were denied. However, the issue is reserved
    for appellate review at the end of the action. In addition to
    the primary insurance available for asbestos-related claims, the
    Company has substantial additional layers of insurance available
    for potential future asbestos-related product claims. As such,
    the Company continues to believe that its coverage is sufficient
    to meet foreseeable liabilities.

Although it is impossible to predict the outcome of pending or
    future claims or the impact of tort reform legislation that may
    be enacted at the State or Federal levels, due to the
    encapsulated nature of the products, the Company’s
    experiences in aggressively defending and resolving claims in
    the past, and the Company’s significant insurance coverage
    with solvent carriers as of the date of this filing, management
    does not believe that asbestos-related product liability claims
    are likely to have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial
    condition.

NOTE 16

LEASES
    AND COMMITMENTS

Certain assets are leased under long-term operating leases.
    These include production equipment at one plant, rent for the
    corporate headquarters and an airplane. Most leases contain
    renewal options for various periods. Leases generally require
    the Company to pay for insurance, taxes and maintenance of the
    leased property. The Company leases other equipment such as
    vehicles and certain office equipment under short-term leases.
    Total rent expense was $31.5 million in 2008,
    $29.8 million in 2007, and $22.4 million in 2006. The
    Company does not have any material capital leases.

The Company has guaranteed the residual values of certain leased
    machinery and equipment at one of its facilities. The guarantees
    extend through the maturity of the underlying lease, which is in
    September 2010. In the event the Company exercises its option
    not to purchase the machinery and equipment, the Company has
    guaranteed a residual value of $7.7 million. The Company
    has accrued $4.1 million as a loss on this guarantee, which
    is expected to be paid in 2009.

Future minimum operating lease payments at December 31,
    2008 were as follows:

    SPLIT

On November 14, 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors
    approved a

stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend on its
    common stock. To implement this stock split, shares of common
    stock were issued on December 17, 2007 to stockholders of
    record as of the close of business on December 6, 2007. All
    prior year share and per share amounts disclosed in this

RESTRUCTURING

On July 31, 2008, the Company announced a restructuring of
    its operations to align ongoing operations with a continuing,
    fundamental market shift in the auto industry. As a continuation
    of the Company’s third quarter restructuring, on
    December 11, 2008, the Company announced plans for
    additional restructuring actions. As a result of these third and
    fourth quarter restructuring actions, the Company has reduced
    its North American workforce by approximately 2,400 people,
    or 33%; its European workforce by approximately
    1,600 people, or 18%; and its Asian workforce by
    approximately 400 people, or 17%. The restructuring expense
    recognized for employee termination benefits is
    $54.6 million, of which $10.3 million was paid out in
    the third and fourth quarters of 2008. The remaining liability
    will be paid out by the middle of 2010. In addition to employee
    termination costs, the Company recorded $72.9 million of
    asset impairment charges related to the North American and
    European restructuring. The combined restructuring expenses of
    $127.5 million are broken out by segment as follows: Engine
    $85.3 million, Drivetrain $40.9 million and Corporate
    $1.3 million.

On September 22, 2006, the Company announced the reduction
    of its North American workforce by approximately
    850 people, or 13%, spread across its 19 operations in the
    U.S., Canada and Mexico. In addition to employee related costs
    of $6.7 million, the Company recorded $4.8 million of
    asset impairment charges related to the North American
    restructuring. The restructuring expenses broken out by segment
    were as follows: Engine $7.3 million, Drivetrain
    $3.6 million and Corporate $0.6 million.

During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company recorded
    restructuring expense associated with closing the drivetrain
    plant in Muncie, Indiana and adjusted the carrying values of
    other assets primarily related to its four-wheel drive transfer
    case product line. Production activity at the Muncie facility is
    scheduled to cease no later than the expiration of the current
    labor contract on April 24, 2009. The Company recorded
    employee related costs of $14.8 million, asset impairments
    of $51.6 million and pension curtailment expense of
    $6.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. The expenses
    broken out by segment were as follows: Engine $5.9 million
    and Drivetrain $67.3 million.

Estimates of restructuring expense are based on information
    available at the time such charges are recorded. Due to the
    inherent uncertainty involved in estimating restructuring
    expenses, actual amounts paid

for such activities may differ from amounts initially recorded.
    Accordingly, the Company may record revisions of previous
    estimates by adjusting previously established reserves.

RECENT
    TRANSACTIONS

BERU
    AG

In 2005, the Company acquired approximately 69.4% of the
    outstanding shares of BERU Aktiengesellschaft
    (“BERU”), headquartered in Ludwigsburg, Germany.

The Company acquired approximately 12.8% of additional BERU
    shares in 2007. The purchase price paid for these shares was
    $138.8 million, including transaction fees. In connection
    with the purchase, the Company recorded fair value of identified
    intangible assets and beginning inventory of $28.5 million.
    Of this total, $2.1 million, net of tax, of in process
    R&D, order backlog and beginning inventory were immediately
    written off in the selling, general, and administrative line in
    the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Net liabilities of



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

$1.0 million and goodwill of $48.7 million were also
    recorded. The Company also recorded a reduction in the minority
    interest of BERU of $62.6 million.

In the second quarter of 2008, the Company and BERU AG
    (“BERU”) completed a Domination and Profit Transfer
    Agreement (“DPTA”), giving BorgWarner full control of
    BERU. Under this agreement BERU is obligated to transfer 100% of
    its profits or losses to the Company. Upon request of BERU
    minority shareholders, the Company is obligated to purchase
    their shares for a cash payment of €71.32 per share. Those
    BERU minority shareholders who do not sell their shares are
    entitled to receive an annual compensatory payment (perpetual
    dividend) of €4.73 (gross) per share, less certain taxes,
    from the Company. The total obligation associated with the DPTA
    as of December 31, 2008 was approximately €31.5
    $(44.0) million, based upon the present value of the
    perpetual dividend and approximates the cost if all remaining
    shares were purchased by the Company at €71.32 per share.
    As of December 31, 2008, the DPTA obligation is presented
    in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as $44.0 million in
    current liabilities.

As of June 30, 2008, in connection with the DPTA, the
    Company recorded the remaining 17.8% of the fair value of BERU.
    The table below summarizes activity related to the
    Company’s DPTA obligation as of December 31, 2008 as
    follows (in millions):

Goodwill is reflected in the Engine segment. The
    $71.2 million of goodwill represents the excess of the DPTA
    obligation over the fair value of assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed.

Of the total tangible and intangible fair value write up of
    $61.7 million, $3.3 million of in process R&D and
    order backlog were written off in the selling, general, and
    administrative line and $1.8 million of beginning inventory
    was written off in the cost of sales line in the Condensed
    Consolidated Statement of Operations in the second quarter of
    2008. The combined pre-tax effect of both items is
    $5.1 million, $4.5 million net of tax or $0.04 per
    diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2008.

As of December 31, 2008, the portion of the acquisition
    related to the DPTA represents a non-cash transaction of
    €31.5 $(44.0) million. For the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the costs related to the annual
    perpetual dividend arrangement are reflected as expense in the
    Consolidated Statement of Operations. $4.0 million in
    interest expense and $0.2 million in income tax expense
    have been recorded in 2008. The tendering of approximately 13.4%
    of BERU shares, at a cost of $133.6 million, has been
    reflected as an investing activity in the Consolidated Statement
    of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2008. The
    annual payment of the perpetual dividend will be reflected as a
    financing activity. The payment of the annual perpetual dividend
    is expected to occur in the second quarter of each year,
    beginning in 2009.

The DPTA is a binding agreement. However, minority shareholders
    of BERU initiated an appraisal proceeding in the German court
    system that challenges the €71.32 purchase price and
    €4.73 annual compensatory payment (perpetual dividend). If
    a higher price is determined, the excess purchase price would be



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

recorded as additional goodwill with a corresponding increase to
    the Company’s total DPTA obligation. Any additional
    goodwill would be subject to impairment testing.

As a result of the tendering of shares in 2008 in accordance
    with the DPTA, the Company owns approximately 96% of all
    BERU’s outstanding shares. On January 7, 2009 the
    Company informed BERU of its intention to purchase the remaining
    outstanding shares of approximately 4%, using the required
    German legal process referred to as a “squeeze-out” to
    complete the 100% ownership.

See Note 7, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets”, for further discussion on BERU’s goodwill
    impairment charge recorded in the third and fourth quarters of
    2008.

ETEC

The Company acquired the ETEC product lines from Eaton as of the
    close of business for the quarter ended September 30, 2006
    for $63.7 million, net of cash acquired. The operating
    results of ETEC have been reported within the Drivetrain segment
    since its acquisition.

Other

In the third quarter of 2008, the Company purchased the
    remaining 26% interest in its joint venture located in India,
    BorgWarner Morse TEC Murugappa Pvt. Ltd., for $4.4 million.

In the third quarter of 2008, BERU divested its 50% interest in
    Impco BERU Technologies B.V. (located in the Netherlands) for
    $5.5 million, which approximated its carrying value.

On November 18, 2008, we entered into a joint venture
    agreement with China Automobile Development United Investment
    Company, a company owned by leading Chinese automakers, to
    produce various dual clutch transmission modules. The joint
    venture will be located in Dalian, China and  production is
    scheduled to begin in 2011. BorgWarner will own 66% of the joint
    venture.

NOTE 21

REPORTING
    SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION

The Company’s business is comprised of two reporting
    segments: Engine and Drivetrain. These segments are strategic
    business groups, which are managed separately as each represents
    a specific grouping of automotive components and systems.
    Effective January 1, 2006, the Company assigned an
    operating facility previously reported in the Engine segment to
    the Drivetrain segment due to changes in the facility’s
    product mix.

The Company allocates resources to each segment based upon the
    projected after-tax return on invested capital
    (“ROIC”) of its business initiatives. The ROIC is
    comprised of projected earnings before interest and income taxes
    (“EBIT”) adjusted for income taxes compared to the
    projected average capital investment required.

EBIT is considered a “non-GAAP financial measure.”
    Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure
    of a company’s financial performance, financial position or
    cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included
    in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure
    calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. EBIT is
    defined as earnings before interest, income taxes and minority
    interest. “Earnings” is intended to mean net earnings
    as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations under
    GAAP.

The Company believes that EBIT is useful to demonstrate the
    operational profitability of its segments by excluding interest
    and income taxes, which are generally accounted for across the
    entire Company on a consolidated basis. EBIT is also one of the
    measures used by the Company to determine resource allocation
    within the Company. Although the Company believes that EBIT
    enhances understanding of our business and performance, it
    should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful
    than, net earnings or cash flows from operations as determined
    in accordance with GAAP.

Item 9.

Changes
    in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and
    Financial Disclosure

The Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors
    solicited proposals from the four major accounting firms and
    conducted an extensive evaluation process in connection with the
    selection of the Company’s independent auditor for the
    fiscal year ending December 31, 2009. Following this
    process, on October 6, 2008, the Audit Committee
    (i) elected to replace, and thereby dismissed,
    Deloitte & Touche LLP (“Deloitte”) as its
    independent auditor for the Company’s fiscal year ending
    December 31, 2009, and (ii) appointed
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) to serve as the
    Company’s independent auditor for 2009. Deloitte continued
    as the Company’s auditor for the fiscal year ending
    December 31, 2008. With the filing on February 12,
    2009, of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for
    the year ended December 31, 2008, Deloitte was dismissed as
    the Company’s independent auditor and the Company’s
    auditor-client relationship with Deloitte effectively ceased.

Deloitte’s audit report dated February 12, 2009, on
    the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the
    fiscal years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 did not
    contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor was it
    qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or
    accounting principles, except that the audit report included an
    emphasis of a matter indicating that as discussed in Note 1
    to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed
    its method of accounting in 2007 for income taxes as a result of
    adopting FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes

, and in 2006 for defined benefit
    pension and  other postretirement plans as a result of adopting
    SFAS No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined
    Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans.

The audit
    report of Deloitte dated February 12, 2009 on the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2008 did not contain an adverse opinion or
    disclaimer of opinion, nor was it qualified or modified as to
    uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.

During the Company’s two most recent fiscal years and the
    subsequent interim period from January 1, 2009 through
    February 12, 2009, (i) there were no disagreements
    between the Company and Deloitte on any matters of accounting
    principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or
    auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not
    resolved to the satisfaction of Deloitte, would have caused
    Deloitte to make reference to the subject matter of the
    disagreement in its report on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements, and (ii) there were no
    “reportable events” as that term is defined in
    Item 304(a)(1)(v) of

Regulation S-K.

Deloitte has provided us with a letter stating that they agree
    that there were no disagreements during our last two fiscal
    years ended and the subsequent interim period from
    January 1, 2009 through February 12, 2009, and we filed a
    copy of such letter under cover of Form 8-K/A within the time
    period prescribed by the SEC.

During the two most recent fiscal years and the subsequent
    interim period from January 1, 2009 through
    February 12, 2009, neither the Company nor anyone acting on
    behalf of the Company, consulted PwC regarding any of the
    matters or events set forth in Item 3.04(a)(2) of

Regulation S-K.

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

The Company has adopted and maintains disclosure controls and
    procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance
    that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed
    under the Exchange Act, such as this

Form 10-K,

is collected, recorded, processed, summarized and reported
    within the time periods specified in the rules of the Securities
    and Exchange Commission. The Company’s disclosure controls
    and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information
    is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely
    decisions regarding required disclosure. As required under
    Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15,

the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation
    of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of
    the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that
    evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures
    are effective.



Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting, as defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
    designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s
    management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and
    fair presentation of published financial statements. Management
    conducted an assessment of the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria
    established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework. Based on the assessment, management concluded that,
    as of December 31, 2008, the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting is effective based on those
    criteria. The Company’s management report on internal
    control over financial reporting is set forth on page 43 of this
    report.

The Company’s management, including its Chief Executive
    Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that
    the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures and its
    internal control processes will prevent all error and all fraud.
    A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can
    provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
    objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of
    a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
    constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered
    relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in
    all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide
    absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
    error or fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
    These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments
    in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur
    because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can
    be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by
    collusion of two or more people, or by management override of
    the control. The design of any system of controls also is based
    in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
    events, and there can be no assurance that any design will
    succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
    conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of
    changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the
    policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent
    limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements
    due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.
    However, these inherent limitations are known features of the
    financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design
    into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate,
    this risk.

Deloitte and Touche LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, has audited the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements and the effectiveness of internal controls
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 as stated
    in their report below.

Changes
    in Internal Control

There have been no changes in internal controls over the
    financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal
    quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
    to materially affect our internal controls over financial
    reporting.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of BorgWarner Inc.

Auburn Hills, Michigan

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    BorgWarner Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) as of December 31, 2008, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
    included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is
    to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2008, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 of the Company and our report dated
    February 12, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
    financial statements.
