PART I

Item 1.

Business

The Company, a Delaware corporation, was incorporated in 1987.
The Company is a leading, global supplier of highly engineered
systems and components, primarily for powertrain applications.
The Company’s products help improve vehicle performance,
fuel efficiency, air quality and vehicle stability. These
products are manufactured and sold worldwide, primarily to
original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) of light
vehicles (passenger cars, sport-utility vehicles, vans and light
trucks). The Company’s products are also sold to OEMs of
commercial trucks, buses and agricultural and off-highway
vehicles. The Company operates manufacturing facilities serving
customers in the Americas, Europe and Asia, and is an original
equipment supplier to every major automotive OEM in the world.

$635 million in 2005, $500 million in 2004, and
$391 million in 2003.

Engine

The Engine Group develops products to manage engines for fuel
efficiency, reduced emissions, and enhanced performance. Its
products currently fall into the following major categories:
turbochargers, chain products, emissions systems, thermal
systems, diesel cold start and gasoline ignition technology,
tire pressure monitoring systems and diesel cabin heaters.

The Engine Group provides turbochargers for light vehicle,
commercial vehicle and off-road applications for diesel and
gasoline engine manufacturers in Europe, North America, South
America and Asia. The Engine Group has greatly benefited from
the growth in turbocharger demand in Europe. This growth is
linked to increasing demand for diesel engines in light vehicles
and for turbocharged gasoline engines. Benefits of turbochargers
in both light vehicle and commercial vehicle applications
include increased power for a given engine size, improved fuel
economy and significantly reduced emissions. The Company
believes it is a leading manufacturer of turbochargers worldwide.

Sales of turbochargers for light vehicles represented
approximately 16%, 16%, and 13% of the Company’s total
revenues for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company
currently supplies light vehicle turbochargers to VW/ Audi,
Renault, PSA, DaimlerChrysler, Hyundai and Fiat and commercial
vehicle turbochargers to Caterpillar, John Deere,
DaimlerChrysler, International, Deutz and MAN. The Company
expects to supply the next generation of light vehicle
turbochargers in Europe to VW/



Audi, Renault, PSA, BMW, Ford and Fiat. In 2004, the Company
announced that it would supply the 3.0 liter, 6-cylinder engine
for the BMW 5-series with its regulated two-stage turbocharging
system known as
R2S

®

.
The system allows continuously variable adaption of the turbine
and compressor side for every operating point of the engine. In
2005, the Company announced the start of production of
R2S

®

for medium truck applications. In 2005, the Company also
announced that it would supply turbochargers for VW/ Audi’s
2.0 liter gasoline direct injection engine as well as for the
first dual-charged 1.4 liter gasoline direct injection engine.
These products are provided from facilities in Europe, North
America, South America, and Asia.

The Engine Group’s products in chain and chain systems
include timing chain and timing chain systems, crankshaft and
camshaft sprockets, chain tensioners, guides and snubbers,
HY-VO

®

Front-Wheel Drive (“FWD”) transmission chain and
Four-Wheel Drive (“4WD”) chain, and MORSE
GEMINI

®

chain systems for light vehicle and commercial vehicle
applications.

The Company’s timing chain systems are used on Ford’s
family of overhead cam engines, including the Duratech and
Triton, and in-line 4 cylinder engines, as well as on
Chrysler’s 2.7 liter, 3.7 liter, 4.7 liter and 5.7 liter
overhead cam engines, which includes the Hemi applications. In
addition, the Company provides timing systems to a number of
Asian OEMs and their North American transplant operations,
including Honda, Nissan, and Hyundai, and to several European
OEMs. The Company believes that it is the world’s leading
manufacturer of timing chain systems.

The Engine Group also has started production of its first
high-volume variable cam timing (“VCT”) systems for a
new family of GM V6 engines. VCT is a means of precisely
controlling the flow of air into and out of an engine by
allowing the camshaft to be dynamically phased relative to its
crankshaft. The Company’s VCT system includes Torsional
Assist

tm

technology, which utilizes camshaft torque as its actuation
energy instead of the conventional oil-pressure actuated
approach. The VCT systems are utilized by GM’s new 3.5
liter and 3.9 liter V-6 engines in the 2006 model year Chevrolet
Impala and Pontiac G6.

HY-VO

®

chain is used to transfer power from the engine to the
drivetrain. The Company’s MORSE
GEMINI

®

chain system emits significantly less chain pitch frequency
noise than conventional transmission chain systems. The chain in
a transfer case distributes power between the front and rear
output shafts which, in turn, drive the front and rear wheels.
The Company believes it is the world’s leading manufacturer
of chain for FWD transmissions and 4WD transfer cases. These
products are provided from facilities in North America, Europe
and Asia.

The Engine Group also manufactures a wide variety of fluid
pumps, including engine hydraulic pumps for variable cam timing
and engine lubrication, and products for engine air intake
management. Key products for engine air intake management
include throttle bodies, electronic throttle control, and
complete engine induction modules. The Engine Group also designs
and manufactures products to control emissions and improve gas
mileage such as electric air pumps, variable force solenoids for
the actuation of cam phasing systems and exhaust gas
recirculation valves for gasoline and diesel applications. These
products are provided from facilities in North America and
Europe.

The Engine Group is a global provider of engine thermal
solutions. The group manufactures and markets air sensing fan
drives that mechanically control and electronically control fans
to sense and respond to multiple cooling requirements. The
Engine Group also manufactures and markets polymer fans for
engine cooling systems. The Company’s thermal products
provide improved vehicle fuel economy and reduced engine
emissions while minimizing parasitic horsepower loss. These
advanced thermal systems products are provided from facilities
in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. The Company
is a leading global provider of such products, but competes with
other large independent producers. This business serves the
global light, medium, and heavy vehicle markets, as well as
selected off-highway applications.



In 2005, the Company acquired 69.4% of the outstanding shares of
Beru Aktiengesellschaft (“Beru”), headquartered in
Ludwigsburg, Germany. Beru’s operating results are included
within the Engine Group. Beru is a leading global automotive
supplier of diesel cold starting technology (glow plugs and
instant starting systems); gasoline ignition technology (spark
plugs and ignition coils); and electronic control units and
sensor technology (tire pressure sensors, diesel cabin heaters
and selected sensors). These products are provided from
facilities located in Europe, Asia and North America.

Drivetrain

The Drivetrain Group leverages the Company’s clutching and
controls expertise for efficient torque management, developing
interactive electronic control systems and strategies for the
Company’s traditional mechanical products. The Drivetrain
Group’s major products are transmission components and
systems, and all-wheel drive (“AWD”) torque management
systems.

The Drivetrain Group engineers and manufactures components and
modules for automatic transmissions in North America, Asia and
Europe. Principal product lines include friction plates, one-way
clutches, transmission bands and torque converter

lock-up

clutches for
automatic transmissions. The Company is a supplier to virtually
every major automatic transmission manufacturer in the world.
The Company’s 50%-owned joint venture in Japan, NSK-Warner
Kabushiki Kaisha (“NSK-Warner”), is a leading producer
of friction plates and one-way clutches in Japan. NSK-Warner is
the joint venture partner with a 40% interest in the Drivetrain
Group’s Korean subsidiary, BorgWarner Transmission Systems
Korea, Inc.

The Drivetrain Group also designs and manufactures sophisticated
electro-mechanical, mechanical and electronic components and
systems used for automated transmissions. Key products for
transmission controls include single function solenoids, complex
solenoids and multi-function modules.

In 2003, the Company launched its
DualTronic

tm

transmission technology on the VW Golf R32 DSG
and the Audi TT 3.2. The technology provides the
smooth-shifting convenience of an automatic transmission with
the fuel efficiency of a manual transmission. Through advanced
electrohydraulic controls and a unique two-clutch wet-friction
system,
DualTronic

tm

technology eliminates the disruptive feel of a manual
transmission gear shift. This technology is being launched
across the entire VW Group vehicle family, including VW, Audi,
Skoda and Seat.

There has been a noticeable trend in transmission technology
from four and five speed to six and seven speed transmissions.
Transmissions with more speeds improve fuel economy and vehicle
performance. These transmissions are being developed by a
variety of transmission manufacturers, including ZF, Aisin AW,
Hyundai, DaimlerChrysler, GM, Ford and Jatco. The Company
supplies products for four, five, six, and seven speed
transmissions, including solenoids, transmission control
modules, friction plates and clutching mechanisms.

The Company’s torque management products include 4WD, AWD
transfer cases and systems for rear-wheel drive vehicles, and
torque management products and systems to transfer torque within
the drivetrain for FWD/AWD based vehicles. The main focus is on
electronically controlled (active) torque management
devices and systems. Other torque management products include
synchronizer rings and systems for application in manual and
automated transmissions.

Transfer cases are installed primarily on light trucks,
sport-utility vehicles (“SUVs”), and rear-wheel drive
based cross-over vehicles (“CUVs”). A transfer case
attaches to the transmission and distributes torque to the front
and rear axles for 4WD, improving vehicle control during
off-road use and in a variety of road conditions. The Company
has designed and developed an exclusive 4WD
TORQUE-ON-DEMAND

®

(“TOD

®

”)
transfer case system, which allows vehicles to automatically
shift from two-wheel drive to 4WD when electronic data and
sensors indicate it is necessary. The
TOD

®

transfer case is available on the Ford Explorer, Ford
Expedition, Lincoln Navigator and SsangYong Musso. In 2001, this
technology was also adopted by Hyundai for its Terracan SUV, and
was launched



on the Kia Sorento in 2002. The Company also began production in
2005 on transfer cases for the SsangYong Kyron, and for Beijing
Jeep.

Sales of rear-wheel drive based transfer cases and components
represented approximately 12%, 18% and 20% of the Company’s
total revenues for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
Company’s largest customer of 4WD transfer cases is Ford
Motor Company. The Company supplies the majority of the 4WD
transfer cases to Ford, including those installed in the Ford
Explorer, the Lincoln Aviator, the Ford Expedition, the Ford
F-150, Ranger

pick-up

trucks, the Mercury Mountaineer and the Lincoln Navigator. The
Company also began supplying transfer cases to several new
General Motors applications in 2002 including the Hummer H2, the
Cadillac Escalade, the Chevrolet Tahoe and the Suburban, along
with the GMC Yukon and the Yukon XL. The Company also supplies
transfer cases for the Cadillac SRX and STS and began supplying
transfer cases for the new Hummer H3 in 2005. The Company also
supplies 4WD transfer cases to several Asian-based OEMs. The
Company also began supplying transfer cases to Audi in 2005 for
its new Q7 SUV.

One of the Company’s AWD
iTrac

®

products is the INTERACTIVE TORQUE
MANAGEMENT

tm

(“ITM

®

”)
system. This product was introduced on the Acura MDX in 2000,
was launched on the Honda Pilot in 2002 and on the Honda
Ridgeline, a new midsize pickup, in 2005.
ITM

®

uses electronically controlled clutches to distribute power to
the individual rear wheels when traction is required. The
Company is actively involved in developing this technology for
new applications in both FWD based CUVs and passenger cars. A
variant of this product,

ITM-1

®

,
which features a single clutch pack in front of the rear axle
differential, was launched on the Hyundai Santa Fe in 2002,
the Hyundai Tucson and KIA Sportage in 2004. The Company has
announced that it will begin supplying a North American OEM with
ITM

®

product in early 2006 for several passenger cars and CUVs.

The Company’s drivetrain products are manufactured in North
America, Europe, and Asia.

Joint Ventures

As of December 31, 2005, the Company had 13 joint
ventures in which it has a less-than-100% ownership interest.
Results from the seven ventures in which the Company is the
majority owner are consolidated as part of the Company’s
results. Where the Company’s effective ownership interest
is 50% or less, the Company reported using the equity method of
accounting.



Management of the unconsolidated joint ventures is shared with
the Company’s respective joint venture partners. Certain
information concerning the Company’s joint ventures is set
forth below:

(a)

The Company owns 69.4% of the outstanding shares of Beru. For
    the joint ventures in which Beru is a party, the percentage of
    ownership for each joint venture reflects Beru’s ownership
    percentage.

Financial Information About Geographic Areas

See Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements in the Company’s Annual Report for financial
information about geographic areas which is incorporated herein
by reference.



Customers

Approximately 73% of the Company’s total sales in 2005 were
for light vehicle applications, with the remaining 27% of the
Company’s sales to a diversified group of commercial truck,
bus, construction and agricultural vehicle manufacturers, and to
distributors of aftermarket replacement parts.

For the most recent three-year period, the Company’s
worldwide sales to the following customers were approximately as
follows:

Customer




Ford

16%

21%

23%

Volkswagen

13%

10%

8%

DaimlerChrysler

12%

14%

17%

General Motors

9%

10%

12%

Approximately 55% of consolidated sales for 2005 were outside
the United States, including exports. However, a portion of such
sales were to OEMs headquartered outside the United States that
produce vehicles that are, in turn, exported to the United
States. See Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements in the Company’s Annual Report.

The Company’s automotive products are generally sold
directly to OEMs substantially pursuant to negotiated annual
contracts, long-term supply agreements or terms and conditions
as may be modified by the parties. Deliveries are subject to
periodic authorizations based upon the production schedules of
the OEMs. The Company typically ships its products directly from
its plants to the OEMs.

Sales and Marketing

Each of the Company’s business units within its two
operating segments has its own sales function. Account
executives for each business unit are assigned to serve specific
OEM customers for one or more of a business unit’s
products. Such account executives spend the majority of their
time in direct contact with OEM purchasing and engineering
employees and are responsible for servicing existing business
and for identifying and obtaining new business. Because of their
close relationship with the OEMs, account executives are able to
identify and meet customers’ needs based upon their
knowledge of the Company’s products and design and
manufacturing capabilities. Upon securing a new order, account
executives participate in product launch team activities and as
a key interface with the customers.

In addition, between the Engine segment and the Drivetrain
segment, sales and marketing employees work together to explore
cross-development opportunities for the business units. The
development of
DualTronic

tm

,
the Company’s wet-clutch and control-system technology for
a new-concept automated transmission, is an example of a
successful collaboration.

Seasonality

The Company’s business is moderately seasonal because the
Company’s largest North American customers typically halt
vehicle production for approximately two weeks in July and one
week in December. Additionally, customers in Europe and Asia
typically shut down vehicle production during portions of July
or August and one week in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, the
Company’s third and fourth quarters may reflect those
practices.

Research and Development

The Company conducts advanced engine and drivetrain research at
the segment level. This advanced engineering function looks to
leverage electronics and the Company’s expertise across
product lines to create new engine and drivetrain systems and
modules that can be commercialized. A venture capital fund that
was created by the Company as seed money for new innovation and
collaboration across businesses is managed by this function.



In addition, each of the Company’s operating segments has
its own research and development (“R&D”)
organization. The Company has 811 employees, including
engineers, mechanics and technicians, engaged in R&D
activities at facilities worldwide. The Company also operates
testing facilities such as prototype, measurement and
calibration, life cycle testing and dynamometer laboratories.

By working closely with the OEMs and anticipating their future
product needs, the Company’s R&D personnel conceive,
design, develop and manufacture new proprietary automotive
components and systems. R&D personnel also work to improve
current products and production processes. The Company believes
its commitment to R&D will allow it to obtain new orders
from its OEM customers.

Consistent with its strategy of developing technologically
innovative products, the Company spent approximately
$161.0 million, $123.1 million, and
$118.2 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, on
R&D activities. Not included in the reported R&D
activities were customer-sponsored R&D activities of
approximately $33.3 million, $31.8 million, and
$22.3 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

Patents and Licenses

The Company has approximately 3,500 active domestic and foreign
patents and patent applications pending or under preparation,
and receives royalties from licensing patent rights to others.
While it considers its patents on the whole to be important, the
Company does not consider any single patent, group of related
patents or any single license essential to its operations in the
aggregate or to the operations of any of the Company’s
business groups individually. The expiration of the patents
individually and in the aggregate is not expected to have a
material effect on the Company’s financial position or
future operating results. The Company owns numerous trademarks,
some of which are valuable, but none of which are essential to
its business in the aggregate.

The Company owns the “BorgWarner” and
“Borg-Warner Automotive” trade names and housemarks,
and variations thereof, which are material to the Company’s
business.

Competition

The Company’s operating segments compete worldwide with a
number of other manufacturers and distributors which produce and
sell similar products. Many of these competitors are larger and
have greater resources than the Company. Price, quality and
technological innovation are the primary elements of competition.

The Company’s major competitors include:

In addition, a number of the Company’s major OEM customers
manufacture, for their own use and for others, products which
compete with the Company’s products. Although these OEM
customers



have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside
suppliers, the OEMs could elect to manufacture products to meet
their own requirements or to compete with the Company. There can
be no assurance that the Company’s business will not be
adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in
which it operates.

For many of its products, the Company’s competitors include
suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic
advantages such as lower labor costs, lower health care costs
and, in some cases, export subsidies and/or raw materials
subsidies.

Employees

As of December 31, 2005, the Company and its consolidated
subsidiaries had approximately 17,400 salaried and hourly
employees (as compared with approximately 14,500 employees at
December 31, 2004), of which approximately 7,600 were
U.S. employees. Included in these 17,400 employees are
approximately 2,700 Beru employees. Approximately 24% of the
Company’s U.S. workers are unionized. The hourly
workers at the Company’s

non-U.S.

operations
are typically unionized. The Company believes its present
relations with employees to be satisfactory.

Raw Materials

Continuing a trend which began in 2004, several raw materials
used in the Company’s products hit record pricing levels,
including steel, copper, resins, and certain alloying elements.
This was due to a host of market factors, not the least of which
included global growth demands and the effects of devastating
hurricanes in North America.

Despite these challenges, the Company used a variety of tactics
in order to limit the impact of inflationary prices and supply
shortages. The Company formed a global procurement organization
to accelerate: cost reductions, purchases from lower cost
regions, risk mitigation efforts, and collaborative buying
activities. In addition, the Company used long-term contracts,
cost sharing arrangements, design changes, customer buy
programs, and hedging instruments to help control costs. The
Company intends to use similar measures in 2006 and beyond.

For 2006, each of the Company’s operating segments believes
that its supplies of raw materials and energy are adequate and
available from multiple sources to support its manufacturing
requirements. Manufacturing operations for each of the
Company’s operating segments are dependent upon natural
gas, fuel oil, and electricity.

Environmental Regulation and Proceedings

The Company’s operations are subject to federal, state,
local and foreign laws and regulations governing, among other
things, emissions to air, discharge to waters and the
generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and
disposal of waste and other materials. The Company believes that
it has operated its business and facilities in compliance in all
material respects with applicable environmental and health and
safety laws and regulations, many of which provide for
substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations.
However, the operation of automotive parts manufacturing plants
entails risks in these areas even for a company complying with
all laws, and there can be no assurance that the Company will
not incur material costs or liabilities. In addition, through
various acquisitions over the years, the Company has acquired a
number of manufacturing facilities and there can be no assurance
that the Company will not incur material costs and liabilities
relating to activities which predate the Company’s
ownership. In addition, potentially significant expenditures
could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental
and health and safety laws, regulations or requirements that may
be adopted or imposed in the future.

The Company believes that the overall impact of compliance with
regulations and legislation protecting the environment will not
have a material effect on its financial position or future
operating results, although no assurance can be given in this
regard. Capital expenditures and expenses in 2005 attributable
to compliance with such legislation were not material.



The Company and certain of its current and former direct and
indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have
been identified by the United States Environmental Protection
Agency (“EPA”) and certain state environmental
agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties
(“PRPs”) at various hazardous waste disposal sites
under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act (“Superfund”) and equivalent state laws
and, as such, may presently be liable for the cost of

clean-up

and other
remedial activities at 38 such sites. Responsibility for

clean-up

and other
remedial activities at a Superfund site is typically shared
among PRPs based on an allocation formula.

Based on the information available to the Company, which in most
cases, includes: an estimate of allocation of liability among
PRPs; the probability that other PRPs, many of whom are large
solvent public companies, will fully pay the cost apportioned to
them; currently available information from PRPs and/or federal
or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of
contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs;
remediation alternatives; estimated legal fees; and other
factors; the Company has established an accrual for indicated
environmental liabilities with a balance at December 31,
2005 of approximately $38.3 million. Included in the total
accrued liability is the $16.1 million anticipated
remaining costs to settle all outstanding claims related to the
Crystal Springs, Mississippi plant described separately below,
which was included in the amount recorded in the second quarter
of 2005. For the other 37 sites, we have accrued amounts
that do not exceed $3.0 million related to any individual
site and management does not believe that the costs related to
any of these other individual sites will have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s results of operations, cashflow, or
financial condition. The Company expects to expend substantially
all of this $38.3 million environmental accrued liability
over the next three to five years.

In connection with the sale of Kuhlman Electric Corporation, the
Company agreed to indemnify the buyer and Kuhlman Electric for
certain environmental liabilities relating to the past
operations of Kuhlman Electric. The liabilities at issue result
from operations of Kuhlman Electric that pre-date the
Company’s acquisition of Kuhlman Electric’s parent
company, Kuhlman Corporation, during 1999. During 2000, Kuhlman
Electric notified the Company that it discovered potential
environmental contamination at its Crystal Springs, Mississippi
plant while undertaking an expansion of the plant. Kuhlman
Electric and others, including the Company, were sued in
numerous related lawsuits, in which multiple claimants alleged
personal injury and property damage.

The Company and other defendants, including the Company’s
subsidiary Kuhlman Corporation, entered into a settlement in
July 2005 regarding approximately 90% of personal injury and
property damage claims relating to the alleged environmental
contamination. In exchange for, among other things, the
dismissal with prejudice of these lawsuits, the defendants
agreed to pay a total sum of up to $39.0 million in
settlement funds. The settlement was paid in three approximately
equal installments. The first two payments of $12.9 million
were made in the third and fourth quarter of 2005 and the
remaining installment of $13.0 million was paid in the
first quarter of 2006.

The same group of defendants entered into a settlement in
October 2005 regarding approximately 9% of personal injury and
property damage claims relating to the alleged environmental
contamination. In exchange for, among other things, the
dismissal with prejudice of these lawsuits, the defendants
agreed to pay a total sum of up to $5.4 million in
settlement funds. The settlement was paid in two approximately
equal installments in the fourth quarter of 2005 and the first
quarter of 2006. With this settlement, the Company and other
defendants have resolved about 99% of the known personal injury
and property damage claims relating to the alleged environmental
contamination.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

Our industry is cyclical and our results of operations
will be adversely affected by industry downturns.

Automotive and truck production and sales are cyclical and
sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors.
Significant reduction in automotive or truck production would
have a material adverse effect on our sales to OEMs and our
financial position and operating results.

We are dependent on sport utility vehicle and light truck
market segments.

Some of our products, in particular four-wheel drive transfer
cases, are currently used exclusively in four-wheel drive
systems for sport utility vehicles and light trucks. For 2005,
for example, sales of rear-wheel drive transfer cases
represented approximately 12% of our total consolidated revenue.
Any significant reduction in production in this market segment
or loss of business in this market segment would have a material
adverse effect on our sales to OEMs and our financial position
and operating results.

We face strong competition.

We compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and
distributors that produce and sell products similar to ours.
Price, quality, and technological innovation are the primary
elements of competition. Our competitors include vertically
integrated units of our major OEM customers, as well as a large
number of independent domestic and international suppliers. We
are not as large as a number of these companies and do not have
as many financial or other resources. The competitive
environment has changed dramatically over the past few years as
our traditional U.S. OEM customers, faced with intense
international competition, have expanded their worldwide
sourcing of components. As a result, we have experienced
competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that
enjoy economic advantages, such as lower labor costs, lower
health care costs and, in some cases, export or raw materials
subsidies. Increased competition could adversely affect our
businesses.

We are under substantial pressure from OEMs to reduce the
prices of our products.

There is substantial and continuing pressure on OEMs to reduce
costs, including costs of products we supply. Although OEMs have
indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers,
a number of our major OEM customers manufacture products for
their own uses that directly compete with our products. These
OEMs could elect to manufacture such products for their own uses
in place of the products we currently supply. We believe that
our ability to develop proprietary new products and to control
our costs will allow us to remain competitive. However, we
cannot assure you that we will be able to improve or maintain
our gross margins on product sales to OEMs or that the trend by
OEMs toward increased outsourcing will continue.

Annual price reductions to OEM customers appear to have become a
permanent feature of our business environment. In 2005 and 2004,
the combination of price reductions to customers and cost
increases for material, labor, and overhead, totaled
approximately $139.6 million and $127.8 million,
respectively. To maintain our profit margins, we seek price
reductions from our suppliers, improve production processes to
increase manufacturing efficiency, update product designs to
reduce costs and develop new products the benefits of which
support stable or increased prices. Our ability to pass through
increased raw material costs to our OEM customers is limited,
with cost recovery less than 100% and often on a delayed basis.
We cannot assure you that we will be able to reduce costs in an
amount equal to annual price reductions and increases in raw
material costs.

We rely on sales to several major customers.

Our worldwide sales in 2005 to Ford, Volkswagen,
DaimlerChrysler, and General Motors constituted approximately
16%, 13%, 12%, and 9%, respectively, of our 2005 consolidated
sales. These four



customers constituted approximately 50% of our 2005 sales.
Credit rating agencies rate two of these customers below
investment grade. The corresponding percentages for 2004 were
21%, 10%, 14%, and 10%. No other single customer accounted for
more than 10% of our consolidated sales in 2005 or 2004.

Although we have had long-standing relationships with each of
Ford, Volkswagen, DaimlerChrysler, and General Motors, and have
sold a wide variety of products to various divisions of each
company globally, the loss of any significant portion of our
sales to any of these customers would have a material adverse
effect on our financial position and operating results.

We are sensitive to the effects of our major
customers’ labor relations.

All three of our primary North American customers, Ford,
DaimlerChrysler, and General Motors, have major union contracts
with the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement
Workers of America. Because of domestic OEMs’ dependence on
a single union, we are affected by labor difficulties and work
stoppages at OEMs’ facilities. Similarly, a majority of our
global customers’ operations outside of North America are
also represented by various unions. Any extended work stoppage
could have a material adverse effect on our financial position
and operating results.

Part of our labor force is unionized.

As of December 31, 2005, approximately 24% of our
U.S. hourly employees were unionized. Our two most
significant domestic collective bargaining agreements are for
our Muncie, Indiana plant and our Ithaca, New York plants. The
Muncie agreement expires in May 2009 and the Ithaca agreement
expires in October 2008. The hourly workers at our European and
certain Asian facilities are also unionized. While we believe
that our relations with our employees are good, a prolonged
dispute with our employees could have a material adverse effect
on our financial position and operating results.

We are subject to extensive environmental
regulations.

Our operations are subject to laws governing, among other
things, emissions to air, discharges to waters, and the
generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment, and
disposal of waste and other materials. We believe that our
business, operations, and activities have been and are being
operated in compliance in all material respects with applicable
environmental and health and safety laws. However, the operation
of automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in these
areas, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur material
costs or liabilities as a result. Furthermore, through various
acquisitions over the years, we have acquired a number of
manufacturing facilities, and we cannot assure you that we will
not incur materials costs and liabilities relating to activities
that predate our ownership. In addition, potentially significant
expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving
environmental and health and safety laws that may be adopted in
the future.

We believe that the overall impact of compliance with
regulations and legislation protecting the environment will not
have a material adverse effect on our future financial position
or operating results, but we cannot assure you that this will be
the case. Capital expenditures and expenses in 2005 attributable
to compliance with environmental laws were not material.

We may incur material costs related to product warranties,
environmental and regulatory matters, litigation, and other
claims.

We and certain of our current and former direct and indirect
corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have been
identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency
and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as
potentially responsible parties at various hazardous waste
disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act and equivalent state laws. As a
result, as of December 31, 2005, we may be liable for the
cost of

clean-up

and
other remedial activities at 38 of these sites.



Based on information available to us, we have established an
accrual in our financial statements for indicated environmental
liabilities, with a balance of approximately $38.3 million
at December 31, 2005. We currently expect this amount to be
expended over the next three to five years.

We believe that none of these matters, individually or in the
aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our future
financial position or operating results, either because
estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not
large or because liability will be shared with other potentially
responsible parties. However, we cannot assure you of the
ultimate outcome.

We provide warranties to our customers for some of our products.
Under these warranties, we may be required to bear costs and
expenses for the repair or replacement of these products. We
cannot assure you that costs and expenses associated with these
product warranties will not be material, or that those costs
will not exceed any amounts accrued for such warranties in our
financial statement.

Based upon information available to us, we have established an
accrual in our financial statements for product warranties, with
a balance of approximately $44.0 million at
December 31, 2005.

We are also party to, or have an obligation to defend a party
to, various legal proceedings, including those described in
Note 14 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. Although we believe that none of these matters is
likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition or future operating results, there can be no assurance
as to the ultimate outcome of any such matter or proceeding.

Our growth strategy may prove unsuccessful.

We have a stated goal of increasing revenues and operating
revenues at a rate greater than global vehicle production by
increasing content per vehicle with innovative new components
and through select acquisitions. We may not meet our goal
because of any of the following: (a) a significant decrease
in the production of sport utility vehicles and light trucks,
high content vehicles for us; (b) the failure to develop
new products which will be purchased by our customers;
(c) technology changes rendering our products obsolete;
(d) a reversal of the trend of supplying systems (which
allows us to increase content per vehicle) instead of
components; and (e) the failure to find suitable
acquisition targets or the failure to integrate operations of
acquired businesses quickly and cost effectively.

We are subject to risks related to our international
operations.

We have manufacturing and technical facilities in many regions
and countries, including North America, Europe, China, India,
South Korea, Japan, and Brazil and sell our products worldwide.
For 2005, approximately 55 percent of our sales were
outside North America. Consequently, our results could be
affected by changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies,
trade restrictions or prohibitions, import or other charges or
taxes, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,
changing economic conditions, and political instability and
disputes.

We may not realize sales represented by awarded
business.

We base our growth projections, in part, on commitments made by
our customers. These commitments generally renew yearly during a
program life cycle. If actual production orders from our
customers do not approximate such commitments, it could have a
material adverse effect on our growth and financial performance.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

The Company has received no written comments regarding its
periodic or current reports from the staff of the Securities and
Exchange Commission that were issued 180 days or more
preceding the end of its 2005 fiscal year and that remain
unresolved.



Item 2. Properties

As of December 31, 2005, the Company had 62 manufacturing,
assembly, and technical facilities strategically located
throughout the United States and worldwide. In addition to its
U.S. manufacturing facilities, the Company has 10
facilities in Germany, five facilities in each of India and
Korea, three facilities in each of the United Kingdom and
France, two facilities in each of China, Japan, Mexico, Hungary,
and Italy, and one facility in each of Brazil, Canada, Ireland,
Spain, and Taiwan. The Company also has several sales offices,
warehouses and technical centers. The Company’s worldwide
headquarters are located in a leased facility in Auburn Hills,
Michigan. In 2002, the Company completed construction of the
BorgWarner Powertrain Technical Center (the “PTC”) in
Auburn Hills, Michigan, which serves as a primary research and
development facility and contains many of the administrative
personnel for the Engine and Drivetrain segments. There are
approximately 475 employees located at the PTC. In general, the
Company believes its facilities to be suitable and adequate to
meet its current and reasonably anticipated needs. The majority
of the facilities are operating at normal levels based on
capacity.

The following is additional information concerning the principal
manufacturing, assembly, and technical facilities operated by
the Company, its subsidiaries, and affiliates.(1)

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

The Company is subject to a number of claims and judicial and
administrative proceedings (some of which involve substantial
amounts) arising out of the Company’s business or relating
to matters for which the Company may have a contractual
indemnity obligation. See Note 14 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company’s Annual
Report for a discussion of environmental, asbestos and other
litigation, which is incorporated herein by reference.

A declaratory judgment action was filed by a subsidiary of the
Company, BorgWarner Diversified Transmission Products Inc.
(“DTP”), in January 2006 in the United Stated District
Court, Southern District of Indiana, Indianapolis Division,
against the United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural
Implements Workers of America, Local No. 287 and Gerald
Poor, individually and as the representative of a defendant
class. DTP is seeking the Court’s affirmation that DTP will
not violate the Labor-Management Relations Act or the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act by amending certain
retirees’ medical plans, effective March 12, 2006. DTP
believes that it is within its rights to amend the plan and that
it will be successful on the merits of the lawsuit, although
there can be no guarantee of success in any litigation.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security
Holders

There were no matters submitted to the Company’s security
holders during the fourth quarter of 2005.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with
Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

Not applicable.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company has adopted and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures that are designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as
this Form

10-K,

is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods required under the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s rules and forms. The Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such
information is accumulated and communicated to management to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The
Company’s internal controls are designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of its consolidated financial
statements in conformity with GAAP. As required under Exchange
Act Rule

13a-15,

the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and
procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and
procedures are effective. This evaluation included consideration
of the restatements described below and in Note 18 of the
Company’s audited Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting, as defined in Exchange Act
Rule

13a-15(e).

Management conducted an assessment of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on the framework
established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission in Internal Control — Integrated
Framework. Based on the assessment, management concluded that,
as of December 31, 2005, the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting is effective. Management’s
assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005,
has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
their report below.

The Company’s management, including its Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that
the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures and its
internal control processes will prevent all error and all fraud.
A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of
a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered
relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in
all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide
absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These
inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in
decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur
because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can
be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by
collusion of two or more people, or by management override of
the control. The design of any system of controls also is based
in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
events, and there can be no assurance that any design will
succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent
limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements
due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.
However, these inherent limitations are known features of the
financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design
into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate,
this risk.



Changes in Internal Control

The Company purchased a 69.4% stake in Beru in January 2005. The
Company considers the acquisition of Beru to be material to the
results of its operations, financial position and cash flows
from the date of acquisition through December 31, 2005, and
believes that the internal controls and procedures of Beru have
a material effect on internal control over financial reporting.
Throughout 2005 the Company went through a process to coordinate
the internal control processes at Beru and has extended its
Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404 compliance program to
include Beru at December 31, 2005.

In connection with the coordination of the internal controls and
processes of Beru, Beru made improvements to its internal
controls and the Company improved its monitoring of the
preparation of financial information at Beru and other reporting
units. The Company and Beru made the following improvements to
internal control over financial reporting to remediate a control
deficiency at Beru which resulted in the correction discussed in
Note 18 to the financial statements;

There have been no other changes in internal controls over the
financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal
quarter that have materially affected, or are likely to
materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of BorgWarner Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting, that BorgWarner Inc. and Consolidated
Subsidiaries (the “Company”) maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
company’s principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material misstatements
due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the criteria
established in

Internal Control — Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended



December 31, 2005 of the Company and our report dated
February 17, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial statements.
