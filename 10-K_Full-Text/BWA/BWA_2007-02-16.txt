The sales information presented above excludes the sales by the
    Company’s unconsolidated joint ventures (See “Joint
    Ventures” section). Such sales totaled approximately
    $676 million in 2006, $635 million in 2005, and
    $500 million in 2004.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company assigned an
    operating facility previously reported in the Engine segment to
    the Drivetrain segment due to changes in the facility’s
    product mix. Prior year segment amounts have been reclassified
    to conform to the current year’s presentation.

Engine

The Engine Group develops products to manage engines for fuel
    efficiency, reduced emissions, and enhanced performance. Its
    products currently fall into the following major categories:
    turbochargers, chain products, emissions systems, thermal
    systems, diesel cold start and gasoline ignition technology,
    tire pressure monitoring systems and diesel cabin heaters.

The Engine Group provides turbochargers for light-vehicle,
    commercial-vehicle and off-road applications for diesel and
    gasoline engine manufacturers in Europe, North America, South
    America and Asia. The Engine Group has greatly benefited from
    the growth in turbocharger demand in Europe. This growth is
    linked to increasing demand for diesel engines in light-vehicles
    which typically utilize turbochargers and for turbocharged
    gasoline engines. Benefits of turbochargers in both
    light-vehicle and commercial-vehicle applications include
    increased power for a given engine size, improved fuel economy
    and significantly reduced emissions. The Company believes it is
    a leading manufacturer of turbochargers worldwide.



Sales of turbochargers for light-vehicles represented
    approximately 18%, 16%, and 16% of the Company’s total
    revenues for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company
    currently supplies light-vehicle turbochargers to VW/Audi,
    Renault, PSA, DaimlerChrysler, Hyundai and Fiat, and supplies
    commercial-vehicle turbochargers to Caterpillar, John Deere,
    DaimlerChrysler, International, Deutz and MAN. The Company
    expects to supply the next generation of light-vehicle
    turbochargers in Europe to VW/Audi, Renault, PSA, BMW, Ford and
    Fiat. In 2004, the Company announced that it would supply the
    3.0 liter, 6-cylinder engine for the BMW 5-series with its
    regulated two-stage turbocharging system known as
    R2S

®

.
    The system allows continuously variable adaptation of the
    turbine and compressor side for every operating point of the
    engine. In 2005, the Company announced the start of production
    of its
    R2S

®

for medium truck applications and that it would supply
    turbochargers for VW/Audi’s 2.0 liter gasoline direct
    injection engine and for their first dual-charged 1.4 liter
    gasoline direct injection engine. In 2006, the Company launched
    a high temperature variable geometry turbine
    (“VTG

®

”)
    for Porsche 3.6 liter gasoline application, another
    R2S

®

application for a DaimlerChrysler light-truck called the
    Sprinter and a
    VTG

®

for the Hyundai A-engine family. These products are provided
    from facilities in Europe, North America, South America and Asia.

The Engine Group designs and manufactures products to control
    emissions and improve fuel economy such as electric air pumps,
    turbo actuators which use integrated electronics to precisely
    control turbocharger speed and pressure ratio, and exhaust gas
    recirculation valves for gasoline and diesel applications. The
    Engine Group also manufactures a wide variety of fluid pumps,
    including engine oil pumps for engine and transmission
    lubrication, and products for engine air intake management.
    Other products for engine air intake management include throttle
    bodies, electronic throttle control, and complete engine
    induction modules. These products are provided from facilities
    in North America, Europe and Asia.

The Engine Group’s chain and chain systems products include
    timing chain and timing drive systems, crankshaft and camshaft
    sprockets, tensioners, guides and snubbers,
    HY-VO

®

Front-Wheel Drive (“FWD”) transmission chain and
    Four-Wheel Drive (“4WD”) chain, and MORSE
    GEMINI

®

chain systems for light-vehicle and commercial-vehicle
    applications.

The Company’s timing chain systems are used on Ford’s
    family of overhead cam engines, including the Duratech and
    Triton, and in-line 4 cylinder engines, as well as on
    Chrysler’s 2.7 liter, 3.7 liter, 4.7 liter, 5.7 liter and
    6.1 liter engines, including the Hemi applications. In addition,
    the Company provides timing systems to a number of Asian OEMs
    and their North American transplant operations, including Honda,
    Nissan, and Hyundai, and to several European OEMs. The Company
    believes that it is the world’s leading manufacturer of
    timing chain systems.

The Engine Group has reached full production of its first
    high-volume variable cam timing (“VCT”) systems for a
    new family of GM V6 engines. VCT is a means of precisely
    controlling the flow of air into and out of an engine by
    allowing the camshaft to be dynamically phased relative to its
    crankshaft. The Company’s VCT system includes Torsional
    Assist

tm

technology, which utilizes camshaft torque as its main actuation
    energy, instead of the conventional oil-pressure actuated
    approach. The VCT systems are utilized by GM’s new 3.5
    liter and 3.9 liter

V-6

engines
    in the all-new Saturn Aura, Chevrolet Impala and Pontiac G6.
    HY-VO

®

chain is used to transfer power from the engine to the
    drivetrain. The Company’s MORSE
    GEMINI

®

chain system emits significantly less chain pitch frequency
    noise than conventional transmission chain systems. The chain in
    a transfer case distributes power between the front and rear
    output shafts which, in turn, drive the front and rear wheels.
    The Company believes it is the world’s leading manufacturer
    of chain for FWD transmissions and 4WD transfer cases. These
    products are provided from facilities in North America, Europe
    and Asia.

The Engine Group believes it is a leading global provider of
    engine thermal solutions for truck, agricultural and off-highway
    applications. The group designs, manufactures and markets
    viscous fan drives that control fans to sense and respond to
    multiple cooling requirements. The Engine Group also
    manufactures and markets polymer fans for engine cooling
    systems. The Company’s thermal products provide improved
    vehicle fuel economy and reduced engine emissions while
    minimizing parasitic horsepower loss. These advanced thermal
    systems products are provided from facilities in North America,
    South America, Europe and Asia. The Company has been awarded the
    “standard position” for its products at the major
    global heavy truck producers, rather than its previous
    “optional position.”



In 2005, the Company acquired 69.4% of the outstanding shares of
    BERU Aktiengesellschaft (“BERU”), headquartered in
    Ludwigsburg, Germany. BERU’s operating results are included
    within the Engine Group. BERU is a leading global automotive
    supplier of diesel cold starting technology (glow plugs and
    instant starting systems); gasoline ignition technology (spark
    plugs and ignition coils); and electronic control units and
    sensor technology (tire pressure sensors, diesel cabin heaters
    and selected sensors). BERU is represented in Europe, Asia and
    North America.

Drivetrain

The Drivetrain Group leverages the Company’s expertise in
    wet friction clutches, mechanical coupling devices, and control
    systems, enabling efficient transmission of engine torque to the
    vehicle drivetrain, and management of torque distribution to the
    driven wheels. The Drivetrain Group’s major products are
    transmission components and systems, and all-wheel drive
    (“AWD”) torque management systems.

Drivetrain Group designs and manufactures automatic transmission
    components and modules in North America, Asia and Europe.
    Principal product lines include:

•

Friction products:

friction plates,
    transmission bands, torque converter clutches, friction clutch
    modules.

•

Mechanical products:

One-way clutches,
    torsional vibration dampers

•

Controls products:

Electro-hydraulic
    solenoids, solenoid modules, high pressure solenoids for
    automated manual transmissions (“AMT”s).

•

Dual clutch transmissions products:

Dual
    clutch modules, torsional vibration dampers, Mechatronic control
    modules.

The Company is a supplier to virtually every major automatic
    transmission manufacturer in the world. The Company’s
    50%-owned joint venture in Japan, NSK-Warner Kabushiki Kaisha
    (“NSK-Warner”), is a leading producer of friction
    plates and one-way clutches in Japan. NSK-Warner is also the
    joint venture partner with a 40% interest in the Drivetrain
    Group’s Korean subsidiary, BorgWarner Transmission Systems
    Korea, Inc.

In 2006 the Drivetrain Group acquired the high-pressure solenoid
    product lines of Eaton Corporation. These solenoids are used in
    AMTs installed on manual gearboxes. AMTs are a growing niche of
    the entry-level city-car and light commercial-vehicle segments
    in Europe and some Asian markets.

In 2003, the Drivetrain Group launched its proprietary dual
    clutch transmission technology known as
    DualTronic

®

on Volkswagen Audi Group’s revolutionary Direct Shift
    Gearbox (“DSG”), featured in the VW Golf R32 and the
    Audi TT 3.2. This technology provides the smooth-shifting
    convenience of an automatic transmission with the fuel
    efficiency of a manual transmission, and quicker shifts than
    either. Through advanced electro-hydraulic controls and a unique
    two-clutch wet-friction system,
    DualTronic

®

technology eliminates the interruption in powerflow that drivers
    experience with a manual or automated manual transmission. This
    technology is expanding across the entire VW Group vehicle
    family, including VW, Audi, Skoda and SEAT vehicles sold
    worldwide.

In conventional automatic transmissions, there has been a global
    market trend from four and five speeds to six, seven, and even
    eight speed transmissions. Transmissions with more speeds
    improve fuel economy and vehicle performance. The Company is a
    leading supplier of friction, mechanical, and controls products
    to every major automatic transmission producer worldwide.

The Drivetrain Group’s torque management products include
    4WD, AWD transfer cases and systems for rear-wheel drive
    vehicles, and torque management products and systems to transfer
    torque within the drivetrain for FWD/AWD based vehicles. The
    main focus is on electronically controlled (active) torque
    management devices and systems. Other torque management products
    include synchronizer rings and systems for application in
    manual, automated manual, and dual clutch transmissions.

Transfer cases are installed primarily on light-trucks,
    sport-utility vehicles (“SUV”s), and rear-wheel drive
    based cross-over utility vehicles (“CUV”s) and
    passenger cars. A transfer case attaches to the transmission and



distributes torque to the front and rear axles for 4WD,
    improving vehicle control during off-road use and in a variety
    of road conditions. The Company has designed and developed an
    exclusive 4WD

TORQUE-ON-DEMAND

®

(“TOD

®

”)
    transfer case system, which allows vehicles to automatically
    shift from two-wheel drive to 4WD when electronic data and
    sensors indicate it is necessary. The
    TOD

®

transfer case is available on the Ford Explorer, Ford
    Expedition, Lincoln Navigator, Kia Sorrento, and certain
    SsangYong vehicles.

Sales of rear-wheel drive based transfer cases and components
    represented approximately 10%, 12% and 18% of the Company’s
    total revenues for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The
    Company supplies the majority of the 4WD transfer cases to Ford,
    including those installed in the Ford Explorer, the Ford
    Expedition, the Ford F-150, Ranger

pick-up

trucks, the Mercury Mountaineer and the Lincoln Navigator. The
    Company also supplies transfer cases to a number of General
    Motors applications including the Hummer H2 and H3; the Cadillac
    Escalade, STS and SRX; and the GMC Yukon Denali. The Company
    began supplying transfer cases for the Audi Q7 in 2005 and to
    Great Wall Motor Company Limited, a leading light-truck and SUV
    manufacturer in China, in 2006. The Company also supplies 4WD
    transfer cases to several other Asia-based OEMs.

The Company supplies a family of AWD products for both volume
    and performance applications. One of the Company’s AWD
    iTrac

tm

products is the
    T-Trac

tm

torque transfer system, formerly called ITM
    II

®

.
    The Company is actively involved in developing this technology
    for new applications in both FWD based CUVs and passenger cars.
    This product was launched on the Honda Pilot in 2002 and on the
    Honda Ridgeline, a midsize pickup, in 2005.
    ITM

®

uses electronically controlled clutches to distribute power to
    the individual rear wheels when traction is required. A variant
    of this product,
    ITM2e

tm

,
    which features a single clutch pack in front of the rear axle
    differential is supplied to Hyundai for the Hyundai Tucson and
    KIA Sportage The latest design,
    ITM3e

®

,
    was launched on the new Hyundai Santa Fe and Chrysler
    Pacifica in 2006.

The Company’s drivetrain products are manufactured in North
    America, Europe and Asia.

Financial
    Information About Geographic Areas

See Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements in the Company’s Annual Report for financial
    information about geographic areas, which is incorporated herein
    by reference.

Approximately 60% of consolidated sales for 2006 was outside the
    United States, including exports. However, a portion of such
    sales was to OEMs headquartered outside the United States that
    produce vehicles that are, in turn, exported to the United
    States.

Customers

Approximately 75% of the Company’s total sales in 2006 was
    for light-vehicle applications, with the remaining 25% of the
    Company’s sales to a diversified group of commercial truck,
    bus, construction and agricultural vehicle manufacturers, and to
    distributors of aftermarket replacement parts.

For the most recent three-year period, the Company’s
    worldwide sales to the following customers were approximately as
    follows:

The Company’s 2006 consolidated sales do not include the
    approximately $676 million of sales made by the
    Company’s unconsolidated joint ventures. If sales from
    these unconsolidated joint ventures were included in 2006
    consolidated sales, our worldwide sales to Toyota Motor
    Corporation and its affiliates would be approximately 7% of
    consolidated sales.

The Company’s automotive products are generally sold
    directly to OEMs substantially pursuant to negotiated annual
    contracts, long-term supply agreements or terms and conditions
    as may be modified by



the parties. Deliveries are subject to periodic authorizations
    based upon the production schedules of the OEMs. The Company
    typically ships its products directly from its plants to the
    OEMs.

Sales and
    Marketing

Each of the Company’s business units within its two
    operating segments has its own sales function. Account
    executives for each business unit are assigned to serve specific
    OEM customers for one or more of a business unit’s
    products. Such account executives spend the majority of their
    time in direct contact with OEM purchasing and engineering
    employees and are responsible for servicing existing business
    and for identifying and obtaining new business. Because of their
    close relationship with the OEMs, account executives are able to
    identify and meet customers’ needs based upon their
    knowledge of the Company’s products and design and
    manufacturing capabilities. Upon securing a new order, account
    executives participate in product launch team activities and
    serve as a key interface with the customers.

In addition, between the Engine segment and the Drivetrain
    segment, sales and marketing employees work together to explore
    cross-development opportunities for the business units. The
    development of
    DualTronic

®

,
    the Company’s wet-clutch and control-system technology for
    a new-concept automated transmission, is an example of a
    successful collaboration.

Seasonality

The Company’s business is moderately seasonal because the
    Company’s largest North American customers typically halt
    vehicle production for approximately two weeks in July and one
    week in December. Additionally, customers in Europe and Asia
    typically shut down vehicle production during portions of July
    or August and one week in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, the
    Company’s third and fourth quarters may reflect those
    practices.

Research
    and Development

The Company conducts advanced engine and drivetrain research at
    the segment level. This advanced engineering function looks to
    leverage electronics and the Company’s expertise across
    product lines to create new engine and drivetrain systems and
    modules that can be commercialized. A venture capital fund that
    was created by the Company as seed money for new innovation and
    collaboration across businesses is managed by this function.

In addition, each of the Company’s operating segments has
    its own research and development (“R&D”)
    organization. The Company has approximately 800 employees,
    including engineers, mechanics and technicians, engaged in
    R&D activities at facilities worldwide. The Company also
    operates testing facilities such as prototype, measurement and
    calibration, life cycle testing and dynamometer laboratories.

By working closely with the OEMs and anticipating their future
    product needs, the Company’s R&D personnel conceive,
    design, develop and manufacture new proprietary automotive
    components and systems. R&D personnel also work to improve
    current products and production processes. The Company believes
    its commitment to R&D will allow it to obtain new orders
    from its OEM customers.

The Company’s net R&D expenditures are included in the
    selling, general, and administrative expenses of the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations. Customer reimbursements
    are netted against gross R&D



expenditures upon billing of services performed. The Company has
    contracts with several customers at the Company’s various
    R&D locations. No such contract exceeded $5.0 million
    in any of the years presented.

Patents
    and Licenses

The Company has approximately 3,800 active domestic and foreign
    patents and patent applications pending or under preparation,
    and receives royalties from licensing patent rights to others.
    While it considers its patents on the whole to be important, the
    Company does not consider any single patent, any group of
    related patents or any single license essential to its
    operations in the aggregate or to the operations of any of the
    Company’s business groups individually. The expiration of
    the patents individually and in the aggregate is not expected to
    have a material effect on the Company’s financial position
    or future operating results. The Company owns numerous
    trademarks, some of which are valuable, but none of which are
    essential to its business in the aggregate.

The Company owns the “BorgWarner” and
    “Borg-Warner Automotive” trade names and housemarks,
    and variations thereof, which are material to the Company’s
    business.

Competition

The Company’s operating segments compete worldwide with a
    number of other manufacturers and distributors which produce and
    sell similar products. Many of these competitors are larger and
    have greater resources than the Company. Price, quality and
    technological innovation are the primary elements of competition.

The Company’s major competitors include:

Product Type: Engine

Name of Competitor

Turbochargers:

Honeywell International Inc.

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd.

Chains:

Tsubaki Group

Iwis

Emissions products:

Kolbenschmidt Pierburg AG

Valeo

Bosch

Thermal products:

Behr GmbH & Co.

Horton/Sachs

Usui

Diesel cold start technology:

Bosch

NGK

Product Type: Drivetrain

Name of Competitor

Torque transfer products:

Magna International Inc.

JTEKT

Transmission products:

Dynax Corporation

INA-Schaeffler

In addition, a number of the Company’s major OEM customers
    manufacture, for their own use and for others, products which
    compete with the Company’s products. Although these OEM
    customers have indicated that they will continue to rely on
    outside suppliers, the OEMs could elect to manufacture products
    to meet their own requirements or to compete with the Company.
    There can be no assurance that the Company’s business will
    not be adversely affected by increased competition in the
    markets in which it operates.

For many of its products, the Company’s competitors include
    suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic
    advantages such as lower labor costs, lower health care costs
    and, in some cases, export subsidies

and/or

raw
    materials subsidies. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors.



Employees

As of December 31, 2006, the Company and its consolidated
    subsidiaries had approximately 17,400 salaried and hourly
    employees (as compared with approximately 17,400 employees at
    December 31, 2005), of which approximately 7,000 were
    U.S. employees. Included in these 17,400 employees are
    approximately 2,600 BERU employees. Approximately 23% of the
    Company’s U.S. work force is unionized. The hourly
    workers at the Company’s

non-U.S. operations

are typically unionized. The Company believes its present
    relations with employees to be satisfactory.

Raw
    Materials

Continuing a trend which began in 2004, several raw materials
    used in the Company’s products hit record pricing levels,
    including steel, copper, resins, nickel and certain alloying
    elements. This was due to a host of supply and demand factors.

Despite these challenges, the Company used a variety of tactics
    in order to limit the impact of inflationary prices and supply
    shortages. The Company formed a global procurement organization
    to accelerate: cost reductions, purchases from lower cost
    regions, risk mitigation efforts, and collaborative buying
    activities. In addition, the Company used long-term contracts,
    cost sharing arrangements, design changes, customer buy
    programs, and hedging instruments to help control costs. The
    Company intends to use similar measures in 2007 and beyond.

For 2007, each of the Company’s operating segments believes
    that its supplies of raw materials and energy are adequate and
    available from multiple sources to support its manufacturing
    requirements. Manufacturing operations for each of the
    Company’s operating segments are dependent upon natural
    gas, fuel oil, and electricity.

Environmental
    Regulation and Proceedings

The Company and certain of its current and former direct and
    indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have
    been identified by the United States Environmental Protection
    Agency and certain state environmental agencies and private
    parties as potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) at
    various hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive
    Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
    (“Superfund”) and equivalent state laws and, as such,
    may presently be liable for the cost of

clean-up

and
    other remedial activities at 35 such sites. Responsibility for

clean-up

and
    other remedial activities at a Superfund site is typically
    shared among PRPs based on an allocation formula.

The Company believes that none of these matters, individually or
    in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its
    results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
    Generally, this is because either the estimates of the maximum
    potential liability at a site are not large or the liability
    will be shared with other PRPs, although no assurance can be
    given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter.

Based on information available to the Company (which in most
    cases, includes: an estimate of allocation of liability among
    PRPs; the probability that other PRPs, many of whom are large,
    solvent public companies, will fully pay the cost apportioned to
    them; currently available information from PRPs

and/or

federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of
    contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs;
    remediation alternatives; estimated legal fees; and other
    factors), the Company has established an accrual for indicated
    environmental liabilities with a balance at December 31,
    2006, of approximately $20 million. Excluding the Crystal
    Springs site discussed below for which $10.8 million has
    been accrued, the Company has accrued amounts that do not exceed
    $3.0 million related to any individual site and management
    does not believe that the costs related to any of these other
    individual sites will have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial
    condition. The Company expects to pay out substantially all of
    the accrued environmental liability over the next three to five
    years.

In connection with the sale of Kuhlman Electric Corporation
    (“Kuhlman Electric”), the Company agreed to indemnify
    the buyer and Kuhlman Electric for certain environmental
    liabilities, then unknown to the Company, relating to the past
    operations of Kuhlman Electric. The liabilities at issue result
    from the operations of Kuhlman



Electric that pre-date the Company’s acquisition of Kuhlman
    Electric’s parent company, Kuhlman Corporation, in 1999.
    During 2000, Kuhlman Electric notified the Company that it
    discovered potential environmental contamination at its Crystal
    Springs, Mississippi plant while undertaking an expansion of the
    plant. The Company is continuing to work with the Mississippi
    Department of Environmental Quality and Kuhlman Electric to
    investigate and remediate to the extent necessary, if any,
    historical contamination at the plant and surrounding area.
    Kuhlman Electric and others, including the Company, were sued in
    numerous related lawsuits, in which multiple claimants alleged
    personal injury and property damage.

The Company and other defendants, including the Company’s
    subsidiary Kuhlman Corporation, entered into a settlement in
    July 2005 regarding approximately 90% of personal injury and
    property damage claims relating to the alleged environmental
    contamination. In exchange for, among other things, the
    dismissal with prejudice of these lawsuits, the defendants
    agreed to pay a total sum of up to $39.0 million in
    settlement funds. The settlement was paid in three approximately
    equal installments. The first two payments of $12.9 million
    were made in the third and fourth quarters of 2005 and
    $13.0 million was paid in the first quarter of 2006.

The same group of defendants entered into a settlement in
    October 2005 regarding approximately 9% of personal injury and
    property damage claims relating to the alleged environmental
    contamination. In exchange for, among other things, the
    dismissal with prejudice of these lawsuits, the defendants
    agreed to pay a total sum of up to $5.4 million in
    settlement funds. The settlement was paid in two approximately
    equal installments in the fourth quarter of 2005 and the first
    quarter of 2006. With this settlement, the Company and other
    defendants have resolved about 99% of the known personal injury
    and property damage claims relating to the alleged environmental
    contamination. The cost of this settlement has been recorded in
    other income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Our
    industry is cyclical and our results of operations will be
    adversely affected by industry downturns.

Automotive and truck production and sales are cyclical and
    sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors.
    Significant reduction in automotive or truck production would
    have a material adverse effect on our sales to original
    equipment manufacturers and our financial position and operating
    results.

We are
    dependent on sport-utility vehicle and light-truck market
    segments.

Some of our products, in particular four-wheel drive transfer
    cases, are currently used exclusively in four-wheel drive
    systems for sport-utility vehicles and light-trucks. For 2006
    for example, sales of rear-wheel drive transfer cases
    represented 10% of our total consolidated revenue. Any
    significant reduction in production in this market segment or
    loss of business in this market segment would have a material
    adverse effect on our sales to original equipment manufacturers
    and our financial position and operating results.

We
    face strong competition.

We compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and
    distributors that produce and sell products similar to ours.
    Price, quality and technological innovation are the primary
    elements of competition. Our competitors include vertically
    integrated units of our major original equipment manufacturer
    customers, as well as a large number of independent domestic and
    international suppliers. We are not as large as a number of
    these companies and do not have as many financial or other
    resources. The competitive environment has changed dramatically
    over the past few years as our traditional U.S. original
    equipment manufacturer customers, faced with intense
    international competition, have expanded their worldwide
    sourcing of components. As a result, we have experienced
    competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that
    enjoy economic advantages, such as lower labor costs, lower
    health care costs and, in some cases, export or raw materials
    subsidies. Increased competition could adversely affect our
    businesses.

We are
    under substantial pressure from original equipment manufacturers
    to reduce the prices of our products.

There is substantial and continuing pressure on original
    equipment manufacturers to reduce costs, including costs of
    products we supply. Although original equipment manufacturers
    have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside
    suppliers, a number of our major original equipment manufacturer
    customers manufacture products for their own uses that directly
    compete with our products. These original equipment
    manufacturers could elect to manufacture such products for their
    own uses in place of the products we currently supply. We
    believe that our ability to develop proprietary new products and
    to control our costs will allow us to remain competitive.
    However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to improve or
    maintain our gross margins on product sales to original
    equipment manufacturers or that the recent trend by original
    equipment manufacturers towards increased outsourcing will
    continue.

Annual price reductions to original equipment manufacturer
    customers appear to have become a permanent feature of our
    business environment. In 2006 and 2005, the combination of price
    reductions to customers and cost increases for material, labor
    and overhead, totaled approximately $155 million and
    $140 million, respectively. To maintain our profit margins,
    we seek price reductions from our suppliers, improve production
    processes to increase manufacturing efficiency, update product
    designs to reduce costs and develop new products the benefits of
    which support stable or increased prices. Our ability to pass
    through increased raw material costs to our original equipment
    manufacturer customers is limited, with cost recovery less than
    100% and often on a delayed basis. We cannot assure you that we
    will be able to reduce costs in an amount equal to annual price
    reductions and increases in raw material costs.



We are
    sensitive to the effects of our major customers’ labor
    relations.

All three of our primary North American customers, Ford,
    DaimlerChrysler and General Motors, have major union contracts
    with the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement
    Workers of America. Because of domestic original equipment
    manufacturers’ dependence on a single union, we are
    affected by labor difficulties and work stoppages at original
    equipment manufacturers’ facilities. Similarly, a majority
    of our global customers’ operations outside of North
    America are also represented by various unions. Any extended
    work stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our
    financial position and operating results.

Part
    of our labor force is unionized.

As of December 31, 2006, approximately 23% of our
    U.S. employees was unionized. Our two most significant
    domestic collective bargaining agreements are for our Muncie,
    Indiana plant and our Ithaca, New York plants. The Muncie
    agreement expires in April 2009 and the Ithaca agreement expires
    in October 2008. The hourly employees at certain of our
    international facilities are also unionized. While we believe
    that our relations with our employees are satisfactory, a
    prolonged dispute with our employees could have a material
    adverse effect on our financial position and operating results.

We are
    subject to extensive environmental regulations.

Our operations are subject to laws governing, among other
    things, emissions to air, discharges to waters and the
    generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and
    disposal of waste and other materials. We believe that our
    business, operations and activities have been and are being
    operated in compliance in all material respects with applicable
    environmental and health and safety laws. However, the operation
    of automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in these
    areas, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur material
    costs or liabilities as a result. Furthermore, through various
    acquisitions over the years, we have acquired a number of
    manufacturing facilities, and we cannot assure you that we will
    not incur material costs and liabilities relating to activities
    that predate our ownership. In addition, potentially significant
    expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving
    environmental and health and safety laws that may be adopted in
    the future.

We believe that the overall impact of compliance with
    regulations and legislation protecting the environment will not
    have a material adverse effect on our future financial position
    or operating results, but we cannot assure you that this will
    always be the case. Capital expenditures and expenses in 2006
    attributable to compliance with environmental laws were not
    material.

We
    have contingent liabilities related to environmental, product
    warranties, regulatory matters, litigation and other
    claims.

We and certain of our current and former direct and indirect
    corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have been
    identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency
    and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as
    potentially responsible parties at various hazardous waste
    disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
    Compensation and Liability Act and equivalent state laws. As a
    result, as of December 31, 2006, we may be liable for the
    cost of

clean-up

and
    other remedial activities at 35 of these sites.

We work with outside experts to determine a range of potential
    liability for environmental sites. The ranges for each
    individual site are then aggregated into a loss range for the
    total accrued liability. Management’s estimate of the loss
    range for 2006 is between $18.1 million and
    $29.5 million. We record an accrual at the most probable
    amount within the range unless one cannot be determined; in
    which case we record the accrual at the low end of the range.
    Based on information available to us, we have established an
    accrual in our financial statements for indicated environmental
    liabilities, with a balance of $20.0 million at
    December 31, 2006. We currently expect this amount to be
    expended over the next three to five years.

We believe that none of these matters, individually or in the
    aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our future
    financial position or operating results, either because
    estimates of the maximum potential liability at a



site are not large or because liability will be shared with
    other potentially responsible parties. However, we cannot assure
    you of the ultimate outcome.

We are also party to, or have an obligation to defend a party
    to, various legal proceedings, including those described in
    Note 15 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in the Company’s Annual Report. Although we
    believe that none of these matters is likely to have a material
    adverse effect on our financial condition or future operating
    results, there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of
    any such matter or proceeding.

We provide warranties to our customers for some of our products.
    Under these warranties, we may be required to bear costs and
    expenses for the repair or replacement of these products. We
    cannot assure you that costs and expenses associated with these
    product warranties will not be material, or that those costs
    will not exceed any amounts accrued for such warranties in our
    financial statement.

Based upon information available to us, we have established an
    accrual in our financial statements for product warranties of
    $60.0 million at December 31, 2006.

Our
    growth strategy may prove unsuccessful.

We have a stated goal of increasing revenues and operating
    revenues at a rate greater than global vehicle production by
    increasing content per vehicle with innovative new components
    and through select acquisitions. We may not meet our goal
    because of any of the following: (a) a significant decrease
    in the production of sport-utility vehicles and light-trucks,
    high content vehicles for us; (b) the failure to develop
    new products which will be purchased by our customers;
    (c) technology changes rendering our products obsolete;
    (d) a reversal of the trend of supplying systems (which
    allows us to increase content per vehicle) instead of
    components; and (e) the failure to find suitable
    acquisition targets or the failure to integrate operations of
    acquired businesses quickly and cost effectively.

We are
    subject to risks related to our international
    operations.

We have manufacturing and technical facilities in many regions
    and countries, including North America, Europe, China, India,
    South Korea, Japan, and Brazil and sell our products worldwide.
    For 2006, approximately 60% of our sales were outside North
    America. Consequently, our results could be affected by changes
    in trade, monetary and fiscal policies, trade restrictions or
    prohibitions, import or other charges or taxes, and fluctuations
    in foreign currency exchange rates, changing economic
    conditions, and political instability and disputes. See
    Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    in the Company’s Annual Report.

We may
    not realize sales represented by awarded business.

We base our growth projections, in part, on commitments made by
    our customers. These commitments generally renew yearly during a
    program life cycle. If actual production orders from our
    customers do not approximate such commitments, it could have a
    material adverse effect on our growth and financial performance.

We are
    impacted by the rising cost of providing pension and other post
    employment benefits.

The automotive industry, like other industries, continues to be
    impacted by the rising cost of providing pension and other post
    employment benefits. To partially address this impact, we
    adjusted certain retiree medical plans effective April 1,
    2006 to provide certain participating retirees with continued
    access to group health coverage while reducing our subsidy of
    the program. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements in the Company’s Annual Report.

Certain
    defined benefit pension plans we sponsor are currently
    underfunded.

We sponsor certain defined benefit pension plans worldwide that
    are underfunded and will require cash payments. Additionally, if
    the performance of the assets in our pension plans does not meet
    our expectations, or if



other actuarial assumptions are modified, our required
    contributions may be higher than we expect. See Note 12 of
    the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the
    Company’s Annual Report.

Negative
    or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our
    results of operations.

Adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial
    outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to
    changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets
    and other tax accruals that could materially and adversely
    affect our results of operations.

Additionally, we are subject to tax audits by governmental
    authorities in the U.S. and numerous

non-U.S. jurisdictions.

Because the results of tax audits are inherently uncertain,
    negative or unexpected results from one or more such tax audits
    could adversely affect our results of operations.

We
    rely on sales to several major customers.

Our worldwide sales in 2006 to Ford Motor Company, Volkswagen,
    DaimlerChrysler and General Motors Corporation constituted
    approximately 13%, 13%, 11% and 9%, respectively, of our 2006
    consolidated sales. These four customers constituted
    approximately 46% of our 2006 sales. Credit rating agencies rate
    two of these customers below investment grade. The corresponding
    percentages of sales to these customers for 2005 were 16%, 13%,
    12% and 9%. No other single customer accounted for more that 10%
    of our consolidated sales in 2006 or 2005.

Our 2006 consolidated sales do not include the approximately
    $676 million of sales made by our unconsolidated joint
    ventures. If sales from these unconsolidated joint ventures were
    included in 2006 consolidated sales, our worldwide sales to
    Toyota Motor Corporation and its affiliates would be
    approximately 7% of consolidated sales.

Economic
    distress of suppliers could result in disruption of our
    operations and have a material effect on our
    business.

Some automotive parts suppliers continue to experience commodity
    cost pressures and the effects of industry overcapacity. These
    factors have increased pressure on the industry’s supply
    base, as suppliers cope with higher commodity costs, lower
    production volumes and other challenges. The Company receives
    certain of its raw materials from sole suppliers or a limited
    number of suppliers. The inability of a supplier to fulfill
    supply requirements of the Company could materially affect
    future operating results.

Item 1B.

Unresolved
    Staff Comments

The Company has received no written comments regarding its
    periodic or current reports from the staff of the Securities and
    Exchange Commission that were issued 180 days or more
    preceding the end of its 2006 fiscal year and that remain
    unresolved.

Item 2.

Properties

As of December 31, 2006, the Company had 64 manufacturing,
    assembly, and technical locations worldwide. In addition to its
    15 U.S. manufacturing locations, the Company has 10
    locations in Germany, five locations in each of India and Korea,
    three locations in each of the United Kingdom, France and China,
    two locations in each of Japan, Mexico, Hungary, and Italy, and
    one location in each of Brazil, Canada, Ireland, Spain, and
    Taiwan. The Company also has several sales offices, warehouses
    and technical centers. The Company’s worldwide headquarters
    are located in a leased facility in Auburn Hills, Michigan. In
    2002, the Company completed construction of the BorgWarner
    Powertrain Technical Center (the “PTC”) in Auburn
    Hills, Michigan, which serves as a primary research and
    development facility and contains many of the administrative
    personnel for the Engine and Drivetrain segments. There are
    approximately 500 employees located at the PTC. In general, the
    Company believes its facilities to be suitable and adequate to
    meet its current and reasonably anticipated needs. The majority
    of the locations are operating at normal levels based on
    capacity.

Legal
    Proceedings

The Company is subject to a number of claims and judicial and
    administrative proceedings (some of which involve substantial
    amounts) arising out of the Company’s business or relating
    to matters for which the Company may have a contractual
    indemnity obligation. See Note 15 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company’s Annual
    Report for a discussion of environmental, asbestos and other
    litigation, which is incorporated herein by reference.

A declaratory judgment action was filed by a subsidiary of the
    Company, BorgWarner Diversified Transmission Products Inc.
    (“DTP”), in January 2006 in the United Stated District
    Court, Southern District of Indiana, Indianapolis Division,
    against the United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural
    Implements Workers of America, Local No. 287 and Gerald
    Poor, individually and as the representative of a defendant
    class. DTP is seeking the Court’s affirmation that DTP will
    not violate the Labor-Management Relations Act or the Employee
    Retirement Income Security Act by amending certain
    retirees’ medical plans, effective March 12,



2006. DTP believes that it is within its rights to amend the
    plan and that it will be successful on the merits of the
    lawsuit, although there can be no guarantee of success in any
    litigation.

Item 5.

Market
    for the Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder
    Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

The Company’s Common Stock is listed for trading on the New
    York Stock Exchange under the symbol BWA. As of February 9,
    2007, there were 2,651 holders of record of Common Stock.

The Company has increased its dividend during each of the last
    four years. During 2004, the Company paid a quarterly dividend
    of $0.25 on a pre-split basis. In May 2004, the Company declared
    a

two-for-one

stock split, thereby adjusting the quarterly dividend to $0.125.
    For the first quarter of 2005, the Company announced an increase
    in the cash dividend from $0.125 per share to
    $0.14 per share. The Company announced an increase of the
    cash dividend from $0.14 per share to $0.16 per share
    for the first quarter of 2006. The Company announced an increase
    of the cash dividend from $0.16 per share to $0.17 per
    share for the first quarter of 2007. While the Company currently
    expects that comparable quarterly cash dividends will continue
    to be paid in the future, the dividend policy is subject to
    review and change at the discretion of the Board of Directors.

High and low sales prices (as reported on the New York Stock
    Exchange composite tape) for the Common Stock for each quarter

Controls

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

The Company has adopted and maintains disclosure controls and
    procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance
    that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed
    under the Exchange Act, such as this

Form 10-K,

is collected, recorded, processed, summarized and reported
    within the time periods specified in the rules of the Securities
    and Exchange Commission. The Company’s disclosure controls
    and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information
    is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely
    decisions regarding required disclosure. As required under
    Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15,

the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation
    of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of
    the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that
    evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures
    are effective.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting, as defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
    designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s
    management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and
    fair presentation of published financial statements. Management
    conducted an assessment of the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria
    established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework. Based on the assessment, management concluded that,
    as of December 31, 2006, the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting is effective based on those
    criteria. Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of
    the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2006, has been audited by
    Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report below.

The Company’s management, including its Chief Executive
    Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that
    the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures and its
    internal control processes will prevent all error and all fraud.
    A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can
    provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
    objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of
    a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
    constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered
    relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in
    all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide
    absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
    error or fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
    These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments
    in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur
    because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls



can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by
    collusion of two or more people, or by management override of
    the control. The design of any system of controls also is based
    in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
    events, and there can be no assurance that any design will
    succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
    conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of
    changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the
    policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent
    limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements
    due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.
    However, these inherent limitations are known features of the
    financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design
    into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate,
    this risk.

Changes
    in Internal Control

There have been no changes in internal controls over the
    financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal
    quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
    to materially affect our internal controls over financial
    reporting.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of BorgWarner Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting, that BorgWarner Inc. and Consolidated
    Subsidiaries (the “Company”) maintained effective
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material
    respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 of the Company and our report dated
    February 16, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
    financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph
    regarding the Company’s changes in its methods of
    accounting in 2006 for employee stock-based compensation as a
    result of adopting SFAS No. 123(R),

Share Based
    Payment,

and for defined benefit pension and other post
    retirement plans as a result of adopting SFAS No. 158,

    Other Postretirement Plans.
