PART I

Item 1.

Business

BorgWarner Inc. (the “Company”), a
Delaware corporation, was incorporated in 1987. The Company is a
leading, global supplier of highly engineered systems and
components, primarily for powertrain applications. The
Company’s products help improve vehicle performance, fuel
efficiency, air quality and vehicle stability. These products
are manufactured and sold worldwide, primarily to original
equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) of light vehicles
(passenger cars, sport-utility vehicles, vans and light trucks).
The Company’s products are also sold to OEMs of commercial
trucks, buses and agricultural and off-highway vehicles. The
Company operates manufacturing facilities serving customers in
the Americas, Europe and Asia, and is an original equipment
supplier to every major automotive OEM in the world.

Financial Information About Segments

Incorporated herein by reference is
Note Sixteen of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements on pages 52 through 54 of the Company’s
Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2004 (the
“Company’s Annual Report”) filed as an exhibit to
this report.

Narrative Description of Operating
Segments

The Company reports its results under two
reportable operating segments: Drivetrain and Engine. Net
revenues by segment for the three years ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, are as follows (in millions of dollars):

The sales information presented above excludes
the sales by the Company’s unconsolidated joint ventures
(See “Joint Ventures” section). Such sales totaled
approximately $500 million in 2004, $391 million in
2003 and $332 million in 2002.

Drivetrain

The Drivetrain Group leverages the Company’s
legacy and understanding of powertrain torque management to
develop interactive electronic control systems and strategies
for the Company’s traditional mechanical products. The
Drivetrain Group’s products are primarily transmission
components and systems for torque management applications.

The Drivetrain Group engineers and manufactures
components for automatic transmissions and the systems that
combine such components in North America, Asia and Europe.
Principal product lines include friction plates, one-way
clutches, transmission bands and torque converter lock-up
clutches for automatic transmissions. The Company is a supplier
to virtually every major automatic transmission manufacturer in
the world. The Company’s 50%-owned joint venture in Japan,
NSK-Warner Kabushiki Kaisha (“NSK-Warner”), is a
leading producer of friction plates and one-way clutches in
Japan.

The Drivetrain Group also designs and
manufactures sophisticated electro-mechanical, mechanical and
electronic components and systems used for automated
transmissions. Key products for transmission controls include
single function solenoids, complex solenoids and multi-function
modules.



In 2003, the Company launched its
DualTronic

TM

transmission technology on the VW Golf
R32 DSG and the Audi TT 3.2. The technology provides the
smooth-shifting convenience of an automatic transmission with
the fuel efficiency of a manual transmission. Through advanced
electrohydraulic controls and a unique two-clutch wet-friction
system, DualTronic

TM

technology eliminates the
disruptive feel of a manual transmission gear shift. This
technology is being launched across the entire VW Group vehicle
family, including VW, Audi, Skoda and Seat.

There has been a noticeable trend in transmission
technology from four and five speed to six speed transmissions.
Six speed transmissions improve fuel economy and vehicle
performance. These transmissions are being developed by a
variety of transmission manufacturers, including ZF, Aisin AW,
GM, Ford and Jatco. The Company supplies solenoids, transmission
control modules, friction plates and clutching mechanisms for
six speed transmissions.

The Company’s torque management products
include four-wheel drive (“4WD”) and all-wheel drive
transfer cases for rear wheel drive vehicles and torque
management systems to transfer torque within the drivetrain for
front-wheel drive (“FWD”)/all-wheel drive
(“AWD”) based vehicles. The main focus is on
electronically controlled torque management devices and systems.

Transfer cases are installed primarily on light
trucks and sport-utility vehicles (“SUVs”). A transfer
case attaches to the transmission and distributes torque to the
front and rear axles for 4WD, improving vehicle control during
off-road use and in a variety of road conditions. The Company
has designed and developed an exclusive 4WD
TORQUE-ON-DEMAND® (“TOD®”) transfer case
system, which allows vehicles to automatically shift from
two-wheel drive to 4WD when electronic sensors indicate it is
necessary. The TOD® transfer case is available on the Ford
Explorer, the best selling SUV in the United States in 2004,
2003 and 2002, and the Ford Expedition, Lincoln Navigator and
SsangYong Musso. In 2001, this technology was also adopted by
Hyundai for its Terracan SUV, and was launched on the Kia
Sorento in 2002.

Sales of rear wheel drive based transfer cases
represented approximately 18%, 20% and 21% of the Company’s
total revenues for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The
Company’s largest customer of 4WD transfer cases is Ford
Motor Company. The Company supplies the majority of the 4WD
transfer cases to Ford, including those installed in the Ford
Explorer, the Lincoln Aviator, the Ford Expedition, the Ford
F-150, Ranger pick-up trucks, the Mercury Mountaineer and the
Lincoln Navigator. The Company also began supplying transfer
cases to several new General Motors applications in 2002
including the Hummer H2, the Cadillac Escalade, the Chevrolet
Tahoe and the Suburban, along with the GMC Yukon and the Yukon
XL. The Company also supplies transfer cases for the Cadillac
SRX and STS and will begin supplying transfer cases for the new
Hummer H3 in 2005.

One of the Company’s AWD products is the
INTERACTIVE TORQUE MANAGEMENT

TM

(“ITM®”) system. This product was introduced on
the Acura MDX in 2000, was launched on the Honda Pilot in 2002
and will be installed on the 2006 Honda Ridgeline, new midsize
pickup. ITM® uses electronically controlled clutches to
distribute power to the individual rear wheels when traction is
required. The Company is actively involved in developing this
technology for new applications in both front-wheel drive based
cross-over vehicles and passenger cars. A variant of this
product, ITM 1®, which features a single clutch pack in
front of the rear axle differential, was launched on the Hyundai
Santa Fe in 2002, the Hyundai Tucson and KIA Sportage in
2004.

The Company’s drivetrain products are
manufactured in North America, Europe, and Asia.

Engine

The Engine Group develops strategies and products
to manage engines for fuel efficiency, reduced emissions, and
enhanced performance. Its products currently fall into three
major categories: turbochargers, chains, and emissions and
thermal systems.

The Engine Group provides turbochargers for light
vehicle, commercial vehicle and industrial applications for
diesel and gasoline engine manufacturers in Europe, North
America, South America



and Asia. The Engine Group has greatly benefited
from the growth in turbocharger demand in Europe. This growth is
linked to increasing demand for diesel engine light vehicles and
for turbocharged gasoline engines. Benefits of turbochargers in
both light vehicle and commercial vehicle applications include
increased power for a given engine size, improved fuel economy
and significantly reduced emissions. The Company believes it is
a leading manufacturer of turbochargers worldwide.

Sales of turbochargers for light vehicles
represented approximately 16%, 13% and 9% of the Company’s
total revenues for 2004, 2003 and 2002. The Company currently
supplies light vehicle turbochargers to VW, Renault, PSA,
International and Fiat and commercial vehicle turbochargers to
Caterpillar, John Deere, DaimlerChrysler, Deutz and RVI. The
Company expects to supply the next generation of light vehicle
turbochargers in Europe to VW, Renault, PSA, BMW, Ford and Fiat.
In 2004, the Company announced that it would supply the 3.0
liter, 6-cylinder engine for the BMW 5-series with its regulated
two-stage turbocharging system known as R2S®. The system
allows continuously variable adaption of the turbine and
compressor side for every operating point of the engine.

Chain and chain systems include timing chain and
timing chain systems, crankshaft and camshaft sprockets, chain
tensioners and snubbers, HY-VO® FWD transmission chain and
4WD chain, and MORSE GEMINI® chain systems for light
vehicle and commercial vehicle applications. These products are
provided from facilities in North America, Europe and Asia.

The Company’s timing chain systems are used
on Ford’s family of overhead cam engines, including the
Duratech and Triton and in-line 4 cylinder engines, as well as
Chrysler’s 2.7 liter, 3.7 liter, 4.7 liter
and 5.7 liter overhead cam engines, which includes the Hemi
applications. In addition, the Company provides timing systems
for a number of Asian OEMs and their North American transplant
operations, including Honda and Nissan, and to several European
OEMs. The Company believes that it is the world’s leading
manufacturer of timing chain systems.

The Engine Group also will begin production of
its first high-volume variable cam timing
(“VCT”) systems for a new family of GM V6
engines. VCT is a means of precisely controlling the flow of air
into and out of an engine by allowing the camshaft to be
dynamically phased relative to its crankshaft. The
Company’s VCT system includes Torsional Assist

TM

technology, which utilizes camshaft torque as its actuation
energy instead of the conventional oil-pressure actuated
approach. The VCT systems will be utilized by GM’s new 3.5
liter and 3.9 liter, V-6 engines in the 2006 model year
Chevrolet Impala, Chevrolet Monte Carlo and Pontiac G6.

HY-VO® chain is used to transfer power from
the engine to the drivetrain. The Company’s MORSE
GEMINI® chain system emits significantly less chain pitch
frequency noise than conventional transmission chain systems.
The chain in a transfer case distributes power between the front
and rear output shafts which, in turn, drive the front and rear
wheels. The Company believes it is the world’s leading
manufacturer of chain for FWD transmissions and 4WD transfer
cases.

The Engine Group designs and manufactures
sophisticated electro-mechanical, mechanical and electronic
components and systems used for automated transmissions, fluid
pumps, engine air intake modules, engine emission controls and
actuation systems. Key products for transmission controls
include single function solenoids, complex solenoids and
multi-function modules. The Company also manufactures a wide
variety of fluid pumps, including engine hydraulic pumps for
variable cam timing and engine lubrication. Key products for
engine air intake management include throttle bodies, electronic
throttle control, and complete engine induction modules. The
Company also designs and manufactures products to control
emissions and improve gas mileage such as electric air pumps,
variable force solenoids for the actuation of cam phasing
systems and exhaust gas recirculation valves for gasoline and
diesel applications. These products are provided from facilities
in the United States, France and Germany.

The Engine Group is a global provider of engine
cooling solutions. The group manufactures and markets air
sensing fan drives that can be mechanically controlled and
electronically controlled fan



drives that sense and respond to multiple cooling
requirements simultaneously. The Engine Group also manufactures
and markets polymer fans for engine cooling systems. The
Company’s products provide improved vehicle fuel economy
and reduced engine emissions while minimizing parasitic
horsepower loss. These advanced cooling systems products are
manufactured by facilities in the U.S., Germany, Brazil, Korea,
China and India. The Company is a leading global provider of
such products, but competes with other large independent
producers. This business serves the global light, medium, and
heavy vehicle markets, as well as selected off-highway
applications.

On January 4, 2005, the Company acquired
62.2% of the outstanding shares of Beru Aktiengesellschaft
(“Beru”), headquartered in Ludwigsburg, Germany, from
the Carlyle Group and certain family shareholders. In
conjunction with the acquisition, the Company launched a tender
offer for the remaining outstanding shares of Beru. The tender
offer period officially ended on January 24, 2005.
Presently the Company holds 69.42% of the shares of Beru at a
cost of approximately

€

415 million.
Beru is a leading global automotive supplier of diesel cold
starting technology (glow plugs and instant starting systems);
gasoline ignition technology (spark plugs and ignition coils);
and electronic control units and sensor technology (tire
pressure sensors, diesel cabin heaters and selected sensors).
Beginning in 2005, the Company will report the operating results
of Beru within the Engine Group.

Joint Ventures

As of December 31, 2004, the Company had
nine joint ventures in which it has a less-than-100% ownership
interest. Results from six of these ventures, in which the
Company is the majority owner, are consolidated as part of the
Company’s results. The Company’s ownership interest in
NSK-Warner and Hitachi Warner is 50% each. Such interests are
reported using the equity method of accounting.

Management of the unconsolidated joint ventures
is shared with the Company’s respective joint venture
partners. Certain information concerning the Company’s
joint ventures is set forth below:



See Note Sixteen of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 52 through 54 of
the Company’s Annual Report for geographic information.

Customers

Approximately 75% of the Company’s total
sales in 2004 were to light and commercial vehicle OEMs, with
the remaining 25% of the Company’s sales to a diversified
group of industrial, construction and agricultural vehicle
manufacturers, automotive parts manufacturers and to
distributors of automotive aftermarket and replacement parts.

The Company’s worldwide sales in 2004 to
Ford, DaimlerChrysler, General Motors and Volkswagen constituted
approximately 21%, 14%, 10% and 10%, respectively, of its 2004
consolidated sales. Approximately 44% of consolidated sales for
2004 were outside the United States, including exports. However,
a substantial portion of such sales was to OEMs headquartered
outside the United States that produce vehicles that are, in
turn, exported to the United States. See Note Sixteen of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 52
through 54 of the Company’s Annual Report.

The Company’s automotive products are
generally sold directly to OEMs substantially pursuant to
negotiated annual contracts, long-term supply agreements or
terms and conditions as may be modified by the parties.
Deliveries are subject to periodic authorizations based upon the
production schedules of the OEMs. The Company typically ships
its products directly from its plants to the OEMs.

Sales and Marketing

Each of the Company’s business units within
its two operating segments has its own sales function headed by
a vice president of sales. Account executives for each business
unit are assigned to serve specific OEM customers for one or
more of a business unit’s products. Such account executives
spend the majority of their time in direct contact with OEM
purchasing and engineering employees and are responsible for
servicing existing business and for identifying and obtaining
new business. Because of their close relationship with the OEMs,
account executives are able to identify and meet customers’
needs based upon their knowledge of the Company’s products
and design and manufacturing capabilities. Upon securing a new
order, account executives participate in product launch team
activities as a key interface to the customers.

In addition, within the Engine segment and the
Drivetrain segment, sales and marketing employees work together
to explore cross-development opportunities for the business
units. The development of DualTronic

TM

, the
Company’s wet-clutch and control-system technology for a
new-concept automated transmission, is an example of a
successful collaboration.

Seasonality

The Company’s business is moderately
seasonal because the Company’s largest North American
customers typically halt vehicle production for approximately
two weeks in July and one week in December. Additionally,
customers in Europe typically shut down vehicle production
during portions



of August and one week in December. Accordingly,
the Company’s third and fourth quarters may reflect those
trends.

Research and Development

Each of the Company’s operating segments has
its own research and development (“R&D”)
organization. The Company has 639 employees, including
engineers, mechanics and technicians, engaged in R&D
activities at facilities worldwide. The Company also operates
testing facilities such as prototype, measurement and
calibration, life cycle testing and dynamometer laboratories.

By working closely with the OEMs and anticipating
their future product needs, the Company’s R&D personnel
conceive, design, develop and manufacture new proprietary
automotive components and systems. R&D personnel also work
to improve current products and production processes. The
Company believes its commitment to R&D will allow it to
obtain new orders from its OEM customers.

Consistent with its strategy of developing
technologically innovative products, the Company spent
approximately $123.1 million, $118.2 million and
$109.1 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, on
R&D activities. Not included in the reported R&D
activities were customer-sponsored R&D activities of
approximately $31.8 million, $22.3 million and
$14.2 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Patents and Licenses

The Company has approximately 3,200 active
domestic and foreign patents and patent applications pending or
under preparation, and receives royalties from licensing patent
rights to others. While it considers its patents on the whole to
be important, the Company does not consider any single patent,
group of related patents or any single license essential to its
operations in the aggregate or to the operations of any of the
Company’s business groups individually. The expiration of
the patents individually and in the aggregate is not expected to
have a material effect on the Company’s financial position
or future operating results. The Company owns numerous
trademarks, some of which are valuable, but none of which are
essential to its business in the aggregate.

The Company owns the “BorgWarner” and
“Borg-Warner Automotive” trade names and housemarks,
and variations thereof, which are material to the Company’s
business.

Competition

The Company’s operating segments compete
worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors
which produce and sell similar products. Price, quality and
technological innovation are the primary elements of
competition. Many of these companies are larger and have greater
resources than the Company.

The Company’s major competitors include:

In addition, a number of the Company’s major
OEM customers manufacture, for their own use and for others,
products which compete with the Company’s products.
Although these OEM customers have indicated that they will
continue to rely on outside suppliers, the OEMs could elect to



manufacture products to meet their own
requirements or to compete with the Company. There can be no
assurance that the Company’s business will not be adversely
affected by increased competition in the markets in which it
operates.

For many of its products, the Company’s
competitors include suppliers in other parts of the world that
enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs, lower
health care costs and, in some cases, export subsidies and/or
raw materials subsidies.

Employees

As of December 31, 2004, the Company and its
consolidated subsidiaries had approximately 14,500 salaried
and hourly employees (as compared with approximately
14,300 employees at December 31, 2003), of which
approximately 7,900 were U.S. employees. Approximately 26%
of the Company’s domestic workers are unionized. The hourly
workers at the Company’s non-U.S. operations are
typically unionized. The Company believes its present relations
with employees to be satisfactory.

Raw Materials

In 2004, several raw materials used in the
Company’s products hit record pricing levels, including
steel, copper, aluminum, and resins. This was due to a host of
factors, not the least of which included unprecedented growth in
China. Despite these difficulties, the Company used a variety of
tactics in order to limit the impact of rising prices and supply
shortages of certain raw materials. The Company formed a global
purchasing organization to drive cost reductions and create
collaboration across business operations. In addition, the
Company used long-term contracts, cost sharing arrangements,
design changes, re-sourcing, customer buy programs, and hedging
instruments to help control costs. The Company intends to use
similar tactics in 2005 and beyond.

For 2005, each of the Company’s operating
segments believes that its supplies of raw materials for
manufacturing requirements are adequate and are available from
multiple sources. It is common, however, for customers to
require their prior approval before certain raw materials or
components can be used, thereby reducing sources of supply that
would otherwise be available. Manufacturing operations for each
of the Company’s operating segments are dependent upon
natural gas, fuel oil, and electricity.

Environmental Regulation and
Proceedings

The Company’s operations are subject to
federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations
governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharge to
waters and the generation, handling, storage, transportation,
treatment and disposal of waste and other materials. The Company
believes that it has operated its business and facilities in
compliance in all material respects with applicable
environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, many
of which provide for substantial fines and criminal sanctions
for violations. However, the operation of automotive parts
manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas even for a
company complying with all laws, and there can be no assurance
that the Company will not incur material costs or liabilities.
In addition, through various acquisitions over the years, the
Company has acquired a number of manufacturing facilities and
there can be no assurance that the Company will not incur
material costs and liabilities relating to activities which
predate the Company’s ownership. In addition, potentially
significant expenditures could be required in order to comply
with evolving environmental and health and safety laws,
regulations or requirements that may be adopted or imposed in
the future.

The Company believes that the overall impact of
compliance with regulations and legislation protecting the
environment will not have a material effect on its financial
position or future operating results, although no assurance can
be given in this regard. Capital expenditures and expenses in
2004 attributable to compliance with such legislation were not
material.



The Company and certain of its current and former
direct and indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and
divisions have been identified by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and
certain state environmental agencies and private parties as
potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) at various
hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
(“Superfund”) and equivalent state laws and, as such,
may presently be liable for the cost of clean-up and other
remedial activities at 39 such sites. Responsibility for
clean-up and other remedial activities at a Superfund site is
typically shared among PRPs based on an allocation formula.

Based on the information available to the
Company, which in most cases, includes: an estimate of
allocation of liability among PRPs; the probability that other
PRPs, many of whom are large solvent public companies, will
fully pay the cost apportioned to them; currently available
information from PRPs and/or federal or state environmental
agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated
remediation and consulting costs; remediation alternatives;
estimated legal fees; and other factors, the Company has
established an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities
with a balance at December 31, 2004 of approximately
$25.7 million. The Company expects this amount to be
expended over the next three to five years.

The Company believes that none of these matters,
individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse
effect on its financial condition or future operating results,
generally either because estimates of the maximum potential
liability at a site are not large or because liability will be
shared with other PRPs, although no assurance can be given with
respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter.

In connection with the sale of Kuhlman Electric
Corporation (“Kuhlman Electric”), the Company agreed
to indemnify the buyer and Kuhlman Electric for certain
environmental liabilities relating to the past operations of
Kuhlman Electric. The liabilities at issue relate from
operations of Kuhlman Electric that pre-date the Company’s
acquisition of Kuhlman Corporation. During 2000, Kuhlman
Electric notified the Company that it discovered potential
environmental contamination at its Crystal Springs, Mississippi
plant while undertaking an expansion of the plant.

The Company has been working with the Mississippi
Department of Environmental Quality, the EPA and Kuhlman
Electric to investigate the extent of and remediate the
contamination. The investigation revealed the presence of
Polychlorinated Biphenyls (“PCBs”) in portions of the
soil at the plant and neighboring areas. Cleanup began in 2000
and is continuing. Kuhlman Electric and others, including the
Company, have been sued in numerous related lawsuits, in which
multiple claimants allege personal injury and property damage.
The first trial in these lawsuits is currently scheduled to
begin in March 2005.

The Company believes that the accrual for
environmental liabilities and any insurance recoveries are
adequate to cover any potential liability associated with
environmental matters. However, due to the nature of
environmental remediation and litigation, there can be no
assurance that the actual amount of environmental liabilities
will not exceed the accrual amount.

Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company’s management, including the
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by
this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring
that all material information required to be filed in reports
that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules
and forms. There have been no changes in internal controls over
financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by
this report that have materially affected, or are likely to
materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting

The Company’s management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act
Rule 13a-15(e). Management conducted an assessment of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
on the framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal
Control — Integrated Framework. Based on the
assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31,
2004, the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting is effective. Management’s assessment of the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, has been
audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report
below.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
BorgWarner Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment,
included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that BorgWarner Inc.
and Consolidated Subsidiaries (the “Company”)
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of,
the company’s principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal
control over financial reporting, including the possibility of
collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation
of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial
reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that
the Company maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the criteria
established in

Internal Control — Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company
as of December 31, 2004, and the related consolidated
statement of operations, cash flows and stockholders’



equity and comprehensive income for the year
ended December 31, 2004 and our report dated March 7,
2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial
statements.
