PART I

Item 1.

Business

BorgWarner Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) is a Delaware corporation that was
    incorporated in 1987. We are a leading, global supplier of
    highly engineered automotive systems and components, primarily
    for powertrain applications. Our products help improve vehicle
    performance, fuel efficiency, stability and air quality. These
    products are manufactured and sold worldwide, primarily to
    original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) of
    light-vehicles (passenger cars, sport-utility vehicles, vans and
    light-trucks). The Company’s products are also sold to
    other OEMs of commercial trucks, buses and agricultural and
    off-highway vehicles. We also manufacture and sell our products
    to certain Tier One vehicle systems suppliers and into the
    aftermarket for light and commercial vehicles. The Company
    operates manufacturing facilities serving customers in the
    Americas, Europe and Asia, and is an original equipment supplier
    to every major automotive OEM in the world.

Engine

The Engine Group develops and manufactures products to manage
    engines for fuel efficiency, reduced emissions, and enhanced
    performance. Concern about fuel prices and availability, and the
    need to lower
    CO


emissions are driving demand for the Company’s products in
    smaller, more efficient gasoline and diesel engines and
    alternative powertrains. Engine Group products currently fall
    into the following major categories: turbochargers, timing
    devices and chain products, emissions systems, thermal systems,
    diesel cold start and gasoline ignition technology and cabin
    heaters.

The Engine Group provides turbochargers for light-vehicle,
    commercial-vehicle and off-road applications for diesel and
    gasoline engine manufacturers in Europe, North America, South
    America and Asia. The Engine Group has greatly benefited from
    the growth in turbocharger demand in Europe. This growth is
    linked to increasing demand for diesel engines in light
    vehicles, which typically use turbochargers, and for
    turbocharged gasoline engines. Benefits of turbochargers in both
    light-vehicle and commercial-vehicle applications include
    increased power for a given engine size, improved fuel economy
    and significantly reduced emissions.

Sales of turbochargers for light-vehicles represented
    approximately 26%, 27%, and 24% of the Company’s total
    revenues for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company
    currently supplies light-



vehicle turbochargers to many OEMs including Volkswagen,
    Renault, PSA, Daimler, Hyundai, Fiat, BMW, Ford and General
    Motors. The Company also supplies commercial-vehicle
    turbochargers to Caterpillar, John Deere, Daimler,
    Navistar, Deutz and MAN.

The Company’s newest technologies are its regulated
    two-stage turbocharging system known as
    R2S

®

,

    variable turbine geometry (“VTG”) turbochargers and
    turbochargers for gasoline direct injected engines. In 2008, the
    Company announced the start of production of its award winning
    R2S technology for Daimler’s four-cylinder diesel engine
    range. The Company also began shipping VTG turbochargers for
    VW’s common-rail engine range and announced the launch of a
    VTG turbocharger for use with low-pressure exhaust gas
    recirculation to reduce emissions on VW’s Jetta Clean
    Diesel TDI. In 2010, the Company began shipping turbochargers
    for Ford’s 3.5 liter V6 direct-injected gasoline EcoBoost
    engine for rear-wheel drive cars and trucks. Ford selected
    BorgWarner’s leading gasoline turbocharger technology for
    their new four-cylinder EcoBoost engine, which made its global
    debut in 2010.

The Engine Group also designs and manufactures products to
    control emissions and improve fuel economy. These products
    include electric air pumps, turbo actuators that use integrated
    electronics to precisely control turbocharger speed and pressure
    ratio, and exhaust gas recirculation coolers, tubes and valves
    for gasoline and diesel applications.

The Engine Group’s chain and chain systems products include
    timing chain and timing drive systems, variable cam timing
    (“VCT”) systems, crankshaft and camshaft sprockets,
    tensioners, guides and snubbers, HY-VO

®

front-wheel drive (“FWD”) transmission chain and
    four-wheel drive (“4WD”) chain, and MORSE GEMINI

®

chain systems for light-vehicle and commercial-vehicle
    applications.

The Company’s timing chain systems are used on Ford’s
    family of engines, including the Duratec, Modular and in-line
    four-cylinder engines, as well as on a number of Chrysler’s
    engines, including its 3.7 liter and 4.7 liter engines, the
    four-cylinder World Engine and the new 3.6 liter Pentastar
    engine. In addition, the Company provides timing systems to a
    number of Asian OEMs, including Honda, Nissan, and Hyundai, and
    to several European OEMs. The Company believes that it is the
    world’s leading manufacturer of timing chain systems.

The Engine Group’s newest technology is its VCT with mid
    position lock, which allows a greater range of camshaft
    positioning thereby enabling greater control over airflow and
    the opportunity to improve fuel economy, function and efficiency
    compared with conventional VCT systems. BorgWarner is currently
    working with five OEMs to implement the technology.

The Company believes it is the world’s leading manufacturer
    of chain for FWD transmissions and 4WD transfer cases. HY-VO
    chain is used to transfer power from the engine to the
    drivetrain. The chain in a transfer case distributes power
    between a vehicle’s front and rear output shafts which, in
    turn, provide torque to the front and rear wheels. The
    Company’s MORSE GEMINI transmission chain system emits
    significantly less chain pitch frequency noise than conventional
    transmission chain systems.

The Company also believes it is a leading global provider of
    engine thermal solutions for truck, agricultural and off-highway
    applications. The group designs, manufactures and markets
    viscous fan drives that control fans to sense and respond to
    multiple cooling requirements. The Engine Group also
    manufactures and markets polymer fans for engine cooling
    systems. The Company’s thermal products provide improved
    vehicle fuel economy and reduced engine emissions while
    minimizing parasitic horsepower loss. The Company has been
    awarded the “standard position” (the OEM-designated
    preferred supplier of component systems available to the
    end-customer) at the major global heavy truck producers.

In 2005, the Company acquired approximately 69.4% of the
    outstanding shares of BERU Aktiengesellschaft
    (“BERU”), headquartered in Ludwigsburg, Germany.
    Through a series of transactions and legal actions, the Company
    became the only shareholder of BERU effective September 30,
    2009. That company’s corporate form and name was changed to
    BorgWarner BERU Systems GmbH (“BERU Systems”) in late
    2009.



BERU System’s operating results are included within the
    Company’s Engine Group segment. BERU Systems is a leading
    global automotive supplier of diesel cold start technology (glow
    plugs and instant starting systems). In 2008, BERU launched its
    new Pressure Sensor Glow Plug with which the combustion process
    of a diesel engine is monitored and enhanced, allowing the
    lowest
    CO


and
    NO

x

emissions possible. It also designs and manufactures gasoline
    ignition technology (spark plugs and ignition coils); and
    electronic control units and sensor technology (tire pressure
    sensors, diesel cabin heaters and selected sensors).

On June 2, 2009, the Company announced the purchase of
    advanced gasoline ignition technology and related intellectual
    property from Florida-based Etatech, Inc. The high-frequency
    ignition technology enables high-performing, lean burning
    engines to significantly improve fuel economy and reduce
    emissions compared with conventional combustion technologies.

On April 10, 2010, the Company acquired 100% of Dytech ENSA
    S.L. (“Dytech”), headquartered in Vigo, Spain. Dytech
    is a leading producer of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR)
    coolers, EGR tubes, and integrated EGR modules including valves
    for automotive and commercial vehicle applications, both on- and
    off-road.

In anticipation of market growth expected for its electric cabin
    heaters, the Company completed the acquisition of
    BERU-Eichenauer GmbH by acquiring the shares of its former joint
    venture partner, Eichenauer Heizelemente GmbH & Co.
    KG. The former 50/50 joint venture was formed in 2000 to develop
    and manufacture electric cabin heaters. The acquisition formally
    took effect on May 1, 2010.

Drivetrain

The Drivetrain Group leverages the Company’s expertise in
    clutching and control systems to enable efficient transmission
    of engine torque through the vehicle drivetrain and management
    of torque distribution to the driven wheels. The Company’s
    technology can improve fuel efficiency and help reduce emissions
    in all types of powertrains. The Drivetrain Group’s major
    products are transmission components and systems, and all-wheel
    drive (“AWD”) torque management systems.

The Drivetrain Group designs and manufactures automatic
    transmission components and modules and is a supplier to
    virtually every major automatic transmission manufacturer in the
    world for both conventional automatic, new dual-clutch
    transmissions (“DCT”) and automated manual
    transmissions.

Friction and mechanical products include dual clutch modules,
    friction clutch modules, friction plates, transmission bands,
    torque converter clutches, one-way clutches and torsional
    vibration dampers. Controls products feature electro-hydraulic
    solenoids for standard and high pressure hydraulic systems,
    transmission solenoid modules and dual clutch control modules.

The Company’s 50%-owned joint venture in Japan, NSK-Warner
    Kabushiki Kaisha (“NSK-Warner”), is a leading producer
    of friction plates and one-way clutches in Japan. NSK-Warner is
    also the joint venture partner with a 40% interest in the
    Drivetrain Group’s Korean subsidiary, BorgWarner
    Transmission Systems Korea, Inc.

The Company has led the globalization of today’s DCT
    technology for over ten years. Following the development of its
    DCT technology in the 1990s, the Company established its
    industry-leading position in Europe in 2003 with the production
    launch of its award-winning
    DualTronic

®

innovations with VW/Audi. In 2007, the Company launched its
    first dual-clutch technology application in a Japanese
    transmission with Nissan.

The Company has announced DCT programs with customers that
    include VW, Audi, SAIC and Nissan, in addition to Getrag DCT
    programs with BMW, Ford and other global automakers. Also, the
    Company is working on several other DCT programs with OEMs
    around the world. BorgWarner DualTronic technology enables a
    conventional, manual gearbox to function as a fully automatic
    transmission by eliminating the interruption in power flow that
    occurs when a single clutch manual transmission shifts gears.
    The result is a smooth shifting automatic transmission with the
    fuel efficiency and great driving experience of a manual gearbox.



On November 18, 2008, we entered into a joint venture
    agreement with China Automobile Development United Investment
    Company, a company owned by leading Chinese automakers, to
    produce various dual clutch transmission modules. The joint
    venture’s operations will be located in Dalian, China and
    production is scheduled to begin in 2011. The Company owns 66%
    of the joint venture.

In conventional automatic transmissions, there has been a global
    market trend from four and five speeds to six, seven, and even
    eight speed transmissions. Transmissions with more speeds
    improve fuel economy and vehicle performance and offer growth
    opportunities.

The Drivetrain Group’s torque management products include
    rear-wheel drive (“RWD”)/AWD transfer case systems,
    FWD/AWD electromagnetic coupling systems and advanced products.
    The Company’s focus is on electronically controlled
    (active) torque management devices and systems for their vehicle
    dynamics, fuel economy and stability benefits.

Transfer cases are installed primarily on light-trucks,
    sport-utility vehicles (“SUV“s), rear-wheel drive
    based cross-over utility vehicles (“CUV“s) and
    passenger cars. A transfer case attaches to the transmission and
    distributes torque to the front and rear axles improving vehicle
    traction and stability in dynamic driving conditions.

The Company is involved in the FWD/AWD market with
    electromagnetic couplings that use electronically controlled
    clutches to distribute power to the rear wheels instantly as
    traction is required. The
    NexTrac

®

AWD device is our latest product innovation that produces
    outstanding stability and traction while promoting better fuel
    economy. The NexTrac AWD device launched in 2008 on the Hyundai
    Santa Fe, Tucson and KIA Sportage.

With the trend toward vehicle electrification gaining momentum,
    the Company is also applying its years of expertise to deliver
    robust and highly efficient single and multiple speed electric
    gear reduction solutions for hybrids and electric vehicles.
    Currently, we supply our
    eGearDrive

(tm)

single-speed gearbox to the Ford Transit Connect Electric. We
    are actively engaged with traditional and non-traditional OEMs
    on a number of other transmission programs for plug-in hybrid
    and electric vehicles.

On January 31, 2011, the Company acquired the Traction
    Systems division of Haldex Group, a leading provider of
    innovative all-wheel drive (AWD) products for the global vehicle
    industry headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden. The purchase price
    was approximately $205 million (1.425 billion Swedish
    Krona). The operating results will be reported within the
    Company’s Drivetrain reporting segment from the date of
    acquisition.

This acquisition is expected to accelerate BorgWarner’s
    growth in the global AWD market as it continues to shift toward
    front-wheel drive (FWD) based vehicles. The acquisition will add
    industry leading FWD/AWD technologies, with a strong European
    customer base, to BorgWarner’s existing portfolio of front
    and rear-wheel drive based products. This enables BorgWarner to
    provide global customers a broader range of all-wheel drive
    solutions to meet their vehicle needs.

Joint
    Ventures

As of December 31, 2010, the Company had 11 joint ventures
    in which it had a less-than-100% ownership interest. Results
    from the eight ventures in which the Company is the majority
    owner are consolidated as part of the Company’s results.
    Results from the three ventures in which the Company’s
    effective ownership interest is 50% or less, were reported by
    the Company using the equity method of accounting.

The Company’s automotive products are generally sold
    directly to OEMs substantially pursuant to negotiated annual
    contracts, long-term supply agreements or terms and conditions
    as may be modified by the parties. Deliveries are subject to
    periodic authorizations based upon the production schedules of
    the OEMs. The Company typically ships its products directly from
    its plants to the OEMs.

Sales and
    Marketing

Each of the Company’s business units within its two
    reporting segments has its own sales function. Account
    executives for each of our business units are assigned to serve
    specific OEM customers for one or more of a business unit’s
    products. Our account executives spend the majority of their
    time in direct contact with OEM purchasing and engineering
    employees and are responsible for servicing existing business
    and for identifying and obtaining new business. Because of their
    close relationship with OEMs, account executives are able to
    identify and meet customers’ needs based upon their
    knowledge of our products design and manufacturing capabilities.
    Upon securing a new order, account executives participate in
    product launch team activities and serve as a key interface with
    the customers.

In addition, the sales and marketing employees of our Engine
    segment and Drivetrain segment often work together to explore
    cross-development opportunities for the business units. The
    development of
    DualTronic

®

,

    the Company’s wet-clutch and control-system technology for
    a new-concept automated transmission, is an example of a
    successful collaboration.

Seasonality

The Company’s business is moderately seasonal because the
    Company’s largest North American customers typically halt
    vehicle production for approximately two weeks in July and one
    week in December. Customers in Europe and Asia typically shut
    down vehicle production during portions of July or August and
    one week in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, the Company’s
    third and fourth quarters may reflect those practices.

Research and
    Development

The Company conducts advanced engine and drivetrain research at
    the reporting segment level. This advanced engineering function
    looks to leverage know-how and expertise across product lines to
    create new engine and drivetrain systems and modules that can be
    commercialized. A venture capital fund that was created by the
    Company as seed money for new innovation and collaboration
    across businesses is managed by this function.

In addition, each of the Company’s business units within
    its two reporting segments has its own research and development
    (“R&D”) organization. The Company has
    approximately 700 employees, including engineers, mechanics
    and technicians, engaged in R&D activities at facilities
    worldwide. The Company also operates testing facilities such as
    prototype, measurement and calibration, life cycle testing and
    dynamometer laboratories.

By working closely with the OEMs and anticipating their future
    product needs, the Company’s R&D personnel conceive,
    design, develop and manufacture new proprietary automotive
    components and systems. R&D personnel also work to improve
    current products and production processes. The Company believes
    its commitment to R&D will allow it to obtain new orders
    from its OEM customers.



The following table presents the Company’s gross and net
    expenditures on R&D activities:

    Consolidated Statements of Operations. Net R&D expenditures
    as a percentage of net sales were 3.3% in 2010 and 3.9% in both
    2009 and 2008. Customer reimbursements are netted against gross
    R&D expenditures upon billing of services performed. The
    Company has contracts with several customers at the
    Company’s various R&D locations. No such contract
    exceeded $6.0 million in any of the years presented.

Patents and
    Licenses

The Company has approximately 4,000 active domestic and foreign
    patents and patent applications pending or under preparation,
    and receives royalties from licensing patent rights to others.
    While it considers its patents on the whole to be important, the
    Company does not consider any single patent, any group of
    related patents or any single license essential to its
    operations in the aggregate or to the operations of any of the
    Company’s business groups individually. The expiration of
    the patents individually and in the aggregate is not expected to
    have a material effect on the Company’s financial position
    or future operating results. The Company owns numerous
    trademarks, some of which are valuable, but none of which are
    essential to its business in the aggregate.

The Company owns the “BorgWarner” and
    “Borg-Warner Automotive” trade names and housemarks,
    and variations thereof, which are material to the Company’s
    business.

Competition

The Company’s operating segments compete worldwide with a
    number of other manufacturers and distributors which produce and
    sell similar products. Many of these competitors are larger and
    have greater resources than the Company. Technological
    innovation, application engineering development, quality, price,
    delivery and program launch support are the primary elements of
    competition.

The Company’s major competitors by product type follow:

Product Type: Engine

Name of Competitor

Turbochargers:

Holset (Cummins Inc.)

Schaeffler Group

In addition, a number of the Company’s major OEM customers
    manufacture, for their own use and for others, products which
    compete with the Company’s products. Other current OEM
    customers could elect to manufacture products to meet their own
    requirements or to compete with the Company. There can be no
    assurance that the Company’s business will not be adversely
    affected by increased competition in the markets in which it
    operates.

For many of its products, the Company’s competitors include
    suppliers in parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages
    such as lower labor costs, lower health care costs and, in some
    cases, export subsidies

and/or

raw
    materials subsidies. Also, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Workforce

As of December 31, 2010, the Company and its consolidated
    subsidiaries had a salaried and hourly workforce of
    approximately 17,500 (as compared with approximately 12,500 at
    December 31, 2009), of which approximately 5,000 were in
    the U.S. Approximately 23% of the Company’s
    U.S. workforce is unionized. The hourly workforces at
    certain of our international facilities are also unionized. The
    Company believes its present relations with our workforce to be
    satisfactory.

Our only domestic collective bargaining agreement is for our
    Ithaca and Cortland, New York facilities. This agreement expires
    in September 2012.

Raw
    Materials

The Company uses a variety of raw materials in the production of
    its automotive products including steel, aluminum, copper,
    plastic resins, and certain alloy elements. Manufacturing
    operations for each of the Company’s operating segments are
    dependent upon natural gas, fuel oil, and electricity.

Due to a global economic recovery in 2010, commodity prices
    increased after dropping sharply in 2009. The 2009 decline in
    commodity prices was due to falling global demand and oversupply.

As developed economies continue to recover and auto production
    accelerates, certain commodities may experience temporary
    shortages and inflated prices until production volumes again
    reach equilibrium with market demands. The Company uses a
    variety of tactics in order to limit the impact of supply
    shortages and inflationary pressures.

The Company’s global procurement organization works to
    accelerate cost reductions, purchases from lower cost regions,
    supplier rationalization, risk mitigation efforts, and
    collaborative buying activities. In addition, the Company uses
    long-term contracts, cost sharing arrangements, design changes,
    customer buy programs, and limited financial instruments to help
    control costs. The Company intends to use similar measures in
    2011 and beyond. Refer to Note 10, “Financial
    Instruments” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this report for information related
    to the Company’s hedging activities.

For  2011, the Company believes that its supplies of raw
    materials and energy are adequate and available from multiple
    sources to support its manufacturing requirements.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

The following risk factors and other information included in
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

should be considered. The risks and uncertainties described
    below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and
    uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently
    deem immaterial also may impact our business operations. If any
    of the following risks occur, our business including its
    financial performance, financial condition, operating results
    and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

Our industry
    is cyclical and our results of operations will be adversely
    affected by industry downturns.

Automotive and truck production and sales are cyclical and
    sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors
    including interest rates, consumer credit, and consumer spending
    and preferences. Economic declines that result in significant
    reduction in automotive or truck production would have a
    material adverse effect on our sales to original equipment
    manufacturers.

We continue to take steps to realign and resize our production
    capacity and cost structure to meet current and projected
    operational and market requirements. Significant declines in the
    automotive industry and financial declines and restructurings by
    our significant customers may make it necessary to take
    restructuring actions and charges.

We are
    dependent on market segments that use our key products.
    Decreased demand in those segments could adversely affect our
    business.

Some of our products, in particular turbochargers, are currently
    used primarily in diesel passenger cars and commercial vehicles.
    Any significant reduction in production in these market segments
    or loss of business in these market segments could have a
    material adverse effect on our sales to original equipment
    manufacturers.

We face strong
    competition.

We compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and
    distributors that produce and sell products similar to ours.
    Price, quality, delivery, technological innovation, application
    engineering development and program launch support are the
    primary elements of competition. Our competitors include
    vertically



integrated units of our major original equipment manufacturer
    customers, as well as a large number of independent domestic and
    international suppliers. We are not as large as a number of
    these companies and do not have as many financial or other
    resources. The competitive environment has changed dramatically
    over the past few years as our traditional U.S. original
    equipment manufacturer customers, faced with intense
    international competition, have expanded their worldwide
    sourcing of components. As a result, we have experienced
    competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that
    enjoy economic advantages, such as lower labor costs, lower
    health care costs and, in some cases, export or raw materials
    subsidies. Increased competition could adversely affect our
    businesses.

We are under
    substantial pressure from original equipment manufacturers to
    reduce the prices of our products.

There is substantial and continuing pressure on original
    equipment manufacturers to reduce costs, including costs of
    products we supply. Although original equipment manufacturers
    have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside
    suppliers, a number of our major original equipment manufacturer
    customers manufacture products for their own uses that directly
    compete with our products. These original equipment
    manufacturers could elect to manufacture such products for their
    own uses in place of the products we currently supply. We
    believe that our ability to develop proprietary new products and
    to control our costs will allow us to remain competitive.
    However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to improve or
    maintain our gross margins on product sales to original
    equipment manufacturers or that the trend by original equipment
    manufacturers towards outsourcing will continue.

Annual price reductions to original equipment manufacturer
    customers appear to have become a permanent feature of our
    business environment. To maintain our profit margins, we seek
    price reductions from our suppliers, improve production
    processes to increase manufacturing efficiency, update product
    designs to reduce costs and develop new products, the benefits
    of which support stable or increased prices. Our ability to pass
    through increased raw material costs to our original equipment
    manufacturer customers is limited, with cost recovery often less
    than 100% and often on a delayed basis. We cannot assure you
    that we will be able to reduce costs in an amount equal to
    annual price reductions, increases in raw material costs, and
    increases in employee wages and benefits.

We are
    sensitive to the effects of our major customers’ labor
    relations.

All three of our primary North American customers, Ford,
    Chrysler and General Motors, have major union contracts with the
    United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers
    of America. Because of domestic original equipment
    manufacturers’ dependence on a single union, we are
    affected by labor difficulties and work stoppages at original
    equipment manufacturers’ facilities. Similarly, a majority
    of our global customers’ operations outside of North
    America are also represented by various unions. Any extended
    work stoppage could have an adverse effect on our business.

Part of our
    labor force is unionized which could subject us to work
    stoppages.

As of December 31, 2010, approximately 23% of our
    U.S. workforce was unionized. Our only domestic collective
    bargaining agreement is for our Ithaca and Cortland, New York
    facilities. This agreement expires in September 2012. The hourly
    employees at certain of our international facilities are also
    unionized. While we believe that our relations with our
    employees are satisfactory, a prolonged dispute with our
    employees could have an adverse effect on our business.

We are subject
    to extensive environmental regulations.

Our operations are subject to laws governing, among other
    things, emissions to air, discharges to waters and the
    generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and
    disposal of waste and other materials. We believe that our
    business, operations and activities have been and are being
    operated in compliance in all material respects with applicable
    environmental, health and safety laws. However, the operation of
    automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in these
    areas, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur



material costs or liabilities as a result. Furthermore, through
    various acquisitions over the years, we have acquired a number
    of manufacturing facilities, and we cannot assure you that we
    will not incur material costs and liabilities relating to
    activities that predate our ownership. In addition, potentially
    significant expenditures could be required in order to comply
    with evolving environmental, health and safety laws that may be
    adopted in the future.

We have
    contingent liabilities related to environmental, product
    warranties, regulatory matters, litigation and other
    claims.

We and certain of our current and former direct and indirect
    corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have been
    identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency
    and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as
    potentially responsible parties at various hazardous waste
    disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
    Compensation and Liability Act and equivalent state laws. As a
    result, as of December 31, 2010, we may be liable for the
    cost of

clean-up

and
    other remedial activities at 38 of these sites.

We work with outside experts to determine a range of potential
    liability for environmental sites. The ranges for each
    individual site are then aggregated into a loss range for the
    total accrued liability. Management’s estimate of the loss
    range for environmental liability, including conditional asset
    retirement obligations, for 2010 is between approximately
    $27 million and $42 million. We record an accrual at
    the most probable amount within the range unless one cannot be
    determined; in which case we record the accrual at the low end
    of the range. Based on information available to us, we have
    established an accrual in our financial statements for indicated
    environmental liabilities of $29.2 million, which includes
    our conditional asset retirement obligation under ASC Topic 410
    of $1.2 million at December 31, 2010. We currently
    expect the substantial portion of this amount to be expended
    over the next three to five years.

We provide warranties to our customers for some of our products.
    Under these warranties, we may be required to bear costs and
    expenses for the repair or replacement of these products. We
    cannot assure you that costs and expenses associated with these
    product warranties will not be material, or that those costs
    will not exceed any amounts accrued for such warranties in our
    financial statement. Based upon information available to us, we
    have established an accrual in our financial statements for
    product warranties of $66.8 million at December 31,
    2010.

We are also party to, or have an obligation to defend a party
    to, various legal proceedings, including those described in
    Note 14 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in the Company’s Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

We are currently, and may in the future become, subject to legal
    proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes. These claims
    typically arise in the normal course of business and may
    include, but not be limited to, commercial or contractual
    disputes with our suppliers, intellectual property matters and
    employment claims. There is a possibility that such claims may
    have an adverse impact on our business that is greater than we
    anticipate.

Our growth
    strategy may prove unsuccessful.

We have a stated goal of increasing revenues and operating
    income at a rate greater than global vehicle production by
    increasing content per vehicle with innovative new components
    and through select acquisitions. We may not meet our goal
    because of any of the following: (a) the failure to develop
    new products which will be purchased by our customers;
    (b) technology changes rendering our products obsolete;
    (c) a reversal of the trend of supplying systems (which
    allows us to increase content per vehicle)
    instead of components; and (d) the failure to
    find suitable acquisition targets or the failure to integrate
    operations of acquired businesses quickly and cost effectively.

We are subject
    to risks related to our international operations.

We have manufacturing and technical facilities in many regions
    and countries, including North America, Europe, China, India,
    South Korea, Japan, and Brazil and sell our products worldwide.
    For 2010,



approximately 74% of our sales were outside North America.
    Consequently, our results could be affected by changes in trade,
    monetary and fiscal policies, trade restrictions or
    prohibitions, import or other charges or taxes, and fluctuations
    in foreign currency exchange rates, limitations on the
    repatriation of funds, changing economic conditions, social
    unrest, political instability and disputes, and international
    terrorism. Compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting
    laws and regulations of various countries is burdensome and
    expensive. See Note 19, “Reporting Segments and
    Related Information” to Consolidated Financial Statements
    in the Company’s Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

regarding the size of our international operations.

We may not
    realize sales represented by awarded business.

We base our growth projections, in part, on commitments made by
    our customers. These commitments generally renew yearly during a
    program life cycle. If actual production orders from our
    customers do not approximate such commitments, it could
    adversely affect our business.

We are
    impacted by the rising cost of providing pension and other post
    employment benefits.

The automotive industry, like other industries, continues to be
    impacted by the rising cost of providing pension and other post
    employment benefits. To partially address this impact, we
    continue to make adjustments to certain retiree medical and
    pension plans. See Note 11, “Retirement Benefit
    Plans” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the
    Company’s Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Certain
    defined benefit pension plans we sponsor are currently
    underfunded.

We sponsor certain defined benefit pension plans worldwide that
    are underfunded and will require cash payments. Additionally, if
    the performance of the assets in our pension plans does not meet
    our expectations, or if other actuarial assumptions are
    modified, our required contributions may be higher than we
    expect. See Note 11, “Retirement Benefit Plans”
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company’s
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Negative or
    unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our
    business.

Adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial
    outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to
    changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets
    and other tax accruals that could adversely affect our financial
    performance.

Additionally, we are subject to tax audits by governmental
    authorities in the U.S. and numerous

non-U.S. jurisdictions.

Because the results of tax audits are inherently uncertain,
    negative or unexpected results from one or more such tax audits
    could adversely affect our business.

We rely on
    sales to major customers.

We rely on sales to original equipment manufacturers around the
    world. Supply to several of these customers requires significant
    investment by the Company in working capital, plant and
    equipment. Some of our customers are rated by the credit rating
    agencies as below investment grade. The loss of sales to a major
    customer, due to any of a variety of factors including
    non-renewal of purchase orders, the customer’s financial
    hardship or other unforeseen reasons, could adversely affect our
    business.

Furthermore, some of our sales are concentrated. Our worldwide
    sales in 2010 to Volkswagen and Ford constituted approximately
    19% and 11%, respectively, of our 2010 consolidated sales.

Suppliers’
    economic distress could result in the disruption of our
    operations and could adversely affect our
    business.

Rapidly changing industry conditions such as volatile production
    volumes; credit tightness; changes in foreign currencies; raw
    material, commodity, transportation, and energy price
    escalation; drastic changes in consumer preferences; and others
    could adversely affect our supply chain, and sometimes with
    little advanced notice. These conditions could also result in
    increased commercial disputes and supply



interruption risks. In certain instances, it would be difficult
    and expensive for us to change suppliers that are critical to
    our business. On occasion, we must provide financial support to
    distressed suppliers or take other measures to protect our
    supply lines. While we have taken definite actions to mitigate
    these factors, we cannot predict with certainty the potential
    adverse effects these costs might have on our business.

We continue to
    face highly volatile commodity costs used in the production of
    our products.

The Company uses a variety of commodities (including steel,
    nickel, copper, aluminum, plastic resins, other raw materials
    and energy) and materials purchased in various forms such as
    castings, powder metal, forgings, stampings, and bar stock.
    Increasing commodity costs will have an impact on our results.
    We have sought to alleviate the impact of increasing costs by
    including a material pass-through provision in our customer
    contracts wherever possible or by selectively hedging certain
    commodity exposures. Customers frequently challenge these
    contractual provisions and rarely pay the full cost of any
    materials increases. The discontinuation of ability to
    pass-through or hedge increasing commodity costs would adversely
    affect our business.

From time to time, commodity prices may also fall rapidly. When
    this happens, suppliers may withdraw capacity from the market
    until prices improve which may cause periodic supply
    interruptions. The same may be true of our transportation
    carriers and energy providers.

We could be
    adversely affected by supply shortages of components from our
    suppliers.

In an effort to manage and reduce the cost of purchased goods
    and services, we have been rationalizing our supply base. As a
    result, we are dependent on fewer sources of supply for certain
    components used in the manufacture of our products. The Company
    selects suppliers based on total value (including total landed
    price, quality, delivery, and technology), taking into
    consideration their production capacities and financial
    condition. We expect that they will deliver to our stated
    written expectations.

However, there can be no assurance that capacity limitations,
    labor unrest, weather emergencies, commercial disputes,
    government actions, riots, wars, sabotage, non-conforming parts,
    acts of terrorism, “Acts of God”, or other problems
    experienced by our suppliers will not result in occasional
    shortages or delays in their supply of components to us. If we
    were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of
    critical components from any of our suppliers and could not
    procure the components from other sources, we would be unable to
    meet the production schedules for some of our key products and
    could miss customer delivery expectations. This would adversely
    affect our customer relations and business.

A downgrade in
    the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the
    debt capital markets.

Changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt
    may ultimately impact our access to the debt capital markets and
    the costs we incur to borrow funds. If ratings for our debt fall
    below investment grade, our access to the debt capital markets
    could become restricted.

Additionally, our revolving credit agreement includes an
    increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are
    downgraded. The interest costs on our revolving credit agreement
    are based on a rating grid agreed to in our credit agreement.
    Further, an increase in the level of our indebtedness and
    related interest costs may increase our vulnerability to adverse
    general economic and industry conditions and may affect our
    ability to obtain additional financing.

Conditions in
    the automotive industry may adversely affect our
    business.

Our financial performance depends on conditions in the global
    automotive industry. Original equipment manufacturers have
    experienced difficulties from a weakened economy and tightened
    credit markets. If our customers reduce their orders to us, it
    would adversely affect our results of operations. A prolonged
    downturn in the automotive industry or a significant product mix
    shift due to consumer demand could require us to shut down
    plants or incur impairment charges. Continued uncertainty
    relating to the financial condition of automakers may adversely
    affect our business.



We are subject
    to possible insolvency of financial
    counterparties.

The Company engages in numerous financial transactions and
    contracts including insurance policies, letters of credit,
    credit line agreements, financial derivatives, and investment
    management agreements involving various counterparties. The
    Company is subject to the risk that one or more of these
    counterparties may become insolvent and therefore be unable to
    discharge its obligations under such contracts.

We are subject
    to possible insolvency of outsourced service
    providers.

The Company relies on third party service providers for
    administration of workers’ compensation claims, health care
    benefits, pension benefits, stockholder and bondholder
    registration and similar services. These service providers
    contribute to the efficient conduct of the Company’s
    business. Insolvency of one or more of these service providers
    could adversely affect our business.

Our business
    success depends on attracting and retaining qualified
    personnel.

Our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to
    hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management
    team and workforce worldwide. Any unplanned turnover or
    inability to attract and retain key employees in numbers
    sufficient for our needs could adversely affect our business.

We are subject
    to business continuity risks associated with increasing
    centralization of our information technology
    systems.

To improve efficiency and reduce costs, we have regionally
    centralized the information systems that support our business
    processes such as invoicing, payroll and general management
    operations. If the centralized systems are disrupted or
    disabled, key business processes could be interrupted, which
    could adversely affect our business.

A variety of
    other factors could adversely affect our business.

Any of the following could materially and adversely affect our
    business: the loss of or changes in supply contracts or sourcing
    strategies of our major customers or suppliers;
    start — up expenses associated with new vehicle
    programs or delays or cancellation of such programs,
    underutilization of our manufacturing facilities, which can be
    dependent on a single product line or customer; inability to
    recover engineering and tooling costs; market and financial
    consequences of recalls that may be required on products we
    supplied; delays or difficulties in new product development; the
    possible introduction of similar or superior technologies by
    others; and global excess capacity and vehicle platform
    proliferation.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

The Company is subject to a number of claims and judicial and
    administrative proceedings (some of which involve substantial
    amounts) arising out of the Company’s business or relating
    to matters for which the Company may have a contractual
    indemnity obligation. Refer to Note 14,
    “Contingencies” of the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for a
    discussion of environmental, asbestos and other litigation.

In January 2006, BorgWarner Diversified Transmission Products
    Inc (“DTP”), a subsidiary of the Company, filed a
    declaratory judgment action in United States District Court,
    Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis Division) against the
    United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implements
    Workers of America (“UAW”) Local No. 287 and
    Gerald Poor, individually and as the representative of a
    defendant class. DTP sought the Court’s affirmation that
    DTP did not violate the Labor-Management Relations Act or the
    Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) by unilaterally
    amending certain medical plans effective April 1, 2006 and
    October 1, 2006, prior to the expiration of the
    then-current collective bargaining agreements. On
    September 10, 2008, the Court found that DTP’s
    reservation of the right to make such amendments reducing the
    level of benefits provided to retirees was limited by its
    collectively bargained health insurance agreement with the UAW,
    which did not expire until April 24, 2009. Thus, the
    amendments were considered untimely. In 2008 the Company
    recorded a charge of $4.0 million as a result of the
    Court’s decision.

DTP filed a declaratory judgment action in the United States
    District Court, Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis
    Division) against the UAW Local No. 287 and Jim Barrett and
    others, individually and as representatives of a defendant
    class, on February 26, 2009 again seeking the Court’s
    affirmation that DTP will not violate the Labor —
    Management Relations Act or ERISA by modifying the level of
    benefits provided retirees to make them comparable to other
    Company retiree benefit plans after April 24, 2009. Certain
    retirees, on behalf of themselves and others, filed a
    mirror-image action in the United States District Court, Eastern
    District of Michigan (Southern Division) on March 11, 2009,
    for which a class has been certified. During the last quarter of
    2009 the action pending in Indiana was dismissed, while the
    action in Michigan is continuing and in the discovery phase. The
    Company is vigorously defending against the suit. This
    contingency is subject to many uncertainties, therefore based on
    the information available to date, the Company cannot estimate
    the amount or the range of potential loss, if any.

    Operations

INTRODUCTION

BorgWarner Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) is a leading global supplier of highly
    engineered systems and components primarily for powertrain
    applications. Our products help improve vehicle performance,
    fuel efficiency, air quality and vehicle stability. They are
    manufactured and sold worldwide, primarily to original equipment
    manufacturers (“OEMs”) of light vehicles (i.e.
    passenger cars, sport-utility vehicles (“SUVs”),
    cross-over vehicles, vans and light trucks). Our products are
    also manufactured and sold to OEMs of commercial trucks, buses
    and agricultural and off-highway vehicles. We also manufacture
    for and sell our products to certain Tier One vehicle
    systems suppliers and into the aftermarket for light and
    commercial vehicles. We operate manufacturing facilities serving
    customers in the Americas, Europe and Asia, and are an original
    equipment supplier to every major automaker in the world.

The Company’s products fall into two reporting segments:
    Engine and Drivetrain. The Engine segment’s products
    include turbochargers, timing chain systems, air management,
    emissions systems, thermal systems, as well as diesel and gas
    ignition systems. The Drivetrain segment’s products include
    all-wheel drive transfer cases, torque management systems, and
    components and systems for automated transmissions.

A summary of major factors impacting the Company’s net
    earnings for the year ended December 31, 2010 in comparison
    to 2009 and 2008 is as follows:

•

Global financial market and economic recovery in 2010
    significantly impacted consumer demand for light vehicles and
    positively increased our sales and operating margins.

•

Global financial market and economic crisis in the second half
    of 2008 and full year of 2009 significantly impacted consumer
    demand for light vehicles and negatively impacted our sales.

Data provided by CSM Worldwide.

Our net sales increase in 2010 of 42.7% was better than the
    estimated worldwide market production increase of 23.5%. Our net
    sales decrease in 2009 of 24.7% was worse than the estimated
    worldwide market production decrease of 13.7%. The effect of
    changing currency rates had a negative impact on the
    Company’s net sales and net earnings in 2010 and in 2009.
    The effect of

non-U.S. currencies,

primarily the Euro, decreased net sales by approximately
    $90 million in 2010. Non-US currencies had a negligible
    impact on the Company’s net earnings in 2010. In 2009,

non-U.S. currencies,

primarily the Euro, decreased net sales by approximately
    $169 million and reduced the Company’s net earnings by
    approximately $4 million.



The year over year increase in net sales, excluding the
    unfavorable impact of currency, was 45% in 2010. The year over
    year decrease in net sales, excluding the unfavorable impact of
    currency, was 21.5% in 2009.

Consolidated net sales to a single customer (including their
    subsidiaries), which exceeded 10% of our total sales, were to
    Volkswagen of approximately 19%, 22%, and 19%; and to Ford of
    approximately 11%, 12%, and 9% for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Both of our
    reporting segments had significant sales to the customers listed
    above. Such sales consisted of a variety of products to a
    variety of customer locations and regions. No other single
    customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated sales in
    any year of the periods presented.

Outlook

Our overall outlook for 2011 is positive. The Company expects
    global production volumes to be higher in 2011 compared with
    2010. Furthermore, we expect that higher adoption rates of
    BorgWarner products around the world will result in sales growth
    for the Company above global production growth in 2011.

The Company maintains a positive long-term outlook for its
    global business and is committed to new product development and
    strategic capital investments to enhance its product leadership
    strategy. The trends that are driving our long-term growth are
    expected to continue, including the growth of direct injection
    diesel and gasoline engines worldwide, the increased adoption of
    automated transmissions in Europe and Asia-Pacific, and the move
    to variable cam and chain engine timing systems in both Europe
    and Asia-Pacific.

Results By
    Reporting Segment

The Company’s business is comprised of two reporting
    segments: Engine and Drivetrain. These segments are strategic
    business groups, which are managed separately as each represents
    a specific grouping of related automotive components and systems.

The Company allocates resources to each segment based upon the
    projected after-tax return on invested capital
    (“ROIC”) of its business initiatives. The ROIC is
    comprised of projected earnings before interest, income taxes
    and noncontrolling interest (“EBIT”) adjusted for
    restructuring, goodwill impairment charges, affiliates’
    earnings and other items not reflective of on-going operating
    profit or loss (“Adjusted EBIT”) compared to the
    projected average capital investment required.

Adjusted EBIT is the measure of segment profit or loss used by
    the Company. The Company believes Adjusted EBIT is most
    reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our
    reporting segments.

The

Engine

segment 2010 net sales increased
    $1,177.6 million, or 40.8%, and segment EBIT increased
    $318.1 million, or 144.7%, from the year ended
    December 31, 2009. Excluding the impact of weaker foreign
    currencies, primarily the Euro, sales increased approximately
    44%. The sales increase was primarily driven by strong global
    growth in all major product groups as well as the second quarter
    2010 acquisition of Dytech ENSA SL. The Segment EBIT margin was
    13.2% in 2010, up from 7.6% in 2009, due to a significant
    increase in customer production schedules in the U.S. and
    European market and continued cost management.

The Engine segment 2009 net sales were down 25.3% from
    2008, with a 44.3% decrease in Segment EBIT over the same
    period. The Engine segment decrease was primarily driven by
    reduced global vehicle production and depressed demand for
    engine products. The Segment EBIT margin was 7.6% in 2009, down
    from 10.2% in 2008, due to the significant reduction in customer
    production schedules in the U.S. and European markets.

The

Drivetrain

segment 2010 net sales increased
    $517.9 million, or 47.4%, and segment EBIT increased
    $150.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2009.
    Excluding the impact of weaker foreign currencies, primarily the
    Euro, sales increased approximately 49%. The sales increase was
    primarily driven by strong growth of transmission components and
    torque management devices in Europe, Asia and the
    U.S. Segment EBIT margin was 8.5% in 2010, up from (1.2)%
    in 2009, primarily due to higher global production of light
    trucks and sport-utility vehicles equipped with its torque
    transfer products and continued cost management.

The Drivetrain segment 2009 net sales decreased 23.3% from
    2008 with a 175.5% decrease in Segment EBIT over the same
    period. The group was negatively impacted by lower global
    production of light trucks and SUVs equipped with its torque
    transfer products and lower sales of its traditional
    transmission products. Segment EBIT margin was (1.2)% in 2009,
    down from (0.3)% in the prior year, primarily due to lower
    global production of light trucks and sport-utility vehicles
    equipped with its torque transfer products.



Corporate

represents corporate headquarters’
    expenses, expenses not directly attributable to the individual
    segments, expenses associated with divested operations and
    equity in affiliates’ earnings. This net expense was
    $111.0 million in 2010, $111.3 million in 2009 and
    $60.0 million in 2008. The increase in Corporate expenses
    in 2009 from 2008 is primarily related to a decline in affiliate
    earnings, an increase in pension and other postemployment
    expenses and an increase in performance related compensation.

Gross profit

as a percentage of net sales was 19.3%,
    14.2% and 15.9% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The gross
    margin percentage increase is primarily due to higher sales in
    2010 and successful cost reduction actions taken in 2009 and
    2008, offset by higher raw material costs. Cost reduction
    actions taken in 2009 and 2008 to reduce our cost structure
    included headcount reductions, global pay cuts, selected plant
    shutdowns and reduced work weeks outside of the U.S.

Selling, general and administrative

expenses
    (“SG&A”) as a percentage of net sales were 10.0%,
    11.6% and 10.3% in 2010, 2009 and 2008 respectively. 2010
    SG&A expenses increased $106.8 million or 23.2%
    compared to 2009. The 2010 decrease in SG&A as a percentage
    of net sales was primarily due to a significant year over year
    increase in sales, offset by an increase in performance related
    compensation.

Research and development (“R&D”) is a major
    component of our SG&A expenses. R&D spending, net of
    customer reimbursements, was $185.0 million or 3.3% of
    sales in 2010, compared to $155.2 million, or 3.9% of sales
    in 2009, and $205.7 million, or 3.9% of sales in 2008. We
    currently intend to continue to increase our spending in
    R&D, although the growth rate in the future may not
    necessarily match the rate of our sales growth. We also intend
    to continue to invest in a number of cross-business R&D
    programs, as well as a number of other key programs, all of
    which are necessary for short and long-term growth. Our current
    long-term expectation for R&D spending is approximately
    4.0% of sales. We intend to maintain our commitment to R&D
    spending while continuing to focus on controlling other
    SG&A costs.

Restructuring expense

of $50.3 million in 2009 and
    $127.5 million in 2008 was in response to declines in
    global customer production levels, customer restructurings and a
    subsequent evaluation of our headcount levels in North America,
    Europe and Asia and our long-term capacity needs.



On July 31, 2008, the Company announced a restructuring of
    its operations to align ongoing operations with a continuing,
    fundamental market shift in the auto industry. As a continuation
    of the Company’s third quarter restructuring, on
    December 11, 2008, the Company announced plans for
    additional restructuring actions. As a result of these third and
    fourth quarter 2008 restructuring actions, the Company had
    reduced its North American workforce by approximately
    2,400 people, or 33%; its European workforce by
    approximately 1,600 people, or 18%; and its Asian workforce
    by approximately 400 people, or 17%. The restructuring
    expense recognized for employee termination benefits was
    $54.6 million. In addition to employee termination costs,
    the Company recorded $72.9 million of asset impairment
    charges related to the North American and European
    restructuring. The combined 2008 restructuring expenses of
    $127.5 million are broken out by segment as follows: Engine
    $85.3 million, Drivetrain $40.9 million and Corporate
    $1.3 million.

In the second quarter of 2009, the Company took additional
    restructuring actions. The Company reduced its North American
    workforce by approximately 550 people, or 12%; its European
    workforce by approximately 150 people, or 2%; and its Asian
    workforce by approximately 60 people, or 3% in the second
    quarter. The net restructuring expense recognized in the second
    quarter was $9.0 million for employee termination benefits.
    In addition to employee termination costs, the Company recorded
    $36.3 million of asset impairment and $5.0 million of
    other charges in the second quarter of 2009 related to the North
    American and European restructuring. The combined 2009
    restructuring expenses of $50.3 million are broken out by
    segment as follows: Engine $27.2 million, Drivetrain
    $19.7 million and Corporate $3.4 million.

Included in the second quarter of 2009 asset impairment charge
    is $22.3 million related to one of the Company’s
    European locations. During the second quarter of 2009
    circumstances caused the Company to evaluate the long range
    outlook of the facility using an undiscounted and discounted
    cash flow model, both of which indicated that assets were
    impaired. The Company then used a replacement cost technique to
    determine the fair value of the assets at the facility. This
    reduction of asset value was included in the Engine segment.

Refer to Note 17, “Restructuring” of the Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this
    report for further discussion.

Equity in affiliates’ earnings, net of tax

was
    $39.6 million, $21.8 million and $38.4 million in
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. This line item is primarily
    driven by the results of our 50% owned Japanese joint venture,
    NSK-Warner, and our 32.6% owned Indian joint venture, Turbo
    Energy Limited (“TEL”). The significant increase in
    equity in affiliates’ earnings in 2010 is primarily due to
    higher vehicle production in Asia. For more discussion of
    NSK-Warner, see Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Interest expense and finance charges

were
    $68.8 million, $57.2 million and $38.8 million in
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in 2010 over
    2009 and 2009 over 2008 was primarily due to accretion of the
    discounted carrying value of our $373.8 million convertible
    senior notes and higher debt levels.

The provision for income taxes

The provision for income
    taxes resulted in an effective tax rate for 2010 of 17.1%
    compared with rates of (103.4)% in 2009 and 237.9% in 2008. The
    2010 tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate
    primarily due to foreign rates, which differ from those in the
    U.S., the realization of certain business tax credits including
    foreign tax credits and favorable permanent differences between
    book and tax treatment for items, including equity in
    affiliates’ earnings. Excluding the impacts of the reversal
    of the valuation allowance on U.S. based foreign tax
    credits, the change in tax treatment for Medicare Part D
    subsidies, the BERU-Eichenauer equity investment gain and the
    Company’s environmental litigation settlement, the
    Company’s annual effective tax rate associated with
    on-going business operations was 21.7%.

The effective tax rate of (103.4%) for 2009 differs from the
    U.S. statutory rate primarily due a reduction in
    U.S. income; foreign rates, which differ from those in the
    U.S.; the realization of certain business tax credits including
    R&D and U.S. based foreign tax credits; and favorable
    permanent differences between book and tax treatment for items,
    including equity in affiliates’ earnings.

Noncontrolling interest, net of tax

of $18.8 million
    increased by $9.4 million from 2009 and $2.5 million
    from 2008. The increase between 2010 and 2009 is primarily
    related to higher sales and earnings by the Company’s joint
    ventures. The increase between 2010 and 2008 is primarily
    related to higher sales by the Company’s joint ventures,
    offset by the Company’s increased ownership to 100% of BERU.

The $338.1 million increase in debt primarily relates to
    the January 1, 2010 adoption of ASC Topic 860, which
    required the Company to reflect its receivable securitization
    facility in its financial statements, as well as the
    Company’s September 16, 2010 issuance of
    $250 million in 4.625% senior notes. The impact of the
    adoption of ASC Topic 860 is an increase in receivables, net of
    $80 million and an increase in notes payable and other
    short-term debt of $80 million in the Company’s 2010
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company’s debt to capital
    increase also relates to the Company’s second quarter 2010
    $147.6 million acquisition of Dytech as well as the
    repurchasing of 7,066,100 shares of common stock for
    $325.7 million.

The currency translation component of other comprehensive income

Operating
    Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was
    $538.9 million, $351.0 million and $400.8 million
    in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The $187.9 million
    increase in 2010 from 2009 primarily reflects higher earnings,
    offset by higher working capital needs as compared to 2009. The
    $538.9 million of net cash provided by operating activities
    in 2010 consists of net earnings of $396.2 million,
    increased for non-cash charges of $249.5 million and a
    $106.8 million decrease in net operating assets and
    liabilities. Non-cash charges are primarily comprised of
    $252.9 million in depreciation and amortization.

The $49.8 million decrease in 2009 from 2008 was primarily
    due to lower operational earnings, somewhat offset by lower
    working capital needs.

Inventory increased in 2010 by $79.0 million excluding the
    impact of currency due to higher business levels in all regions
    of the world. Inventory management continues to remain an area
    of focus for the Company as sales volumes continue to stabilize.



Investing
    Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $429.5 million,
    $154.8 million and $343.9 million in 2010, 2009 and
    2008, respectively. This increase is primarily due to the
    $147.6 million acquisition of Dytech, the $9.6 million
    acquisition of the Company’s


/


BERU-Eichenauer joint venture, and the final $7.5 million
    payment for the June 2009 purchase of Etatech, Inc. Capital
    expenditures, including tooling outlays (“capital
    spending”) of $276.6 million in 2010, or 4.9% of
    sales, increased $104.6 million over the 2009 level of
    $172.0 million, or 4.3% of sales. Selective capital
    spending remains an area of focus for us, both in order to
    support our book of new business and for cost reduction and
    other purposes. Heading into 2011, we plan to continue to spend
    capital to support the launch of our new applications and for
    cost reductions and productivity improvement projects.

Financing
    Activities and Liquidity

Liquidity:

The Company had $449.9 million of cash on
    hand at December 31, 2010. On March 31, 2010, the
    Company replaced its $250 million multi-currency revolving
    credit facility with a new $550 million multi-currency
    revolving credit facility, which includes a feature that allows
    the Company to increase its borrowings to $600 million. The
    new facility provides for borrowings through March 31,
    2013, and is guaranteed by the Company’s domestic
    subsidiaries. The Company has three key financial covenants as
    part of the credit agreement. These covenants are a net worth
    test, a debt compared to EBITDA (“Earnings Before Interest,
    Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization”) test, and an
    interest coverage test. The Company was in compliance with all
    covenants at December 31, 2010 and expects to remain
    compliant in future periods. At December 31, 2010 and
    December 31, 2009 there were no outstanding borrowings
    under these facilities. In addition to the credit facility, as
    of December 31, 2010, the Company had approximately
    $126 million available under a universal shelf registration
    statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission
    (“SEC”) under which a variety of debt and equity
    instruments could be issued. The Company’s Board of
    Directors has authorized the filing of a new universal shelf
    registration with the SEC.

From a credit quality perspective, the Company has a credit
    rating of BBB from both Standard & Poor’s and
    Fitch Ratings and Baa3 from Moody’s (on September 2,
    2010 the Company received its first credit rating from Fitch
    Ratings). On October 27, 2010, Moody’s upgraded the
    Company’s credit rating from Ba1 to Baa3. The current
    outlook from Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and
    Fitch Ratings is stable. None of the Company’s debt
    agreements require accelerated repayment in the event of a
    downgrade in credit ratings.

On April 24, 2009 the Company’s $50 million
    accounts receivable securitization facility matured and was
    repaid. On December 21, 2009 the Company entered into a new
    $50 million accounts receivable securitization facility.

On September 8, 2010 the Company amended the
    December 21, 2009 Receivable Purchase Agreement, which
    increased the accounts receivable securitization facility from
    $50 million to $80 million. This facility matures on
    December 21, 2012.

We believe that the combination of cash from operations, cash
    balances, available credit facilities and our shelf registration
    capacity will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for our
    current level of operations and our planned operations for the
    foreseeable future. We will continue to balance our needs for
    internal growth, external growth, debt reduction and cash
    conservation.

Financing Activities:

Net debt increases, excluding the
    impact of currency translation, were $256.3 million,
    $102.4 million and $107.5 million in 2010, 2009 and
    2008, respectively. The change is mostly due to the
    Company’s September 16, 2010 issuance of
    $250 million in 4.625% senior notes, offset by the
    repurchasing of approximately 7.1 million shares of its
    common stock in 2010. Proceeds from stock options exercised, net
    of tax benefit were $67.1 million, $8.7 million and
    $17.1 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The
    Company paid dividends to BorgWarner stockholders of
    $13.8 million and $51.1 million in 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. The Company had treasury stock purchases of
    $331.2 million in 2010, of which $325.7 million has
    been paid for as of December 31, 2010. The Company had
    treasury stock purchases of $55.9 million in 2008.

The Company purchased approximately 0.4 million and
    1.34 million BERU shares in 2009 and 2008, respectively.
    The cost for these shares was $46.6 million and
    $136.8 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively and has been
    reflected as “payments for noncontrolling interest
    acquired” in the Financing section of the Consolidated
    Statements of Cash Flows. See Note 18, “Recent
    Transactions” for further information.



Off Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

The Company securitizes certain receivables through third party
    financial institutions without recourse. The amount can vary
    each month based on the amount of underlying receivables. The
    Company continues to administer the collection of these
    receivables on behalf of the third party.

On April 24, 2009 the Company’s $50 million
    accounts receivable securitization facility matured and was
    repaid. On December 21, 2009 the Company entered into a new
    $50 million accounts receivable securitization facility.

The Company was required to adopt amended ASC Topic 860,

“Accounting for Transfer of Financial Assets”

,
    on January 1, 2010. This adoption required the Company to
    reflect its receivable securitization facility in its financial
    statements in the current year of change. Accounting rules prior
    to January 1, 2010 allowed qualifying special-purpose
    entities off-balance sheet treatment. The impact of this
    adoption was an increase in receivables, net of $80 million
    and an increase in notes payable and other short-term debt of
    $80 million in the Company’s December 31, 2010
    Consolidated Balance Sheet.

On September 8, 2010 the Company amended the
    December 21, 2009 Receivable Purchase Agreement, which
    increased the accounts receivable securitization facility from
    $50 million to $80 million. This facility matures on
    December 21, 2012. Both the maturity and repayment; as well
    as the subsequent renewal of our accounts receivable
    securitization facility are reflected as Financing activities in
    the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

The Company has certain leases that are recorded as operating
    leases. Types of operating leases include leases on the
    headquarters facility, an airplane, vehicles, and certain office
    equipment. The total expected future cash outlays for all lease
    obligations at the end of 2010 is $43.0 million. See
    Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more
    information on operating leases, including future minimum
    payments.

Pension and
    Other Post Employment Benefits

The Company’s policy is to fund its defined benefit pension
    plans in accordance with applicable government regulations and
    to make additional contributions when appropriate. At
    December 31, 2010, all legal funding requirements had been
    met. The Company contributed $25.1 million,
    $39.3 million and $13.3 million to its defined benefit
    pension plans in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company
    expects to contribute a total of $30 million to
    $40 million in 2011. $23.2 million of the
    $30 million to $40 million in 2011 contributions are
    contractually obligated, as shown in the table above, while the
    remaining payments are discretionary.

The funded status of all pension plans was a net unfunded
    position of $(210.4) million and $(229.9) million at
    the end of 2010 and 2009, respectively. Of these amounts,
    $(128.0) million and $(131.1) at the end of 2010 and 2009,
    respectively, were related to plans in Germany, where there is
    not a tax deduction allowed under the applicable regulations to
    fund the plans; hence the common practice is that they are
    unfunded plans.

Other post employment benefits primarily consist of post
    employment health care benefits for certain employees and
    retirees of the Company’s U.S. operations. The Company
    funds these benefits as retiree claims are incurred. Other post
    employment benefits had an unfunded status of
    $(261.9) million at the end of 2010 and
    $(278.5) million at the end of 2009.

The Company believes it will be able to fund the requirements of
    these plans through cash generated from operations or other
    available sources of financing for the foreseeable future.

See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee
    retirement benefits.



OTHER
    MATTERS

Contingencies

In the normal course of business the Company and its
    subsidiaries are parties to various commercial and legal claims,
    actions and complaints, including matters involving warranty
    claims, intellectual property claims, general liability and
    various other risks. See Notes 7 and 14 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements. It is not possible to predict with
    certainty whether or not the Company and its subsidiaries will
    ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal
    matters or, if not, what the impact might be. The Company’s
    environmental and product liability contingencies are discussed
    separately below. The Company’s management does not expect
    that the results in any of these commercial and legal claims,
    actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect on
    the Company’s results of operations, financial position or
    cash flows.

Litigation

In January 2006, DTP, a subsidiary of the Company, filed a
    declaratory judgment action in United States District Court,
    Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis Division) against the
    United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implements
    Workers of America (“UAW”) Local No. 287 and
    Gerald Poor, individually and as the representative of a
    defendant class. DTP sought the Court’s affirmation that
    DTP did not violate the Labor-Management Relations Act or the
    Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) by unilaterally
    amending certain medical plans effective April 1, 2006 and
    October 1, 2006, prior to the expiration of the
    then-current collective bargaining agreements. On
    September 10, 2008, the Court found that DTP’s
    reservation of the right to make such amendments reducing the
    level of benefits provided to retirees was limited by its
    collectively bargained health insurance agreement with the UAW,
    which did not expire until April 24, 2009. Thus, the
    amendments were untimely. In 2008 the Company recorded a charge
    of $4.0 million as a result of the Court’s decision.

DTP filed a declaratory judgment action in the United States
    District Court, Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis
    Division) against the UAW Local No. 287 and Jim Barrett and
    others, individually and as representatives of a defendant
    class, on February 26, 2009 again seeking the Court’s
    affirmation that DTP will not violate the Labor —
    Management Relations Act or ERISA by modifying the level of
    benefits provided retirees to make them comparable to other
    Company retiree benefit plans after April 24, 2009. Certain
    retirees, on behalf of themselves and others, filed a
    mirror-image action in the United States District Court, Eastern
    District of Michigan (Southern Division) on March 11, 2009,
    for which a class has been certified. During the last quarter of
    2009 the action pending in Indiana was dismissed, while the
    action in Michigan is continuing and in the discovery phase. The
    Company is vigorously defending against the suit. This
    contingency is subject to many uncertainties, therefore based on
    the information available to date, the Company cannot estimate
    the amount or the range of potential loss, if any.

Environmental

The Company and certain of its current and former direct and
    indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have
    been identified by the United States Environmental Protection
    Agency and certain state environmental agencies and private
    parties as potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) at
    various hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive
    Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
    (“Superfund”) and equivalent state laws and, as such,
    may presently be liable for the cost of

clean-up

and
    other remedial activities at 38 such sites. Responsibility for

clean-up

and
    other remedial activities at a Superfund site is typically
    shared among PRPs based on an allocation formula.

The Company believes that none of these matters, individually or
    in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its
    results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
    Generally, this is because either the estimates of the maximum
    potential liability at a site are not material or the liability
    will be shared with other PRPs, although no assurance can be
    given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter.

Based on information available to the Company (which in most
    cases includes: an estimate of allocation of liability among
    PRPs; the probability that other PRPs, many of whom are large,
    solvent public companies,



will fully pay the cost apportioned to them; currently available
    information from PRPs

and/or

federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of
    contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs;
    remediation alternatives; and estimated legal fees), the Company
    has an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities with a
    balance at December 31, 2010 of $28.0 million. The
    Company has accrued amounts that do not exceed $3.0 million
    related to any individual site except for the Crystal Springs
    site discussed below, and we do not believe that the costs
    related to any of these sites will have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows
    or financial condition. The Company expects to pay out
    substantially all of the amounts accrued for environmental
    liability over the next three to five years.

In connection with the sale of Kuhlman Electric Corporation, the
    Company agreed to indemnify the buyer and Kuhlman Electric for
    certain environmental liabilities, then unknown to the Company,
    relating to certain operations of Kuhlman Electric that pre-date
    the Company’s 1999 acquisition of Kuhlman Electric. During
    2000, Kuhlman Electric notified the Company that it discovered
    potential environmental contamination at its Crystal Springs,
    Mississippi plant while undertaking an expansion of the plant.
    The Company is continuing to work with the Mississippi
    Department of Environmental Quality and Kuhlman Electric to
    investigate and remediate to the extent necessary, historical
    contamination at the plant and surrounding area. Kuhlman
    Electric and others, including the Company, were sued in
    numerous related lawsuits, in which multiple claimants alleged
    personal injury and property damage relating to the alleged
    environmental contamination. In 2005, the Company and other
    defendants entered into settlements that resolved approximately
    99% of those claims and the remainder of them have since been
    dismissed.

In 2007 and 2008, four additional lawsuits were filed against
    Kuhlman Electric and others, including the Company, on behalf of
    approximately 340 plaintiffs, alleging personal injury relating
    to the alleged environmental contamination. One of the lawsuits,
    involving a single plaintiff, was dismissed by the trial court
    in April 2010 and the plaintiff’s appeal of that decision
    was dismissed by the appellate court in August 2010. The Company
    entered into a settlement in July 2010 regarding the personal
    injury claims of the plaintiffs in the other three lawsuits and
    those of approximately 2,700 unfiled claimants represented by
    those plaintiffs’ attorneys. In exchange for, among other
    things, the dismissal with prejudice of these lawsuits and the
    release of claims by the unfiled claimants, the Company agreed
    to pay up to $28 million in settlement funds, which was
    expensed in the second quarter of 2010. In November 2010 the
    Company paid $13.9 million related to this settlement. The
    remaining payment of approximately $14 million is expected
    to be paid in February 2011.

Conditional
    Asset Retirement Obligations

In March 2005, ASC Topic 410, Accounting for Conditional Asset
    Retirement Obligations, which requires the Company to recognize
    legal obligations to perform asset retirements in which the
    timing

and/or

method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may
    or may not be within the control of the entity. Certain
    government regulations require the removal and disposal of
    asbestos from an existing facility at the time the facility
    undergoes major renovations or is demolished. The liability
    exists because the facility will not last forever, but it is
    conditional on future renovations (even if there are no
    immediate plans to remove the materials, which pose no health or
    safety hazard in their current condition). Similarly, government
    regulations require the removal or closure of underground
    storage tanks and above ground storage tanks when their use
    ceases, the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyl transformers
    and capacitors when their use ceases, and the disposal of used
    furnace bricks and liners, and lead-based paint in conjunction
    with facility renovations or demolition. The Company currently
    has 45 manufacturing locations that have been identified as
    containing these items. The fair value to remove and dispose of
    this material has been estimated and recorded at
    $1.2 million as of December 31, 2010 and
    $1.3 million at December 31, 2009.

Product
    Liability

Like many other industrial companies who have historically
    operated in the U.S., the Company (or parties the Company is
    obligated to indemnify) continues to be named as one of many
    defendants in asbestos-related personal injury actions. We
    believe that the Company’s involvement is limited because,
    in general, these claims relate to a few types of automotive
    friction products that were manufactured many years ago and
    contained encapsulated asbestos. The nature of the fibers, the
    encapsulation and the manner of use lead the



Company to believe that these products are highly unlikely to
    cause harm. As of December 31, 2010 and December 31,
    2009 the Company had approximately 17,000 and 23,000 pending
    asbestos-related product liability claims, respectively. Of the
    17,000 outstanding claims at December 31, 2010,
    approximately 8,000 were pending in just three jurisdictions,
    where significant tort and judicial reform activities are
    underway.

The Company’s policy is to vigorously defend against these
    lawsuits and the Company has been successful in obtaining
    dismissal of many claims without any payment. The Company
    expects that the vast majority of the pending asbestos-related
    product liability claims where it is a defendant (or has an
    obligation to indemnify a defendant) will result in no payment
    being made by the Company or its insurers. In 2010, of the
    approximately 7,700 claims resolved, 245 (3.2%) resulted in any
    payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the Company.
    In the full year of 2009, of the approximately 5,300 claims
    resolved, only 223 (4.2%) resulted in any payment being made to
    a claimant by or on behalf of the Company.

Prior to June 2004, the settlement and defense costs associated
    with all claims were covered by the Company’s primary layer
    insurance coverage, and these carriers administered, defended,
    settled and paid all claims under a funding arrangement. In
    addition to the primary insurance available for asbestos-related
    claims, the Company has substantial additional layers of
    insurance available for potential future asbestos-related
    product claims. As such, the Company continues to believe that
    its coverage is sufficient to meet foreseeable liabilities.

In June 2004, primary layer insurance carriers notified the
    Company of the alleged exhaustion of their policy limits. This
    led the Company to access the next available layer of insurance
    coverage. Since June 2004, secondary layer insurers have been
    responsible for asbestos-related litigation defense and
    settlement expenses pursuant to a funding arrangement.

A declaratory judgment action was filed in January 2004 in the
    Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois by Continental Casualty
    Company and related companies (“CNA”) against the
    Company and certain of its other historical general liability
    insurers. CNA provided the Company with both primary and
    additional layer insurance, and, in conjunction with other
    insurers, is currently defending and indemnifying the Company in
    its pending asbestos-related product liability claims. The
    lawsuit seeks to determine the extent of insurance coverage
    available to the Company including whether the available limits
    exhaust on a “per occurrence” or an
    “aggregate” basis, and to determine how the applicable
    coverage responsibilities should be apportioned. On
    August 15, 2005, the Court issued an interim order
    regarding the apportionment matter. The interim order has the
    effect of making insurers responsible for all defense and
    settlement costs pro rata to

time-on-the-risk,

with the pro-ration method to hold the insured harmless for
    periods of bankrupt or unavailable coverage. Appeals of the
    interim order were denied. However, the issue is reserved for
    appellate review at the end of the action.

Although it is impossible to predict the outcome of pending or
    future claims or the impact of tort reform legislation that may
    be enacted at the State or Federal levels, due to the
    encapsulated nature of the products, the Company’s
    experiences in vigorously defending and resolving claims in the
    past, and the Company’s significant insurance coverage with
    solvent carriers as of the date of this filing, management does
    not believe that asbestos-related product liability claims are
    likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

To date, the Company has paid and accrued $153.1 million in
    defense and indemnity in advance of insurers’
    reimbursement, which includes the $40.7 million referred to
    below, and has received $32.5 million in cash from
    insurers. The net outstanding balance of $120.6 million is
    expected to be fully recovered, of which approximately
    $43 million is expected to be recovered within one year.
    Timing of the recovery is dependent on final resolution of the
    declaratory judgment action referred to above. At
    December 31, 2009, insurers owed $58.6 million in
    association with these claims.

On April 5, 2010 the Superior Court of New Jersey Appellate
    Division affirmed a lower court judgment in an asbestos-related
    action against the Company and others. The Company filed its
    Notice of Petition to the Supreme Court of New Jersey in late
    April, seeking to appeal the decisions of the lower courts. On
    July 8, 2010 the Supreme Court of New Jersey denied the
    Company’s Notice of Petition appealing the decision of the
    lower courts. The total claim of $40.7 million was paid by
    the Company in July 2010.



In addition to the $120.6 million net outstanding balance
    relating to past settlements and defense costs, the Company has
    estimated a liability of $50.6 million for claims asserted,
    but not yet resolved and their related defense costs at
    December 31, 2010. The Company also has a related asset of
    $50.6 million to recognize proceeds from the insurance
    carriers. Insurance carrier reimbursement of 100% is expected
    based on the Company’s experience, its insurance contracts
    and decisions received to date in the declaratory judgment
    action referred to below. At December 31, 2009, the
    comparable value of the insurance asset and accrued liability
    was $49.9 million.

The amounts recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets related
    to the estimated future settlement of existing claims are as
    follows:

The Company cannot reasonably estimate possible losses, if any,
    in excess of those for which it has accrued, because it cannot
    predict how many additional claims may be brought against the
    Company (or parties the Company has an obligation to indemnify)
    in the future, the allegations in such claims, the possible
    outcomes, or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be
    enacted at the State or Federal levels.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States (“GAAP”). In preparing these financial
    statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments
    of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving
    due consideration to materiality. Critical accounting policies
    are those that are most important to the portrayal of the
    Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
    These policies require management’s most difficult,
    subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the
    financial statements and accompanying notes. Management makes
    estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are
    inherently uncertain, relating to the reporting of assets,
    liabilities, revenues, expenses and the disclosure of contingent
    assets and liabilities. Our most critical accounting policies
    are discussed below.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates
    and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
    contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
    statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
    during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
    those estimates.

Depreciation

The automotive industry experienced unprecedented declines in
    production in the fourth quarter of 2008 and projected continued
    declines for the full year of 2009. According to Accounting
    Standards Codification (“ASC”) 250, future
    depreciation expense should be revised due to a change in the
    estimated future benefits inherent in an asset, the pattern of
    consumption of those benefits, or the information available to
    the entity about those benefits. As a result of the 2008 and
    2009 unprecedented declines in production activity, the



Company determined that its usage pattern for certain assets had
    changed significantly and revised the useful lives of certain
    equipment starting in 2009. This adjustment was considered to be
    a change in an accounting estimate.

Revenue
    Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss pass
    to the customer, which is usually upon shipment of product.
    Although the Company may enter into long-term supply agreements
    with its major customers, each shipment of goods is treated as a
    separate sale and the prices are not fixed over the life of the
    agreements.

Impairment of
    Long-Lived Assets

In accordance with ASC Topic 360, the Company periodically
    reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets, whether
    held for use or disposal, including other intangible assets,
    when events and circumstances warrant such a review. Such events
    and circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant
    decrease in market volumes, or project life, or a loss of a
    major customer application (i.e., a “triggering
    event”). The Company’s impairment review is performed
    at each manufacturing, assembly, and technical site using data
    that is the basis for the Company’s annual budget (or
    forecast on an interim basis) and long-range plan
    (“LRP”). The annual budget and LRP include a five year
    projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and
    customer commitments. If a triggering event has occurred, the
    assets are identified by the operating location and management
    as potentially impaired and a recoverability review is performed
    by management. The review will determine if a current or future
    alternative use exists for additional customer applications or
    if redeployment of the assets to any of the Company’s other
    operating sites around the world is justified. The
    recoverability test compares projected undiscounted future cash
    flows to the carrying value of a product line or a specific
    customer application or asset grouping, as applicable.

If the undiscounted cash flow test for recoverability identifies
    a possible impairment, management will perform a fair value
    analysis. Management determines fair value under ASC Topic 820
    using the appropriate valuation technique of market, income or
    cost approach. Management believes that the estimates and
    assumptions are reasonable however, changes in assumptions with
    respect to future volumes, program project life or future asset
    use, in addition to future cash flows underlying these estimates
    could affect the Company’s fair value evaluations.

Due to the sudden decline in the global automotive markets in
    2008 and 2009, the Company reviewed the carrying value of its
    long-lived assets. As a result of these reviews, the Company
    recognized $36.3 million and $72.9 million in
    impairment of long-lived assets (i.e., plant and equipment) as
    part of restructuring



expenses in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The 2009 and 2008
    impairment charges are broken out by segment as follows:

    a discussion of market-based measurements.

Goodwill

The Company annually reviews its goodwill for impairment in the
    fourth quarter of each year for all of its reporting units, or
    more often when events and circumstances warrant such a review.

The Company’s goodwill impairment review, under ASC Topic
    350, requires the Company to make significant assumptions and
    estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows,
    discount rates and growth rates. The basis of our goodwill
    impairment analysis is the Company’s annual budget and
    long-range plan (“LRP”). The annual budget and LRP
    include a five year projection of future cash flows based on
    actual new products and customer commitments. As part of the
    projection, we assumed the last year of the LRP data is a fair
    indication of the future performance, including fundamental
    industry growth for the business beyond the five year period
    into perpetuity. As the LRP is estimated over a significant
    future period of time, those estimates and assumptions are
    subject to a high degree of uncertainty. We also utilize market
    valuation models and other financial ratios, which require us to
    make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the
    applicability of those models to our assets and businesses. We
    believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the
    estimated fair values of each of our reporting units are
    reasonable. Different assumptions could materially affect the
    estimated fair value. The primary assumptions affecting the
    Company’s December 31, 2010 goodwill impairment review
    are as follows:

•

Discount Rate: The Company used a 10% weighted average cost of
    capital (“WACC”) as the discount rate for future cash
    flows. The WACC is intended to represent a rate of return that
    would be expected by a market participant.

•

Operating Income Margin: The Company utilized historical and
    expected operating income margins, which varied based on the
    projections of each reporting unit being evaluated.

In addition to the above significant assumptions, the Company
    notes the following risk to volume assumptions that could have
    an impact on the discounted cash flow model:

•

Our industry is cyclical and our results of operations will be
    adversely affected by industry downturns.

•

We are dependent on market segments that use our key products
    and would be affected by decreasing demand in those segments.

•

We are subject to risks related to our international operations.

While the Company believes that these assumptions are
    appropriate, significant changes in these assumptions may
    materially affect the Company’s analysis related to one of
    its reporting units in the Engine operating segment, whose
    estimated fair value is 112% of its carrying value.

Based on our sensitivity analysis, a 1% increase in the discount
    rate or a 1% decrease in the operating margin assumptions would
    result in the carrying value exceeding the estimated fair value
    of one reporting unit tested within the Engine operating
    segment. This would require further evaluation of the reporting
    unit’s



goodwill, under a step two impairment test. The following table
    illustrates the sensitivity to the estimated fair value of that
    reporting unit.

In 2008 the company recorded impairment charges totaling
    €111.5 ($156.8) million to adjust BERU’s goodwill
    to its estimated fair value. The impairment charge is
    attributable to a decrease in the operating unit’s
    estimated fair value based primarily upon the effect of the
    decline in European market conditions on current and projected
    operating results. The impairment charge was also impacted by
    the recognition of additional goodwill in the second quarter of
    2008, which was based on the court determined buy out value of
    €71.32 per share related to the Domination and Profit
    Transfer Agreement. Any differences in future results compared
    to management’s estimates could result in fair values
    different from estimated fair values, which could materially
    impact the Company’s future results of operations and
    financial condition.

See Note 18, “Recent Transactions”, for further
    discussion on the BERU Domination and Profit Transfer Agreement.

The impairment tests completed in the fourth quarter of 2010 and
    2009 indicated no impairment for either year, and estimated fair
    value to be approximately 360% and 220% for the Company’s
    carrying value in 2010 and 2009, respectively.

See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information regarding goodwill.

Environmental
    Accrual

We work with outside experts to determine a range of potential
    liability for environmental sites. The ranges for each
    individual site are then aggregated into a loss range for the
    total accrued liability. Management’s estimate of the loss
    range for environmental liability, including conditional asset
    retirement obligations, for 2010 is between approximately
    $26 million and $40 million. We record an accrual at
    the most probable amount within the range unless one cannot be
    determined; in which case we record the accrual at the low end
    of the range. At the end of 2010, our total accrued
    environmental liability was $29.2 million, which includes
    our conditional asset retirement obligation under ASC Topic 410
    of $1.2 million.

See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information regarding environmental accrual.

Product
    Warranty

The Company provides warranties on some of its products. The
    warranty terms are typically from one to three years. Provisions
    for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at
    the time products are sold. These estimates are established
    using historical information about the nature, frequency, and
    average cost of warranty claim settlements; as well as product
    manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from
    third parties. Management actively studies trends of warranty
    claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize
    warranty claims. Management believes that the warranty accrual
    is appropriate; however, actual claims incurred could differ
    from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to the
    accrual. Our warranty provision over the last three years, and
    as a percentage of net sales, has trended as follows:

At the end of 2010, our total accrued warranty liability was

    $37.0 million in current liabilities and $29.8 million
    in non-current liabilities on our balance sheet.

See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information regarding product warranty.

Other Loss
    Accruals and Valuation Allowances

The Company has numerous other loss exposures, such as customer
    claims, workers’ compensation claims, litigation, and
    recoverability of assets. Establishing loss accruals or
    valuation allowances for these matters requires the use of
    estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and
    ultimate realization. We estimate losses under the programs
    using consistent and appropriate methods; however, changes to
    our assumptions could materially affect our recorded accrued
    liabilities for loss or asset valuation allowances.

Pension and Other
    Post Employment Defined Benefits

The Company provides post employment defined benefits to a
    number of its current and former employees. Costs associated
    with post employment defined benefits include pension and post
    employment health care expenses for employees, retirees and
    surviving spouses and dependents.

Using appropriate actuarial methods and assumptions, the
    Company’s defined benefit pension and non-pension
    postretirement employee benefit plans are accounted for in
    accordance with ASC Topic 715. Disability, early retirement and
    other postretirement employee benefits are accounted for in
    accordance with ASC Topic 712.

The determination of the Company’s obligation and expense
    for its pension and other postretirement employee benefits, such
    as retiree health care, is dependent on certain assumptions used
    by actuaries in calculating such amounts. Certain of the more
    important assumptions are described in Note 11
    “Retirement Benefit Plans” to the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements included in Item 8
    “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K

and include the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return
    on plan assets, rates of increase in compensation and health
    care costs, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors.
    The effects of any modification to those assumptions are either
    recognized immediately or amortized over future periods in
    accordance with GAAP.

In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from
    assumptions used are accumulated and generally amortized over
    future periods. The primary assumptions affecting the
    Company’s accounting for employee benefits under ASC Topics
    712 and 715 as of December 31, 2010 are as follows:

•

Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets: The expected
    long-term rate of return is used in the calculation of net
    periodic benefit cost. The required use of the expected
    long-term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized
    returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on
    those plan assets in any given year. Over time, however, the
    expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is designed to
    approximate actual earned long-term returns. The expected
    long-term rate of return for pension assets has been determined
    based on various inputs. These inputs include historical returns
    for the different asset classes held by the Company’s
    trusts and its asset allocation, as well as inputs from internal
    and external sources regarding expected capital market return,
    inflation and other variables. The Company also considers the
    impact of active management of the plans’ invested assets.
    In determining its pension expense for 2010, the Company used
    long-term rates of return on plan assets ranging from 2.00% to
    9.25% outside of the U.S. and 7.50% in the U.S.



Actual return on U.S. pension assets for 2010, 2009 and
    2008 were 14.6%, 25.3% and (25.7%), respectively, compared to
    the expected rate of return assumption of 7.50% in 2010 and 2009
    and 8.75% for 2008.

Actual return on U.K. pension assets for 2010, 2009 and 2008
    were 13.3%, 15.1% and (18.7%), respectively, compared to the
    expected rate of return assumption of 7.50% in 2010 and 2009 and
    7.25% for 2008.

•

Discount rate: The discount rate is used to calculate pension
    and postretirement employee benefit obligations
    (“OPEB”). The discount rate assumption is based on a
    constant effective yield from matching projected plan cash flows
    to high quality (Aa) bond yields of corresponding maturities as
    of the measurement date. The Company used discount rates ranging
    from 1.75% to 7.75% to determine its pension and other benefit
    obligations as of December 31, 2010, including weighted
    average discount rates of 5.17% for U.S. pension plans,
    5.37% for

non-U.S. pension

plans, and 4.75% for U.S. other post employment health care
    plans. The U.S. discount rate reflects the fact that our
    U.S. pension plan has been closed for new participants
    since 1989 (1999 for our U.S. health care plan), and with
    the closing of our Muncie facility in 2009, there will be
    negligible service cost going forward.

•

Health care cost trend: For postretirement employee health care
    plan accounting, the Company reviews external data and Company
    specific historical trends for health care cost to determine the
    health care cost trend rate assumptions. In determining the
    projected benefit obligation for postretirement employee health
    care plans as of December 31, 2010, the Company used health
    care cost trend rates of 7.40%, declining to an ultimate trend
    rate of 5% by the year 2019.

While the Company believes that these assumptions are
    appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or
    significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect
    the Company’s pension and other postretirement employee
    benefit obligations and its future expense.

The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in
    certain assumptions for Company sponsored U.S. and

non-U.S. pension

plans on its 2011 pre-tax pension expense:

Income
    Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC
    Topic 740. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
    for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
    between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
    and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating
    loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
    apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
    differences are expected to be recovered or settled. In 2008 and
    2009, the Company recorded a valuation allowance that primarily
    represented foreign net operating losses and U.S. based
    foreign tax credits for which utilization was uncertain. In
    2010, the Company recorded a reversal of the Company’s
    $21.2 million valuation allowance on U.S. based foreign tax
    credit carryforwards.

Management judgment is required in determining the
    Company’s provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets
    and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the
    Company’s net deferred tax assets. In calculating the
    provision for income taxes on an interim basis, the Company uses
    an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the
    facts and circumstances known at each interim period. In
    determining the need for a valuation allowance, the historical
    and projected financial performance of the operation recording
    the net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other
    pertinent information. Since future financial results may differ
    from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to the
    Company’s valuation allowance may be necessary.

The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. at the
    federal and state level and numerous

non-U.S. jurisdictions.

Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide
    provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and
    liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are
    many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax
    determination is less than certain. Accruals for income tax
    contingencies are provided for in accordance with the
    requirements of ASC Topic 605. The Company’s
    U.S. federal and certain state income tax returns and
    certain

non-U.S. income

tax returns are currently under various stages of audit by
    applicable tax authorities. Although the outcome of ongoing tax
    audits is always uncertain, management believes that it has
    appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns
    and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient
    to pay assessments, if any, which may be proposed by the taxing
    authorities. At December 31, 2010, the Company has recorded
    a liability for its best estimate of the more likely than not
    loss on certain of its tax positions, which is included in other
    non-current liabilities. Nonetheless, the amounts ultimately
    paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing
    authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for
    each year.

See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information regarding income taxes.

New Accounting
    Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB ASC amended Topic 820,

Fair Value
    Measurements and Disclosures

. ASC Topic 820 defines fair
    value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP
    and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. On
    January 1, 2009, the Company fully adopted as required, ASC
    Topic 820. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for more information regarding the implementation of
    ASC Topic 820.



In February 2007, the FASB ASC amended Topic 825,

Financial
    Instruments

. ASC Topic 825 allows entities to irrevocably
    elect to recognize most financial assets and financial
    liabilities at fair value on an

instrument-by-instrument

basis. The stated objective of ASC Topic 825 is to improve
    financial reporting by giving entities the opportunity to elect
    to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair
    value in order to mitigate earnings volatility caused when
    related assets and liabilities are measured differently. ASC
    Topic 825 was effective for the Company beginning with its
    quarter ending March 31, 2008. The Company chose to not
    make the election to adopt.

In December 2007, the FASB ASC amended Topic 805,

Business
    Combinations

. ASC Topic 805 establishes principles and
    requirements for recognizing identifiable assets acquired,
    liabilities assumed, noncontrolling interest in the acquiree,
    goodwill acquired in the combination or the gain from a bargain
    purchase, and disclosure requirements. Under this revised
    statement, all costs incurred to effect an acquisition are
    recognized separately from the acquisition. Also, restructuring
    costs that are expected but the acquirer is not obligated to
    incur are recognized separately from the acquisition. On
    January 1, 2009, the Company adopted ASC Topic 805. In the
    first quarter of 2009, the Company expensed $4.8 million
    related to on-going acquisition related activity.

In December 2007, the FASB ASC amended Topic 810,

Consolidation

. For consolidated subsidiaries that are
    less than wholly owned, the third party holdings of equity
    interests are referred to as noncontrolling interests. The
    portion of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling
    interests for such subsidiaries is presented as net income
    (loss) applicable to noncontrolling interest on the consolidated
    statement of operation, and the portion of stockholders’
    equity of such subsidiaries is presented as noncontrolling
    interest on the consolidated balance sheet. Effective
    January 1, 2009, the Company adopted ASC Topic 810.

The adoption of ASC Topic 810 did not have a material impact on
    the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or
    cash flows. However, it did impact the presentation and
    disclosure of noncontrolling (minority) interests in our
    consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated
    financial statements. As a result of the retrospective
    presentation and disclosure requirements of ASC Topic 810, the
    Company was required to reflect the change in presentation and
    disclosure for the period ending March 31, 2009 and all
    periods presented in future filings.

The principal effect on the prior year balance sheets related to
    the adoption of ASC Topic 810 is summarized as follows:

In March 2008, the FASB ASC amended Topic 815,

Derivatives
    and Hedging

. ASC Topic 815 requires entities to provide
    enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative
    instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items
    are accounted for under ASC Topic 815 and its related
    interpretations, and how derivative instruments and related
    hedged items affect an entity’s financial position,
    financial performance, and cash flows. On January 1, 2009,
    the Company adopted ASC Topic 815. See Note 10 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding
    the implementation of ASC Topic 815.

In May 2008, the FASB ASC amended Topic 470,

Debt

. Under
    ASC Topic 470, an entity must separately account for the
    liability and equity components of the convertible debt
    instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash
    upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer’s
    interest cost. ASC Topic 470 is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008, and for interim periods
    within those fiscal years, with retrospective application
    required. As a result of our adoption of ASC Topic 470 for
    fiscal 2009 and the Company’s April 9, 2009 issuance
    of $373.8 million convertible senior notes due
    April 15, 2012, we recorded the equity and liability
    components of the notes on our December 31, 2009
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additionally, ASC Topic 470 requires
    us to accrete the discounted carrying value of the convertible
    notes to their face value over the term of the notes. The
    Company’s interest expense associated with this
    amortization is based on the effective interest rate of the
    convertible senior notes of 9.365%. See Note 8 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

In December 2008, the FASB ASC amended Topic 715,

Compensation — Retirement Benefits

. ASC Topic
    715 requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures about how
    investment allocation decisions are made, the major categories
    of plan assets, the inputs and valuation techniques used to
    measure fair value of plan assets, the effect of fair value
    measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in
    plan assets for the period, and significant concentrations of
    risk within plan assets. See Note 9 and Note 11 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding
    the implementation of ASC Topic 715.

In June 2009, the FASB ASC amended Topic 860,

“Accounting for Transfer of Financial Assets”

.
    ASC Topic 860 removes the concept of a qualifying
    special-purpose entity and removes the exception from applying
    ASC Topic 810, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, to
    qualifying special-purpose entities. This Statement modifies the
    financial- components approach used in ASC Topic 860 and limits
    the circumstances in which a financial asset, or portion of a
    financial asset, should be derecognized. Additionally, enhanced
    disclosures are required to provide financial statement users
    with greater transparency about transfers of financial assets
    and a transferor’s continuing involvement with transferred
    financial assets. On January 1, 2010, the Company elected
    to prospectively adopt ASC Topic 860. The impact of this
    adoption is an increase in receivables, net of $80 million
    and an increase in notes payable and other short-term debt of
    $80 million in the Company’s December 31, 2010
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 1 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for more information on the implementation
    of ASC Topic 860.

In June 2009, the FASB amended ASC Topic 810,
    “

Consolidation”

. ASC Topic 810 requires an
    ongoing reassessment of whether an enterprise is the primary
    beneficiary of a variable interest entity. Additionally, ASC
    Topic 810 requires enhanced disclosures that will provide users
    of financial statements with more transparent information about
    an enterprise’s involvement in variable interest entities.
    On January 1, 2010, the Company adopted ASC Topic 810. The
    adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s financial statements.

In June 2009, the FASB ASC amended Topic 105, “

Generally
    Accepted Accounting Principles”

. This ASC Topic
    instituted a major change in the way accounting standards are
    organized. The accounting standards Codification became the
    single official source of authoritative, nongovernmental GAAP.
    As of September 30, 2009 only one level of authoritative
    GAAP exists, other than guidance issued by the SEC. All other
    literature is non-authoritative. The Company adopted the
    Codification in the third quarter of 2009. The adoption of the
    Codification had no impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.



QUALITATIVE AND
    QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company’s primary market risks include fluctuations in
    interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We are also
    affected by changes in the prices of commodities used or
    consumed in our manufacturing operations. Some of our commodity
    purchase price risk is covered by supply agreements with
    customers and suppliers. Other commodity purchase price risk is
    addressed by hedging strategies, which include forward
    contracts. The Company enters into derivative instruments only
    with high credit quality counterparties and diversifies its
    positions across such counterparties in order to reduce its
    exposure to credit losses. We do not engage in any derivative
    instruments for purposes other than hedging specific operating
    risks.

We have established policies and procedures to manage
    sensitivity to interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and
    commodity purchase price risk, which include monitoring the
    level of exposure to each market risk. For quantitative
    disclosures about market risk, please refer to Note 10,
    “Financial Instruments” of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report
    with respect to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange
    risk.

Interest Rate
    Risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic
    losses due to adverse changes in interest rates. The Company
    manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to
    fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its
    interest costs. The Company selectively uses interest rate swaps
    to reduce market value risk associated with changes in interest
    rates (fair value hedges). At the end of 2010, the amount of
    debt with fixed interest rates was 69.5% of total debt,
    including the impact of the interest rate swaps. Our earnings
    exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is
    primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt
    instruments that are indexed to floating money market rates. A
    10% increase or decrease in the average cost of our variable
    rate debt would result in a change in pre-tax interest expense
    of approximately $1.6 million in 2010, and
    $1.5 million in 2009.

We also measure interest rate risk by estimating the net amount
    by which the fair value of all of our interest rate sensitive
    assets and liabilities would be impacted by selected
    hypothetical changes in market interest rates. Fair value is
    estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis. Assuming a
    hypothetical instantaneous 10% change in interest rates as of
    December 31, 2010, the net fair value of these instruments
    would increase by approximately $28.0 million if interest
    rates decreased and would decrease by approximately
    $26.0 million if interest rates increased. Our interest
    rate sensitivity analysis assumes a constant shift in interest
    rate yield curves. The model, therefore, does not reflect the
    potential impact of changes in the relationship between
    short-term and long-term interest rates. Interest rate
    sensitivity at December 31, 2009, measured in a similar
    manner, was slightly more than at December 31, 2010.

Foreign Currency
    Exchange Rate Risk

Foreign currency risk is the risk that we will incur economic
    losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates. Currently, our most significant currency exposures relate
    to the British Pound, the Euro, the Hungarian Forint, the
    Japanese Yen, and the South Korean Won. We mitigate our foreign
    currency exchange rate risk principally by establishing local
    production facilities and related supply chain participants in
    the markets we serve, by invoicing customers in the same
    currency as the source of the products and by funding some of
    our investments in foreign markets through local currency loans
    and cross currency swaps. Such

non-U.S. Dollar

debt was $299.0 million as of December 31, 2010 and
    $303.1 million as of December 31, 2009. We also
    monitor our foreign currency exposure in each country and
    implement strategies to respond to changing economic and
    political environments. In addition, the Company periodically
    enters into forward currency contracts in order to reduce
    exposure to exchange rate risk related to transactions
    denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. As
    of December 31, 2010, the Company was holding foreign
    exchange derivatives with positive and negative fair market
    values of $2.7 million and



$(6.4) million, respectively, of which $2.6 million in
    gains and $(3.3) million in losses mature in less than one
    year. As of December 31, 2010, $(0.1) million in
    losses did not qualify for deferral.

Commodity Price
    Risk

Commodity price risk is the possibility that we will incur
    economic losses due to adverse changes in the cost of raw
    materials used in the production of our products. Commodity
    forward and option contracts are executed to offset our exposure
    to the potential change in prices mainly for various non-ferrous
    metals and natural gas consumption used in the manufacturing of
    vehicle components. As of December 31, 2010, the Company
    had forward and option commodity contracts with a total notional
    value of $1.2 million.

REPORT OF
    MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
    REPORTING

The information in this report is the responsibility of
    management. BorgWarner Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) has in place reporting guidelines and
    policies designed to ensure that the statements and other
    information contained in this report present a fair and accurate
    financial picture of the Company. In fulfilling this management
    responsibility, we make informed judgments and estimates
    conforming with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America.

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been
    audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
    public accounting firm.

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting.

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
    a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
    America. The internal control process includes those policies
    and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
    detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
    dispositions of the assets of the Company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
    that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made
    only in accordance with authorizations of management and
    directors of the Company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Any system of internal control, no matter how well designed, has
    inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined
    to be effective may not prevent or detect misstatements and can
    provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
    statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any
    evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
    risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
    conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
    or procedures may deteriorate.

The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010. In making this assessment, the
    Company’s management used the criteria set forth by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (“COSO”) in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

.

Based on management’s assessment and those criteria, we
    believe that, as of December 31, 2010, the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting is effective.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, has audited the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements and the effectiveness of internal controls
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 as stated
    in their report.

The Company’s Audit Committee, composed entirely of
    directors of the Company who are not employees, meets
    periodically with the Company’s management and independent
    registered public accounting firm to review financial results
    and procedures, internal financial controls and internal and
    external audit plans and recommendations. In carrying out these
    responsibilities, the Audit Committee and the independent
    registered public accounting firm have unrestricted access to
    each other with or without the presence of management
    representatives.

Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of BorgWarner Inc.:

Auburn Hills, Michigan

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
    the financial position of BorgWarner Inc. and Consolidated
    Subsidiaries at December 31, 2010 and December 31,
    2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
    for each of the two years in the period ended December 31,
    2010 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
    in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the
    Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010,
    based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions
    on these financial statements and on the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
    We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
    control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

We also have audited the adjustments to the 2008 financial
    statements to retrospectively apply the change in accounting
    related to the adoption of ASC 810 Noncontrolling Interests
    in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB
    No. 51 (formerly FAS 160), as described in
    Note 1. In our opinion, such adjustments are appropriate
    and have been properly applied. We were not engaged to audit,
    review, or apply any procedures to the 2008 financial statements
    of the Company other than with respect to the adjustments and,
    accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of
    assurance on the 2008 financial statements taken as a whole.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of BorgWarner Inc.

Auburn Hills, Michigan

We have audited, before the effects of the adjustments to
    retrospectively apply the change in accounting discussed in
    Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements of
    BorgWarner Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries (the
    “Company”), the consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income and cash
    flows for the year ended December 31, 2008 (the 2008
    consolidated financial statements before the effects of the
    adjustments discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated
    financial statements are not presented herein). These financial
    statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such 2008 consolidated financial statements,
    before the effects of the adjustments to retrospectively apply
    the change in accounting discussed in Note 1 to the
    consolidated financial statements, present fairly, in all
    material respects, the results of the operations and cash flows
    of BorgWarner Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries for the year
    ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to
    the adjustments to retrospectively apply the change in
    accounting discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated
    financial statements and, accordingly, we do not express an
    opinion or any other form of assurance about whether such
    retrospective adjustments are appropriate and have been properly
    applied. Those retrospective adjustments were audited by other
    auditors.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INTRODUCTION

BorgWarner Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) is a leading global supplier of highly
    engineered systems and components primarily for powertrain
    applications. These products are manufactured and sold
    worldwide, primarily to original equipment manufacturers of
    passenger cars, sport-utility vehicles, crossover vehicles,
    trucks, commercial transportation products and industrial
    equipment and to certain Tier One vehicle systems
    suppliers. The Company’s products fall into two reporting
    segments: Engine and Drivetrain.

NOTE 1

SUMMARY OF
    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following paragraphs briefly describe the Company’s
    significant accounting policies.

Basis of presentation

The Company’s presentation of
    the Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of
    Operations, Consolidated Statements of Equity and Comprehensive
    Income (Loss), and Reporting Segments and Related Information
    Note have been adjusted to conform with the requirements of
    Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 810,
    Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements and
    ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. Refer to New Accounting
    Pronouncements for further information regarding these
    reclassifications.

Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements
    in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
    the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires
    management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates
    and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
    at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
    of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
    results could differ from those estimates.

Concentrations of risk

Cash is maintained with several
    financial institutions. Deposits held with banks may exceed the
    amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these
    deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with
    financial institutions of reputable credit and therefore bear
    minimal risk.

The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its suppliers
    and customers and, with the exception of certain financing
    transactions, does not require collateral from its customers.
    The Company’s customers are primarily original equipment
    manufacturers (“OEMs”) of light-vehicles (passenger
    cars, sport-utility vehicles, crossover vehicles, vans and
    light-trucks). The Company’s products are also sold to
    other OEMs of commercial trucks, buses and agricultural and
    off-highway vehicles. The Company also manufactures and sells
    products to certain Tier One vehicle systems suppliers and
    into the aftermarket for light and commercial vehicles.

Some automotive parts suppliers continue to experience commodity
    cost pressures and the effects of industry overcapacity. These
    factors have increased pressure on the industry’s supply
    base, as suppliers cope with higher commodity costs, lower
    production volumes and other challenges. The Company receives
    certain of its raw materials from sole suppliers or a limited
    number of suppliers. The inability of a supplier to fulfill
    supply requirements of the Company could materially affect
    future operating results.

Principles of consolidation

The Consolidated Financial
    Statements include all majority- owned subsidiaries with a
    controlling financial interest. All inter-company accounts and
    transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments
    in 20% to 50% owned affiliates are accounted for under the
    equity method when the Company does not have a controlling
    financial interest.

Revenue recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when
    title and risk of loss pass to the customer, which is usually
    upon shipment of product. Although the Company may enter into
    long-term supply agreements with its major customers, each
    shipment of goods is treated as a separate sale and the prices
    are not fixed over the life of the agreements.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Cash

Cash is valued at fair market value. It is the
    Company’s policy to classify all highly liquid investments
    with original maturities of three months or less as cash.

Accounts receivable

The Company securitizes certain
    receivables through third party financial institutions without
    recourse. The amount can vary each month based on the amount of
    underlying receivables. The Company continues to administer the
    collection of these receivables on behalf of the third party.

On April 24, 2009 the Company’s $50 million
    accounts receivable securitization facility matured and was
    repaid. On December 21, 2009 the Company entered into a new
    $50 million accounts receivable securitization facility.

On September 8, 2010 the Company amended the
    December 21, 2009 Receivable Purchase Agreement, which
    increased the accounts receivable securitization facility from
    $50 million to $80 million. This facility matures on
    December 21, 2012.

The Company was required to adopt amended ASC Topic 860,

“Accounting for Transfer of Financial Assets”

,
    on January 1, 2010. This adoption required the Company to
    reflect its receivable securitization facility in its financial
    statements in the current year of change. Accounting rules prior
    to January 1, 2010 allowed qualifying special-purpose
    entities off-balance sheet treatment. The impact of this
    adoption was an increase in receivables, net of $80 million
    and an increase in notes payable and other short-term debt of
    $80 million in the Company’s December 31, 2010
    Consolidated Balance Sheet.

During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, total
    cash proceeds from sales of accounts receivable were
    approximately $720 million and $250 million,
    respectively. The Company paid servicing fees related to these
    receivables for the year ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and
    2008 of $1.2 million, $0.4 million, and
    $1.9 million, respectively. These amounts are recorded in
    interest expense and finance charges in the Consolidated
    Statements of Operations.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost
    or market. Cost of U.S. inventories is determined by the

last-in,

first-out (“LIFO”) method, while the foreign
    operations use the

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) or average-cost methods. Inventory
    held by U.S. operations was $100.1 million and
    $81.2 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. Such inventories, if valued at current cost
    instead of LIFO, would have been greater by $13.2 million
    in 2010 and $11.6 million in 2009.

See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information on inventories.

Pre-production costs related to long-term supply arrangements

Engineering, research and development, and other design and
    development costs for products sold on long-term supply
    arrangements are expensed as incurred unless the Company has a
    contractual guarantee for reimbursement from the customer. Costs
    for molds, dies and other tools used to make products sold on
    long-term supply arrangements for which the Company either has
    title to the assets or has the non-cancelable right to use the
    assets during the term of the supply arrangement are capitalized
    in property, plant and equipment. Capitalized items specifically
    designed for a supply arrangement are amortized to cost of sales
    over the shorter of the term of the arrangement or over the
    estimated useful lives of the assets, typically 3 to
    5 years. Costs for molds, dies and other tools used to make
    products sold on long-term supply arrangements for which the
    Company has a contractual guarantee for lump sum reimbursement
    from the customer are capitalized in prepayments and other
    current assets.

Property, plant and equipment and depreciation

Property,
    plant and equipment are valued at cost less accumulated
    depreciation. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and renewals
    of relatively minor items are generally charged to expense as
    incurred. Renewals of significant items are capitalized.
    Depreciation is computed generally on a straight-line basis over
    the estimated useful lives of the assets. Useful lives for
    buildings range from 15 to 40 years and useful lives for
    machinery and equipment range from 3 to 12 years. For
    income tax purposes, accelerated methods of depreciation are
    generally used. The Company’s property, plant and equipment
    are all held for use at December 31, 2010 and 2009.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information on property, plant and equipment and
    depreciation.

Impairment of long-lived assets

The Company reviews the
    carrying value of its long-lived assets, whether held for use or
    disposal, including other amortizing intangible assets, when
    events and circumstances warrant such a review under ASC Topic
    360. A recoverability review is performed using the undiscounted
    cash flows if there is a triggering event. If the undiscounted
    cash flow test for recoverability identifies a possible
    impairment, management will perform a fair value analysis.
    Management determines fair value under ASC Topic 820 using the
    appropriate valuation technique of market, income or cost
    approach. If the carrying value of a long-lived asset is
    considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the
    amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset
    exceeds its fair value.

Management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and
    fair value assumptions are reasonable; however, changes in
    assumptions underlying these estimates could affect the
    evaluations. Long-lived assets held for sale are recorded at the
    lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.
    Significant judgments and estimates used by management when
    evaluating long-lived assets for impairment include: (i) an
    assessment as to whether an adverse event or circumstance has
    triggered the need for an impairment review; and
    (ii) undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset
    (iii) fair valuation of the asset.

See Note 17, “Restructuring” and Note 9
    “Fair Value Measurements”, to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for more information regarding the
    Company’s impairment of long-lived assets and a discussion
    of market-based measurements.

Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets

Under ASC Topic 350, goodwill and other indefinite-lived
    intangibles are not amortized; however, they must be tested for
    impairment at least annually or upon a triggering event. In the
    fourth quarter of each year, or when events and circumstances
    warrant such a review, the Company reviews the goodwill of all
    of its reporting units for impairment. The Company’s
    goodwill impairment review, under ASC Topic 350, requires the
    Company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the
    extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and
    growth rates. The fair value of the Company’s reporting
    units used in the determination of goodwill impairment is
    computed using the expected present value of associated future
    cash flows. The cash flows are estimated over a significant
    future period of time, which makes those estimates and
    assumptions subject to an even higher degree of uncertainty. The
    Company also utilizes market valuation models and other
    financial ratios, which require the Company to make certain
    assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those
    models to its assets and businesses. The Company believes that
    the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated
    fair values of each of its reporting units are reasonable. The
    Company recognized goodwill impairment of $156.8 million in
    the Engine segment in 2008.

A considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are
    required in performing the impairment tests. While no impairment
    existed at December 31, 2010, different assumptions and
    estimates could materially change the estimated fair values and
    therefore, change impairment charges.

See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information on goodwill and other indefinite-lived
    intangible assets.

Product warranty

The Company provides warranties on some
    of its products. The warranty terms are typically from one to
    three years. Provisions for estimated expenses related to
    product warranty are made at the time products are sold. These
    estimates are established using historical information about the
    nature, frequency, and average cost of warranty claim
    settlements as well as product manufacturing and industry
    developments and recoveries from third parties. Management
    actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to
    improve product quality and minimize warranty claims. Management
    believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate; however,
    actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates,
    requiring adjustments to the accrual. The accrual is represented
    in both current and non-current liabilities on the balance sheet.

Other loss accruals and valuation allowances

The Company
    has numerous other loss exposures, such as customer claims,
    workers’ compensation claims, litigation, and
    recoverability of assets. Establishing loss accruals or
    valuation allowances for these matters requires the use of
    estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and
    ultimate realization. The Company estimates losses under the
    programs using consistent and appropriate methods; however,
    changes to its assumptions could materially affect its recorded
    accrued liabilities for loss or asset valuation allowances.

Derivative financial instruments

The Company recognizes
    that certain normal business transactions generate risk.
    Examples of risks include exposure to exchange rate risk related
    to transactions denominated in currencies other than the
    functional currency, changes in cost of major raw materials and
    supplies, and changes in interest rates. It is the objective and
    responsibility of the Company to assess the impact of these
    transaction risks, and offer protection from selected risks
    through various methods including financial derivatives.
    Virtually all derivative instruments held by the Company are
    designated as hedges, have high correlation with the underlying
    exposure and are highly effective in offsetting underlying price
    movements. Accordingly, gains and losses from changes in
    qualifying hedge fair values are matched with the underlying
    transactions. All hedge instruments are carried at their fair
    value based on quoted market prices for contracts with similar
    maturities. The Company does not engage in any derivative
    transactions for purposes other than hedging specific risks.

See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information on derivative financial instruments.

Foreign currency

The financial statements of foreign
    subsidiaries are translated to U.S. Dollars using the
    period-end exchange rate for assets and liabilities and an
    average exchange rate for each period for revenues, expenses,
    and capital expenditures. The local currency is the functional
    currency for substantially all the Company’s foreign
    subsidiaries. Translation adjustments for foreign subsidiaries
    are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss) in stockholders’ equity. The Company
    recognizes transaction gains and losses arising from
    fluctuations in currency exchange rates on transactions
    denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in
    earnings as incurred, except for those transactions which hedge
    purchase commitments and for those intercompany balances which
    are designated as long-term investments.

See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information on other comprehensive income (loss).

Environmental Contingencies

The Company accounts for
    environmental costs in accordance with ASC Topic 450. Costs
    related to environmental assessments and remediation efforts at
    operating facilities are accrued when it is probable that a
    liability has been incurred and the amount of that liability can
    be reasonably estimated. Estimated costs are recorded at
    undiscounted amounts, based on experience and assessments and
    are regularly evaluated. The liabilities are recorded in other
    current liabilities and other long-term liabilities in the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information regarding environmental contingencies.

Pensions and Other Postretirement Employee Defined Benefits

The Company’s defined benefit pension and other
    postretirement employee benefit plans are accounted for in
    accordance with ASC Topic 715. Disability, early retirement and
    other postretirement employee benefits are accounted for in
    accordance with ASC Topic 712.

Pensions and other postretirement employee benefit costs and
    related liabilities and assets are dependent upon assumptions
    used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include
    discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, health care
    cost trends, compensation and other factors. In



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from the
    assumptions used are accumulated and amortized over future
    periods, and accordingly, generally affect recognized expense in
    future periods.

See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information regarding the Company’s retirement benefit
    plans.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income tax expense
    based on expected income and statutory tax rates in the various
    jurisdictions in which we operate. Judgment is required in
    determining our income tax expense. We establish accruals under
    ASC Topic 740. For uncertain tax positions, the ASC Topic 740
    approach is based on a two-step benefit recognition model. In
    the first step, ASC Topic 740 requires that a position taken or
    expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized in the
    financial statements when it is more likely than not, based on
    the technical merits and without consideration of detection
    risk, that the position will be sustained on audit, including
    resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
    The second step is to measure the appropriate amount of the
    benefit to recognize. The amount of benefit to recognize is
    measured as the largest amount of the tax benefit that is
    greater than 50 percent likely to ultimately be realized
    upon settlement. The tax position must be derecognized when it
    is no longer more likely than not to be sustained. The
    interpretation also provides guidance on recognition and
    classification of related penalties and interest, classification
    of liabilities, and disclosures of unrecognized tax benefits.

The Company’s effective tax rate includes the impact of
    accrual provisions and changes to accruals that we consider
    appropriate, as well as interest and penalties. A period of time
    may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have or have
    not established an accrual is audited and finally resolved.
    While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the
    timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe
    that our accruals are appropriate under GAAP. Favorable or
    unfavorable adjustments of an accrual for any particular issue
    would be recognized as an increase or decrease to our income tax
    expense in the period of a change in facts and circumstances.

Tax laws require items to be included in the tax return at
    different times than the items are reflected in the financial
    statements. As a result, the income tax expense reflected in our
    financial statements is different than the liability reported in
    our tax return. Some of the differences are permanent in nature,
    however, there are many differences that are temporary
    differences, such as depreciation expense. Deferred tax assets
    and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
    attributable to differences between financial statement carrying
    amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
    tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
    Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
    tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in
    which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered
    or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce
    deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such
    assets may not be realized. This assessment requires significant
    judgment, and must be done on a

jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction

basis. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, all
    available positive and negative evidence, including historical
    and projected financial performance, is considered along with
    any other pertinent information.

See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information regarding income taxes.

New Accounting
    Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB ASC amended Topic 820,

Fair Value
    Measurements and Disclosures

. ASC Topic 820 defines fair
    value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP
    and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. On
    January 1, 2009, the Company fully adopted as required, ASC
    Topic 820. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for more information regarding the implementation of
    ASC Topic 820.

In February 2007, the FASB ASC amended Topic 825,

Financial
    Instruments

. ASC Topic 825 allows entities to irrevocably
    elect to recognize most financial assets and financial
    liabilities at fair value on an

instrument-by-instrument

basis. The stated objective of ASC Topic 825 is to improve
    financial reporting by



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

giving entities the opportunity to elect to measure certain
    financial assets and liabilities at fair value in order to
    mitigate earnings volatility caused when related assets and
    liabilities are measured differently. ASC Topic 825 was
    effective for the Company beginning with its quarter ending
    March 31, 2008. The Company chose to not make the election
    to adopt.

In December 2007, the FASB ASC amended Topic 805,

Business
    Combinations

. ASC Topic 805 establishes principles and
    requirements for recognizing identifiable assets acquired,
    liabilities assumed, noncontrolling interest in the acquiree,
    goodwill acquired in the combination or the gain from a bargain
    purchase, and disclosure requirements. Under this revised
    statement, all costs incurred to effect an acquisition are
    recognized separately from the acquisition. Also, restructuring
    costs that are expected but the acquirer is not obligated to
    incur are recognized separately from the acquisition. On
    January 1, 2009, the Company adopted ASC Topic 805. In the
    first quarter of 2009, the Company expensed $4.8 million
    related to on-going acquisition related activity.

In December 2007, the FASB ASC amended Topic 810,

Consolidation

. For consolidated subsidiaries that are
    less than wholly owned, the third party holdings of equity
    interests are referred to as noncontrolling interests. The
    portion of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling
    interests for such subsidiaries is presented as net income
    (loss) applicable to noncontrolling interest on the consolidated
    statement of operation, and the portion of stockholders’
    equity of such subsidiaries is presented as noncontrolling
    interest on the consolidated balance sheet. Effective
    January 1, 2009, the Company adopted ASC Topic 810.

The adoption of ASC Topic 810 did not have a material impact on
    the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or
    cash flows. However, it did impact the presentation and
    disclosure of noncontrolling (minority) interests in our
    consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated
    financial statements. As a result of the retrospective
    presentation and disclosure requirements of ASC Topic 810, the
    Company was required to reflect the change in presentation and
    disclosure for the period ending March 31, 2009 and all
    periods presented in future filings.

    the adoption of ASC Topic 810 is summarized as follows:

In March 2008, the FASB ASC amended Topic 815,

Derivatives
    and Hedging

. ASC Topic 815 requires entities to provide
    enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative
    instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items
    are accounted for under ASC Topic 815 and its related
    interpretations, and how derivative instruments and related
    hedged items affect an entity’s financial position,
    financial performance, and cash flows. On January 1, 2009,
    the Company adopted ASC Topic 815. See Note 10 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding
    the implementation of ASC Topic 815.

In May 2008, the FASB ASC amended Topic 470,

Debt

. Under
    ASC Topic 470, an entity must separately account for the
    liability and equity components of the convertible debt
    instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash
    upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer’s
    interest cost. ASC Topic 470 is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008, and for interim periods
    within those fiscal years, with retrospective application
    required. As a result of our adoption of ASC Topic 470 for
    fiscal 2009 and the Company’s April 9, 2009 issuance
    of $373.8 million convertible senior notes due
    April 15, 2012, we recorded the equity and liability
    components of the notes on our December 31, 2009
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additionally, ASC Topic 470 requires
    us to accrete the discounted carrying value of the convertible
    notes to their face value over the term of the notes. The
    Company’s interest expense associated with this
    amortization is based on the effective interest rate of the
    convertible senior notes of 9.365%. See Note 8 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding
    the implementation of ASC Topic 470.

In December 2008, the FASB ASC amended Topic 715,

Compensation — Retirement Benefits

. ASC Topic
    715 requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures about how
    investment allocation decisions are made, the major categories
    of plan assets, the inputs and valuation techniques used to
    measure fair value of plan assets, the effect of fair value
    measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in
    plan assets for the period, and significant concentrations of
    risk within plan assets. See Note 9 and Note 11 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding
    the implementation of ASC Topic 715.

In June 2009, the FASB ASC amended Topic 860,

“Accounting for Transfer of Financial Assets”

.
    ASC Topic 860 removes the concept of a qualifying
    special-purpose entity and removes the exception from applying
    ASC Topic 810, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, to
    qualifying special-purpose entities. This Statement modifies the
    financial-components approach used in ASC Topic 860 and limits
    the circumstances in which a financial asset, or portion of a
    financial asset, should be derecognized. Additionally, enhanced
    disclosures are required to provide financial statement users
    with greater transparency about transfers of financial assets
    and a transferor’s continuing involvement with transferred
    financial assets. On January 1, 2010, the Company elected
    to prospectively adopt ASC Topic 860. The impact of this
    adoption is an increase in receivables, net of $80 million
    and an increase in notes payable and other short-term debt of
    $80 million in the Company’s December 31, 2010
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 1 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for more information on the implementation
    of ASC Topic 860.

In June 2009, the FASB amended ASC Topic 810,
    “

Consolidation”

. ASC Topic 810 requires an
    ongoing reassessment of whether an enterprise is the primary
    beneficiary of a variable interest entity. Additionally, ASC
    Topic 810 requires enhanced disclosures that will provide users
    of financial statements with more transparent information about
    an enterprise’s involvement in variable interest entities.
    On January 1, 2010, the Company adopted ASC Topic 810. The
    adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s financial statements.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In June 2009, the FASB ASC amended Topic 105, “

Generally
    Accepted Accounting Principles”

. This ASC Topic
    instituted a major change in the way accounting standards are
    organized. The accounting standards Codification became the
    single official source of authoritative, nongovernmental GAAP.
    As of September 30, 2009 only one level of authoritative
    GAAP exists, other than guidance issued by the SEC. All other
    literature is non-authoritative. The Company adopted the
    Codification in the third quarter of 2009. The adoption of the
    Codification had no impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate
    for 2010 of 17.1% compared with rates of (103.4)% in 2009 and
    237.9% in 2008.

In the first quarter of 2010, the Patient Protection and
    Affordable Care Act (PPACA) was signed into law. In addition,
    the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010
    (“the Reconciliation Act”) was also passed, amending
    certain portions of the PPACA. The PPACA contains a provision
    eliminating tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to
    the extent of federal subsidies received by plan sponsors who
    provide retiree prescription drug benefits equivalent to
    Medicare Part D coverage. However, based upon the changes
    made in the Reconciliation Act, the tax benefit related to the
    Medicare Part D subsidies will be extended until
    December 31, 2012. For all tax years ending after
    December 31, 2012 there will no longer be a tax benefit for
    the Medicare Part D subsidies. Therefore, the impact to the
    Company for the loss of this future tax benefit (after
    December 31, 2012) was an additional tax expense of
    approximately $2.9 million in 2010.

The provision for income taxes for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 included a favorable impact of
    $21.2 million from the reversal of the Company’s
    valuation allowance on U.S. based foreign tax credit
    carryforwards. The improving financial performance of the
    Company’s U.S. operations has resulted in greater
    certainty that the Company will be able to fully utilize
    existing foreign tax credit carryforwards.

The Company’s annual effective tax rate for 2010 is 17.1%
    which includes the impact of the reversal of the Company’s
    valuation allowance on U.S. based foreign tax credit
    carryforwards, the change in tax legislation related to Medicare
    Part D subsidies, the additional tax expense associated
    with the BERU-Eichenauer equity investment gain and the tax
    benefit associated with the Company’s environmental
    litigation settlement. This rate differs from the
    U.S. statutory rate primarily due to foreign rates, which
    differ from those in the U.S., the realization of certain
    business tax credits including foreign tax credits and favorable
    permanent differences between book and tax treatment for items,
    including equity in affiliates’ earnings.

    total represents the amount that, if recognized, would affect
    the Company’s effective income tax rate in future periods.
    This amount differs from the gross unrecognized tax benefits

The other non-current assets and liabilities have been netted
    within their respective taxing jurisdictions due to
    consolidation (primarily U.S. and Germany).

The deferred income taxes — current assets are
    primarily comprised of amounts from the U.S., France, Italy,
    Japan, Spain and the U.K. The deferred income taxes —
    current liabilities are primarily comprised of amounts from
    Germany. The other non-current assets are primarily comprised of
    amounts from the U.S.. The other non-current liabilities are
    primarily comprised of amounts from France, Germany, Italy,
    Spain and the U.K.

At December 31, 2010, the Company has a U.S. net
    operating loss carryforward of $1.6 million that is
    available to offset future taxable income. This loss
    carryforward expires in 2030. Certain

non-U.S. subsidiaries

have net operating loss carryforwards totaling
    $69.5 million that are available to offset future taxable
    income. Carryforwards of $29.7 million expire at various
    dates from 2011 through 2019 and the balance has no expiration
    date. A valuation allowance of $6.5 million has been
    recorded for the tax effect on $26.3 million of the loss
    carryforwards. Certain U.S. subsidiaries have state net
    operating loss carryforwards totaling $510.3 million which
    are completely offset by a valuation allowance due to risk of
    realization. Certain

non-U.S. subsidiaries

located in China, Korea and Poland have tax exemptions or tax
    holidays. The cumulative impact of these tax exemptions or tax
    holidays was a reduction of tax expense of approximately
    $17.0 million in 2010.

No deferred income taxes have been provided on the excess of the
    amount for financial reporting over the tax basis of investments
    in foreign subsidiaries or foreign equity affiliates totaling
    $1,574.6 million in 2010, as these amounts are essentially
    permanent in nature. The excess amount will become taxable upon
    repatriation of assets, sale, or liquidation of the investment.
    It is not practicable to determine the unrecognized deferred tax
    liability on the excess amount because the actual tax liability
    on the excess amount, if any, is dependent on circumstances
    existing when remittance occurs.

Interest costs capitalized during 2010 and 2009 were
    $11.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2010
    and December 31, 2009, accounts payable of
    $28.9 million and $28.6 million, respectively, were
    related to property, plant and equipment purchases. As of
    December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, specific
    assets of $3.4 million and $3.7 million, respectively,
    were pledged as collateral under certain of the Company’s
    long-term debt agreements.

As a result of the impairment charges recorded in the third and
    fourth quarters of 2008, depreciation expense for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 was reduced by approximately
    $9 million and $11 million, respectively.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The automotive industry experienced unprecedented declines in
    production in the fourth quarter of 2008 and projected continued
    declines for the full year of 2009. According to Accounting
    Standards Codification (“ASC”) 250, future
    depreciation expense should be revised due to a change in the
    estimated future benefits inherent in an asset, the pattern of
    consumption of those benefits, or the information available to
    the entity about those benefits. As a result of the 2008 and
    2009 unprecedented declines in production activity, the Company
    determined that its usage pattern for certain assets had changed
    significantly and revised the useful lives of certain equipment
    starting in 2009. This adjustment was considered to be a change
    in an accounting estimate.

NOTE 6

GOODWILL AND
    OTHER INTANGIBLES

The Company annually reviews its goodwill for impairment in the
    fourth quarter of each year for all of its reporting units, or
    more often when events and circumstances warrant such a review.

The Company’s goodwill impairment review, under ASC Topic
    350, requires the Company to make significant assumptions and
    estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows,
    discount rates and growth rates. The basis of our goodwill
    impairment analysis is the Company’s annual budget and
    long-range plan (“LRP”). The annual budget and LRP
    include a five year projection of future cash flows based on
    actual new products and customer commitments. As part of the
    projection, we assumed the last year of the LRP data is a fair
    indication of the future performance, including fundamental
    industry growth for the business beyond the five year period
    into perpetuity. As the LRP is estimated over a significant
    future period of time, those estimates and assumptions are
    subject to a high degree of uncertainty. We also utilize market
    valuation models and other financial ratios, which require us to
    make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the
    applicability of those models to our assets and businesses. We
    believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the
    estimated fair values of each of our reporting units are
    reasonable. Different assumptions could materially affect the
    estimated fair value. The primary assumptions affecting the
    Company’s December 31, 2010 goodwill impairment review
    are as follows:

•

Discount Rate: The Company used a 10% weighted average cost of
    capital (“WACC”) as the discount rate for future cash
    flows. The WACC is intended to represent a rate of return that
    would be expected by a market participant.

•

Operating Income Margin: The Company utilized historical and
    expected operating income margins, which varied based on the
    projections of each reporting unit being evaluated.

In addition to the above significant assumptions, the Company
    notes the following risk to volume assumptions that could have
    an impact on the discounted cash flow model:

•

Our industry is cyclical and our results of operations will be
    adversely affected by industry downturns.

•

We are dependent on market segments that use our key products
    and would be affected by decreasing demand in those segments.

•

We are subject to risks related to our international operations.

Using the assumptions outlined above, the impairment testing
    conducted in the fourth quarter of 2010 indicated that goodwill
    was not impaired in any reporting unit tested.

The estimated fair value of one reporting unit tested within the
    Engine operating segment was 112% of its carrying value. Based
    on our sensitivity analysis, a 1% increase in the discount rate
    or a 1% decrease in the operating margin assumptions would
    result in the carrying value exceeding the estimated fair value,
    which would require further evaluation of the reporting
    unit’s goodwill. This reporting unit had approximately
    $165 million of goodwill at December 31, 2010.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In 2008 the Company recorded impairment charges totaling
    €111.5 ($156.8) million to adjust BERU’s goodwill
    to its estimated fair value. The impairment charge is
    attributable to a decrease in the operating unit’s
    estimated fair value based primarily upon the effect of the
    decline in European market conditions on current and projected
    operating results. The impairment charge was also impacted by
    the recognition of additional goodwill in the second quarter of
    2008, which was based on the court determined buy out value of
    €71.32 per share related to the Domination and Profit
    Transfer Agreement. Any differences in future results compared
    to management’s estimates could result in fair values
    different from estimated fair values, which could materially
    impact the Company’s future results of operations and
    financial condition.

See Note 18, “Recent Transactions”, for further
    discussion on the BERU Domination and Profit Transfer Agreement.

On June 2, 2009, the Company announced the purchase of
    advanced gasoline ignition technology and related intellectual
    property from Florida-based Etatech, Inc. In connection with ASC
    amended Topic 805,

Business Combinations,

the Company
    capitalized $13.1 million of in-process R&D. The
    Company intends to commercialize a high-frequency ignition
    system based on Etatech technology in the next five years.
    Amortization of the $13.1 million of in-process R&D
    will coincide with the commercial application of the technology.

On April 10, 2010, the Company acquired 100% of Dytech ENSA
    S.L. (“Dytech”), headquartered in Vigo, Spain. In
    connection with this acquisition, the Company capitalized
    $15.6 million for customer relationships,
    $15.7 million for unpatented technology, $9.0 million
    for trade names and $0.3 million in other miscellaneous
    intangible assets. Customer relationships, unpatented technology
    and miscellaneous intangible assets will be amortized over 8, 15
    and 3 year useful life, respectively. Trade names will not
    be amortized.

On May 1 2010, the Company completed the acquisition of
    BERU-Eichenauer GmbH by acquiring the shares of its former joint
    venture partner, Eichenauer Heizelemente GmbH & Co.
    KG. In connection with this acquisition, the Company capitalized
    $14.4 million in intangible assets related to adjusting the
    Company’s fifty percent investment to fair value under ASC
    Topic 805.

    $80 million and an increase in notes payable and other
    short-term debt of $80 million in

    for more information regarding the Company’s first quarter
    2010 adoption of ASC Topic 860.

(b)

In 2006, the Company entered into several interest rate swaps
    that had the effect of converting $325.0 million of fixed
    rate notes to variable rates. In the first quarter of 2009,
    $100 million in interest rate swaps related to the
    Company’s 2009 fixed rate debt matured, and the Company
    terminated $150 million in interest rate swap agreements
    related to the Company’s 2016 fixed rate debt and
    $75 million of interest rate swap agreements related to the
    Company’s 2019 fixed rate debt. As a result of the first
    quarter 2009 swap terminations, a $34.5 million gain
    remained in debt and is being amortized over the remaining lives
    of the respective 2016 and 2019 debt. As of December 31,
    2010 and 2009, the unamortized portion was $27.8 million
    and $31.4 million, respectively.

The Company’s long-term debt includes various financial
    covenants, none of which are expected to restrict future
    operations.

On March 31, 2010, the Company replaced its
    $250 million multi-currency revolving credit facility with
    a new $550 million multi-currency revolving credit
    facility, which includes a feature that allows the Company to
    increase its borrowings to $600 million. The new facility
    provides for borrowings through March 31, 2013, and is
    guaranteed by the Company’s domestic subsidiaries. The
    Company has three key financial covenants as part of the credit
    agreement. These covenants are a net worth test, a debt compared
    to EBITDA (“Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation
    and Amortization”) test, and an interest coverage test. The
    Company was in compliance with all covenants at
    December 31, 2010 and expects to remain compliant in future
    periods. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009
    there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities.

On September 16, 2010, the Company issued $250 million
    in 4.625% senior notes due 2020. Interest is payable
    semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year,
    beginning on March 15, 2011. The senior notes were issued
    under the Company’s $750 million universal shelf
    registration filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
    leaving approximately $126 million available as of
    December 31, 2010.

On April 9, 2009, the Company issued $373.8 million in
    convertible senior notes due April 15, 2012. Under ASC
    Topic 470,

“Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments
    That May be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial
    Cash Settlement)”

, the Company must account for the
    convertible senior notes by bifurcating the instruments between
    their liability and equity components. The value of the debt
    component is based on the fair value of issuing a similar
    nonconvertible debt security. The equity component of the
    convertible debt security is calculated by deducting the value
    of the liability from the proceeds received at issuance. The
    Company’s December 31, 2010 Consolidated Balance Sheet
    includes debt of $348.5 million and capital in excess of
    par of $36.5 million. Additionally, ASC Topic 470 requires
    the Company to accrete the



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

discounted carrying value of the convertible notes to their face
    value over the term of the notes. The Company’s interest
    expense associated with this amortization is based on the
    effective interest rate of the convertible senior notes of
    9.365%. The total interest expense related to the convertible
    notes in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations
    for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was as
    follows:

(millions of dollars)

The notes will pay interest semi-annually of $6.5 million,
    which is at a coupon rate of 3.50% per year.

Holders of the notes may convert their notes at their option at
    any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled
    trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the
    notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount. The initial
    conversion rate for the notes is 30.4706 shares of the
    Company’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes
    (representing an initial conversion price of approximately
    $32.82 per share of common stock). The conversion price
    represents a conversion premium of 27.50% over the last reported
    sale price of the Company’s common stock on the New York
    Stock Exchange on April 6, 2009, of $25.74 per share. Since
    the Company’s stock price was above the convertible senior
    notes conversion price of $32.82 as of December 31, 2010,
    the if-converted value was approximately $450.2 million and
    $4.6 million higher than the face value of the convertible
    senior notes at December 31, 2010 and December 31,
    2009, respectively. In conjunction with the note offering, the
    Company entered into a bond hedge overlay at a net pre-tax cost
    of $25.2 million, effectively raising the conversion
    premium to 50.0%, or approximately $38.61 per share. Upon
    conversion, the Company will pay or deliver cash, shares of our
    common stock or a combination thereof at our election. The
    convertible senior notes were issued under the Company’s
    $750 million universal shelf registration filed with the
    Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the estimated fair values
    of the Company’s senior unsecured notes totaled
    $1,482.3 million and $776.0 million, respectively. The
    estimated fair values were $483.7 million higher and
    $43.3 million higher at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively than their carrying values. Fair market values are
    developed by the use of estimates obtained from brokers and
    other appropriate valuation techniques based on information
    available as of quarter-end and year-end. The fair value
    estimates do not necessarily reflect the values the Company
    could realize in the current markets.

The Company had outstanding letters of credit at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 of $26.5 million and
    $15.2 million, respectively. The letters of credit
    typically act as a guarantee of payment to certain third parties
    in accordance with specified terms and conditions.

NOTE 9

FAIR VALUE
    MEASUREMENTS

On January 1, 2009, the Company fully adopted as required,
    ASC Topic 820 — “Fair Value Measurements”
    which expands the disclosure of fair value measurements and its
    impact on the Company’s financial statements.

ASC Topic 820 emphasizes that fair value is a market-based
    measurement, not an entity specific measurement. Therefore, a
    fair value measurement should be determined based on assumptions
    that market participants would use in pricing an asset or
    liability. As a basis for considering market participant
    assumptions in fair value measurements, ASC Topic 820
    establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs
    used in measuring fair values as follows:

Level 1:

Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;

Level 2:

Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are
    observable either directly or indirectly; and



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Level 3:

Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data,
    which require the reporting entity to develop its own
    assumptions.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are based on one
    or more of the following three valuation techniques noted in ASC
    Topic 820:

A.

Market approach: Prices and other relevant information generated
    by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets
    or liabilities.

B.

Cost approach: Amount that would be required to replace the
    service capacity of an asset (replacement cost).

C.

Income approach: Techniques to convert future amounts to a
    single present amount based upon market expectations (including
    present value techniques, option-pricing and excess earnings
    models).

NOTE 10

FINANCIAL
    INSTRUMENTS

On January 1, 2009, the Company adopted as required, ASC
    Topic 815, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and
    Hedging Activities” which expands the disclosure of
    financial instruments.

The Company’s financial instruments include cash and
    marketable securities. Due to the short-term nature of these
    instruments, their book value approximates their fair value. The
    Company’s financial instruments also include long-term
    debt, interest rate and currency swaps, commodity forward
    contracts, and foreign currency forward contracts. All
    derivative contracts are placed with counterparties that have an
    S&P, or equivalent, investment grade credit rating at the
    time of the contracts’ placement. At December 31, 2010
    and 2009 the Company had no derivative contracts that contained
    credit risk related contingent features.

The Company selectively uses cross-currency swaps to hedge the
    foreign currency exposure associated with our net investment in
    certain foreign operations (net investment hedges). Fair values
    of cross currency swaps are based on observable inputs, such as
    interest rate, yield curves, credit risks, currency exchange
    rates and other external valuation methodology (Level 2
    inputs under ASC Topic 820).

At December 31, 2010 and 2009 the following cross-currency

In 2006, the Company entered into a series of interest rate
    swaps designated as fair value hedges of a portion of its senior
    notes. In the first quarter of 2009 the company terminated
    interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of debt.
    Therefore, the basis adjustments of $34.5 million present
    at the termination of the hedging relationship are being
    amortized over the remaining life of the respective debt
    maturing in 2016 and 2019. The $30.0 million cash received
    related to the termination of these interest rate swaps is
    included in the Financing section of the Statement of Cash
    Flows. The Company recognized $5.7 million in interest
    expense in the first quarter of 2009 as a result of the early
    termination. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were
    no outstanding fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements.

Effectiveness for cash flow, fair value and net investment
    hedges is assessed at the inception of the hedging relationship
    and quarterly, thereafter. To the extent that derivative
    instruments are deemed to be effective as defined by ASC Topic
    815, gains and losses arising from these contracts are deferred
    in other comprehensive income or loss (OCI). Such gains and
    losses will be reclassified into income as the underlying
    operating transactions are realized. Gains and losses not
    qualifying for deferral treatment have been credited/charged to
    income as they are recognized.

The table below shows deferred gains and losses at the end of
    the period reported in OCI and amounts expected to be
    reclassified to income or loss within the next twelve months.
    The OCI gain or loss expected to be reclassified to income or
    loss in one year or less assumes no change in the current
    relationship of the hedged item at December 31, 2010 market
    rates.

Net investment hedges are derivative contracts entered into to
    hedge against changes in exchange rates that affect the overall
    value of net investments in foreign entities. Gains and losses
    on net investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive
    income or loss and are used to offset equivalent gains or losses
    in the value of net investments that are recorded in translation
    gains and losses which is also a component of other
    comprehensive income or loss.

NOTE 11

RETIREMENT
    BENEFIT PLANS

The Company sponsors various defined contribution savings plans
    primarily in the U.S. that allow employees to contribute a
    portion of their pre-tax

and/or

after-tax income in accordance with plan specified guidelines.
    Under specified conditions, the Company will make contributions
    to the plans

and/or

match
    a percentage of the employee contributions up to certain limits.
    Total expense related to the defined contribution plans was
    $19.2 million, $16.6 million and $22.1 million in
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The Company has a number of defined benefit pension plans and
    other post employment benefit plans covering eligible salaried
    and hourly employees and their dependents. The defined pension
    benefits provided are primarily based on (i) years of
    service and (ii) average compensation or a monthly
    retirement benefit amount. The Company provides defined benefit
    pension plans in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Japan, South Korea,
    Italy, France, Ireland, Monaco and Mexico. The other post
    employment benefit plans, which provide medical and life
    insurance benefits, are unfunded plans. All pension and other
    post employment benefit plans in the U.S. have been closed
    to new employees since 1999. The measurement date for all plans
    is December 31.

In September 2008 and 2007, the Company made changes to its
    U.S. retiree medical program that impact certain union and
    non-union active employees with a future retiree benefit and
    current retirees participating in a health care plan. The effect
    of the changes to both groups is that most members will pay a
    higher percentage of the annual premium for Company-sponsored
    retiree medical coverage between retirement and age 65, and
    neither group will receive Company-sponsored Medicare health
    plan coverage once entitled to Medicare. Instead, certain active
    employees received a lump sum credit into a non-contributory
    cash balance pension plan earning interest each year. Current
    retirees receive an annual per member allowance toward the
    purchase of individual Medicare health plan coverage and for
    reimbursement of healthcare

out-of-pocket

expenses.

On February 26, 2009, the Company’s subsidiary,
    BorgWarner Diversified Transmission Products Inc.
    (“DTP”), entered into a Plant Shutdown Agreement with
    the United Auto Workers (“UAW”) for its Muncie,
    Indiana automotive component plant (the “Muncie
    Plant”). Management subsequently wound-down production
    activity at the plant, with operations effectively ceased as of
    March 31, 2009. As a result of the closure of the Muncie
    Plant, the Company recorded a curtailment gain of
    $41.9 million in the other post employment benefit plan in
    the first quarter of 2009.

The Plant Shutdown Agreement with the UAW for the Muncie Plant
    also included a settlement of a portion of the UAW retiree
    health care obligation, resulting in the remeasurement of the
    retiree medical plan. The financial impact of this settlement
    resulted in expense recognition of $14.0 million, a
    $47.2 million reduction to retirement-related liabilities,
    a $27.2 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive
    income and a $34.0 million increase in accounts payable and
    accrued expenses in the first quarter of 2009. The
    $34.0 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses was
    paid in monthly installments, which began in May 2009 and
    concluded in April 2010.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The combined pre-tax impact of these actions was a net gain of
    $27.9 million, comprised of a $41.9 million
    curtailment gain and $14.0 million settlement loss in the
    first quarter of 2009.

In April 2009, the Company made changes to certain Muncie
    retirees medical program. The effect of the changes to this
    group is that members will pay a higher percentage of the annual
    premium for Company-sponsored retiree medical coverage from
    retirement to age 65, and the group will not receive
    Company-sponsored Medicare Supplemental coverage once entitled
    to Medicare. Consistent with the majority of other
    U.S. BorgWarner retiree medical plans, retirees will
    receive an annual per member allowance toward the purchase of
    individual Medicare health plan coverage and for reimbursement
    of healthcare

out-of-pocket

expenses. The financial impact of this change was a
    $22.2 million reduction to retirement-related liabilities
    and a $22.2 million increase in accumulated other
    comprehensive income.

In June 2009, the Company announced its plan to freeze its
    defined benefit plan at its Bradford plant in the United Kingdom
    in consultation with affected employees and their
    representatives. The effect of this change was that participants
    in the Bradford defined benefit plan ceased to accrue defined
    benefits after October 31, 2009. Future pension benefits
    will be earned within an existing defined contribution plan
    going forward. The financial impact of this change was a
    $3.7 million reduction to retirement-related liabilities, a
    $3.5 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive
    income and $0.2 million in income recognition in the second
    quarter of 2009.

On March 24, 2010, the Company finalized its settlement
    agreement regarding the closure of the Muncie Plant with the
    Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation in which the Company will
    make certain payments directly to the Muncie Plant’s
    defined benefit pension plan (the “Plan”). On
    December 23, 2009 the Company made an initial cash
    contribution of $23 million for the 2009 Plan year,
    consistent with the settlement agreement. Also under the
    settlement agreement for each of the Plan years beginning in
    2011, 2012, and 2013, the Company will make a cash contribution
    to the Plan in the amount of $15 million, unless this
    contribution exceeds the maximum amounts deductible under the
    applicable U.S. tax regulations. The Company provided
    $35 million in the form of a surety bond and will waive a
    credit balance valued at $8 million in 2014.

    Company’s defined contribution and defined benefit pension

The Company’s investment strategy is to maintain actual
    asset weightings within a preset range of target allocations.
    The Company believes these ranges represent an appropriate risk
    profile for the planned benefit payments of the plans based on
    the timing of the estimated benefit payments. Within each asset
    category, separate portfolios are maintained for additional
    diversification. Investment managers are retained within each
    asset category to manage each portfolio against its benchmark.
    Each investment manager has appropriate investment guidelines.
    In addition, the entire portfolio is evaluated against a
    relevant peer group. The defined benefit pension plans did not
    hold any Company securities as investments as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009. A portion of pension assets are
    invested in common and comingled trusts.

The Company expects to contribute a total of $30 million to
    $40 million into its defined benefit pension plans during
    2011, including $15 million related to the Company’s
    settlement agreement with the PBGC discussed above.
    $23.2 million of the $30 million to $40 million
    in 2011 contributions are contractually obligated, while the
    remaining payments are discretionary.

Refer to Note 9, “Fair Value Measurements”, for
    more detail surrounding the fair value of each major category of
    plan assets as well as the inputs and valuation techniques used
    to develop the fair value measurements of the plan’s assets
    at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Note: In the year ended December 31, 2009, the other post
    employment benefits settlement/curtailment of
    $61.9 million, in the table above, was offset by a
    $34.0 million cost to settle, resulting in a net pre-tax
    gain of $27.9 million. Excluding the $61.9 million
    settlement/curtailment gain, the Company’s 2009 other post
    employment benefit expense was $13.5 million.

The estimated net loss for the defined benefit pension plans
    that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss) into net periodic benefit cost over the next
    fiscal year is $7.2 million. The estimated net loss and
    prior service credit for the other post employment plans that
    will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss) into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year
    are $8.0 million and $(6.9) million, respectively.

The Company’s weighted-average assumptions used to
    determine the benefit obligations for its defined benefit
    pension and other post employment plans as of December 31,

The Company’s approach to establishing the discount rate is
    based upon the market yields of high-quality corporate bonds,
    with appropriate consideration of each plan’s defined
    benefit payment terms and duration of the liabilities. The
    discount rate assumption is typically rounded up or down to the
    nearest 25 basis points for each plan.

The Company determines its expected return on plan asset
    assumptions by evaluating estimates of future market returns and
    the plans’ asset allocation. The Company also considers the
    impact of active management of the plans’ invested assets.
    The Company’s expected return on assets assumption reflects
    the asset allocation of each plan. The Company’s assumed
    long-term rate of return on assets for its U.S. pension
    plans was 7.50% for 2010 and 2009 and 8.75% for 2008. The
    Company’s assumed long-term rate of return on assets for
    its U.K. pension plan was 7.50% for 2010 and 2009 and 7.25% for
    2008.

    post employment benefits are as follows:

    the Company’s common stock at the fair market value on the
    date of grant. The options vest over periods up to three years
    and have a term of ten years from date of grant. As of
    December 31, 2003, there were no options available for
    future grants under the 1993 Plan. The 1993 Plan expired at the
    end of 2003 and was replaced by the Company’s 2004 Stock
    Incentive Plan, which was amended at the Company’s 2009
    Annual Stockholders Meeting, among other things, to increase the
    number of shares available for issuance under the Plan. Under
    the BorgWarner Inc. Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive
    Plan (“2004 Stock Incentive Plan”), the number of
    shares authorized for grant was 12,500,000, of which
    approximately 2,200,000 shares are available for future
    issuance. As of December 31, 2010, there were a total of
    3,253,181 outstanding options under the 1993 and 2004 Stock
    Incentive Plans.

Restricted Stock

At its November 2007 meeting, our
    Compensation Committee decided that restricted common stock and
    stock units would be awarded in place of stock options for
    long-term incentive award grants to employees. These restricted
    shares and units for employees vest fifty percent after two
    years and the remainder after three years from the date of
    grant. The Company also grants restricted common stock to its
    non-employee directors. For non-employee directors restricted
    shares generally vest ratably on the anniversary of the date of
    the grant over a period of three years. The market value of the
    Company’s restricted common stock and stock units at the
    date of grant determines the value of the restricted common
    stock. In February 2010, 570,954 restricted shares and units
    were granted to employees under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan.
    In April 2010, 19,440 restricted shares were granted to
    non-employee directors under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan. The
    value of the awards is recorded as unearned compensation within
    capital in excess of par value in stockholders’ equity, and
    is amortized as compensation expense over the restriction
    periods.

Restricted stock compensation expense reduced earnings before
    income taxes and noncontrolling interest and net earnings for
    the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 by:

Performance Share Plans

The 2004 Stock Incentive Plan
    provides for awarding of performance shares to members of senior
    management at the end of successive three-year periods based on
    the Company’s performance in terms of total shareholder
    return relative to a peer group of automotive companies. Awards
    earned are generally payable 40% in cash and 60% in the
    Company’s common stock.

The Company recognizes compensation expense for the 40% cash
    component and 60% stock component ratably over the performance
    period. Compensation expense for the 60% stock component is
    based on the performance shares fair value at the date of grant.
    This fair value is calculated using a lattice model (Monte Carlo
    simulation). The compensation expense for the 40% cash component
    is based on quarterly marking to market the cash liability. The
    amounts expensed under the plan and the share issuances for the
    three-year measurement periods ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008 were as follows:

CONTINGENCIES

In the normal course of business the Company and its
    subsidiaries are parties to various commercial and legal claims,
    actions and complaints, including matters involving warranty
    claims, intellectual property claims, general liability and
    various other risks. It is not possible to predict with
    certainty whether or not the Company and its subsidiaries will
    ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal
    matters or, if not, what the impact might be. The Company’s
    environmental and product liability contingencies are discussed
    separately below. The Company’s management does not expect
    that the results in any of these commercial and legal claims,
    actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect on
    the Company’s results of operations, financial position or
    cash flows.

Litigation

In January 2006, DTP, a subsidiary of the Company, filed a
    declaratory judgment action in United States District Court,
    Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis Division) against the
    United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implements
    Workers of America (“UAW”) Local No. 287 and
    Gerald Poor, individually and as the representative of a
    defendant class. DTP sought the Court’s affirmation that
    DTP did not violate the Labor-Management Relations Act or the
    Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) by unilaterally
    amending certain medical plans effective April 1, 2006 and
    October 1, 2006, prior to the expiration of the
    then-current collective bargaining agreements. On
    September 10, 2008, the Court found that DTP’s
    reservation of the right to make such amendments reducing the
    level of benefits provided to retirees was limited by its
    collectively bargained health insurance agreement with the UAW,
    which did not expire until April 24, 2009. Thus, the
    amendments were untimely. In 2008 the Company recorded a charge
    of $4.0 million as a result of the Court’s decision.

DTP filed a declaratory judgment action in the United States
    District Court, Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis
    Division) against the UAW Local No. 287 and Jim Barrett and
    others, individually and as representatives of a defendant
    class, on February 26, 2009 again seeking the Court’s
    affirmation that DTP will not violate the Labor —
    Management Relations Act or ERISA by modifying the level of
    benefits provided retirees to make them comparable to other
    Company retiree benefit plans after April 24, 2009. Certain
    retirees, on behalf of themselves and others, filed a
    mirror-image action in the United States District Court, Eastern
    District of Michigan (Southern Division) on March 11, 2009,
    for which a class has been certified. During the last quarter of
    2009 the action pending in Indiana was dismissed, while the
    action in Michigan is continuing and in the discovery phase. The
    Company is vigorously defending against the suit. This
    contingency is subject to many uncertainties, therefore based on
    the information available to date, the Company cannot estimate
    the amount or the range of potential loss, if any.

Environmental

The Company and certain of its current and former direct and
    indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have
    been identified by the United States Environmental Protection
    Agency and certain state environmental agencies and private
    parties as potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) at
    various hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive
    Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
    (“Superfund”) and equivalent state laws and, as such,
    may presently be liable for the cost of

clean-up

and
    other remedial activities at 38 such sites. Responsibility for

clean-up

and
    other remedial activities at a Superfund site is typically
    shared among PRPs based on an allocation formula.

The Company believes that none of these matters, individually or
    in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its
    results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
    Generally, this is because either the estimates of the maximum
    potential liability at a site are not material or the liability
    will be shared with other PRPs, although no assurance can be
    given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter.

Based on information available to the Company (which in most
    cases includes: an estimate of allocation of liability among
    PRPs; the probability that other PRPs, many of whom are large,
    solvent public companies, will fully pay the cost apportioned to
    them; currently available information from PRPs

and/or

federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of
    contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs;
    remediation alternatives; and estimated legal fees), the Company
    has an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities with a
    balance at December 31, 2010 of $28.0 million. The
    Company has accrued amounts that do not exceed $3.0 million
    related to any individual site except for the Crystal Springs
    site discussed below, and we do not believe that the costs
    related to any of these sites will have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows
    or financial condition. The Company expects to pay out
    substantially all of the amounts accrued for environmental
    liability over the next three to five years.

In connection with the sale of Kuhlman Electric Corporation, the
    Company agreed to indemnify the buyer and Kuhlman Electric for
    certain environmental liabilities, then unknown to the Company,
    relating to certain



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

operations of Kuhlman Electric that pre-date the Company’s
    1999 acquisition of Kuhlman Electric. During 2000, Kuhlman
    Electric notified the Company that it discovered potential
    environmental contamination at its Crystal Springs, Mississippi
    plant while undertaking an expansion of the plant. The Company
    is continuing to work with the Mississippi Department of
    Environmental Quality and Kuhlman Electric to investigate and
    remediate to the extent necessary, historical contamination at
    the plant and surrounding area. Kuhlman Electric and others,
    including the Company, were sued in numerous related lawsuits,
    in which multiple claimants alleged personal injury and property
    damage relating to the alleged environmental contamination. In
    2005, the Company and other defendants entered into settlements
    that resolved approximately 99% of those claims and the
    remainder of them have since been dismissed.

In 2007 and 2008, four additional lawsuits were filed against
    Kuhlman Electric and others, including the Company, on behalf of
    approximately 340 plaintiffs, alleging personal injury relating
    to the alleged environmental contamination. One of the lawsuits,
    involving a single plaintiff, was dismissed by the trial court
    in April 2010 and the plaintiff’s appeal of that
    decision was dismissed by the appellate court in August 2010.
    The Company entered into a settlement in July 2010 regarding the
    personal injury claims of the plaintiffs in the other three
    lawsuits and those of approximately 2,700 unfiled claimants
    represented by those plaintiffs’ attorneys. In exchange
    for, among other things, the dismissal with prejudice of these
    lawsuits and the release of claims by the unfiled claimants, the
    Company agreed to pay up to $28 million in settlement
    funds, which was expensed in the second quarter of 2010. In
    November 2010 the Company paid $13.9 million related to
    this settlement. The remaining payment of approximately
    $14 million is expected to be paid in February 2011.

Conditional Asset
    Retirement Obligations

In March 2005, ASC Topic 410, Accounting for Conditional Asset
    Retirement Obligations, which requires the Company to recognize
    legal obligations to perform asset retirements in which the
    timing

and/or

method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may
    or may not be within the control of the entity. Certain
    government regulations require the removal and disposal of
    asbestos from an existing facility at the time the facility
    undergoes major renovations or is demolished. The liability
    exists because the facility will not last forever, but it is
    conditional on future renovations (even if there are no
    immediate plans to remove the materials, which pose no health or
    safety hazard in their current condition). Similarly, government
    regulations require the removal or closure of underground
    storage tanks and above ground storage tanks when their use
    ceases, the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyl transformers
    and capacitors when their use ceases, and the disposal of used
    furnace bricks and liners, and lead-based paint in conjunction
    with facility renovations or demolition. The Company currently
    has 45 manufacturing locations that have been identified as
    containing these items. The fair value to remove and dispose of
    this material has been estimated and recorded at
    $1.2 million as of December 31, 2010 and
    $1.3 million at December 31, 2009.

Product
    Liability

Like many other industrial companies who have historically
    operated in the U.S., the Company (or parties the Company is
    obligated to indemnify) continues to be named as one of many
    defendants in asbestos-related personal injury actions. We
    believe that the Company’s involvement is limited because,
    in general, these claims relate to a few types of automotive
    friction products that were manufactured many years ago and
    contained encapsulated asbestos. The nature of the fibers, the
    encapsulation and the manner of use lead the Company to believe
    that these products are highly unlikely to cause harm. As of
    December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 the Company
    had approximately 17,000 and 23,000 pending asbestos-related
    product liability claims, respectively. Of the 17,000
    outstanding claims at December 31, 2010, approximately
    8,000 were pending in just three jurisdictions, where
    significant tort and judicial reform activities are underway.

The Company’s policy is to vigorously defend against these
    lawsuits and the Company has been successful in obtaining
    dismissal of many claims without any payment. The Company
    expects that the vast majority of the pending asbestos-related
    product liability claims where it is a defendant (or has an
    obligation to indemnify a defendant) will result in no payment
    being made by the Company or its insurers. In 2010, of the



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

approximately 7,700 claims resolved, 245 (3.2%) resulted in any
    payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the Company.
    In the full year of 2009, of the approximately 5,300 claims
    resolved, only 223 (4.2%) resulted in any payment being made to
    a claimant by or on behalf of the Company.

Prior to June 2004, the settlement and defense costs associated
    with all claims were covered by the Company’s primary layer
    insurance coverage, and these carriers administered, defended,
    settled and paid all claims under a funding arrangement. In
    addition to the primary insurance available for asbestos-related
    claims, the Company has substantial additional layers of
    insurance available for potential future asbestos-related
    product claims. As such, the Company continues to believe that
    its coverage is sufficient to meet foreseeable liabilities.

In June 2004, primary layer insurance carriers notified the
    Company of the alleged exhaustion of their policy limits. This
    led the Company to access the next available layer of insurance
    coverage. Since June 2004, secondary layer insurers have been
    responsible for asbestos-related litigation defense and
    settlement expenses pursuant to a funding arrangement.

A declaratory judgment action was filed in January 2004 in the
    Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois by Continental Casualty
    Company and related companies (“CNA”) against the
    Company and certain of its other historical general liability
    insurers. CNA provided the Company with both primary and
    additional layer insurance, and, in conjunction with other
    insurers, is currently defending and indemnifying the Company in
    its pending asbestos-related product liability claims. The
    lawsuit seeks to determine the extent of insurance coverage
    available to the Company including whether the available limits
    exhaust on a “per occurrence” or an
    “aggregate” basis, and to determine how the applicable
    coverage responsibilities should be apportioned. On
    August 15, 2005, the Court issued an interim order
    regarding the apportionment matter. The interim order has the
    effect of making insurers responsible for all defense and
    settlement costs pro rata to

time-on-the-risk,

with the pro-ration method to hold the insured harmless for
    periods of bankrupt or unavailable coverage. Appeals of the
    interim order were denied. However, the issue is reserved for
    appellate review at the end of the action.

Although it is impossible to predict the outcome of pending or
    future claims or the impact of tort reform legislation that may
    be enacted at the State or Federal levels, due to the
    encapsulated nature of the products, the Company’s
    experiences in vigorously defending and resolving claims in the
    past, and the Company’s significant insurance coverage with
    solvent carriers as of the date of this filing, management does
    not believe that asbestos-related product liability claims are
    likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

To date, the Company has paid and accrued $153.1 million in
    defense and indemnity in advance of insurers’
    reimbursement, which includes the $40.7 million referred to
    below, and has received $32.5 million in cash from
    insurers. The net outstanding balance of $120.6 million is
    expected to be fully recovered, of which approximately
    $43 million is expected to be recovered within one year.
    Timing of the recovery is dependent on final resolution of the
    declaratory judgment action referred to above. At
    December 31, 2009, insurers owed $58.6 million in
    association with these claims.

On April 5, 2010 the Superior Court of New Jersey Appellate
    Division affirmed a lower court judgment in an asbestos-related
    action against the Company and others. The Company filed its
    Notice of Petition to the Supreme Court of New Jersey in late
    April, seeking to appeal the decisions of the lower courts. On
    July 8, 2010 the Supreme Court of New Jersey denied the
    Company’s Notice of Petition appealing the decision of the
    lower courts. The total claim of $40.7 million was paid by
    the Company in July 2010.

In addition to the $120.6 million net outstanding balance
    relating to past settlements and defense costs, the Company has
    estimated a liability of $50.6 million for claims asserted,
    but not yet resolved and their related defense costs at
    December 31, 2010. The Company also has a related asset of
    $50.6 million to recognize proceeds from the insurance
    carriers. Insurance carrier reimbursement of 100% is expected
    based on the Company’s experience, its insurance contracts
    and decisions received to date in the declaratory

judgment action referred to below. At December 31, 2009,
    the comparable value of the insurance asset and accrued
    liability was $49.9 million.

The Company cannot reasonably estimate possible losses, if any,
    in excess of those for which it has accrued, because it cannot

    Company (or parties the Company has an obligation to indemnify)
    in the future, the allegations in such claims, the possible
    outcomes, or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be

LEASES AND
    COMMITMENTS

Certain assets are leased under long-term operating leases.
    These include rent for the corporate headquarters and one
    airplane. Most leases contain renewal options for various
    periods. Leases generally require the Company to pay for
    insurance, taxes and maintenance of the leased property. The
    Company leases other equipment such as vehicles and certain
    office equipment under short-term leases. Total rent expense was
    $25.6 million in 2010, $28.5 million in 2009, and
    $31.5 million in 2008. The Company does not have any
    material capital leases.

On September 30, 2010 the Company paid $6.0 million
    for certain machinery and equipment it had previously leased.
    The Company’s $6.0 million payment has been recorded
    as a capital expenditure in the investing activity section of
    the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the
    year ended December 31, 2010.

NOTE 16

EARNINGS (LOSS)
    PER SHARE

The Company presents both basic and diluted earnings per share
    of common stock (“EPS”) amounts. Basic EPS is
    calculated by dividing net earnings (loss) attributable to
    BorgWarner Inc. by the weighted average shares of common stock
    outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted EPS is
    calculated by



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

dividing net earnings (loss) attributable to BorgWarner Inc. by
    the weighted average shares of common stock and common
    equivalent stock outstanding during the reporting period. The
    dilutive impact of stock based compensation is calculated using
    the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method assumes
    that the Company uses the proceeds from the exercise of awards
    to repurchase common stock at the average market pricing during
    the period. The assumed proceeds under the treasury stock method
    include the purchase price that the grantee will pay in the
    future, compensation cost for future service that the Company
    has not yet recognized and any windfall tax benefits that would
    be credited to capital in excess of par value when the award
    generates a tax deduction. If there would be a shortfall
    resulting in a charge to capital in excess of par value, such an
    amount would be a reduction in proceeds.

Options are only dilutive when the average market price of the
    underlying common stock exceeds the exercise price of the
    options because it is unlikely they would be exercised if the
    exercise price were higher than the market price.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, the impact of the
    approximately 1.578 million options and restricted stock in
    the table below were excluded from the calculation of fully
    diluted earnings as this would have reduced the Company’s
    loss per share. For the year-ended December 31, 2009, there
    were approximately 2.711 million options where the exercise
    price exceeded the market price. For the year-ended
    December 31, 2010, the market price exceeded the exercise
    price for all outstanding options.

The potential common shares associated with the Company’s
    3.50% convertible notes due April 15, 2012 are reflected in
    diluted earnings per share in 2010 using the
    “if-converted” method. Under this method, if dilutive,
    the common stock is assumed issued as of the beginning of the
    reporting period and included in calculating diluted earnings
    per share of common stock. In addition, if dilutive, interest
    expense, net of tax, related to the convertible notes is added
    back to the numerator in calculating diluted earnings per share
    of common stock.

Separately and concurrently with the issuance of the
    Company’s 3.50% convertible notes, the Company entered into
    a bond hedge overlay, including warrants and options. If the
    Company’s weighted-average share price exceeds $38.61 per
    share for any period presented, the warrants will be dilutive to
    the Company’s earnings. If the Company’s weighted
    average share price exceeds $32.82 for any period presented the
    offsetting bond hedge will be anti-dilutive.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, the
    11.389 million share impact of the Company’s
    convertible bond was not included in the calculation of fully
    diluted earnings because using the if-converted method would
    increase earnings per share. At December 31, 2009, the
    common stock share price was less than the warrant exercise
    price of $38.62. Therefore, no value was assigned as
    anti-dilutive in the table below.

RESTRUCTURING

On July 31, 2008, the Company announced a restructuring of
    its operations to align ongoing operations with a continuing,
    fundamental market shift in the auto industry. As a continuation
    of the Company’s third quarter restructuring, on
    December 11, 2008, the Company announced plans for
    additional restructuring actions. As a result of these third and
    fourth quarter 2008 restructuring actions, the Company had
    reduced its North American workforce by approximately
    2,400 people, or 33%; its European workforce by
    approximately 1,600 people, or 18%; and its Asian workforce
    by approximately 400 people, or 17%. The restructuring
    expense recognized for employee termination benefits was
    $54.6 million. In addition to employee termination costs,
    the Company recorded $72.9 million of asset impairment
    charges related to the North American and European
    restructuring. The combined restructuring expenses of
    $127.5 million are broken out by segment



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

as follows: Engine $85.3 million, Drivetrain
    $40.9 million and Corporate $1.3 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008.

In the second quarter of 2009, the Company took additional
    restructuring actions. The Company reduced its North American
    workforce by approximately 550 people, or 12%; its European
    workforce by approximately 150 people, or 2%; and its Asian
    workforce by approximately 60 people, or 3% in the second
    quarter. The net restructuring expense recognized in the second
    quarter was $9.0 million for employee termination benefits.
    In addition to employee termination costs, the Company recorded
    $36.3 million of asset impairment and $5.0 million of
    other charges in the second quarter of 2009 related to the North
    American and European restructuring. The combined 2009
    restructuring expenses of $50.3 million are broken out by
    segment as follows: Engine $27.2 million, Drivetrain
    $19.7 million and Corporate $3.4 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2009.

Included in the second quarter of 2009 asset impairment charge
    is $22.3 million related to one of the Company’s
    European locations. During the second quarter of 2009
    circumstances caused the Company to evaluate the long range
    outlook of the facility using an undiscounted and discounted
    cash flow model, both of which indicated that assets were
    impaired. The Company then used a replacement cost technique to
    determine the fair value of the assets at the facility. This
    reduction of asset value was included in the Engine segment.

Estimates of restructuring expense are based on information
    available at the time such charges are recorded. Due to the
    inherent uncertainty involved in estimating restructuring
    expenses, actual amounts paid for such activities may differ
    from amounts initially recorded. Accordingly, the Company may
    record revisions of previous estimates by adjusting previously
    established reserves.

The following table displays a roll forward of the employee
    related restructuring and other accruals recorded within the
    Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet and the related cash

RECENT
    TRANSACTIONS

Traction
    Systems division of Haldex Group

On January 31, 2011, the Company acquired the Traction
    Systems division of Haldex Group, a leading provider of
    innovative all-wheel drive (AWD) products for the global vehicle
    industry headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden. The purchase price
    was approximately $205 million (1.425 billion Swedish
    Krona).



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The operating results will be reported within the Company’s
    Drivetrain reporting segment from the date of acquisition.

This acquisition is expected to accelerate BorgWarner’s
    growth in the global AWD market as it continues to shift toward
    front-wheel drive (FWD) based vehicles. The acquisition will add
    industry leading FWD/AWD technologies, with a strong European
    customer base, to BorgWarner’s existing portfolio of front
    and rear-wheel drive based products. This enables BorgWarner to
    provide global customers a broader range of all-wheel drive
    solutions to meet their vehicle needs.

BERU-Eichenauer
    GmbH

In anticipation of market growth expected for its electric cabin
    heaters, the Company completed the acquisition of
    BERU-Eichenauer GmbH by acquiring the shares of its former joint
    venture partner, Eichenauer Heizelemente GmbH & Co.
    KG. The former


/


joint venture was formed in 2000 to develop and manufacture
    electric cabin heaters. The acquisition formally took effect on
    May 1, 2010.

The pre-tax impact of this acquisition was an increase in
    intangible and other assets of $17.6 million related to
    adjusting the Company’s fifty percent investment to fair
    value under ASC Topic 805, a gain of $8.0 million and a
    decrease in cash of $9.6 million. The Company’s
    $9.6 million payment has been recorded as an investing
    activity in the Company’s December 31, 2010
    Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

Dytech ENSA
    S.L.

On April 10, 2010, the Company acquired 100% of Dytech ENSA
    S.L. (“Dytech”), headquartered in Vigo, Spain. The
    gross cost of this acquisition is $147.7 million, or
    $147.6 million, net of cash and cash equivalents. Dytech is
    a leading producer of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) coolers,
    EGR tubes, and integrated EGR modules including valves for
    automotive and commercial vehicle applications, both on- and
    off-road. This acquisition enhances the Company’s emissions
    products offering and system/module expertise, further
    differentiating BorgWarner as a leader in highly engineered
    automotive systems. In addition, Dytech’s geographic
    footprint and customer base complements and strengthens the
    Company’s market presence with global automakers. The
    operating results of Dytech are reported within the
    Company’s Engine reporting segment from the date of
    acquisition. The Company’s $147.6 million payment has

BERU

The Company acquired approximately 82.2% of the outstanding
    shares of BERU Aktiengesellschaft (“BERU”),
    headquartered in Ludwigsburg, Germany prior to 2008.

In the second quarter of 2008, the Company and BERU completed a
    Domination and Profit Transfer Agreement (“DPTA”),
    giving BorgWarner full control of BERU. Under this agreement
    BERU is obligated to transfer 100% of its annual profits or
    losses to the Company. Upon request of BERU noncontrolling
    shareholders, the Company is obligated to purchase their shares
    for a cash payment of €71.32 per share. Those BERU
    noncontrolling shareholders who did not sell their shares are
    entitled to receive an annual compensatory payment (perpetual
    dividend) of €4.23 (net) per share. The DPTA is a binding
    agreement. However, certain noncontrolling shareholders of BERU
    initiated an appraisal proceeding in the German court system
    that challenged the valuation of the €71.32 purchase price
    and €4.23 annual compensatory payment (perpetual dividend).

On January 7, 2009 the Company informed BERU of its
    intention to purchase the remaining outstanding shares at that
    time of approximately 4%, using the required German legal
    process referred to as a “squeeze-out” to gain 100%
    ownership. This process included an affirmative vote of BERU
    shareholders at its May 20, 2009 annual shareholder
    meeting. The registration of the “squeeze-out” was
    challenged by certain noncontrolling shareholders of BERU with
    the commercial register in June 2009. The
    “squeeze-out” share price passed by the BERU
    shareholders in May 2009 was €73.39. The increase in price
    per share of €2.07 resulting from the “squeeze
    out” was reflected as an increase to the Company’s
    total DPTA obligation.

On September 18, 2009 the noncontrolling shareholders of
    BERU who had challenged the “squeeze-out” resolution
    dropped their complaint. The elimination of all actions against
    the resolution allowed BERU to register the
    “squeeze-out” with the commercial register. The
    “squeeze-out” became effective on, September 30,
    2009, making the Company the only shareholder of BERU. On
    October 2, 2009, BERU was delisted as a public company in
    Germany. In October 2009, the Company paid €22.9
    ($33.5) million for the approximately 311,000 outstanding
    shares of BERU. Certain noncontrolling shareholders have
    challenged the “squeeze out” share price of
    €73.39. A hearing date for this action has been scheduled
    for April 2011.

As a result of the tendering of shares, the Company owned 100%
    of all BERU’s outstanding shares at December 31, 2009.
    The tendering of approximately 4.4% of BERU shares, at a cost of
    $46.6 million, has been reflected as a Financing activity
    in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the year ended
    December 31, 2009. Additionally, on May 22, 2009, the
    Company paid the annual perpetual dividend of $1.9 million,
    which is also reflected as a Financing activity in the
    Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended
    December 31, 2009.

REPORTING
    SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION

The Company’s business is comprised of two reporting
    segments: Engine and Drivetrain. These segments are strategic
    business groups, which are managed separately as each represents
    a specific grouping of related automotive components and systems.

The Company allocates resources to each segment based upon the
    projected after-tax return on invested capital
    (“ROIC”) of its business initiatives. The ROIC is
    comprised of projected earnings before interest, income taxes
    and noncontrolling interest (“EBIT”) adjusted for
    restructuring, goodwill impairment

Adjusted EBIT is the measure of segment profit or loss used by
    the Company. The Company believes Adjusted EBIT is most
    reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our
    reporting segments.

Outside the U.S., only China, Germany, France, Hungary and South
    Korea, exceeded 5% of consolidated net sales in 2010,
    attributing sales to the sources of the product rather than the
    location of the customer. Also, the Company’s 50% equity
    investment in NSK-Warner (see Note 5) amounting to
    $180.3 million, $174.0 million and $192.5 million
    at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, are

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can
    provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
    objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of
    a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
    constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered
    relative to costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all
    control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
    assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if
    any, within the company have been detected. Because of the
    inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,
    misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be
    detected. However, our disclosure controls and procedures are
    designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their
    objectives.

The Company has adopted and maintains disclosure controls and
    procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance
    that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed
    or submitted under the Exchange Act, such as this

Form 10-K,

is collected, recorded, processed, summarized and reported
    within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
    Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure
    that such information is accumulated and communicated to
    management to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosure. As required under Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15,

the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation
    of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of
    the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that
    evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures
    are effective.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting, as defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

Management conducted an assessment of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on the framework
    and criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework. Based on the
    assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31,
    2010, the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting is effective based on those criteria.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, has audited the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements and the effectiveness of internal controls
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 as stated
    in their report included herein.

Changes in
    Internal Control

There have been no changes in internal controls over the
    financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal
    quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
    to materially affect our internal controls over financial
    reporting.
