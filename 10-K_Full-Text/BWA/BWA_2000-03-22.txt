The sales information presented above excludes the sales by the
Company&#146;s unconsolidated joint ventures. See &#147;Joint
Ventures.&#148; Such sales totaled approximately
$287 million in 1999, $247 million in 1998 and $336
million in 1997.

Air/ Fluid Systems

     
Air/ Fluid Systems designs and manufactures sophisticated
mechanical, electro-mechanical and electronic components and
systems used for engine air intake and exhaust management, fuel
and vapor management, electronically controlled automatic
transmissions and steering and suspension systems. Key products
for engine air intake management produced by the Company include
throttle bodies, intake manifolds, throttle position sensors, and
 complete engine induction systems. The Company&#146;s products
for emissions control and improved gas mileage include mechanical
 and electrical air pumps, air control valves and pressure
feedback exhaust gas re-circulation valves. The fuel management
and vapor recovery products include roll valves, canister purge
solenoids and complete vapor recovery systems. Air/ Fluid Systems
 also produces fuel tanks used on commercial vehicle applications
 and oil pumps.




Cooling Systems

     
Cooling Systems, the Company&#146;s newest segment, is a
combination of the businesses acquired from Eaton Corporation and
 the Schwitzer cooling businesses acquired as part of the Kuhlman
 Corporation acquisition in 1999. Cooling Systems manufactures
viscous fan clutches, on-off fan drives and fans which are used
as part of the engine cooling system. Product features include
improved fuel economy and emissions control by minimizing
parasitic power loss. These products are provided from facilities
 in the U.S., Germany, U.K., Brazil, Korea and China. The Company
 believes it is a leading global supplier of such products but
competes with other large independent producers as well as
divisions of its OEM customers.

Morse TEC

     
Morse TEC manufactures chain and chain systems, including
HY-VO&#174; front-wheel drive (&#147;FWD&#148;) transmission
chain and four-wheel drive (&#147;4WD&#148;) chain, MORSE
GEMINI&#153; Chain Systems, timing chain and timing chain
systems, crankshaft and camshaft sprockets, chain tensioners and
snubbers and turbochargers for passenger car and commercial
vehicle applications.

     
HY-VO&#174; chain is used in transmissions and for 4WD transfer
case applications. Transmission chain is used to transfer power
from the engine to the transmission. The Company&#146;s MORSE
GEMINI&#153; Chain System emits significantly less chain pitch
frequency noise than conventional transmission chain systems. The
 chain in a transfer case distributes power between the front and
 rear output shafts which, in turn, drive the front and rear
wheels. The Company believes it is the world&#146;s leading
manufacturer of chain for FWD transmissions and 4WD transfer
cases. The Company is an original equipment supplier to every
major manufacturer that uses chain for such applications.

     
The Company&#146;s timing chain system is used on Ford&#146;s new
 family of overhead cam engines, including the Duratech and
Triton engines, as well as Chrysler&#146;s 2.7 liter, 3.7 liter
and 4.7 liter overhead cam engines. The Company has been selected
 to provide timing systems for a number of Japanese and European
applications beginning in 1999. The Company believes that it is
the world&#146;s leading manufacturer of timing chain.

     
This segment also provides turbochargers for passenger car,
commercial vehicle and industrial applications for diesel and
gasoline engine manufacturers in Europe, North America, South
America and Asia. In December 1998, the Company announced
the completion of its purchase of the European turbocharger
business of AG K&#252;hnle, Kopp &#38; Kausch (&#147;AG
K&#252;hnle&#148;), renaming it 3K-Warner Turbosystems GmbH
(&#147;3K-Warner&#148;). In 1999, the business was expanded by
the addition of the Schwitzer Group turbocharger portion of the
Kuhlman Corporation acquisition. A turbocharger is a device
designed to force additional intake air into the engine to create
 a cleaner and more powerful ignition. Benefits of turbocharging
in both passenger car and commercial vehicle applications include
 greater power for a given engine size, improved fuel economy and
 significantly reduced emissions. The Company believes it the
second leading manufacturer of turbochargers in the world.

TorqTransfer Systems

     
TorqTransfer Systems&#146; products include 4WD and all-wheel
drive transfer cases and related systems to transfer torque
within the drivetrain.

     
Transfer cases are installed primarily on light trucks and
sport-utility vehicles. A transfer case attaches to the
transmission and distributes torque to the front and rear axles
for 4WD, improving vehicle control during off-road use and in a
variety of road conditions. The Company has designed and
developed an exclusive 4WD Torque-on-Demand&#174;
(&#147;TOD&#148;) transfer case system, which allows vehicles to
automatically shift from two-wheel drive to 4WD when electronic
sensors indicate it is necessary. The TOD transfer case is
available on the Ford Explorer, the best selling sport-utility
vehicle in the United States in 1999, 1998 and 1997, and the Ford
 Expedition, Lincoln Navigator, Isuzu Trooper and SsangYong Musso
 from Daewoo.




     
Sales of 4WD transfer cases represented 22%, 27% and 34% of the
Company&#146;s total revenues for 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively. The Company believes that it is the world&#146;s
leading independent manufacturer of 4WD transfer cases, producing
 approximately 1.2 million transfer cases in 1999. The
Company&#146;s largest customer of 4WD transfer cases is Ford
Motor Company. The Company supplies the majority of the 4WD
transfer cases for Ford, including those installed in the Ford
Explorer, the Ford Expedition, the Ford F-150 and Ranger pick-up
trucks, the Mercury Mountaineer and the Lincoln Navigator.

     
The Company supplies transfer cases for the Mercedes-Benz 4WD
vehicle, which was first made available to consumers in 1997 and
is manufactured at Mercedes-Benz&#146;s United States
passenger-vehicle manufacturing facility. Under a five-year
agreement, which has a three-year extension provision, the
Company developed and supplies Mercedes-Benz with two-speed,
electronically controlled, all-wheel drive transfer cases that
are compatible with its anti-skid braking system.

Transmission Systems

     
The Company engineers and manufactures components for automatic
transmissions and the systems that combine such components around
 the world. Principal product lines include friction plates,
one-way clutches, transmission bands and torque converter lock-up
 clutches for automatic transmissions. The Company is a supplier
to virtually every major automatic transmission manufacturer in
the world. The Company&#146;s 50%-owned joint venture in Japan,
NSK-Warner Kabushiki Kaisha (&#147;NSK Warner&#148;), is a
leading producer of friction plates and one-way clutches in
Japan.

Acquisitions during 1999


Kuhlman Corporation

     
On March 1, 1999, the Company acquired all the outstanding
shares of common stock of Kuhlman Corporation
(&#147;Kuhlman&#148;), for a purchase price of
$693.0 million. The Company also assumed $131.6 million
 of Kuhlman&#146;s existing indebtedness, which it subsequently
refinanced. The Company funded the transaction by issuing common
stock and by borrowing approximately $543.2 million.

     
Kuhlman was a diversified industrial manufacturing company that
operated in two product segments: vehicle and electrical
products. In vehicle products, Kuhlman&#146;s Schwitzer Group and
 Kysor were leading worldwide manufacturers of proprietary engine
 components, including turbochargers, fans and fan drives, fuel
tanks, instrumentation, heating/ ventilation/ air conditioning
systems, and other products for commercial transportation and
industrial equipment. The vehicle products units have been
integrated into the Company&#146;s Air/ Fluid Systems, Cooling
Systems and Morse TEC operating segments.

     
The electrical products businesses acquired from Kuhlman
consisted of Kuhlman Electric Corporation (&#147;Kuhlman
Electric&#148;) and Coleman Cable Systems, Inc. (&#147;Coleman
Cable&#148;). These businesses manufactured transformers for the
utility industry and wire and cable for utilities and other
industries. At the time of the Kuhlman acquisition, the Company
announced that it intended to sell the businesses by the end of
the year. As of December 31, 1999, the Company had completed
 the sales of both Kuhlman Electric and Coleman Cable. The
Company received cash proceeds of approximately
$227.1 million and $30.3 million face value debt
instruments from the buyers of the businesses. The debt
instruments were adjusted to a carrying value of
$12.9 million because of their terms and credit-worthiness.

Eaton Corporation&#146;s Fluid Power Acquisition

     
Effective October 1, 1999, the Company acquired Eaton
Corporation&#146;s Fluid Power Division, one of the world&#146;s
leading manufacturers of powertrain cooling solutions for the
global automotive industry, for $321.7 million. To partially
 finance the acquisition, the Company issued $150 million of
 8.0% senior unsecured notes maturing September 2019. Cash
from operations funded the remainder of





the acquisition price. The Fluid Power Division designs and
produces a variety of viscous fan drive cooling systems primarily
 for passenger vehicles such as light trucks, sport-utility
vehicles and vans. It has been combined with the commercial
cooling systems business acquired from Kuhlman in March to form
the Company&#146;s newest segment, Cooling Systems.


Joint Ventures

     
The Company has five joint ventures in which it has a
less-than-100% ownership interest. Results from three of these
ventures, in which the Company is the majority owner, are
consolidated as part of the Company&#146;s results. The
Company&#146;s ownership interest in the two unconsolidated joint
 ventures NSK-Warner and Beijing Warner Gear Co., Ltd. are 50%
and 49.9%, respectively. These investments are reported using the
 equity method.

     
Management of the unconsolidated joint ventures is shared with
the Company&#146;s respective joint venture partners. Certain

See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements on pages 40 through 42 of the Company&#146;s Annual
Report for geographic information.

Customers

     
Approximately 75% of the Company&#146;s total sales in 1999 were
to automotive OEMs, with the remaining 25% of the Company&#146;s
sales to a diversified group of industrial, construction and
agricultural vehicle manufacturers, auto part manufacturers and
to distributors of automotive aftermarket and replacement parts.

     
The Company&#146;s worldwide sales in 1999 to Ford,
DaimlerChrysler Corporation and General Motors Corporation
constituted approximately 28%, 17% and 12%, respectively, of its
1999 consolidated sales. Approximately 25% of consolidated sales
for 1999 were outside the United States, including exports.
However, a substantial portion of such sales were to foreign OEMs
 of vehicles that are, in turn, exported to the United States.
See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements on pages 40 through 42 of the Company&#146;s
Annual Report.

     
The Company&#146;s automotive products are sold directly to OEMs
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the OEMs&#146; purchase
orders, and deliveries are subject to periodic authorizations
based upon the production schedules of the OEMs. The Company
ships its products directly from its plants to the OEMs.




Sales and Marketing

     
Each of the Company&#146;s operating segments has its own sales
function headed by a vice president of sales. Account executives
for each group are assigned to serve specific OEM customers for
one or more of a business group&#146;s products. Such account
executives spend the majority of their time in direct contact
with OEM purchasing and engineering employees and are responsible
 for servicing existing business and for identifying and
obtaining new business. Because of their close relationship with
the OEMs, account executives are able to identify and meet
customers&#146; needs based upon their knowledge of the
Company&#146;s products and design and manufacturing
capabilities. Upon securing a new order, account executives
participate in product launch team activities as a key interface
to the customers.

Research and Development

     
Each of the Company&#146;s operating segments has its own
research and development (&#147;R&#38;D&#148;) organization. Over
 500 employees, including engineers, mechanics and
technicians, are engaged in R&#38;D activities at Company
facilities worldwide. The Company also operates testing
facilities such as prototype, measurement and calibration, life
testing and dynamometer laboratories.

     
By working closely with the OEMs and anticipating their future
product needs, the Company&#146;s R&#38;D personnel conceive,
design, develop and manufacture new proprietary automotive
components and systems. R&#38;D personnel also work to improve
current products and production processes. The Company believes
its commitment to R&#38;D will allow it to obtain new orders from
 its OEM customers.

     
Consistent with its strategy of developing technologically
innovative products, the Company spent approximately
$91.6 million, $65.1 million and $59.0 million in
1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively, on R&#38;D activities. Not
included in the reported R&#38;D activities were
customer-sponsored R&#38;D activities that were approximately
$9.4 million, $8.4 million and $8.0 million in
1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

Patents and Licenses

     
The Company has approximately 2,500 active domestic and foreign
patents and patent applications pending or under preparation, and
 receives royalties from licensing patent rights to others. While
 it considers its patents on the whole to be important, the
Company does not consider any single patent, group of related
patents or any single license essential to its operations in the
aggregate or to the operations of any of the Company&#146;s
business groups individually. The expiration of the patents
individually and in the aggregate is not expected to have a
material effect on the Company&#146;s financial position or
future operating results. The Company owns numerous trademarks,
some of which are valuable but none of which are essential to its
 business in the aggregate.

     
The Company owns the &#147;BorgWarner&#148; and &#147;Borg-Warner
 Automotive&#148; trade names and housemarks, and variations
thereof, which are material to the Company&#146;s business.

Competition

     
Each of the Company&#146;s operating segments competes worldwide
with a number of other manufacturers and distributors which
produce and sell similar products. Price, quality and
technological innovation are the primary elements of competition.
 Competitors include vertically integrated units of the
Company&#146;s major OEM customers, as well as a large number of
independent domestic and international suppliers. Many of these
companies are larger and have greater resources than the Company.

     
A number of the Company&#146;s major OEM customers manufacture,
for their own use and for others, products which compete with the
 Company&#146;s products. Although these OEM customers have
indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers,
the OEMs could elect to manufacture products to meet their own
requirements or to compete with the Company. There can be no
assurance that the Company&#146;s business will not be adversely
affected by increased competition in the markets in which it
operates.




     
The competitive environment has changed dramatically over the
past few years as the Company&#146;s traditional United States
OEM customers, faced with intense international competition, have
 expanded their worldwide sourcing of components with the stated
objective of better competing with lower-cost imports. As a
result, the Company has experienced competition from suppliers in
 other parts of the world enjoying economic advantages such as
lower labor costs, lower health care costs and, in some cases,
export subsidies and/or raw materials subsidies.

Employees

     
As of December 31, 1999, the Company and its consolidated
subsidiaries had approximately 14,400 salaried and hourly
employees (as compared with approximately 10,100 employees at
December 31, 1998), of which approximately 9,900 were U.S.
employees. Approximately 43% of the Company&#146;s domestic
hourly workers are unionized. The hourly workers at the
Company&#146;s European facilities are also unionized. The
Company believes its present relations with employees to be
satisfactory.

Raw Materials

     
Each of the Company&#146;s operating segments believes that its
supplies of raw materials for manufacturing requirements in 2000
are adequate and are available from multiple sources. It is
common, however, for customers to require their prior approval
before certain raw materials or components can be used, thereby
reducing sources of supply that would otherwise be available.
Manufacturing operations for each of the Company&#146;s operating
 segments are dependent upon natural gas, fuel oil, propane and
electricity.

Environmental Regulation and Proceedings

     
The Company&#146;s operations are subject to federal, state,
local and foreign laws and regulations governing, among other
things, emissions to air, discharge to waters and the generation,
 handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of
waste and other materials. The Company believes that its
business, operations and facilities have been and are being
operated in compliance in all material respects with applicable
environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, many of
 which provide for substantial fines and criminal sanctions for
violations. However, the operation of automotive parts
manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas, and there can
be no assurance that the Company will not incur material costs or
 liabilities. In addition, potentially significant expenditures
could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental
and health and safety laws, regulations or requirements that may
be adopted or imposed in the future.

     
The Company believes that the overall impact of compliance with
regulations and legislation protecting the environment will not
have a material effect on its financial position or future
operating results, although no assurance can be given in this
regard. Capital expenditures and expenses in 1999 attributable to
 compliance with such legislation were not material.

     
The Company and certain of its current and former direct and
indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have
been identified by the United States Environmental Protection
Agency and certain state environmental agencies and private
parties as potentially responsible parties (&#147;PRPs&#148;) at
various hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
(&#147;Superfund&#148;) and equivalent state laws and, as such,
may be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial
activities at 40 such sites. Responsibility for cleanup and other
 remedial activities at a Superfund site is typically shared
among PRPs based on an allocation formula.

     
Based on information available to the Company which, in most
cases, includes: an estimate of allocation of liability among
PRPs; the probability that other PRPs, many of whom are large,
solvent public companies, will fully pay the costs apportioned to
 them; currently available information from PRPs and/or federal
or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of
contamination and estimated remediation costs; remediation
alternatives; estimated legal fees; and other factors, the





Company has established a reserve for indicated environmental
liabilities in the aggregate amount of approximately
$17.8 million at December 31, 1999. The Company expects
 this amount to be expended over the next three to five years.


     
The Company believes that none of these matters, individually or
in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its
financial position or future operating results, generally either
because estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site
are not large or because liability will be shared with other
PRPs, although no assurance can be given with respect to the
ultimate outcome of any such matter.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

     
The Company is presently, and is from time to time, subject to
claims and suits arising in the ordinary course of its business.
In certain such actions, plaintiffs request punitive or other
damages that may not be covered by insurance. The Company
believes that it has established adequate provisions for
litigation liabilities in its financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. These provisions
include both legal fees and possible outcomes of legal
proceedings.

     
It is the opinion of the Company that the various asserted claims
 and litigation in which the Company is currently involved will
not materially affect its financial position or future operating
results, although no assurance can be given with respect to the
ultimate outcome for any such claim or litigation.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security
Holders

     
There were no matters submitted to the security holders of the
Company during the fourth quarter of 1999.
