PART I

ITEM 1.   BUSINESS

BorgWarner Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries (the “Company”) is a Delaware corporation  incorporated in 1987. We are a leading global supplier of highly engineered automotive systems and components primarily for powertrain applications. Our products help improve vehicle performance, fuel efficiency, stability and air quality. These products are manufactured and sold worldwide, primarily to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) of light vehicles (passenger cars, sport-utility vehicles ("SUVs"), vans and light-trucks). The Company's products are also sold to other OEMs of commercial vehicles (medium-duty trucks, heavy-duty trucks and buses) and off-highway vehicles (agricultural and construction machinery and marine applications). We also manufacture and sell our products to certain Tier One vehicle systems suppliers and into the aftermarket for light, commercial and off-highway vehicles. The Company operates manufacturing facilities serving customers in the Americas, Europe and Asia, and is an original equipment supplier to every major automotive OEM in the world.

Financial Information About Reporting Segments

Refer to Note 19, “Reporting Segments and Related Information,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for financial information about the Company's reporting segments.

Narrative Description of Reporting Segments

The Company reports its results under two reporting segments: Engine and Drivetrain. Net sales by reporting segment for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 are as follows:

The sales information presented above excludes the sales by the Company's unconsolidated joint ventures (See sub-heading “Joint Ventures”). Such unconsolidated sales totaled approximately $817 million, $779 million and $599 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Engine

The Engine Group develops and manufactures products to manage engines for fuel efficiency, reduced emissions and enhanced performance. Concern about fuel prices and availability, as well as the need to lower CO


emissions are driving demand for the Company's products in smaller, more efficient gasoline and diesel engines and alternative powertrains. Engine Group products currently fall into the following major categories: turbochargers, emissions systems, timing devices and chain products, thermal systems, diesel cold start, gasoline ignition technology and cabin heaters.

The Engine Group provides turbochargers for light, commercial and off-highway applications for diesel and gasoline engine manufacturers in the Americas, Europe and Asia.  The Engine Group has greatly benefited from the growth in turbocharger demand in Europe.  This growth is linked to increasing demand for diesel engines in light vehicles, which typically use turbochargers, and for turbocharged gasoline engines.  Benefits of turbochargers in light, commercial and off-highway applications include increased power for a given engine size, improved fuel economy and reduced emissions.



Sales of turbochargers for light-vehicles represented approximately

26%

of total net sales for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and

27%

of total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009. The Company currently supplies light-vehicle turbochargers to many OEMs including Volkswagen, Renault, PSA, Daimler, Hyundai, Fiat, BMW, Ford and General Motors. The Company also supplies commercial vehicle turbochargers to Daimler, Navistar, Deutz and MAN and off-highway turbochargers to Caterpillar and John Deere.

The Company's newest turbocharger technologies are its regulated two-stage turbocharging system, known as R2S

®

, variable turbine geometry ("VTG") turbochargers and turbochargers for gasoline direct injected engines, all of which may be found in numerous applications around the world.  For example, the Company supplies its award winning R2S

®

turbocharger technology to Volkswagen's 2.0 liter four-cylinder common-rail diesel engine featured in the Transporter T5 and Amarok pickup. Also, the Company supplies VTG turbochargers to Renault's 1.6 liter R9M diesel engine featured in the Mégane Scénic and Ford selected BorgWarner's leading gasoline turbocharger technology for their new 1.6 liter and 2.0 liter four-cylinder EcoBoost engines, the latter launching in the U.S. in the 2012 Explorer and 2012 Edge models, and in China in the Ford Mondeo.

The Engine Group also designs and manufactures products to control emissions and improve fuel economy.  These products include electric air pumps, turbo actuators using integrated electronics to precisely control turbocharger speed and pressure ratio and exhaust gas recirculation ("EGR") coolers, tubes and valves for gasoline and diesel applications.  In 2010, the Company acquired Dytech Ensa S.L., a leading producer of EGR coolers, EGR tubes and integrated EGR modules including valves for light, commercial and off-highway applications.

The Engine Group's timing devices and chain products include timing chain and timing drive systems, variable cam timing (“VCT”) systems, crankshaft and camshaft sprockets, tensioners, guides and snubbers, HY-VO

®

front-wheel drive (“FWD”) transmission chain and four-wheel drive (“4WD”) chain and MORSE GEMINI

®

chain systems for light vehicles.

The Company is a leading manufacturer of timing chain systems to OEMs around the world. BorgWarner timing chain systems are featured on Ford's family of engines, including the Duratec, Modular, and in-line four-cylinder engines, Chrysler's 3.6 liter Pentastar engine, Volkswagen's EA888 family, Hyundai's Gamma, Nu and Theta families and numerous other applications around the world.

The Engine Group's newest chain product technology is its VCT with mid position lock, which allows a greater range of camshaft positioning thereby enabling greater control over airflow and the opportunity to improve fuel economy, function and efficiency compared with conventional VCT systems. VCT with mid-position lock made its debut on Subaru's Boxer

®

2.0 liter engine. BorgWarner is currently working with a number of other OEMs interested in implementing this technology.

The Company is a leading manufacturer of chain for FWD transmissions and 4WD transfer cases.  The Company's HY-VO

®

chain is used to transfer power from the engine to the drivetrain. The chain in a transfer case distributes power between a vehicle's front and rear output shafts which, in turn, provide torque to the front and rear wheels. The Company's MORSE GEMINI

®

transmission chain system emits significantly less chain pitch frequency noise than conventional transmission chain systems.

The Company is a leading global provider of engine thermal solutions for truck, agricultural and off-highway applications. The Engine Group designs, manufactures and markets viscous fan drives that control fans to sense and respond to multiple cooling requirements. The Engine Group also manufactures and markets polymer fans for engine cooling systems. The Company's thermal products provide improved vehicle fuel economy and reduced engine emissions while minimizing parasitic horsepower loss. The Company has been awarded the "standard position" (the OEM-designated preferred supplier of component systems available to the end-customer) at several major global heavy truck producers.



The Company is a leading global automotive supplier of diesel cold start technology (glow plugs and instant starting systems), including its Pressure Sensor Glow Plug which monitors and enhances the combustion process of a diesel engine, minimizing CO


and NO

x

emissions.  The Company also designs and manufactures gasoline ignition technology (spark plugs and ignition coils) and electronic control units and sensor technology (diesel cabin heaters and selected sensors).

In 2009, the Company announced the purchase of advanced gasoline ignition technology and related intellectual property from Florida-based Etatech, Inc. The high-frequency ignition technology enables high-performing, lean burning engines to significantly improve fuel economy and reduce emissions compared with conventional combustion technologies.

In anticipation of market growth expected for its electric cabin heaters, the Company completed the acquisition of BERU-Eichenauer GmbH by acquiring the shares of its former joint venture partner, Eichenauer Heizelemente GmbH & Co. KG. The former 50/50 joint venture was formed in 2000 to develop and manufacture electric cabin heaters. The acquisition formally took effect on May 1, 2010.

Drivetrain

The Drivetrain Group leverages the Company's expertise in clutching and control systems to enable efficient transmission of engine torque through the vehicle drivetrain and management of torque distribution to the driven wheels. The Company's technology can improve fuel efficiency and help reduce emissions in all types of powertrains. The Drivetrain Group's major products are transmission components and systems, and all-wheel drive ("AWD") torque management systems.

The Drivetrain Group designs and manufactures automatic transmission components and modules and is a supplier to virtually every major automatic transmission manufacturer in the world for conventional automatic, new dual-clutch transmissions (“DCT”) and automated manual transmissions. In conventional automatic transmissions, there has been a global market trend from four and five speeds to six, seven and eight speed transmissions. Transmissions with more speeds improve fuel economy and vehicle performance and offer growth opportunities.

Friction and mechanical products include dual clutch modules, friction clutch modules, friction plates, transmission bands, torque converter clutches, one-way clutches and torsional vibration dampers. Controls products feature electro-hydraulic solenoids for standard and high pressure hydraulic systems, transmission solenoid modules and dual clutch control modules. The Company's 50%-owned joint venture in Japan, NSK-Warner Kabushiki Kaisha ("NSK-Warner"), is a leading producer of friction plates and one-way clutches in Japan.

The Company has led the globalization of today's DCT technology for over 10 years.  Following the development of its DCT technology in the 1990s, the Company established its industry-leading position in Europe in 2003 with the production launch of its award-winning DualTronic

®

innovations with VW/Audi.  In 2007, the Company launched its first dual-clutch technology application in a Japanese transmission with Nissan.

The Company has announced DCT programs with customers that include VW/Audi, SAIC and Nissan, in addition to Getrag DCT programs with BMW, Ford and other global automakers. The Company is working on several other DCT programs with OEMs around the world.  BorgWarner DualTronic technology enables a conventional, manual gearbox to function as a fully automatic transmission by eliminating the interruption in power flow that occurs when shifting a single clutch manual transmission. The result is a smooth shifting automatic transmission with the fuel efficiency and great driving experience of a manual gearbox.



In 2008, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with China Automobile Development United Investment Company, a company owned by 12 leading Chinese automakers, to produce various dual clutch transmission modules.  The joint venture's operations are located in Dalian, China and production is scheduled to begin in the first half of 2012.  The Company owns 66% of the joint venture.

The Drivetrain Group's torque management products include rear-wheel drive (“RWD”)/AWD transfer case systems, FWD/AWD electromagnetic coupling systems and advanced products.  The Company's focus is on electronically controlled (active) torque management devices and systems for their vehicle dynamics, fuel economy and stability benefits.

Transfer cases are installed primarily on light-trucks, SUVs, RWD based cross-over utility vehicles ("CUVs") and passenger cars. A transfer case attaches to the transmission and distributes torque to the front and rear axles improving vehicle traction and stability in dynamic driving conditions.

The Company is involved in the AWD market for FWD based vehicles with electromagnetic couplings that use electronically controlled clutches to distribute power to the rear wheels instantly as traction is required. The NexTrac

®

AWD device is our latest product innovation that produces outstanding stability and traction while promoting better fuel economy. The NexTrac AWD device launched in 2008 on the Hyundai Santa Fe, Tucson and KIA Sportage.

On January 31, 2011, the Company acquired the Traction Systems division of Haldex Group, a leading provider of innovative AWD products for the global vehicle industry headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden. This acquisition is expected to accelerate BorgWarner's growth in the global AWD market as it continues to shift toward FWD based vehicles. The acquisition will add industry leading AWD technologies for FWD based vehicles, with a strong European customer base, to BorgWarner's existing portfolio of front and rear-wheel drive based products. This enables BorgWarner to provide global customers a broader range of AWD solutions to meet their vehicle needs.

With the trend toward vehicle electrification gaining momentum, the Company is also applying its years of expertise to deliver robust and highly efficient single and multiple speed electric gear reduction solutions for hybrids and electric vehicles. Currently, we supply our eGearDrive

®

single-speed gearbox to the Ford Transit Connect Electric. We are actively engaged with traditional and non-traditional OEMs on a number of other transmission programs for plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles.



Joint Ventures

As of December 31, 2011, the Company had 10 joint ventures in which it had a less-than-100% ownership interest. Results from the seven joint ventures in which the Company is the majority owner are consolidated as part of the Company's results. Results from the three joint ventures in which the Company's effective ownership interest is 50% or less, were reported by the Company using the equity method of accounting.

Management of the unconsolidated joint ventures is shared with the Company's respective joint venture partners. Certain information concerning the Company's joint ventures is set forth below:

________________

(a)

All sales figures are for the year ended December 31, 2011, except NSK-Warner and Turbo Energy Limited. NSK-Warner’s sales are reported for the 12 months ended November 30, 2011. Turbo Energy Limited’s sales are reported for the 12 months ended September 30, 2011.

(b)

The Company made purchases from Turbo Energy Limited totaling $22.5 million,  $22.9 million and $24.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

(c)

BorgWarner Inc. owns 50% of NSK-Warner, which has a 40% interest in BorgWarner Transmission Systems Korea Ltd. This gives the Company an additional indirect effective ownership percentage of 20%. This results in a total effective ownership interest of 80%.

Financial Information About Geographic Areas

During the year ended December 31, 2011, approximately

76%

of the Company's consolidated net sales were outside the United States ("U.S."), including exports. However, a portion of such sales were to OEMs headquartered outside the U.S. that produce vehicles that are, in turn, exported to the U.S.

Refer to Note 19, “Reporting Segments and Related Information,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for financial information about geographic areas.

Product Lines and Customers

During the year ended December 31, 2011, approximately 78% of the Company's net sales were for light vehicle applications; approximately 10% were for commercial vehicle applications; approximately 6% were for off-highway vehicle applications; and approximately 6% were to distributors of aftermarket replacement parts.



The Company’s worldwide net sales to the following customers (including their subsidiaries) were approximately as follows:

No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales in any of the years  presented.

The Company's automotive products are generally sold directly to OEMs, substantially pursuant to negotiated annual contracts, long-term supply agreements or terms and conditions as may be modified by the parties. Deliveries are subject to periodic authorizations based upon the production schedules of the OEMs. The Company typically ships its products directly from its plants to the OEMs.

Sales and Marketing

Each of the Company's business units within its two reporting segments has its own sales function. Account executives for each of our business units are assigned to serve specific OEM customers for one or more of a business unit's products. Our account executives spend the majority of their time in direct contact with OEM purchasing and engineering employees and are responsible for servicing existing business and for identifying and obtaining new business.  Because of their close relationship with OEMs, account executives are able to identify and meet customers' needs based upon their knowledge of our products design and manufacturing capabilities. Upon securing a new order, account executives participate in product launch team activities and serve as a key interface with the customers.

In addition, the sales and marketing employees of our Engine and Drivetrain reporting segments often work together to explore cross-development opportunities for the business units. The development of DualTronic®, the Company's wet-clutch and control-system technology for a new-concept automated transmission, is an example of a successful collaboration.

Seasonality

Our operations are directly related to the automotive industry. Consequently, we may experience seasonal fluctuations to the extent automotive vehicle production slows, such as in the summer months when many customer plants typically close for model year changeovers or vacations. Historically, model changeovers or vacations have generally resulted in lower sales volume in the third quarter.

Research and Development

The Company conducts advanced Engine and Drivetrain research at the reporting segment level. This advanced engineering function looks to leverage know-how and expertise across product lines to create new Engine and Drivetrain systems and modules that can be commercialized. A venture capital fund that was created by the Company as seed money for new innovation and collaboration across businesses is managed by this function.

In addition, each of the Company's business units within its two reporting segments has its own research and development (“R&D”) organization, including engineers and technicians, engaged in R&D activities at facilities worldwide. The Company also operates testing facilities such as prototype, measurement and calibration, life cycle testing and dynamometer laboratories.



By working closely with the OEMs and anticipating their future product needs, the Company's R&D personnel conceive, design, develop and manufacture new proprietary automotive components and systems. R&D personnel also work to improve current products and production processes. The Company believes its commitment to R&D will allow it to obtain new orders from its OEM customers.

The Company's net R&D expenditures are included in selling, general and administrative expenses of the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Customer reimbursements are netted against gross R&D expenditures as they are considered a recovery of cost. Customer reimbursements for prototypes are recorded net of prototype costs based on customer contracts, typically either when the prototype is shipped or when it is accepted by the customer. Customer reimbursements for engineering services are recorded when performance obligations are satisfied in accordance with the contract and accepted by the customer. Financial risks and rewards transfer upon shipment, acceptance of a prototype component by the customer or upon completion of the performance obligation as stated in the respective customer agreement.

Net R&D expenditures as a percentage of net sales were

3.4%

,

3.3%

and

3.9%

in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company has contracts with several customers at the Company's various R&D locations. No such contract exceeded

5%

of net R&D expenditures in any of the years presented.

Patents and Licenses

The Company has more than 4,000 active domestic and foreign patents and patent applications pending or under preparation, and receives royalties from licensing patent rights to others. While it considers its patents on the whole to be important, the Company does not consider any single patent, any group of related patents or any single license essential to its operations in the aggregate or to the operations of any of the Company's business groups individually. The expiration of the patents individually and in the aggregate is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial position or future operating results. The Company owns numerous trademarks, some of which are valuable, but none of which are essential to its business in the aggregate.

The Company owns the “BorgWarner” and “Borg-Warner Automotive” trade names and housemarks, and variations thereof, which are material to the Company's business.

Competition

The Company's reporting segments compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. Many of these competitors are larger and have greater resources than the Company. Technological innovation, application engineering development, quality, price, delivery and program launch support are the primary elements of competition.



The Company’s major competitors by product type follow:

In addition, a number of the Company's major OEM customers manufacture, for their own use and for others, products that compete with the Company's products. Other current OEM customers could elect to manufacture products to meet their own requirements or to compete with the Company. There is no assurance that the Company's business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates.

For many of its products, the Company's competitors include suppliers in parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs, lower health care costs, lower tax rates and, in some cases, export subsidies and/or raw materials subsidies. Also, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors."

Workforce

As of December 31, 2011, the Company had a salaried and hourly workforce of approximately 19,250 (as compared with approximately 17,500 at December 31, 2010), of which approximately 5,300 were in the U.S.  Approximately 22% of the Company's U.S. workforce is unionized. The workforces at certain international facilities are also unionized. The Company believes the present relations with our workforce to be satisfactory.

Our only domestic collective bargaining agreement is for our Ithaca and Cortland, New York facilities. This agreement expires in September 2012.



Raw Materials

The Company uses a variety of raw materials in the production of its automotive products including steel, aluminum, copper, nickel, plastic resins and certain alloy elements. Manufacturing operations for each of the Company's operating segments are dependent upon natural gas, fuel oil and electricity.

Commodity prices rose in 2011 due to expanding global demand and cautious capacity recovery which constrained supply. The Company uses a variety of tactics in order to limit the impact of supply shortages and inflationary pressures. The Company's global procurement organization works to accelerate cost reductions, purchases from lower cost regions, supplier rationalization, risk mitigation efforts and collaborative buying activities. In addition, the Company uses long-term contracts, cost sharing arrangements, design changes, customer buy programs and limited financial instruments to help control costs. The Company intends to use similar measures in 2012 and beyond.  Refer to Note 10, “Financial Instruments,” of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for information related to the Company's hedging activities.

For 2012, the Company believes that its supplies of raw materials are adequate and available from multiple sources to support its manufacturing requirements.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors

The following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impact our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business including its financial performance, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

Risks related to our industry

Conditions in the automotive industry may adversely affect our business.

Our financial performance depends on conditions in the global automotive industry. Automotive and truck production and sales are cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors including interest rates, consumer credit, and consumer spending and preferences. Economic declines that result in significant reduction in automotive or truck production would have a material adverse affect on our sales to OEMs.



We face strong competition.

We compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell products similar to ours. Price, quality, delivery, technological innovation, application engineering development and program launch support are the primary elements of competition. Our competitors include vertically integrated units of our major OEM customers, as well as a large number of independent domestic and international suppliers. We are not as large as a number of these companies and do not have as many financial or other resources. Although OEMs have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers, a number of our major OEM customers manufacture products for their own uses that directly compete with our products. These OEMs could elect to manufacture such products for their own uses in place of the products we currently supply. The competitive environment has changed dramatically over the past few years as our traditional U.S. OEM customers, faced with intense international competition, have expanded their worldwide sourcing of components. As a result, we have experienced competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages, such as lower labor costs, lower health care costs, lower tax rates and, in some cases, export or raw materials subsidies. Increased competition could adversely affect our business.

Risks related to our business

We are under substantial pressure from OEMs to reduce the prices of our products.

There is substantial and continuing pressure on OEMs to reduce costs, including costs of products we supply. Annual price reductions to OEM customers appear to have become a permanent feature of our business environment. To maintain our profit margins, we seek price reductions from our suppliers, improve production processes to increase manufacturing efficiency, update product designs to reduce costs and develop new products, the benefits of which support stable or increased prices. Our ability to pass through increased raw material costs to our OEM customers is limited, with cost recovery often less than 100% and often on a delayed basis. Inability to reduce costs in an amount equal to annual price reductions, increases in raw material costs, and increases in employee wages and benefits could have an adverse effect on our business.

We continue to face highly volatile costs of commodities used in the production of our products.

The Company uses a variety of commodities (including steel, nickel, copper, aluminum, plastic resins, other raw materials and energy) and materials purchased in various forms such as castings, powder metal, forgings, stampings and bar stock. Increasing commodity costs will have an impact on our results.  We have sought to alleviate the impact of increasing costs by including a material pass-through provision in our customer contracts wherever possible and by selectively hedging certain commodity exposures. Customers frequently challenge these contractual provisions and rarely pay the full cost of any materials increases. The discontinuation of ability to pass-through or hedge increasing commodity costs would adversely affect our business.

From time to time, commodity prices may also fall rapidly. When this happens, suppliers may withdraw capacity from the market until prices improve which may cause periodic supply interruptions. The same may be true of our transportation carriers and energy providers.

We use important intellectual property in our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected.

We own important intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements. Our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve. Our competitors may develop



technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license. Further, as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the protection of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases, despite efforts we undertake to protect them. Developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights, and any inability to protect these rights, could materially adversely impact our business and our competitive position.

We are subject to business continuity risks associated with increasing centralization of our information technology systems.

To improve efficiency and reduce costs, we have regionally centralized the information systems that support our business processes such as invoicing, payroll and general management operations.  If the centralized systems are disrupted or disabled, key business processes could be interrupted, which could adversely affect our business.

Our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel.

Our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce worldwide.  Any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees in numbers sufficient for our needs could adversely affect our business.

Part of our workforce is unionized which could subject us to work stoppages.

As of December 31, 2011, approximately 22% of our U.S. workforce was unionized. Our only domestic collective bargaining agreement is for our Ithaca and Cortland, New York facilities. This agreement expires in September 2012. The workforce at certain of our international facilities is also unionized. A prolonged dispute with our employees could have an adverse effect on our business.

We are impacted by the rising cost of providing retirement benefits and certain retirement benefit plans we sponsor are currently unfunded or underfunded.

We sponsor certain retirement benefit plans worldwide that are unfunded or underfunded and will require cash payments. If the performance of the assets in our funded pension plans do not meet our expectations, if medical costs continue to increase or actuarial assumptions are modified, our required cash payments may be higher than we expect.

We are subject to extensive environmental regulations.

Our operations are subject to laws governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharges to waters and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste and other materials. The operation of automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur material costs or liabilities as a result. Through various acquisitions over the years, we have acquired a number of manufacturing facilities, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur material costs and liabilities relating to activities that predate our ownership. In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental, health and safety laws that may be adopted in the future. Costs associated with failure to comply with environmental regulations could have an adverse effect on our business.



We have contingent liabilities related to environmental, product warranties, regulatory matters, litigation and other claims.

We and certain of our current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and equivalent state laws.

We provide product warranties to our customers for some of our products. Under these product warranties, we may be required to bear costs and expenses for the repair or replacement of these products. We cannot assure you that costs and expenses associated with these product warranties will not be material, or that those costs will not exceed any amounts accrued for such product warranties in our financial statements.

We are currently, and may in the future become, subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes. These claims typically arise in the normal course of business and may include, but not be limited to, commercial or contractual disputes with our suppliers, intellectual property matters, personal injury, environmental and employment claims. There is a possibility that such claims may have an adverse impact on our business that is greater than we anticipate.

Negative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our business.

Adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and other tax accruals that could adversely affect our financial performance.

Additionally, we are subject to tax audits by governmental authorities in the U.S. and numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions, which are inherently uncertain. Negative or unexpected results from one or more such tax audits or changes to tax laws governing the jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect our business.

Our growth strategy may prove unsuccessful.

We have a stated goal of increasing revenues and operating income at a rate greater than global vehicle production by increasing content per vehicle with innovative new components and through select acquisitions. We may not meet our goal because of any of the following: (a) the failure to develop new products which will be purchased by our customers; (b) technology changes rendering our products obsolete; (c) a reversal of the trend of supplying systems (which allows us to increase content per vehicle) instead of components; and (d) the failure to find suitable acquisition targets or the failure to integrate operations of acquired businesses quickly and cost affectively. Failure to execute our growth strategy could adversely affect our business.

We are subject to risks related to our international operations.

We have manufacturing and technical facilities in many regions including the Americas, Europe and Asia. For 2011, approximately

76%

of our sales were outside the U.S. Consequently, our results could be affected by changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies, trade restrictions or prohibitions, import or other charges or taxes, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, limitations on the repatriation of funds, changing economic conditions, unreliable intellectual property protection and legal systems, insufficient infrastructures, social unrest, political instability and disputes, and international terrorism. Compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations of various countries is burdensome and expensive.



A downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets.

Changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately impact our access to the debt capital markets and the costs we incur to borrow funds. If ratings for our debt fall below investment grade, our access to the debt capital markets could become restricted.

Additionally, our revolving credit agreement includes an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded.  The interest costs on our revolving credit agreement are based on a rating grid agreed to in our credit agreement.  Further, an increase in the level of our indebtedness and related interest costs may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing.

Risks related to our customers

We rely on sales to major customers.

We rely on sales to OEMs around the world of varying credit quality. Supply to several of these customers requires significant investment by the Company in working capital, plant and equipment. We base our growth projections, in part, on commitments made by our customers. These commitments generally renew yearly during a program life cycle. If actual production orders from our customers do not approximate such commitments due to any of a variety of factors including non-renewal of purchase orders, the customer's financial hardship or other unforeseen reasons, it could adversely affect our business.

Furthermore, some of our sales are concentrated. Our worldwide sales in 2011 to Volkswagen and Ford constituted approximately

19%

and

12%

, respectively, of our 2011 consolidated net sales.

We are sensitive to the affects of our major customers’ labor relations.

All three of our primary North American customers, Ford, Chrysler and General Motors, have major union contracts with the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America. Because of domestic OEMs' dependence on a single union, we are affected by labor difficulties and work stoppages at OEMs' facilities. Similarly, a majority of our global customers' operations outside of North America are also represented by various unions. Any extended work stoppage could have an adverse affect on our business.

Risks related to our suppliers

We could be adversely affected by supply shortages of components from our suppliers.

In an effort to manage and reduce the cost of purchased goods and services, we have been rationalizing our supply base. As a result, we are dependent on fewer sources of supply for certain components used in the manufacture of our products. The Company selects suppliers based on total value (including total landed price, quality, delivery, and technology), taking into consideration their production capacities and financial condition. We expect that they will deliver to our stated written expectations.

However, there can be no assurance that capacity limitations, labor unrest, weather emergencies, commercial disputes, government actions, riots, wars, sabotage, non-conforming parts, acts of terrorism, “Acts of God," or other problems experienced by our suppliers will not result in occasional shortages or delays in their supply of components to us. If we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers and could not procure the components from other sources, we would be unable to meet the production schedules for some of our key products and could miss customer delivery expectations. This would adversely affect our customer relations and business.



Suppliers’ economic distress could result in the disruption of our operations and could adversely affect our business.

Rapidly changing industry conditions such as volatile production volumes; credit tightness; changes in foreign currencies; raw material, commodity, transportation, and energy price escalation; drastic changes in consumer preferences; and others could adversely affect our supply chain, and sometimes with little advanced notice. These conditions could also result in increased commercial disputes and supply interruption risks. In certain instances, it would be difficult and expensive for us to change suppliers that are critical to our business. On occasion, we must provide financial support to distressed suppliers or take other measures to protect our supply lines. While we have taken definite actions to mitigate these factors, we cannot predict with certainty the potential adverse effects these costs might have on our business.

We are subject to possible insolvency of outsourced service providers.

The Company relies on third party service providers for administration of workers' compensation claims, health care benefits, pension benefits, stockholder and bondholder registration and similar services. These service providers contribute to the efficient conduct of the Company's business.  Insolvency of one or more of these service providers could adversely affect our business.

We are subject to possible insolvency of financial counterparties.

The Company engages in numerous financial transactions and contracts including insurance policies, letters of credit, credit line agreements, financial derivatives, and investment management agreements involving various counterparties. The Company is subject to the risk that one or more of these counterparties may become insolvent and therefore be unable to discharge its obligations under such contracts.

Other risks

A variety of other factors could adversely affect our business.

Any of the following could materially and adversely affect our business: the loss of or changes in supply contracts or sourcing strategies of our major customers or suppliers; start-up expenses associated with new vehicle programs or delays or cancellation of such programs, utilization of our manufacturing facilities, which can be dependent on a single product line or customer; inability to recover engineering and tooling costs; market and financial consequences of recalls that may be required on products we supplied; delays or difficulties in new product development; the possible introduction of similar or superior technologies by others; global excess capacity and vehicle platform proliferation; and the impact of natural disasters.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

INTRODUCTION

BorgWarner Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries (the “Company”) is a leading global supplier of highly engineered automotive systems and components primarily for powertrain applications. Our products help improve vehicle performance, fuel efficiency, stability and air quality. These products are manufactured and sold worldwide, primarily to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) of light vehicles (passenger cars, sport-utility vehicles ("SUVs"), vans and light-trucks). The Company's products are also sold to other OEMs of commercial vehicles (medium-duty trucks, heavy-duty trucks and buses) and off-highway vehicles (agricultural and construction machinery and marine applications). We also manufacture and sell our products to certain Tier One vehicle systems suppliers and into the aftermarket for light, commercial and off-highway vehicles. The Company operates manufacturing facilities serving customers in the Americas, Europe and Asia, and is an original equipment supplier to every major automotive OEM in the world.

The Company's products fall into two reporting segments: Engine and Drivetrain. The Engine segment's products include turbochargers, timing devices and chain products, emissions systems, thermal systems, diesel coldstart, gasoline ignition technology and cabin heaters. The Drivetrain segment's products include transmission components and systems and all-wheel drive torque management systems.

The table below summarizes the overall worldwide light vehicle production year over year percentage increases/(decreases) for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010:

________________

*

Data provided by CSM Worldwide.

The year over year net sales increase of

25.9%

for the year ended December 31, 2011 was better than the estimated worldwide market production increase of

2.8%

. Excluding the impact of strengthening foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, the second quarter 2010 purchase of Dytech Ensa S.L. and the first quarter 2011 purchase of Haldex Traction AB, net sales increased by approximately 17% during the year ended December 31, 2011. The above-market growth for the Company was driven by the industry's focus on fuel economy and lower emissions.

The year over year net sales increase of

42.7%

for the year ended December 31, 2010 was better than the estimated worldwide market production increase of

23.5%

. Excluding, the impact of weakening foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, and the second quarter 2010 purchase of Dytech Ensa S.L., net sales increased by approximately 41% during the year ended December 31, 2010.

Consolidated net sales to Volkswagen were approximately

19%

for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 and

22%

for the year ended December 31, 2009; and to Ford of approximately

12%

,

11%

and

12%

for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Both of our reporting segments had significant sales to the customers listed above. Such sales consisted of a variety of products to a variety of customer locations and regions. No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated net sales in any of the years presented.



The following table details our results of operations as a percentage of net sales:

Cost of sales

as a percentage of net sales was

80.2%

,

80.7%

and

85.8%

in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company's material cost of sales was approximately 50% of net sales in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. The Company's remaining cost to convert raw material to finished product, which includes direct labor and manufacturing overhead, has continued to improve during the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009 as a result of increased net sales and successful cost reduction actions. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was

19.8%

,

19.3%

and

14.2%

in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Selling, general and administrative

expenses

(“SG&A”) as a percentage of net sales were

8.7%

,

10.0%

and

11.6%

in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. SG&A expenses increased

$54.4 million

, or

9.6%

, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was primarily due to the

$58.7 million

, or

31.7%

, increase in research and development ("R&D") costs, which are included in SG&A expenses. SG&A as a percentage of net sales has continued to improve during the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009 primarily as a result of significant year over year increases in net sales.

R&D costs, net of customer reimbursements, was

$243.7 million

, or

3.4%

of net sales, in the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to

$185.0 million

, or

3.3%

of net sales, and

$155.2 million

, or

3.9%

of net sales, in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We will continue to invest in a number of cross-business R&D programs, as well as a number of other key programs, all of which are necessary for short and long-term growth. Our current long-term expectation for R&D spending is approximately 4% of net sales.

Restructuring expense

of

$50.3 million

for the year ended December 31, 2009, included

$9.0 million

relating to employee termination benefits,

$36.3 million

of asset impairment charges and

$5.0 million

of other charges. The Company's restructuring actions reduced its North American workforce by approximately


people, or

12%

; its European workforce by approximately


people, or

2%

; and its Asian workforce by approximately


people, or

3%

. Refer to Note 17, “Restructuring,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for further discussion.



Equity in affiliates' earnings, net of tax

was

$38.2 million

,

$39.6 million

and

$21.8 million

in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. This line item is primarily driven by the results of our 50% owned Japanese joint venture, NSK-Warner, and our 32.6% owned Indian joint venture, Turbo Energy Limited (“TEL”). The decrease in equity in affiliates' earnings for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 is primarily due to lower production volumes in Japan as a result of natural disasters. The significant increase in equity in affiliates' earnings for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 is primarily due to higher vehicle production in Asia. Refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for further discussion of NSK-Warner.

Interest expense and finance charges

were

$74.6 million

,

$68.8 million

and

$57.2 million

in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Interest expense and finance charges have  increased for the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to higher debt levels.

Provision (benefit) for income taxes

The provision (benefit) for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of

25.5%

for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared with rates of

17.1%

and

(103.4)%

for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The effective tax rate of 25.5% for the year ended December 31, 2011 includes $11.0 million of additional tax expense associated with the Company's patent infringement settlement, $2.7 million of additional tax expense associated with the loss on disposals and tax benefit of $6.2 million resulting from other tax adjustments. These other tax adjustments related to a change in state corporate income tax legislation as well as an adjustment of the Company's tax accounts as a result of the closure of certain tax audits. This rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to foreign rates, which differ from those in the U.S., the realization of certain business tax credits including foreign tax credits and favorable permanent differences between book and tax treatment for items, including equity in affiliates' earnings.  Excluding the impact of the patent infringement settlement, loss on disposals and the other tax adjustments mentioned above, the Company's annual effective tax rate associated with ongoing operations for 2011 was 24.8%.

The effective tax rate of

17.1%

for the year ended December 31, 2010 differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to foreign rates, which differ from those in the U.S., the realization of certain business tax credits including foreign tax credits and favorable permanent differences between book and tax treatment for items, including equity in affiliates' earnings. Excluding the impacts of the reversal of the valuation allowance on U.S. based foreign tax credits, the change in tax treatment for Medicare Part D subsidies, the BERU-Eichenauer equity investment gain and the Company's environmental litigation settlement, the Company's annual effective tax rate associated with on-going business operations was 21.7%.

The effective tax rate of

(103.4)%

for the year ended December 31, 2009 differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due a reduction in U.S. income; foreign rates, which differ from those in the U.S.; the realization of certain business tax credits including R&D and U.S. based foreign tax credits; and favorable permanent differences between book and tax treatment for items, including equity in affiliates' earnings.

Net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest, net of tax

of

$20.5 million

for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by

$1.7 million

and

$11.1 million

from the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increases during the year ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 are primarily related to higher sales and earnings by the Company's joint ventures.



Results By Reporting Segment

The Company's business is comprised of two reporting segments: Engine and Drivetrain. These segments are strategic business groups, which are managed separately as each represents a specific grouping of related automotive components and systems.

The Company allocates resources to each segment based upon the projected after-tax return on invested capital ("ROIC") of its business initiatives. ROIC is comprised of Adjusted EBIT after deducting notional taxes compared to the projected average capital investment required. Adjusted EBIT is comprised of earnings before interest, income taxes and noncontrolling interest (“EBIT") adjusted for restructuring, goodwill impairment charges, affiliates' earnings and other items not reflective of on-going operating profit or loss.

Adjusted EBIT is the measure of segment profit or loss used by the Company. The Company believes Adjusted EBIT is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our reporting segments.

The following tables present segment information, including sales and Adjusted EBIT, for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009:

Net Sales

Adjusted Earnings Before Interest,  Income Taxes and Noncontrolling Interest ("Adjusted EBIT")



The

Engine

15.3%

for the year ended December 31, 2011, up from

13.2%

in the year ended December 31, 2010. The net sales and Segment EBIT increases were primarily driven by strong global growth in all major product groups and continued cost management.

The Engine segment's net sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased

$1,177.6 million

, or

40.8%

, and segment EBIT increased

13.2%

for the year ended December 31, 2010, up from

7.6%

in the year ended December 31, 2009, due to a significant increase in customer production schedules in the U.S. and European markets and continued cost management.

The

Drivetrain

segment's net sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased

$473.1 million

, or

29.4%

from the year ended December 31, 2010. Excluding the impact of strengthening foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, and the first quarter 2011 acquisition of Haldex Traction AB, net sales increased approximately 14%. The net sales increase was a result of strong four-wheel drive system and traditional transmission component sales in South Korea and higher dual clutch transmission module sales in Europe. The Segment EBIT margin was

7.7%

in the year ended December 31, 2011, down from

8.5%

in the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to operational inefficiencies in its European operations and Traction Systems acquisition related expenses.

The Drivetrain segment's net sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased

$517.9 million

, or

47.4%

, and segment EBIT increased

$150.5 million

from the year ended December 31, 2009. Excluding the impact of weaker foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, net sales increased approximately 49%. The net sales increase was primarily driven by strong growth of transmission components and torque management devices in Europe, Asia and the U.S. The Segment EBIT margin was

8.5%

in the year ended December 31, 2010, up from

(1.2)%

in the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to higher global production of light trucks and sport utility vehicles equipped with its torque transfer products and continued cost management.

Corporate

represents headquarters' expenses not directly attributable to the individual segments, expenses associated with divested operations and equity in affiliates' earnings. This net expense was

$107.4 million

,

$111.0 million

and

$111.3 million

for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Outlook

Our overall outlook for 2012 is positive.  The Company expects global production volumes to be higher in 2012 compared with 2011. In Europe, we expect production volumes to decline in 2012 compared with 2011. However, we expect that higher adoption rates of BorgWarner products around the world will result in sales growth for the Company above global production growth in 2012.

The Company maintains a positive long-term outlook for its global business and is committed to new product development and strategic capital investments to enhance its product leadership strategy. The trends that are driving our long-term growth are expected to continue, including the growth of direct injection diesel and gasoline engines worldwide, the increased adoption of automated transmissions in Europe and Asia-Pacific, and the move to variable cam and chain engine timing systems in both Europe and Asia-Pacific.



LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Company had

$359.6 million

of cash on hand at December 31, 2011. On June 30, 2011, the Company amended and extended its

$550 million

multi-currency revolving credit facility (which included a feature that allowed the Company's borrowings to be increased to

$600 million

) to a

$650 million

multi-currency revolving credit facility (which includes a feature that allows the Company's borrowings to be increased to

$1 billion

). The facility provides for borrowings through June 30, 2016 and is guaranteed by the Company's material domestic subsidiaries. The Company has two key financial covenants as part of the credit agreement. These covenants are a debt compared to EBITDA (“Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization”) test and an interest coverage test. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2011 and expects to remain compliant in future periods. At December 31, 2011, the Company had

$70.0 million

of outstanding borrowings under this facility.  There were no outstanding borrowings under this facility at December 31, 2010.

On September 8, 2010, the Company amended the December 21, 2009 Receivable Purchase Agreement, which increased the accounts receivable securitization facility from

$50 million

to

$80 million

. This facility matures on December 21, 2012.

On April 9, 2009, the Company issued

$373.8 million

in convertible senior notes due April 15, 2012. In accordance with the original terms of the agreement, the Company has an option to settle the convertible senior notes through delivering cash, shares of its common stock or a combination thereof. On December 13, 2011, the Company announced its intention to settle the convertible senior notes through delivering shares of its common stock, currently held in treasury stock.

On February 11, 2011, the Company filed a new universal shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission, under which an unlimited amount of various debt and equity instruments could be issued.

From a credit quality perspective, the Company has a credit rating of BBB from both Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings. On October 11, 2011, Moody's upgraded the Company's credit rating from Baa3 to Baa2. On May 27, 2011, Fitch upgraded the Company's outlook to positive. The current outlook from Standard & Poor’s and Moody's Ratings is stable. None of the Company’s debt agreements require accelerated repayment in the event of a downgrade in credit ratings.

Capitalization

Balance sheet debt increased by

$148.7 million

and cash on hand decreased by

$90.3 million

compared to December 31, 2010, primarily due to the acquisition of the Haldex Traction AB and treasury share repurchases.



Total equity increased by

$143.2 million

in the year ended December 31, 2011 as follows:

The currency translation component of other comprehensive income decreased during the year ended December 31, 2011 primarily due to the strengthening foreign currencies, primarily the Euro.

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was

$708.2 million

,

$538.9 million

and

$351.0 million

in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The  increase in the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily reflects higher earnings.  The  increase in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily reflects higher earnings, offset by higher working capital needs.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was

$564.5 million

,

$429.5 million

and

$154.8 million

in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  This increases in the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 are primarily due to increased capital spending and higher payments for businesses acquired, net of cash acquired. Year over year capital spending increases of

$117.1 million

and

$104.6 million

during the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, were primarily due to higher spending levels required to meet increased level of program launches worldwide.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities was

$219.7 million

and

$13.2 million

for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  Net cash provided by financing activities was

$44.8 million

for the year ended December 31, 2009.  The

$206.5 million

increase in cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 reflects lower net borrowings of

$133.2 million

, an increase in the Company's purchases of treasury stock of

$31.9 million

and the purchase of the noncontrolling interest's 40% share of BorgWarner Vikas Emissions Systems India Private Limited of

$29.4 million

.



The

$58.0 million

increase in cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 reflects the Company's purchase of treasury stock of

$325.7 million

, which was partially offset by increased proceeds from stock options, including tax benefit of

$58.4 million

and net borrowings of

$153.9 million

and payments made for noncontrolling interest acquired of

$48.5 million

and dividends paid to BorgWarner shareholders of

$13.8 million

during the year ended December 31, 2009.

The Company's significant contractual obligation payments at December 31, 2011 are as follows:

________________

(a)

Other post employment benefits, excluding pensions, include anticipated future payments to cover retiree medical and life insurance benefits. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures related to the Company’s other post employment benefits.

(b)

Since the timing and amount of payments for funded defined benefit pension plans are usually not certain for future years such potential payments are not shown in this table, except for the Company’s settlement agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") to make payments of $15 million in both 2012 and 2013.   Amount contained in “After 2016” column is for unfunded plans and includes estimated payments through 2021. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures related to the Company’s pension benefits.

(c)

The Company's 3.50% convertible senior notes due April 15, 2012, with a face value of $373.8 million, will be settled in common stock currently held in treasury.

(d)

Projection is based upon actual fixed rates where appropriate, and a projected floating rate for the variable rate portion of the total debt portfolio. The floating rate projection is based upon current market conditions and rounded to the nearest 50th basis point (0.50%), which is 5.5% for this purpose. Projection is also based upon debt being redeemed upon maturity.

(e)

See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures related to the Company’s income taxes.

(f)

See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures related to the Company’s environmental contingencies.

We believe that the combination of cash from operations, cash balances, available credit facilities and the remaining shelf registration capacity will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for our current level of operations and our planned operations for the foreseeable future. We will continue to balance our needs for internal growth, external growth, debt reduction and cash conservation.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company has certain leases that are recorded as operating leases. Types of operating leases include leases on the headquarters facility, an airplane, vehicles and certain office equipment. The total expected future cash outlays for operating lease obligations at December 31, 2011 is

$72.8 million

. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on operating leases, including future minimum payments.

Pension and Other Post Employment Benefits

The Company's policy is to fund its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with applicable government regulations and to make additional contributions when appropriate. At December 31, 2011, all



legal funding requirements had been met. The Company contributed

$37.0 million

, $25.1 million and $39.3 million to its defined benefit pension plans in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company expects to contribute a total of

$30 million

to

$40 million

into its defined benefit pension plans during 2012, including

$15 million

related to the Company's settlement agreement with the PBGC.  Of the

$30 million

to

$40 million

in projected 2012 contributions,

$21.5 million

are contractual obligations, while the remaining payments are discretionary.

The funded status of all pension plans was a net unfunded position of

$236.4 million

and

$210.4 million

at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Of these amounts,

$128.7 million

and

$128.0 million

at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, were related to plans in Germany, where there is not a tax deduction allowed under the applicable regulations to fund the plans; hence the common practice is to make contributions as benefit payments become due.

Other post employment benefits primarily consist of post employment health care benefits for certain employees and retirees of the Company's U.S. operations. The Company funds these benefits as retiree claims are incurred. Other post employment benefits had an unfunded status of

$251.0 million

and

$261.9 million

at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

The Company believes it will be able to fund the requirements of these plans through cash generated from operations or other available sources of financing for the foreseeable future.

See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits.

OTHER MATTERS

Contingencies

In the normal course of business, the Company is party to various commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints, including matters involving warranty claims, intellectual property claims, general liability and various other risks. It is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the Company will ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal matters or, if not, what the impact might be. The Company's environmental and product liability contingencies are discussed separately below. The Company's management does not expect that the results in any of these commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Litigation

In January 2006, BorgWarner Diversified Transmission Products Inc. ("DTP"), a subsidiary of the Company, filed a declaratory judgment action in United States District Court, Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis Division) against the United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implements Workers of America (“UAW”) Local No. 287 and Gerald Poor, individually and as the representative of a defendant class. DTP sought the Court's affirmation that DTP did not violate the Labor-Management Relations Act or the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) by unilaterally amending certain medical plans effective April 1, 2006 and October 1, 2006, prior to the expiration of the then-current collective bargaining agreements. On September 10, 2008, the Court found that DTP's reservation of the right to make such amendments reducing the level of benefits provided to retirees was limited by its collectively bargained health insurance agreement with the UAW, which did not expire until April 24, 2009. Thus, the amendments were untimely. In 2008, the Company recorded a charge of

$4.0 million

as a result of the Court's decision.

DTP filed a declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court, Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis Division) against the UAW Local No. 287 and Jim Barrett and others, individually and as



representatives of a defendant class, on February 26, 2009 again seeking the Court's affirmation that DTP will not violate the Labor - Management Relations Act or ERISA by modifying the level of benefits provided retirees to make them comparable to other Company retiree benefit plans after April 24, 2009. Certain retirees, on behalf of themselves and others, filed a mirror-image action in the United States District Court, Eastern District of Michigan (Southern Division) on March 11, 2009, for which a class has been certified. During the last quarter of 2009, the action pending in Indiana was dismissed, while the action in Michigan is continuing and in the discovery phase. The Company is vigorously defending against the suit.  This contingency is subject to many uncertainties, therefore based on the information available to date, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the amount or the range of potential loss, if any.

Environmental

The Company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“Superfund”) and equivalent state laws and, as such, may presently be liable for the cost of clean-up and other remedial activities at


such sites. Responsibility for clean-up and other remedial activities at a Superfund site is typically shared among PRPs based on an allocation formula.

The Company believes that none of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Generally, this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not material or the liability will be shared with other PRPs, although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter.

Based on information available to the Company (which in most cases includes: an estimate of allocation of liability among PRPs; the probability that other PRPs, many of whom are large, solvent public companies, will fully pay the cost apportioned to them; currently available information from PRPs and/or federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs; remediation alternatives; and estimated legal fees), the Company has an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities with a balance of

$10.4 million

at December 31, 2011. The accrued amounts do not exceed

$3.0 million

related to any individual site except for the Crystal Springs site discussed below, and we do not believe that the costs related to any of these sites will have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The Company expects to pay out substantially all of the amounts accrued for environmental liability over the next five years.

In connection with the sale of Kuhlman Electric Corporation, the Company agreed to indemnify the buyer and Kuhlman Electric for certain environmental liabilities, then unknown to the Company, relating to certain operations of Kuhlman Electric that pre-date the Company's 1999 acquisition of Kuhlman Electric. In 2007 and 2008, lawsuits were filed against Kuhlman Electric and others, including the Company, on behalf of approximately


plaintiffs, alleging personal injury relating to alleged environmental contamination at its Crystal Springs, Mississippi plant. The Company entered into a settlement in July 2010 regarding the personal injury claims of the plaintiffs and those of approximately

2,700

unfiled claimants represented by those plaintiffs' attorneys. In exchange for, among other things, the dismissal with prejudice of these lawsuits and the release of claims by the unfiled claimants, the Company agreed to pay up to

$28 million

in settlement funds, which was expensed in the second quarter of 2010. The Company paid

$13.9 million

in November 2010 and made the final payment of

$13.9 million

in February 2011. Litigation concerning indemnification is pending and the Company may in the future become subject to further legal proceedings.



Product Liability

Like many other industrial companies who have historically operated in the U.S., the Company (or parties the Company is obligated to indemnify) continues to be named as one of many defendants in asbestos-related personal injury actions. We believe that the Company's involvement is limited because, in general, these claims relate to a few types of automotive friction products that were manufactured many years ago and contained encapsulated asbestos. The nature of the fibers, the encapsulation and the manner of use lead the Company to believe that these products are highly unlikely to cause harm. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, the Company had approximately

16,000

and

17,000

pending asbestos-related product liability claims, respectively. Of the approximately

16,000

outstanding claims at December 31, 2011, approximately half were pending in jurisdictions that have undergone significant tort and judicial reform activities subsequent to the filing of these claims.

The Company's policy is to vigorously defend against these lawsuits and the Company has been successful in obtaining dismissal of many claims without any payment. The Company expects that the vast majority of the pending asbestos-related product liability claims where it is a defendant (or has an obligation to indemnify a defendant) will result in no payment being made by the Company or its insurers. In 2011, of the approximately

1,800

claims resolved,


(

16%

) resulted in any payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the Company. In the full year of 2010, of the approximately

7,700

claims resolved,


(

3%

) resulted in any payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the Company.

Prior to June 2004, the settlement and defense costs associated with all claims were paid by the Company's primary layer insurance carriers under a series of funding arrangements. In addition to the primary insurance available for asbestos-related claims, the Company has substantial excess insurance coverage available for potential future asbestos-related product claims. In June 2004, primary layer insurance carriers notified the Company of the alleged exhaustion of their policy limits.

A declaratory judgment action was filed in January 2004 in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois by Continental Casualty Company and related companies (“CNA”) against the Company and certain of its other historical general liability insurers. The court has issued a number of interim rulings and discovery is continuing. CNA and the Company have entered into a settlement agreement resolving their coverage disputes, pursuant to which CNA will pay amounts over the next four years to the Company. The Company is vigorously pursuing the litigation against the remaining insurers.

Although it is impossible to predict the outcome of pending or future claims or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the state or federal levels, due to the encapsulated nature of the products, the Company's experience in vigorously defending and resolving claims in the past, and the Company's significant insurance coverage with solvent carriers as of the date of this filing, management does not believe that asbestos-related product liability claims are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

To date, the Company has paid and accrued

$190.9 million

in defense and indemnity in advance of insurers' reimbursement and has received

$81.1 million

in cash and notes from insurers, including CNA. The net balance of

$109.8 million

, is expected to be fully recovered, of which approximately

$33 million

is estimated to be recovered within one year. Timing of recovery is dependent on final resolution of the declaratory judgment action referred to above or additional negotiated settlements. At December 31, 2010, insurers owed

$120.6 million

in association with these claims.

On April 5, 2010, the Superior Court of New Jersey Appellate Division affirmed a lower court judgment in an asbestos-related action against the Company and others. The Company filed its Notice of Petition to the Supreme Court of New Jersey in late April, seeking to appeal the decisions of the lower courts. On July 8, 2010 the Supreme Court of New Jersey denied the Company's Notice of Petition appealing the decision of the lower courts. The total claim of

$40.7 million

was paid by the Company in July 2010.



In addition to the

$109.8 million

net balance relating to past settlements and defense costs, the Company has estimated a liability of

$61.7 million

for claims asserted, but not yet resolved and their related defense costs at December 31, 2011. The Company also has a related asset of

$61.7 million

to recognize proceeds from the insurance carriers. Insurance carrier reimbursement of

100%

is expected based on the Company's experience, its insurance contracts and decisions received to date in the declaratory judgment action referred to above. At December 31, 2010, the comparable value of the insurance asset and accrued liability was

$50.6 million

.

The amounts recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the estimated future settlement of existing claims are as follows:

The Company cannot reasonably estimate possible losses, if any, in excess of those for which it has accrued, because it cannot predict how many additional claims may be brought against the Company (or parties the Company has an obligation to indemnify) in the future, the allegations in such claims, the possible outcomes, or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the State or Federal levels.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management makes estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, relating to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our most critical accounting policies are discussed below.

Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the accompanying notes, as well as, the amounts of revenues and expenses reported during the periods covered by these financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss pass to the customer, which is usually upon shipment of product. Although the Company may enter into long-term supply agreements with its major customers, each shipment of goods is treated as a separate sale and the prices are not fixed over the life of the agreements.



Cost of sales

The Company includes materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead within cost of sales. Manufacturing overhead is comprised of indirect materials, indirect labor, factory operating costs and other such costs associated with manufacturing products for sale.

Impairment of long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets

The Company reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets, whether held for use or disposal, including other amortizable intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 360.  A recoverability review is performed using the undiscounted cash flows if there is a triggering event.  If the undiscounted cash flow test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment, management will perform a fair value analysis.  Management determines fair value under ASC Topic 820 using the appropriate valuation technique of market, income or cost approach.  If the carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.

Management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable; however, changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect the valuations.  Long-lived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.  Significant judgments and estimates used by management when evaluating long-lived assets for impairment include: (i) an assessment as to whether an adverse event or circumstance has triggered the need for an impairment review; (ii) undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset; and (iii) fair value of the asset.

The Company recognized $36.3 million of asset impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2009 within restructuring expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

See Note 17, “Restructuring,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the Company's impairment of long-lived assets and a discussion of market-based measurements.

Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets

During the fourth quarter of each year or upon a triggering event, the Company reviews the goodwill assigned to each of its reporting units to identify those units with a fair value more-likely-than-not less than its carrying value.  With the exception of two reporting units that had recent acquisition or divestiture activity, a qualitative assessment was completed. This assessment evaluated various events and circumstances, such as macro economic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, relevant events and financial trends, that may impact a reporting unit's fair value. After completing this assessment, the Company determined it was more-likely-than-not the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting units qualitatively reviewed. A quantitative, "step one," impairment analysis, therefore, was not required.

For the two reporting units with recent acquisition or divestiture activity, the Company performed a quantitative, "step one," goodwill impairment analysis, which requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates. The basis of this goodwill impairment analysis is the Company's annual budget and long-range plan (“LRP”).  The annual budget and LRP includes a five year projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments and assumes the last year of the LRP data is a fair indication of the future performance. Because the LRP is estimated over a significant future period of time, those estimates and assumptions are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. Further, the market valuation models and other financial ratios used by the Company require certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to the Company's facts and circumstances. The Company believes the assumptions and estimates used to determine its estimated fair value are reasonable.  Different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value.



The primary assumptions affecting the Company's December 31, 2011 goodwill quantitative, "step one," impairment review are as follows:

•

Discount rate

: The Company used a

10%

weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) as the discount rate for future cash flows. The WACC is intended to represent a rate of return that would be expected by a market participant.

•

Operating income margin

: The Company used historical and expected operating income margins, which may vary based on the projections of each reporting unit being evaluated.

In addition to the above primary assumptions, the Company notes the following risk to volume and operating income assumptions that could have an impact on the discounted cash flow model:

•

The automotive industry is cyclical and the Company's results of operations would be adversely affected by industry downturns.

•

The Company is dependent on market segments that use our key products and would be affected by decreasing demand in those segments.

•

The Company is subject to risks related to international operations.

Based on the assumptions outlined above, the impairment testing conducted in the fourth quarter of 2011 indicated the Company's goodwill assigned to the two reporting units that were quantitatively assessed was not impaired. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis was completed indicating a

1%

increase in the discount rate or a

1%

decrease in the operating margin assumptions would not result in the carrying value exceeding the fair value of either of the reporting units quantitatively assessed.

See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding goodwill.

Product warranties

The Company provides warranties on some, but not all, of its products. The warranty terms are typically from

one to three years

. Provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold. These estimates are established using historical information about the nature, frequency and average cost of warranty claim settlements as well as product manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from third parties. Management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims. Management believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate; however, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to the accrual. Our warranty provision over the last three years, and as a percentage of net sales, has trended as follows:



The following table illustrates the sensitivity of a 25 basis point change (as a percentage of net sales) in the assumed warranty trend on the Company's accrued warranty liability:

At December 31, 2011, the total accrued warranty liability was

$72.7 million

. The accrual is represented as

$38.6 million

in current liabilities and

$34.1 million

in non-current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding product warranties.

Other loss accruals and valuation allowances

The Company has numerous other loss exposures, such as customer claims, workers' compensation claims, litigation and recoverability of assets. Establishing loss accruals or valuation allowances for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and ultimate realization. The Company estimates losses under the programs using consistent and appropriate methods; however, changes to its assumptions could materially affect the recorded accrued liabilities for loss or asset valuation allowances.

Environmental contingencies

The Company works with outside experts to determine a range of potential liability for environmental sites. The ranges for each individual site are then aggregated into a loss range for the total accrued liability. Management's estimate of the loss range for environmental liability, including conditional asset retirement obligations, for 2011 is between approximately $8 million and $23 million.  We record an accrual at the most probable amount within the range unless one cannot be determined; in which case we record the accrual at the low end of the range. At December 31, 2011, our total accrued environmental liability was

$11.5 million

, which includes our conditional asset retirement obligation under ASC Topic 410 of

$1.1 million

.

See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding environmental accrual.

Pension and other post employment defined benefits

The Company provides post employment defined benefits to a number of its current and former employees. Costs associated with post employment defined benefits include pension and post employment health care expenses for employees, retirees and surviving spouses and dependents.

The Company's defined benefit pension and non-pension postretirement employee benefit plans are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 715. Disability, early retirement and other postemployment employee benefits are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 712. The determination of the Company's obligation and expense for its pension and other postretirement employee benefits, such as retiree health care, is dependent on certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. Certain assumptions, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rate, rates of increase in compensation and health care costs trends are described in Note 11, “Retirement Benefit Plans,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The effects of any modification to those assumptions are either recognized immediately or amortized over future periods in accordance with GAAP.

In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from assumptions used are accumulated and generally amortized over future periods. The primary assumptions affecting the Company's accounting for employee benefits under ASC Topics 712 and 715 as of December 31, 2011 are as follows:



•

Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets

:  The expected long-term rate of return is used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost. The required use of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year.  Over time, however, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is designed to approximate actual earned long-term returns. The expected long-term rate of return for pension assets has been determined based on various inputs, including historical returns for the different asset classes held by the Company's trusts and its asset allocation, as well as inputs from internal and external sources regarding expected capital market return, inflation and other variables.  The Company also considers the impact of active management of the plans' invested assets. In determining its pension expense for the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company used long-term rates of return on plan assets ranging from 1.75% to 9.00% outside of the U.S. and 7.50% in the U.S.

Actual returns on U.S. pension assets were 3.7%, 14.6% and 25.3% for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 7.50% for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Actual returns on U.K. pension assets were 3.3%, 13.3% and 15.1% for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 7.50% for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

•

Discount rate

:  The discount rate is used to calculate pension and postretirement employee benefit obligations (“OPEB”).  The discount rate assumption is based on a constant effective yield from matching projected plan cash flows to high quality (Aa) bond yields of corresponding maturities as of the measurement date.  The Company used discount rates ranging from 1.75% to 8.00% to determine its pension and other benefit obligations as of December 31, 2011, including weighted average discount rates of 4.42% in the U.S., 5.13% outside of the U.S., and 4.25% for U.S. other post employment health care plans.  The U.S. discount rate reflects the fact that our U.S. pension plan has been closed for new participants since 1989 (1999 for our U.S. health care plan), and with the closing of our Muncie facility in 2009, there will be negligible service cost going forward.

•

Health care cost trend

:  For postretirement employee health care plan accounting, the Company reviews external data and Company specific historical trends for health care cost to determine the health care cost trend rate assumptions.  In determining the projected benefit obligation for postretirement employee health care plans as of December 31, 2011, the Company used health care cost trend rates of 7.10%, declining to an ultimate trend rate of 5% by the year 2019.

While the Company believes that these assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the Company's pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations and its future expense.

The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for Company sponsored U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans on its 2012 pre-tax pension expense:

________________

* A 1 percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have a negligible impact on the Company’s U.S. 2012 pre-tax pension expense.



The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the Company’s U.S. OPEB interest expense:

The sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the Company's total 2012 U.S. OPEB expense is expected to be negligible, as any increase in interest expense will be offset by net actuarial gains.

The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a one-percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend related to the Company's OPEB obligation and service and interest cost:

See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the Company’s retirement benefit plans.

Income taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. In 2009, the Company recorded a valuation allowance that primarily represented foreign net operating losses and U.S. based foreign tax credits for which utilization was uncertain. In 2010, the Company recorded a reversal of the Company’s $21.2 million valuation allowance on U.S. based foreign tax credit carryforwards.

Management judgment is required in determining the Company’s provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the Company’s net deferred tax assets. In calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis, the Company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial performance of the operation recording the net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information. Since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to the Company’s valuation allowance may be necessary.

The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. at the federal and state level and numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is less than certain. Accruals for income tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of ASC Topic 605. The Company’s U.S. federal and certain state income tax returns and certain non-U.S. income tax returns are currently under various stages of audit by applicable tax authorities. Although the outcome of ongoing tax audits is always uncertain, management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax



returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments, if any, which may be proposed by the taxing authorities. At December 31, 2011, the Company has recorded a liability for its best estimate of the more likely than not loss on certain of its tax positions, which is included in other non-current liabilities. Nonetheless, the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year.

See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding income taxes.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") amended ASC Topic 210, "

Balance Sheet

," requiring companies to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position as well as instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement. This guidance is effective retrospectively for interim and annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. The Company anticipates the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In September 2011, the FASB amended ASC Topic 350, "

Intangibles - Goodwill and Other

," allowing companies to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test described in ASC Topic 350. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this standard for the year ended December 31, 2011. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In June 2011, the FASB amended ASC Topic 220, "

Comprehensive Income

," which requires the presentation of the components of net income and comprehensive income in one continuous statement or two consecutive statements and requires companies to separately disclose reclassifications from other comprehensive income into net income on the face of the financial statements. This guidance requires retrospective application and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company will reflect the change in presentation in all periods presented in future filings beginning with the period ending March 31, 2012. In December 2011, the FASB indefinitely deferred the requirement to separately disclose reclassifications from other comprehensive income into net income on the face of the Statement of Operations.

In May 2011, the FASB amended ASC Topic 820, “

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

,” which clarifies the application of existing fair value measurement guidance and amends the guidance to include increased transparency around valuation inputs and investment categorization. This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company anticipates the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

In October 2009, the FASB amended ASC Topic 605, "

Revenue Recognition

," which amends the criteria for separating consideration in multiple-deliverable arrangements and expands the disclosure requirements related to these arrangements. On January 1, 2011, the Company adopted this amendment to ASC Topic 605. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.



QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company's primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We are also affected by changes in the prices of commodities used or consumed in our manufacturing operations. Some of our commodity purchase price risk is covered by supply agreements with customers and suppliers. Other commodity purchase price risk is addressed by hedging strategies, which include forward contracts. The Company enters into derivative instruments only with high credit quality counterparties and diversifies its positions across such counterparties in order to reduce its exposure to credit losses. We do not engage in any derivative instruments for purposes other than hedging specific operating risks.

We have established policies and procedures to manage sensitivity to interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and commodity purchase price risk, which include monitoring the level of exposure to each market risk.  For quantitative disclosures about market risk, please refer to Note 10, "Financial Instruments," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for information with respect to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates.  The Company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs. The Company selectively uses interest rate swaps to reduce market value risk associated with changes in interest rates (fair value hedges). At December 31, 2011, the amount of debt with fixed interest rates was 62.4% of total debt, including the impact of the interest rate swaps.  Our earnings exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to floating money market rates.  A 10% increase or decrease in the average cost of our variable rate debt would result in a change in pre-tax interest expense of approximately $1.8 million, $1.6 million and $1.5 million in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The Company also measures interest rate risk by estimating the net amount by which the fair value of all of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities would be impacted by selected hypothetical changes in market interest rates.  Fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis.  Assuming a hypothetical instantaneous 10% increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2011, the net fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately $24 million.  Assuming a hypothetical instantaneous 10% decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2011, the net fair value of these instruments would decrease by approximately $23 million.  Our interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes a constant shift in interest rate yield curves.  The model, therefore, does not reflect the potential impact of changes in the relationship between short-term and long-term interest rates.  Interest rate sensitivity at December 31, 2011, measured in a similar manner, was slightly less than at December 31, 2010.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

Foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  Currently, our most significant currency exposures relate to the British Pound, the Euro, the Hungarian Forint, the Japanese Yen, the Swedish Krona and the South Korean Won.  We mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate risk by establishing local production facilities and related supply chain participants in the markets we serve, by invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of the products and by funding some of our investments in foreign markets through local currency loans and cross currency swaps.  Such non-U.S. Dollar debt was $280.4 million and $299.0 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  We also monitor our foreign currency exposure in each country and implement strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments.  In addition, the Company periodically enters into forward currency contracts in order to reduce exposure to exchange rate



risk related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.  As of December 31, 2011, the Company was holding foreign exchange derivatives with positive and negative fair market values of $2.7 million and $(2.9) million, respectively, of which $2.6 million in gains and $(2.4) million in losses mature in less than one year.

Commodity Price Risk

Commodity price risk is the possibility that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in the cost of raw materials used in the production of our products.  Commodity forward and option contracts are executed to offset our exposure to the potential change in prices mainly for various non-ferrous metals and natural gas consumption used in the manufacturing of vehicle components.  As of December 31, 2011, the Company had no forward and option commodity contracts outstanding.

Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

The matters discussed in this Item 7 include forward looking statements. See "Forward Looking Statements" at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INTRODUCTION

BorgWarner Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries (the “Company”) is a leading global supplier of highly engineered systems and components primarily for powertrain applications, which help to improve vehicle performance, fuel efficiency, stability and air quality. These products are manufactured and sold worldwide, primarily to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) of light vehicles (passenger cars, sport-utility vehicles ("SUVs"), vans and light-trucks). The Company's products are also sold to other OEMs of commercial vehicles (medium-duty trucks, heavy-duty trucks and buses) and off-highway vehicles (agricultural and construction machinery and marine applications). We also manufacture and sell our products to certain Tier One vehicle systems suppliers and into the aftermarket for light, commercial and off-highway vehicles. The Company operates manufacturing facilities serving customers in the Americas, Europe and Asia, and is an original equipment supplier to every major automotive OEM in the world.The Company's products fall into two reporting segments:  Engine and Drivetrain.

NOTE 1

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following paragraphs briefly describe the Company's significant accounting policies.

Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the accompanying notes, as well as, the amounts of revenues and expenses reported during the periods covered by these financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Concentrations of risk

Cash is maintained with several financial institutions.  Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and therefore bear minimal risk.

The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its suppliers and customers and, with the exception of certain financing transactions, does not require collateral from its OEM customers. Some automotive parts suppliers continue to experience commodity cost pressures and the effects of industry overcapacity. These factors have increased pressure on the industry's supply base, as suppliers cope with higher commodity costs, lower production volumes and other challenges. The Company receives certain of its raw materials from sole suppliers or a limited number of suppliers. The inability of a supplier to fulfill supply requirements of the Company could materially affect future operating results.

Principles of consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include all majority-owned subsidiaries with a controlling financial interest. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in

20%

to

50%

owned affiliates are accounted for under the equity method when the Company does not have a controlling financial interest.

Revenue recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss pass to the customer, which is usually upon shipment of product. Although the Company may enter into long-term supply agreements with its major customers, each shipment of goods is treated as a separate sale and the prices are not fixed over the life of the agreements.

Cost of sales

The Company includes materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead within cost of sales. Manufacturing overhead is comprised of indirect materials, indirect labor, factory operating costs and other such costs associated with manufacturing products for sale.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Cash

Cash is valued at fair market value. It is the Company's policy to classify all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less as cash.

Receivables, net

The Company securitizes certain receivables through third party financial institutions without recourse. The amount can vary each month based on the amount of underlying receivables. The Company continues to administer the collection of these receivables on behalf of the third party.

On April 24, 2009, the Company's

$50 million

accounts receivable securitization facility matured and was repaid. On December 21, 2009, the Company entered into a new

$50 million

accounts receivable securitization facility, which was amended on September 8, 2010 to increase the facility from

$50 million

to

$80 million

. This facility matures on December 21, 2012.

Inventories, net

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost of U.S. inventories is determined using the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method, while the foreign operations use the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) or average-cost methods. Inventory held by U.S. operations was

$100.6 million

and

$100.1 million

at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Such inventories, if valued at current cost instead of LIFO, would have been greater by

$15.3 million

and

$13.2 million

at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on inventories, net.

Pre-production costs related to long-term supply arrangements

Engineering, research and development and other design and development costs for products sold on long-term supply arrangements are expensed as incurred unless the Company has a contractual guarantee for reimbursement from the customer. Costs for molds, dies and other tools used to make products sold on long-term supply arrangements for which the Company either has title to the assets or has the non-cancelable right to use the assets during the term of the supply arrangement are capitalized in property, plant and equipment and   amortized to cost of sales over the shorter of the term of the arrangement or over the estimated useful lives of the assets, typically


to


years.  Costs for molds, dies and other tools used to make products sold on long-term supply arrangements for which the Company has a contractual guarantee for lump sum reimbursement from the customer are capitalized in prepayments and other current assets.

Property, plant and equipment, net

Property, plant and equipment is valued at cost less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and renewals of relatively minor items are generally charged to expense as incurred. Renewals of significant items are capitalized. Depreciation is generally computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Useful lives for buildings range from


to


years and useful lives for machinery and equipment range from


to


years. For income tax purposes, accelerated methods of depreciation are generally used. The Company's property, plant and equipment is held for use at December 31, 2011 and 2010.

See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on property, plant and equipment, net.

Impairment of long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets

The Company reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets, whether held for use or disposal, including other amortizing intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 360.  A recoverability review is performed using the undiscounted cash flows if there is a triggering event.  If the undiscounted cash flow test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment, management will perform a fair value analysis.  Management determines fair value under ASC Topic 820 using the appropriate valuation technique of market, income or cost approach.  If the carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable; however, changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect the valuations.  Long-lived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.  Significant judgments and estimates used by management when evaluating long-lived assets for impairment include: (i) an assessment as to whether an adverse event or circumstance has triggered the need for an impairment review; (ii) undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset; and (iii) fair valuation of the asset.

See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the Company's impairment of long-lived assets and a discussion of market-based measurements.

Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets

During the fourth quarter of each year or upon a triggering event, the Company reviews the goodwill assigned to each of its reporting units to identify those units with a fair value more-likely-than-not less than its carrying value.  With the exception of two reporting units that had recent acquisition or divestiture activity, a qualitative assessment was completed. This assessment evaluated various events and circumstances, such as macro economic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, relevant events and financial trends, that may impact a reporting unit's fair value. After completing this assessment, the Company determined it was more-likely-than-not the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting units qualitatively reviewed. A quantitative, "step one," impairment analysis, therefore, was not required.

For the two reporting units with recent acquisition or divestiture activity, the Company performed a quantitative, "step one," goodwill impairment analysis, which requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates. The basis of this goodwill impairment analysis is the Company's annual budget and long-range plan (“LRP”).  The annual budget and LRP includes a five year projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments and assumes the last year of the LRP data is a fair indication of the future performance. Because the LRP is estimated over a significant future period of time, those estimates and assumptions are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. Further, the market valuation models and other financial ratios used by the Company require certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to the Company's facts and circumstances.

A considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests.  While no impairment existed during the year ended December 31, 2011, different assumptions and estimates could materially change the estimated fair values.

See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets.

Product warranties

The Company provides warranties on some, but not all, of its products. The warranty terms are typically from

one to three years

. Provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold. These estimates are established using historical information about the nature, frequency and average cost of warranty claim settlements as well as product manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from third parties. Management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims. Management believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate; however, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to the accrual. The product warranty accrual is allocated to current and non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on product warranties.

Other loss accruals and valuation allowances

The Company has numerous other loss exposures, such as customer claims, workers' compensation claims, litigation and recoverability of assets. Establishing loss accruals or valuation allowances for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment in regard



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

to the risk exposure and ultimate realization. The Company estimates losses under the programs using consistent and appropriate methods, however, changes to its assumptions could materially affect the recorded accrued liabilities for loss or asset valuation allowances.

Derivative financial instruments

The Company recognizes that certain normal business transactions generate risk. Examples of risks include exposure to exchange rate risk related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency, changes in commodity costs and interest rates. It is the objective and responsibility of the Company to assess the impact of these transaction risks and offer protection from selected risks through various methods, including financial derivatives. Virtually all derivative instruments held by the Company are designated as hedges, have high correlation with the underlying exposure and are highly effective in offsetting underlying price movements. Accordingly, gains and losses from changes in qualifying hedge fair values are matched with the underlying transactions. All hedge instruments are carried at their fair value based on quoted market prices for contracts with similar maturities. The Company does not engage in any derivative transactions for purposes other than hedging specific risks.

See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on derivative financial instruments.

Foreign currency

The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars using the period-end exchange rate for assets and liabilities and an average exchange rate for each period for revenues, expenses and capital expenditures. The local currency is the functional currency for substantially all of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. Translation adjustments for foreign subsidiaries are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in equity. The Company recognizes transaction gains and losses arising from fluctuations in currency exchange rates on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in earnings as incurred, except for those transactions which hedge purchase commitments and for those intercompany balances which are designated as long-term investments.

See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Environmental contingencies

The Company accounts for environmental costs in accordance with ASC Topic 450. Costs related to environmental assessments and remediation efforts at operating facilities are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of that liability can be reasonably estimated. Estimated costs are recorded at undiscounted amounts, based on experience and assessments and are regularly evaluated. The liabilities are recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other non-current liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding environmental contingencies.

Pensions and other postretirement employee defined benefits

The Company's defined benefit pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 715. Disability, early retirement and other post employment employee benefits are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 712.

Pensions and other postretirement employee benefit costs and related liabilities and assets are dependent upon assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, health care cost trends, compensation and other factors. In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions used are accumulated and amortized over future periods, and accordingly, generally affect recognized expense in future periods.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the Company's pension and other postretirement employee defined benefit plans.

Income taxes

In accordance with ASC Topic 740, the Company's income tax expense is calculated based on expected income and statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates and requires the use of management's estimates and judgments.

See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding income taxes.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") amended ASC Topic 210, "

Balance Sheet

," requiring companies to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position as well as instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement. This guidance is effective retrospectively for interim and annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. The Company anticipates the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In September 2011, the FASB amended ASC Topic 350, "

Intangibles - Goodwill and Other

," allowing companies to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test described in ASC Topic 350. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this standard for the year ended December 31, 2011. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In June 2011, the FASB amended ASC Topic 220, "

Comprehensive Income

," which requires the presentation of the components of net income and comprehensive income in one continuous statement or two consecutive statements and requires companies to separately disclose reclassifications from other comprehensive income into net income on the face of the financial statements. This guidance requires retrospective application and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company will reflect the change in presentation in all periods presented in future filings beginning with the period ending March 31, 2012. In December 2011, the FASB indefinitely deferred the requirement to separately disclose reclassifications from other comprehensive income into net income on the face of the Statement of Operations.

In May 2011, the FASB amended ASC Topic 820, “

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

,” which clarifies the application of existing fair value measurement guidance and amends the guidance to include increased transparency around valuation inputs and investment categorization. This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company anticipates the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

In October 2009, the FASB amended ASC Topic 605, "

Revenue Recognition

," which amends the criteria for separating consideration in multiple-deliverable arrangements and expands the disclosure requirements related to these arrangements. On January 1, 2011, the Company adopted this amendment to ASC Topic 605. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS

The Company's net Research & Development ("R&D") expenditures are included in selling, general and administrative expenses of the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Customer reimbursements are netted against gross R&D expenditures as they are considered a recovery of cost. Customer reimbursements for prototypes are recorded net of prototype costs based on customer contracts, typically either when the prototype is shipped or when it is accepted by the customer. Customer reimbursements for engineering services are recorded when performance obligations are satisfied in accordance with the contract and accepted by the customer. Financial risks and rewards transfer upon shipment, acceptance of a prototype component by the customer or upon completion of the performance obligation as stated in the respective customer agreement.

The following table presents the Company’s gross and net expenditures on R&D activities:

Net R&D expenditures as a percentage of net sales were

3.4%

$26.2 million

of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2011, approximately

$22.6 million

of the total represents the amount, if recognized, would

affect the Company's effective income tax rate in future periods. This amount differs from the gross unrecognized tax benefits presented in the table due to the decrease in the U.S. federal income taxes which would occur upon recognition of the state tax benefits included therein.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The amount recognized in income tax expense for 2011 and 2010 is

$1.7 million

The Company has not recorded deferred income taxes on the difference between the book and tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries or foreign equity affiliates totaling approximately

$1.8 billion

in 2011, as these amounts are essentially permanent in nature. The difference will become taxable upon repatriation of assets, sale or liquidation of the investment. It is not practicable to determine the unrecognized deferred tax liability on the difference because the actual tax liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing when the repatriation occurs.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES

During the fourth quarter of each year or upon a triggering event, the Company reviews the goodwill assigned to each of its reporting units to identify those units with a fair value more-likely-than-not less than its carrying value.  With the exception of two reporting units that had recent acquisition or divestiture activity, a qualitative assessment was completed. This assessment evaluated various events and circumstances, such as macro economic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, relevant events and financial trends, that may impact a reporting unit's fair value. After completing this assessment, the Company determined it was more-likely-than-not the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting units qualitatively reviewed. A quantitative, "step one," impairment analysis, therefore, was not required.

For the two reporting units with recent acquisition or divestiture activity, the Company performed a quantitative, "step one," goodwill impairment analysis, which requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates. The basis of this goodwill impairment analysis is the Company's annual budget and long-range plan



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(“LRP”).  The annual budget and LRP includes a five year projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments and assumes the last year of the LRP data is a fair indication of the future performance. Because the LRP is estimated over a significant future period of time, those estimates and assumptions are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. Further, the market valuation models and other financial ratios used by the Company require certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to the Company's facts and circumstances. The Company believes the assumptions and estimates used to determine its estimated fair value are reasonable.  Different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value. The primary assumptions affecting the Company's December 31, 2011 goodwill quantitative, "step one," impairment review are as follows:

•

Discount rate

: The Company used a

10%

weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) as the discount rate for future cash flows. The WACC is intended to represent a rate of return that would be expected by a market participant.

•

Operating income margin

: The Company used historical and expected operating income margins, which may vary based on the projections of each reporting unit being evaluated.

In addition to the above primary assumptions, the Company notes the following risk to volume and operating income assumptions that could have an impact on the discounted cash flow model:

•

The automotive industry is cyclical and the Company's results of operations would be adversely affected by industry downturns.

•

The Company is dependent on market segments that use our key products and would be affected by decreasing demand in those segments.

•

The Company is subject to risks related to international operations.

Based on the assumptions outlined above, the impairment testing conducted in the fourth quarter of 2011 indicated the Company's goodwill assigned to the two reporting units that were quantitatively assessed was not impaired. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis was completed indicating a

1%

increase in the discount rate or a

1%

decrease in the operating margin assumptions would not result in the carrying value exceeding the fair value of either of the reporting units quantitatively assessed.

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 are as follows:

multi-currency revolving credit facility (which includes a feature that allows the Company's borrowings to be increased to

$1 billion

). The facility provides for borrowings through June 30, 2016 and is guaranteed by the Company's material domestic subsidiaries. The Company has two key financial covenants as part of the credit agreement. These covenants are a debt compared to EBITDA (“Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization”) test and an interest coverage test.  The Company was in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2011 and expects to remain compliant in future periods.  At December 31, 2011, the Company had outstanding borrowings of

$70 million

under this facility. There were no outstanding borrowings under this facility at December 31, 2010.

On September 16, 2010, the Company issued

$250 million

in

4.625%

senior notes due 2020. Interest is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2011.

On April 9, 2009, the Company issued

$373.8 million

in convertible senior notes due April 15, 2012. Under ASC Topic 470,

“Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)

," the Company accounted for the convertible senior notes by bifurcating the instruments between its liability and equity components. The value of the debt component was based on the fair value of issuing a similar nonconvertible debt security. The value of the equity component was calculated by deducting the value of the liability from the proceeds received at issuance. The Company's December 31, 2011 Consolidated Balance Sheet includes current debt of

$368.5 million

due April 15, 2012 and capital in excess of par value of

$36.5 million

. Additionally, ASC Topic 470 requires the Company to accrete the discounted carrying value of the convertible notes to their face value over the term of the notes. The Company's interest expense associated with this amortization is based on the effective interest rate of the convertible senior notes of

9.365%

. The total interest expense related to the convertible senior notes in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was as follows:

The notes pay interest semi-annually of

$6.5 million

, which is at a coupon rate of

3.50%

per year.

Holders of the notes may convert their notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the notes, in multiples of

$1,000

principal amount. The initial conversion rate for the notes is

30.4706

shares of the Company's common stock per

$1,000

principal amount of notes (representing an initial conversion price of approximately

$32.82

per share of common stock). The conversion price represents a conversion premium of

27.50%

over the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on April 6, 2009 of

$25.74

per share. Since the Company's stock price was above the convertible senior notes conversion price of

$32.82

, the if-converted value was approximately

$352.1 million

and

$450.2 million

higher than the face value of the convertible senior notes at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. In conjunction with the note offering, the Company entered into a bond hedge overlay at a net pre-tax cost of

$25.2 million

, effectively raising the conversion premium to

50.0%

, or approximately

$38.61

per share. In accordance with the original terms of the agreement, the Company has an option to settle the convertible senior notes through delivering cash, shares of its common stock or a combination thereof. On December 13, 2011, the Company announced its intention to settle the convertible senior notes through delivering shares of its common stock, currently held in treasury stock.

As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the estimated fair values of the Company's senior unsecured notes totaled

$1,454.4 million

and

$1,482.3 million

, respectively. The estimated fair values were

$435.5 million

and

$483.7 million

higher at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, than their carrying values. Fair market values are developed by the use of estimates obtained from brokers and other appropriate valuation techniques based on information available as of quarter-end and year-end. The fair value estimates do not necessarily reflect the values the Company could realize in the current markets.

The Company had outstanding letters of credit of

$50.0 million

and

$26.5 million

at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The letters of credit typically act as guarantees of payment to certain third parties in accordance with specified terms and conditions.

NOTE 9   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

ASC Topic 820 emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity specific measurement. Therefore, a fair value measurement should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, ASC Topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair values as follows:

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are based on one or more of the following three valuation techniques noted in ASC Topic 820:

A.

Market approach

: Prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.

B.

Cost approach

: Amount that would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost).

C.

Income approach

: Techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount based upon market expectations (including present value techniques, option-pricing and excess earnings models).

The following table classifies the assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2011:

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company’s financial instruments include cash and marketable securities. Due to the short-term nature of these instruments, their book value approximates their fair value. The Company’s financial instruments also include long-term debt, interest rate and cross-currency swaps, commodity derivative contracts, and foreign currency derivatives. All derivative contracts are placed with counterparties that have an S&P, or equivalent, investment grade credit rating at the time of the contracts’ placement. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had no derivative contracts that contained credit risk related contingent features.

The Company selectively uses cross-currency swaps to hedge the foreign currency exposure associated with our net investment in certain foreign operations (net investment hedges). At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the following cross-currency swaps were outstanding:

The Company uses certain commodity derivative contracts to protect against commodity price changes related to forecasted raw material and supplies purchases. The Company primarily utilizes forward and option contracts, which are designated as cash flow hedges. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding:

The Company uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to protect against exchange rate movements for forecasted cash flows, including purchases, operating expenses or sales transactions designated in currencies other than the functional currency of the operating unit. Foreign currency derivative contracts require the Company, at a future date, to either buy or sell foreign currency in exchange for the operating units’ local currency.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the following foreign currency derivative contracts were outstanding:

In 2006, the Company entered into a series of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of a portion of its senior notes. In the first quarter of 2009, the Company terminated interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of debt.  Therefore, the basis adjustments of

$34.5 million

present at the termination of the hedging relationship are being amortized over the remaining life of the respective debt maturing in 2016 and 2019.  The

$30.0 million

cash received related to the termination of these interest rate swaps is included in the Financing section of the Statement of Cash Flows.  The Company recognized

$5.7 million

in interest expense in the first quarter of 2009 as a result of the early termination. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, there were no outstanding fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements.

At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the following amounts were recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as being payable to or receivable from counterparties under ASC Topic 815:

Effectiveness for cash flow and net investment hedges is assessed at the inception of the hedging relationship and quarterly, thereafter. To the extent that derivative instruments are deemed to be effective as defined by ASC Topic 815, gains and losses arising from these contracts are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI"). Such gains and losses will be reclassified into income as the underlying operating transactions are realized. Gains and losses not qualifying for deferral treatment have been credited/charged to income as they are recognized.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The table below shows deferred gains and losses at the end of the period reported in AOCI and amounts expected to be reclassified to income within the one year or less. The gain or loss expected to be reclassified to income in one year or less assumes no change in the current relationship of the hedged item at December 31, 2011 market rates.

Net investment hedges are derivative contracts entered into to hedge against changes in exchange rates that affect the overall value of net investments in foreign entities. Gains and losses on net investment hedges are recorded in AOCI and are used to offset equivalent gains or losses in the value of net investments that are recorded in translation gains and losses which is also a component of AOCI.  Net investment hedges, designated under ASC Topic 815, held during the period resulted in the following gains or losses recorded in income:

Cash flow hedges are derivative contracts entered into to hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. The effective portion of gains or losses exactly offset gains or losses in the underlying transaction that they were designated to hedge, and are recorded on the same line in the statement of operations. Ineffectiveness resulting from imperfect matches between changes in value of hedge contracts and changes in value of the underlying transaction are immediately recognized in income. Cash flow hedges, designated under ASC Topic 815, held during the period resulted in the following gains and losses recorded in income:

At December 31, 2011, derivative instruments that were not designated as hedging instruments as defined by ASC Topic 815 were immaterial.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

The Company sponsors various defined contribution savings plans, primarily in the U.S., that allow employees to contribute a portion of their pre-tax and/or after-tax income in accordance with plan specified guidelines. Under specified conditions, the Company will make contributions to the plans and/or match a percentage of the employee contributions up to certain limits. Total expense related to the defined contribution plans was

$18.9 million

,

$19.2 million

and

$16.6 million

in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The Company has a number of defined benefit pension plans and other post employment benefit plans covering eligible salaried and hourly employees and their dependents. The defined pension benefits provided are primarily based on (i) years of service and (ii) average compensation or a monthly retirement benefit amount. The Company provides defined benefit pension plans in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Japan, South Korea, Italy, France, Ireland, Monaco, Mexico and Sweden. The other post employment benefit plans, which provide medical and life insurance benefits, are unfunded plans. All pension and other post employment benefit plans in the U.S. have been closed to new employees since 1999. The measurement date for all plans is December 31.

On February 26, 2009, the Company's subsidiary, BorgWarner Diversified Transmission Products Inc. (“DTP”), entered into a Plant Shutdown Agreement with the United Auto Workers ("UAW") for its Muncie, Indiana automotive component plant (the “Muncie Plant”). Management subsequently wound-down production activity at the plant, with operations effectively ceased as of March 31, 2009.  As a result of the closure of the Muncie Plant, the Company recorded a curtailment gain of

$41.9 million

in the other post employment benefit plan during the first quarter of 2009. The Plant Shutdown Agreement also included a settlement of a portion of the UAW retiree health care obligation, which resulted in a settlement loss of

$14.0 million

during the first quarter of 2009. The combined pre-tax impact of these actions was a net gain of

$27.9 million

.

On March 24, 2010, the Company finalized its settlement agreement regarding the closure of the Muncie Plant with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation in which the Company will make certain payments directly to the Muncie Plant's defined benefit pension plan (the “Plan”). On December 23, 2009, the Company made an initial cash contribution of

$23 million

for the 2009 Plan year, consistent with the settlement agreement. Also under the settlement agreement, the Company made a cash contribution to the Plan of

$15 million

during the year ended December 31, 2011.  The Company will make a cash contribution to the Plan of

$15 million

in both 2012 and 2013, unless this contribution exceeds the maximum amounts deductible under the applicable U.S. tax regulations. The Company provided

$35 million

in the form of a surety bond and will waive a credit balance valued at

$8 million

in 2014. In the second quarter of 2011, the Company replaced the original surety bond with

$35 million

in letters of credit.

The following table summarizes the expenses for the Company's defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans and the other post employment defined benefit plans.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The funded status of pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets at December 31 is as follows:

The weighted average asset allocations of the Company’s funded pension plans and target allocations by asset category are as follows:

The Company's investment strategy is to maintain actual asset weightings within a preset range of target allocations. The Company believes these ranges represent an appropriate risk profile for the planned benefit payments of the plans based on the timing of the estimated benefit payments. Within each asset category, separate portfolios are maintained for additional diversification. Investment managers are retained within each asset category to manage each portfolio against its benchmark. Each investment manager has appropriate investment guidelines. In addition, the entire portfolio is evaluated against a relevant peer group. The defined benefit pension plans did not hold any Company securities as investments as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. A portion of pension assets are invested in common and comingled trusts.

The Company expects to contribute a total of

$30 million

to

$40 million

into its defined benefit pension plans during 2012, including

$15 million

related to the Company's settlement agreement with the PBGC discussed above.  Of the

$30 million

to

$40 million

in projected 2012 contributions,

$21.5 million

are contractually obligated, while the remaining payments are discretionary.

The Company's weighted-average assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations for its defined benefit pension and other post employment plans as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 were as follows:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company’s weighted-average assumptions used to determine the net periodic benefit cost (benefit) for its defined benefit pension and other post employment benefit plans for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were as follows:

The Company's approach to establishing the discount rate is based upon the market yields of high-quality corporate bonds, with appropriate consideration of each plan's defined benefit payment terms and duration of the liabilities. The discount rate assumption is typically rounded up or down to the nearest 25 basis points for each plan.

The Company determines its expected return on plan asset assumptions by evaluating estimates of future market returns and the plans' asset allocation. The Company also considers the impact of active management of the plans' invested assets.

The estimated future benefit payments for the pension and other post employment benefits are as follows:

The weighted-average rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits is projected to be

7.10%

in 2012 for pre-65 and post-65 participants, decreasing to

5.0%

by the year 2019. A one-percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend would have the following effects:

STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS

Under the Company's 1993 Stock Incentive Plan (“1993 Plan”), the Company granted options to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at the fair market value on the date of grant. The options vest over periods up to three years and have a term of ten years from date of grant. As of December 31, 2003, there were no options available for future grants under the 1993 Plan. The 1993 Plan expired at the end of 2003 and was replaced by the Company's 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, which was amended at the Company's 2009 Annual Stockholders Meeting, among other things, to increase the number of shares available for issuance under the Plan. Under the BorgWarner Inc. Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (“2004 Stock Incentive Plan”),

12.5 million

shares are authorized for grant, of which approximately

2.2 million

shares are available for future issuance.

Stock Options

The Company recognized no stock compensation expense and negligible stock option compensation expense during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company's stock option compensation expense reduced earnings before income and noncontrolling interest by

Proceeds from stock option exercises for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were as follows:

Restricted Stock

At its November 2007 meeting, the Company's Compensation Committee decided that restricted common stock awards and stock units ("restricted stock") would be awarded in place of stock options for long-term incentive award grants to employees. Restricted stock granted to employees vest 50% after two years and the remainder after three years from the date of grant. Restricted stock granted to non-employee directors generally vests on the anniversary date of the grant.

The value of restricted stock is determined by the market value of the Company's common stock at the date of grant. In February 2011, restricted stock in the amount of

270,144

was granted to employees under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan. In April 2011, restricted stock in the amount of

3,288

was granted to non-employee directors under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan. The value of the awards is recorded as unearned compensation within capital in excess of par value in equity and is amortized as compensation expense over the restriction periods.

Restricted stock compensation expense reduced earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interest, net earnings and earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 by:

Performance Share Plans

The 2004 Stock Incentive Plan provides for awarding of performance shares to members of senior management at the end of successive three-year periods based on the Company's performance in terms of total shareholder return relative to a peer group of automotive companies. Awards earned are generally payable

40%

in cash and

cash component and

60%

stock component ratably over the performance period. Compensation expense for the

60%

stock component is based on the performance shares fair value at the date of grant. This fair value is calculated using a lattice model (Monte Carlo simulation). The compensation expense for the

40%

cash component is based on quarterly marking to market the cash liability. The amounts expensed under the plan and the share issuances for the three-year measurement periods ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were as follows:

CONTINGENCIES

In the normal course of business, the Company is party to various commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints, including matters involving warranty claims, intellectual property claims, general liability and various other risks. It is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the Company will ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal matters or, if not, what the impact might be. The Company's environmental and product liability contingencies are discussed separately below. The Company's management does not expect that the results in any of these commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Litigation

In January 2006, BorgWarner Diversified Transmission Products Inc. ("DTP"), a subsidiary of the Company, filed a declaratory judgment action in United States District Court, Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis Division) against the United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implements Workers of America (“UAW”) Local No. 287 and Gerald Poor, individually and as the representative of a defendant class. DTP sought the Court's affirmation that DTP did not violate the Labor-Management Relations Act or the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) by unilaterally amending certain medical plans effective April 1, 2006 and October 1, 2006, prior to the expiration of the then-current collective bargaining agreements. On September 10, 2008, the Court found that DTP's reservation of the right to make such amendments reducing the level of benefits provided to retirees was limited by its collectively bargained health insurance agreement with the UAW, which did not expire until April 24, 2009. Thus, the amendments were untimely. In 2008, the Company recorded a charge of

$4.0 million

as a result of the Court's decision.

DTP filed a declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court, Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis Division) against the UAW Local No. 287 and Jim Barrett and others, individually and as representatives of a defendant class, on February 26, 2009 again seeking the Court's affirmation that DTP will not violate the Labor - Management Relations Act or ERISA by modifying the level of benefits provided retirees to make them comparable to other Company retiree benefit plans after April 24, 2009. Certain retirees, on behalf of themselves and others, filed a mirror-image action in the United States District Court, Eastern District of Michigan (Southern Division) on March 11, 2009, for which a class has been certified. During the last quarter of 2009, the action pending in Indiana was dismissed, while the action in Michigan is continuing and in the discovery phase. The Company is vigorously defending against the suit.  This contingency is subject to many uncertainties, therefore based on the information available to date, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the amount or the range of potential loss, if any.

Environmental

The Company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“Superfund”) and equivalent state laws and, as such, may presently be liable for the cost of clean-up and other remedial activities at


such sites. Responsibility for clean-up and other remedial activities at a Superfund site is typically shared among PRPs based on an allocation formula.

The Company believes that none of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Generally, this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not material or the liability will be shared with other PRPs, although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Based on information available to the Company (which in most cases includes: an estimate of allocation of liability among PRPs; the probability that other PRPs, many of whom are large, solvent public companies, will fully pay the cost apportioned to them; currently available information from PRPs and/or federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs; remediation alternatives; and estimated legal fees), the Company has an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities with a balance of

$10.4 million

at December 31, 2011. The accrued amounts do not exceed

$3.0 million

related to any individual site except for the Crystal Springs site discussed below, and we do not believe that the costs related to any of these sites will have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The Company expects to pay out substantially all of the amounts accrued for environmental liability over the next five years.

In connection with the sale of Kuhlman Electric Corporation, the Company agreed to indemnify the buyer and Kuhlman Electric for certain environmental liabilities, then unknown to the Company, relating to certain operations of Kuhlman Electric that pre-date the Company's 1999 acquisition of Kuhlman Electric. In 2007 and 2008, lawsuits were filed against Kuhlman Electric and others, including the Company, on behalf of approximately


plaintiffs, alleging personal injury relating to alleged environmental contamination at its Crystal Springs, Mississippi plant. The Company entered into a settlement in July 2010 regarding the personal injury claims of the plaintiffs and those of approximately

2,700

unfiled claimants represented by those plaintiffs' attorneys. In exchange for, among other things, the dismissal with prejudice of these lawsuits and the release of claims by the unfiled claimants, the Company agreed to pay up to

$28 million

in settlement funds, which was expensed in the second quarter of 2010. The Company paid

$13.9 million

in November 2010 and made the final payment of

$13.9 million

in February 2011. Litigation concerning indemnification is pending and the Company may in the future become subject to further legal proceedings.

Product Liability

Like many other industrial companies who have historically operated in the U.S., the Company (or parties the Company is obligated to indemnify) continues to be named as one of many defendants in asbestos-related personal injury actions. We believe that the Company's involvement is limited because, in general, these claims relate to a few types of automotive friction products that were manufactured many years ago and contained encapsulated asbestos. The nature of the fibers, the encapsulation and the manner of use lead the Company to believe that these products are highly unlikely to cause harm. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, the Company had approximately

16,000

and

17,000

pending asbestos-related product liability claims, respectively. Of the approximately

16,000

outstanding claims at December 31, 2011, approximately half were pending in jurisdictions that have undergone significant tort and judicial reform activities subsequent to the filing of these claims.

The Company's policy is to vigorously defend against these lawsuits and the Company has been successful in obtaining dismissal of many claims without any payment. The Company expects that the vast majority of the pending asbestos-related product liability claims where it is a defendant (or has an obligation to indemnify a defendant) will result in no payment being made by the Company or its insurers. In 2011, of the approximately

1,800

claims resolved,


(

16%

) resulted in any payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the Company. In the full year of 2010, of the approximately

7,700

claims resolved,


(

3%

) resulted in any payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the Company.

Prior to June 2004, the settlement and defense costs associated with all claims were paid by the Company's primary layer insurance carriers under a series of funding arrangements. In addition to the primary insurance available for asbestos-related claims, the Company has substantial excess insurance coverage available for potential future asbestos-related product claims. In June 2004, primary layer insurance carriers notified the Company of the alleged exhaustion of their policy limits.

A declaratory judgment action was filed in January 2004 in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois by Continental Casualty Company and related companies (“CNA”) against the Company and certain of its other

historical general liability insurers. The court has issued a number of interim rulings and discovery is continuing. CNA and the Company have entered into a settlement agreement resolving their coverage disputes, pursuant to which CNA will pay amounts over the next four years to the Company. The Company is vigorously pursuing the litigation against the remaining insurers.

Although it is impossible to predict the outcome of pending or future claims or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the state or federal levels, due to the encapsulated nature of the products, the Company's experience in vigorously defending and resolving claims in the past, and the Company's significant insurance coverage with solvent carriers as of the date of this filing, management does not believe that asbestos-related product liability claims are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

To date, the Company has paid and accrued

$190.9 million

in defense and indemnity in advance of insurers' reimbursement and has received

$81.1 million

in cash and notes from insurers, including CNA. The net balance of

$109.8 million

, is expected to be fully recovered, of which approximately

$33 million

is estimated to be recovered within one year. Timing of recovery is dependent on final resolution of the declaratory judgment action referred to above or additional negotiated settlements. At December 31, 2010, insurers owed

$120.6 million

in association with these claims.

On April 5, 2010, the Superior Court of New Jersey Appellate Division affirmed a lower court judgment in an asbestos-related action against the Company and others. The Company filed its Notice of Petition to the Supreme Court of New Jersey in late April, seeking to appeal the decisions of the lower courts. On July 8, 2010 the Supreme Court of New Jersey denied the Company's Notice of Petition appealing the decision of the lower courts. The total claim of

$40.7 million

was paid by the Company in July 2010.

In addition to the

$109.8 million

net balance relating to past settlements and defense costs, the Company has estimated a liability of

$61.7 million

for claims asserted, but not yet resolved and their related defense costs at December 31, 2011. The Company also has a related asset of

$61.7 million

to recognize proceeds from the insurance carriers. Insurance carrier reimbursement of

100%

expected based on the Company's experience, its insurance contracts and decisions received to date in the declaratory judgment action referred to above. At December 31, 2010, the comparable value of the insurance asset and accrued liability was

$50.6 million

.

The amounts recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the estimated future settlement of existing claims are as follows:

The Company cannot reasonably estimate possible losses, if any, in excess of those for which it has accrued, because it cannot predict how many additional claims may be brought against the Company (or parties the Company has an obligation to indemnify) in the future, the allegations in such claims, the possible outcomes, or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the State or Federal levels.

LEASES AND COMMITMENTS

Certain assets are leased under long-term operating leases. These include rent for the corporate headquarters and one airplane. Most leases contain renewal options for various periods. Leases generally require the Company to pay for insurance, taxes and maintenance of the leased property. The Company leases other equipment such as vehicles and certain office equipment under short-term leases. Total rent expense was

$30.7 million

,

$25.6 million

and

$28.5 million

in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company does not have any material capital leases.

On September 30, 2010, the Company paid

$6.0 million

for certain machinery and equipment it had previously leased, which was recorded as a capital expenditure within the investing activities section of the Company's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2010.

Future minimum operating lease payments at December 31, 2011 were as follows:

NOTE 16

EARNINGS PER SHARE

The Company presents both basic and diluted earnings per share of common stock (“EPS”) amounts.  Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net earnings attributable to BorgWarner Inc. by the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing net earnings attributable to BorgWarner Inc. by the weighted average shares of common stock and common equivalent stock outstanding during the reporting period.

The dilutive impact of stock based compensation is calculated using the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method assumes that the Company uses the proceeds from the exercise of awards to repurchase common stock at the average market price during the period. The assumed proceeds under the treasury stock method include the purchase price that the grantee will pay in the future, compensation cost for future service that the Company has not yet recognized and any windfall/(shortfall) tax benefits that would be credited/(debited) to capital in excess of par value when the award generates a tax deduction. Options are only dilutive when the average market price of the underlying common stock exceeds the exercise price of the options.

The potential common shares associated with the Company's

3.50%

convertible senior notes due April 15, 2012 are reflected in diluted EPS using the “if-converted” method. Under this method, if dilutive, the common stock is assumed issued as of the beginning of the reporting period and included in calculating diluted EPS. In addition, if dilutive, interest expense, net of tax, related to the convertible notes is added back to the numerator in calculating diluted EPS.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Separately and concurrently with the issuance of the Company's

3.50%

convertible senior notes, the Company entered into a bond hedge overlay, including warrants and options. If the Company's weighted-average share price exceeds

$38.61

per share, the warrants will be dilutive to the Company's earnings. If the Company's weighted average share price exceeds

$32.82

per share, the offsetting bond hedge will be anti-dilutive.

The following table reconciles the numerators and denominators used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share of common stock:

NOTE 17

RESTRUCTURING

During the second quarter of 2009, the Company recorded restructuring expenses of

$50.3 million

, which included

$9.0 million

relating to employee termination benefits,

$36.3 million

of asset impairment charges and

$5.0 million

related to the North American and European restructuring. The Company reduced its North American workforce by approximately


people, or

12%

; its European workforce by approximately


people, or

2%

; and its Asian workforce by approximately


people, or

3%

. Included in the asset impairment charges was a

$22.3 million

charge related to one of the Company's European locations, which resulted from the Company's evaluations of the long range outlook of the location using an undiscounted and discounted cash flow model, both of which indicated that assets were impaired. In determining the amount of the asset impairment charge, the Company used a replacement cost technique to determine the fair value of the assets.

BERU-Eichenauer GmbH

In anticipation of market growth expected for its electric cabin heaters, the Company completed the acquisition of BERU-Eichenauer GmbH by acquiring the shares of its former joint venture partner, Eichenauer Heizelemente GmbH & Co. KG. The former 50/50 joint venture was formed in 2000 to develop and manufacture electric cabin heaters. The acquisition formally took effect on May 1, 2010.

The pre-tax impact of this acquisition was an increase in intangible and other assets of

$17.6 million

$8.0 million

and a decrease in cash of

$9.6 million

. The Company's

$9.6 million

payment has been recorded as an investing activity in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

Dytech ENSA S.L.

On April 10, 2010, the Company acquired

100%

of Dytech ENSA S.L. (“Dytech”), headquartered in Vigo, Spain. The gross cost of this acquisition is

The following table summarizes the aggregate estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on April 10, 2010, the date of acquisition.

Etatech, Inc. Technology

On June 2, 2009, the Company announced the purchase of advanced gasoline ignition technology and related intellectual property from Florida-based Etatech, Inc. The high-frequency ignition technology enables high-performing, lean burning engines to significantly improve fuel economy and reduce emissions compared with conventional combustion technologies. The Company made a cash payment of

$7.5 million

in both June 2009 and May 2010 for the purchase of Etatech, Inc., which has been reflected as an investing activity in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

BERU

The Company acquired approximately

95.6%

of the outstanding shares of BERU Aktiengesellschaft (“BERU”), headquartered in Ludwigsburg, Germany prior to 2009.

On January 7, 2009, the Company informed BERU of its intention to purchase the remaining outstanding shares at that time of approximately

4%

, using the required German legal process referred to as a “squeeze-out” to gain

100%

ownership. This process included an affirmative vote of BERU shareholders at its May 20, 2009 annual shareholder meeting. The registration of the “squeeze-out” was challenged by certain noncontrolling shareholders of BERU with the commercial register in June 2009. The “squeeze-out” share price passed by the BERU shareholders in May 2009 was

€73.39

, an increase of

€2.07

from the

$71.32

share price included in the 2008 Domination and Profit Transfer Agreement ("DPTA").  This increase was reflected as an increase to the Company's total DPTA obligation.

On September 18, 2009, the noncontrolling shareholders of BERU who had challenged the “squeeze-out” resolution dropped their complaint. The elimination of all actions against the resolution allowed BERU to register the “squeeze-out” with the commercial register. The “squeeze-out” became effective on September 30, 2009, making the Company the only shareholder of BERU. On October 2, 2009,  BERU was delisted as a public company in Germany. In October 2009, the Company paid

€22.9

(

$33.5

) million for the approximately

311,000

outstanding shares of BERU. Certain noncontrolling shareholders have challenged the “squeeze out” share price of

€73.39

. The Company is awaiting the judge's ruling regarding the share price from the hearing held on April 1, 2011.

As a result of the tendering of shares, the Company owned

100%

of all BERU's outstanding shares at December 31, 2009. The tendering of approximately

4%

of BERU shares, at a cost of

$46.6 million

, has been reflected as a financing activity in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Additionally, on May 22, 2009, the Company paid the annual perpetual dividend of

$1.9 million

, which is also reflected as a financing activity in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

REPORTING SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION

The Company's business is comprised of two reporting segments: Engine and Drivetrain. These segments are strategic business groups, which are managed separately as each represents a specific grouping of related automotive components and systems.

The Company allocates resources to each segment based upon the projected after-tax return on invested capital ("ROIC") of its business initiatives. ROIC is comprised of Adjusted EBIT after deducting notional taxes compared to the projected average capital investment required. Adjusted EBIT is comprised of earnings before interest, income taxes and noncontrolling interest (“EBIT") adjusted for restructuring, goodwill impairment charges, affiliates' earnings and other items not reflective of on-going operating profit or loss.

Adjusted EBIT is the measure of segment profit or loss used by the Company. The Company believes Adjusted EBIT is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our reporting segments. The following tables show segment information and Adjusted EBIT for the Company's reporting segments.

_______________

(a)  Corporate assets include equity in affiliates’, investment and advances and deferred income taxes.  The December 31, 2009  assets are net of trade receivables securitized and sold to third parties.

Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. However, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives.

The Company has adopted and maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, such as this Form 10-K, is collected, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company's disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15, the Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
