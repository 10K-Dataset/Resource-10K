PART I

Item 1.

Business

BorgWarner Inc. (the “Company”), a
Delaware corporation, was incorporated in 1987. The Company is a
leading, global supplier of highly engineered systems and
components, primarily for powertrain applications. The
Company’s products help improve vehicle performance, fuel
efficiency, air quality and vehicle stability. These products
are manufactured and sold worldwide, primarily to original
equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) of passenger cars,
sport-utility vehicles, trucks, and commercial transportation
products. The Company operates manufacturing and technical
facilities in 43 locations in 14 countries serving customers in
the Americas, Europe and Asia, and is an original equipment
supplier to every major automotive OEM in the world.

Financial Information About Segments

Incorporated herein by reference is Note Fifteen
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 52
through 54 of the Company’s Annual Report for the year
ended December 31, 2003 (the “Company’s Annual
Report”) filed as an exhibit to this report.

Narrative Description of Operating
Segments

The Company reports its results under two
reportable operating segments: Drivetrain and Engine. Net
revenues by segment for the three years ended December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001, are as follows (in millions of dollars):

The sales information presented above excludes
the sales by the Company’s unconsolidated joint ventures
(See “Joint Ventures” section). Such sales totaled
approximately $370 million in 2003, $318 million in
2002 and $301 million in 2001. Divested operations and
businesses held for sale include the fuel systems business which
was sold in April 2001.

Drivetrain

The Drivetrain Group leverages the Company’s
legacy and understanding of powertrain torque management to
develop interactive control systems and strategies for our
traditional mechanical products. The Drivetrain Group’s
products are primarily transmission components or torque
management applications and systems.

The Company’s torque management products
include four-wheel drive (“4WD”) and all-wheel drive
transfer cases and torque management systems to transfer torque
within the drivetrain for rear-wheel drive and front-wheel drive
(“FWD”) based vehicles. The main focus is on
electronically controlled torque management devices and systems.

Transfer cases are installed primarily on light
trucks and sport-utility vehicles (“SUVs”). A transfer
case attaches to the transmission and distributes torque to the
front and rear axles for 4WD, improving vehicle control during
off-road use and in a variety of road conditions. The Company
has designed and developed an exclusive 4WD
TORQUE-ON-DEMAND® (“TOD”) transfer case system,
which allows vehicles to automatically shift from two-wheel
drive to 4WD when electronic sensors



indicate it is necessary. The TOD® transfer
case is available on the Ford Explorer, the best selling SUV in
the United States in 2003, 2002 and 2001, and the Ford
Expedition, Lincoln Navigator and SsangYong Musso. In 2001, this
technology was also adopted by Hyundai for its Terracan SUV, and
was launched on the Kia Sorento in 2002.

Sales of 4WD transfer cases represented
approximately 22%, 22% and 20% of the Company’s total
revenues for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company
believes it is the world’s leading independent manufacturer
of 4WD transfer cases, producing over one million transfer cases
in 2003. The Company’s largest customer of 4WD transfer
cases is Ford Motor Company. The Company supplies the majority
of the 4WD transfer cases for Ford, including those installed in
the Ford Explorer, the Lincoln Aviator, the Ford Expedition, the
Ford F-150 and Ranger pick-up trucks, the Mercury Mountaineer
and the Lincoln Navigator. The Company also began supplying
transfer cases to several new General Motors applications in
2002 including the Hummer H2, the Cadillac Escalade, the
Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban, along with the GMC Yukon and Yukon
XL.

The Company’s newest 4WD product is the
INTERACTIVE TORQUE MANAGEMENT™ (“ITM”) system.
This product was introduced on the Acura MDX in 2000 and was
launched on the new Honda Pilot in 2002. ITM™ uses
electronically controlled clutches to distribute power to the
individual rear wheels when traction is required. The Company is
actively involved in developing this technology for new
applications in both front-wheel drive based cross-over vehicles
and passenger cars. A variant of this product, ITM 1™,
which features a single clutch pack in front of the rear axle
differential, was launched on the Hyundai Santa Fe in 2002.

The Drivetrain Group also engineers and
manufactures components for automatic transmissions and the
systems that combine such components in North America, Asia and
Europe. Principal product lines include friction plates, one-way
clutches, transmission bands and torque converter lock-up
clutches for automatic transmissions. The Company is a supplier
to virtually every major automatic transmission manufacturer in
the world. The Company’s 50%-owned joint venture in Japan,
NSK-Warner Kabushiki Kaisha (“NSK-Warner”), is a
leading producer of friction plates and one-way clutches in
Japan.

In 2003, the Company launched its
DualTronic™ transmission technology with Volkswagen and
Audi. The technology provides the smooth-shifting convenience of
an automatic transmission with the fuel efficiency of a manual
transmission. Through advanced electrohydraulic controls and a
unique two-clutch wet-friction system, DualTronic™
eliminates the disruptive feel of a manual transmission gear
shift.

The Company’s drivetrain products are
manufactured in North America, Europe, and Asia.

Engine

The Engine Group develops strategies and products
to manage engines for fuel efficiency, reduced emissions, and
enhanced performance. Its products fall into three major
categories: chains, turbochargers, and emissions and thermal
systems.

Chain and chain systems include timing chain and
timing chain systems, crankshaft and camshaft sprockets, chain
tensioners and snubbers, HY-VO® FWD transmission chain and
4WD chain, and MORSE GEMINI® Chain Systems for passenger
car and commercial vehicle applications. These products are
provided from facilities in North America, South America, Europe
and Asia.

HY-VO® chain is used to transfer power from
the engine to the transmission. The Company’s MORSE
GEMINI® chain system emits significantly less chain pitch
frequency noise than conventional transmission chain systems.
The chain in a transfer case distributes power between the front
and rear output shafts which, in turn, drive the front and rear
wheels. The Company believes it is the world’s leading
manufacturer of chain for FWD transmissions and 4WD transfer
cases.



The Company’s timing chain system is used on
Ford’s family of overhead cam engines, including the
Duratech and Triton and new in-line 4 cylinder engines, as well
as Chrysler’s 2.7 liter, 3.7 liter, 4.7 liter and 5.7 liter
overhead cam engines. In addition, the Company has been selected
to provide timing systems for a number of Japanese and European
applications, including Honda and Nissan. The Company believes
that it is the world’s leading manufacturer of timing chain
systems.

The Engine Group also provides turbochargers for
passenger car, commercial vehicle and industrial applications
for diesel and gasoline engine manufacturers in Europe, North
America, South America and Asia. The Engine Group has greatly
benefited from the growth in turbocharger demand in Europe. This
growth is linked to increasing demand for diesel engine
passenger cars. Benefits of turbochargers in both passenger car
and commercial vehicle applications include increased power for
a given engine size, improved fuel economy and significantly
reduced emissions. The Company believes it is a leading
manufacturer of turbochargers worldwide.

The Engine Group designs and manufactures
sophisticated electro-mechanical, mechanical and electronic
components and systems used for automated transmissions, fluid
pumps, engine air intake modules, engine emission controls and
actuation systems. Key products for transmission controls
include single function solenoids, complex solenoids and
multi-function modules. The Company also manufactures a wide
variety of fluid pumps, including engine hydraulic pumps for
variable cam timing and engine lubrication. Key products for
engine air intake management include throttle bodies, intake
manifolds, throttle position sensors and complete engine
induction systems. The Company also designs and manufactures
products to control emissions and improve gas mileage such as
electric air pumps, air control valves and exhaust gas
recirculation valves. These products are provided from
facilities in the United States and France.

The Engine Group is a global provider of engine
cooling solutions. The group manufactures and markets air
sensing fan drives that can be mechanically controlled and
electronically controlled fan drives that sense and respond to
multiple cooling requirements simultaneously. The Engine Group
also manufactures and markets polymer fans for engine cooling
systems. Product features provide improved vehicle fuel economy
and reduced engine emissions while minimizing parasitic
horsepower loss. These advanced cooling systems products are
manufactured by facilities in the U.S., Germany, U.K., Brazil,
Korea, and China. The Company is a leading global provider of
such products, but competes with other large independent
producers. This business serves the global light, medium, and
heavy vehicle markets, as well as selected off-highway
applications.

Joint Ventures

As of December 31, 2003, the Company had
eight joint ventures in which it has a less-than-100% ownership
interest. Results from six of these ventures, in which the
Company is the majority owner, are consolidated as part of the
Company’s results. The Company’s ownership interest in
NSK-Warner and Hitachi Warner is 50% each. Such interests are
reported using the equity method of accounting.



Management of the unconsolidated joint ventures
is shared with the Company’s respective joint venture
partners. Certain information concerning the Company’s
joint ventures is set forth below:

See Note Fifteen of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements on pages 52 through 54 of the
Company’s Annual Report for geographic information.

Customers

Approximately 77% of the Company’s total
sales in 2003 were to automotive OEMs, with the remaining 23% of
the Company’s sales to a diversified group of industrial,
construction and agricultural vehicle manufacturers, auto part
manufacturers and to distributors of automotive aftermarket and
replacement parts.

The Company’s worldwide sales in 2003 to
Ford, DaimlerChrysler and General Motors constituted
approximately 23%, 17% and 12%, respectively, of its 2003
consolidated sales. Approximately 37% of consolidated sales for
2003 were outside the United States, including exports. However,
a substantial portion of such sales was to foreign OEMs of
vehicles that are, in turn, exported to the United States. See
Note Fifteen of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
on pages 52 through 54 of the Company’s Annual Report.

The Company’s automotive products are
generally sold directly to OEMs substantially pursuant to either
negotiated long-term supply agreements or terms and conditions
as may be modified by the parties. Deliveries are subject to
periodic authorizations based upon the production schedules of
the OEMs. The Company ships its products directly from its
plants to the OEMs.



Sales and Marketing

Each of the Company’s business units within
its two operating segments has its own sales function headed by
a vice president of sales. Account executives for each business
unit are assigned to serve specific OEM customers for one or
more of a business unit’s products. Such account executives
spend the majority of their time in direct contact with OEM
purchasing and engineering employees and are responsible for
servicing existing business and for identifying and obtaining
new business. Because of their close relationship with the OEMs,
account executives are able to identify and meet customers’
needs based upon their knowledge of the Company’s products
and design and manufacturing capabilities. Upon securing a new
order, account executives participate in product launch team
activities as a key interface to the customers.

In addition, within the Engine segment and the
Drivetrain segment, sales and marketing employees work together
to explore cross-marketing opportunities for the business units.
The development of DualTronic™, the Company’s
wet-clutch and control-system technology for a new-concept
automated transmission, is a successful example of this
collaboration.

Research and Development

Each of the Company’s operating segments has
its own research and development (“R&D”)
organization. The Company has 626 employees, including
engineers, mechanics and technicians, engaged in R&D
activities at facilities worldwide. The Company also operates
testing facilities such as prototype, measurement and
calibration, life testing and dynamometer laboratories.

By working closely with the OEMs and anticipating
their future product needs, the Company’s R&D personnel
conceive, design, develop and manufacture new proprietary
automotive components and systems. R&D personnel also work
to improve current products and production processes. The
Company believes its commitment to R&D will allow it to
obtain new orders from its OEM customers.

Consistent with its strategy of developing
technologically innovative products, the Company spent
approximately $118.2 million, $109.1 million and
$104.5 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, on
R&D activities. Not included in the reported R&D
activities were customer-sponsored R&D activities that were
approximately $22.3 million, $14.2 million and
$20.0 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Patents and Licenses

The Company has approximately 3,000 active
domestic and foreign patents and patent applications pending or
under preparation, and receives royalties from licensing patent
rights to others. While it considers its patents on the whole to
be important, the Company does not consider any single patent,
group of related patents or any single license essential to its
operations in the aggregate or to the operations of any of the
Company’s business groups individually. The expiration of
the patents individually and in the aggregate is not expected to
have a material effect on the Company’s financial position
or future operating results. The Company owns numerous
trademarks, some of which are valuable but none of which are
essential to its business in the aggregate.

The Company owns the “BorgWarner” and
“Borg-Warner Automotive” trade names and housemarks,
and variations thereof, which are material to the Company’s
business.

Competition

The Company’s operating segments compete
worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors
which produce and sell similar products. Price, quality and
technological innovation are the primary elements of
competition. Competitors include vertically integrated units of
the Company’s major OEM customers, as well as a large
number of independent domestic and international suppliers, some
of which were formerly part of the Company’s OEM customers.
Many of these companies are larger and have greater resources
than the Company.



A number of the Company’s major OEM
customers manufacture, for their own use and for others,
products which compete with the Company’s products.
Although these OEM customers have indicated that they will
continue to rely on outside suppliers, the OEMs could elect to
manufacture products to meet their own requirements or to
compete with the Company. There can be no assurance that the
Company’s business will not be adversely affected by
increased competition in the markets in which it operates.

For many of its products, the Company’s
competitors include suppliers in other parts of the world that
enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs, lower
health care costs and, in some cases, export subsidies and/or
raw materials subsidies.

Employees

As of December 31, 2003, the Company and its
consolidated subsidiaries had approximately 14,300 salaried and
hourly employees (as compared with approximately 14,000
employees at December 31, 2002), of which approximately
8,100 were U.S. employees. Approximately 28% of the
Company’s domestic hourly workers are unionized. The hourly
workers at the Company’s European facilities are also
unionized. The Company believes its present relations with
employees to be satisfactory.

Raw Materials

Each of the Company’s operating segments
believes that its supplies of raw materials for manufacturing
requirements in 2004 are adequate and are available from
multiple sources. It is common, however, for customers to
require their prior approval before certain raw materials or
components can be used, thereby reducing sources of supply that
would otherwise be available. Manufacturing operations for each
of the Company’s operating segments are dependent upon
natural gas, fuel oil, and electricity.

Environmental Regulation and
Proceedings

The Company’s operations are subject to
federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations
governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharge to
waters and the generation, handling, storage, transportation,
treatment and disposal of waste and other materials. The Company
believes that it has operated its business and facilities in
compliance in all material respects with applicable
environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, many
of which provide for substantial fines and criminal sanctions
for violations. However, the operation of automotive parts
manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas even for a
company complying with all laws, and there can be no assurance
that the Company will not incur material costs or liabilities.
In addition, through various acquisitions over the years, the
Company has acquired a number of manufacturing facilities and
there can be no assurance that the Company will not incur
material costs and liabilities relating to activities which
predate the Company’s ownership. In addition, potentially
significant expenditures could be required in order to comply
with evolving environmental and health and safety laws,
regulations or requirements that may be adopted or imposed in
the future.

The Company believes that the overall impact of
compliance with regulations and legislation protecting the
environment will not have a material effect on its financial
position or future operating results, although no assurance can
be given in this regard. Capital expenditures and expenses in
2003 attributable to compliance with such legislation were not
material.

The Company and certain of its current and former
direct and indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and
divisions have been identified by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental
agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties
(“PRPs”) at various hazardous waste disposal sites
under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act (“Superfund”) and equivalent state laws
and, as such, may presently be liable for the cost of cleanup
and other remedial activities at 43 such sites. Responsibility



for cleanup and other remedial activities at a
Superfund site is typically shared among PRPs based on an
allocation formula.

Based on information available to the Company
which, in most cases, includes: an estimate of allocation of
liability among PRPs; the probability that other PRPs, many of
whom are large, solvent public companies, will fully pay the
costs apportioned to them; currently available information from
PRPs and/or federal or state environmental agencies concerning
the scope of contamination and estimated remediation costs;
remediation alternatives; estimated legal fees; and other
factors, the Company has established a reserve for indicated
environmental liabilities in the aggregate amount of
approximately $19.6 million at December 31, 2003. The
Company expects this amount to be expended over the next three
to five years.

The Company believes that none of these matters,
individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse
effect on its financial position or future operating results,
generally either because estimates of the maximum potential
liability at a site are not large or because liability will be
shared with other PRPs, although no assurance can be given with
respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter.

In connection with the sale of Kuhlman Electric
Corporation (“Kuhlman Electric”), the Company agreed
to indemnify the buyer and Kuhlman Electric for certain
environmental liabilities relating to the past operations of
Kuhlman Electric. During 2000, Kuhlman Electric notified the
Company that it discovered potential environmental contamination
at its Crystal Springs, Mississippi plant while undertaking an
expansion of the plant.

The Company has been working with the Mississippi
Department of Environmental Quality and Kuhlman Electric to
investigate the extent of and to remediate the contamination.
The investigation revealed the presence of polychlorinated
biphenyls (“PCBs”) in portions of the soil at the
plant and neighboring areas. Clean-up began in 2000 and is
continuing. Kuhlman Electric and others, including the Company,
were sued in several related lawsuits, which claim personal and
property damage. The Company has moved to be dismissed from some
of these lawsuits.

The Company believes that the reserve for
environmental liabilities is sufficient to cover any liability
associated with this matter. However, due to the nature of
environmental liability matters, there can be no assurance that
the actual amount of environmental liabilities will not exceed
the amount reserved.

Item 2. Properties

As of December 31, 2003, the Company had 43
manufacturing and technical facilities strategically located
throughout the United States and worldwide. In addition to its
domestic manufacturing facilities, the Company has five
facilities in Germany, four facilities in India, three
facilities in each of the United Kingdom and Korea, two

are located in Chicago, Illinois. In 2002, the Company completed
construction of the BorgWarner Powertrain Technical Center (the
“PTC”) in Auburn Hills, Michigan, which serves as the
primary research and development facility and headquarters for
several of the Company’s business units. There are
approximately 478 employees located at the PTC. In general, the
Company believes that its properties are in good condition and
are adequate to meet its current and reasonably anticipated
needs.

The following is additional information
concerning the headquarters and the major manufacturing plants
operated by the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Unless otherwise noted, these plants are owned by the Company:



(1)

The figure shown in each case is a weighted
    average of the percentage utilization of each major plant within
    the category, with an individual plant weighted in proportion to
    the number of employees employed when such plant runs at 100%
    capacity. With the exception of the Company’s Bellwood,
    Illinois plant, capacity utilization at the 100% level is
    defined as operating five days per week, with two eight-hour
    shifts per day and normal vacation hours. Capacity utilization
    at the 100% level at the Company’s Bellwood, Illinois plant
    is defined as operating five days per week, with three
    eight-hour shifts per day and normal vacation hours.

(2)

The table excludes joint ventures owned 50% or
    less.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

The Company is party to various judicial and
administrative proceedings which are considered to be routine
and incidental to its business including those described under
Environmental Regulation and Proceedings. Management does not
believe that the results of any of these proceedings are likely
to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.

Like many other industrial companies, the Company
continues to be named as one of the defendants in
asbestos-related personal injury actions. Management believes
that the Company’s involvement is limited to claims that
relate to a few types of automotive friction products,
manufactured many years ago, that contained encapsulated
asbestos. The Company aggressively defends against these
lawsuits and has been successful in obtaining dismissal of many
cases without any payment whatsoever or, in many cases for
nominal or minimal settlement payments. The Company has
significant insurance coverage with solvent carriers and, to
date, has not incurred any out-of-pocket costs, other than
immaterial administration expenses, in connection with these
lawsuits or any settlements thereof.

Although it is impossible to predict the outcome
of pending or future claims, in light of the nature of the
products, our experience in defending and resolving claims in
the past, our insurance coverage and existing reserves,
management does not believe that asbestos-related claims will
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity,
financial condition or results of operations.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote
of Security Holders

There were no matters submitted to the
Company’s security holders during the fourth quarter of
2003.

PART II

Item 5.

Market for the Registrant’s Common
    Equity, Related Stockholder Matters

and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

The Company’s Common Stock is listed for
trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BWA. As
of March 5, 2004, there were approximately 2,900 holders of
record of Common Stock.

The Company has paid cash dividends of $0.18 per
share on its Common Stock during each quarter for the last
fiscal year. For the first quarter of 2004, the Company
announced an increase in the cash dividend from $0.18 per share
