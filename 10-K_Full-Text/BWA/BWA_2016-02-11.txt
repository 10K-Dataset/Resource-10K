The Engine Segment's products include: turbochargers, timing systems, emissions systems, thermal systems, thermostats, diesel cold start and gasoline ignition technology.

Turbochargers provide several benefits including increased power for a given engine size, improved fuel economy and reduced emissions. The Engine Segment has benefited from the growth in turbocharger demand around the world for both diesel and gasoline engines. The Engine Segment provides turbochargers for light, commercial and off-highway applications for diesel and gasoline engine manufacturers in the Americas, Europe and Asia.  The Engine Segment also designs and manufactures turbo actuators using integrated electronics to precisely control turbocharger speed and pressure ratio.



Sales of turbochargers for light vehicles represented approximately

31%

,

28%

and

26%

of total net sales for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Engine Segment currently supplies turbochargers to many OEMs including BMW, Daimler, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles ("FCA"), Ford, General Motors, Great Wall, Hyundai, Renault, Volkswagen and Volvo. The Engine Segment also supplies turbochargers to several commercial vehicle and off-highway OEMs including Caterpillar, Daimler, Deutz, John Deere, MAN, Navistar and Weichai.

The Engine Segment's turbocharger technologies include regulated two-stage turbocharging system, known as R2S®, regulated 3-stage turbocharging systems known as R3S™, variable turbine geometry ("VTG") turbochargers and turbochargers for gasoline direct injected engines, all of which may be found in numerous applications around the world. For example, the Engine Segment supplies its award winning VTG turbocharger technology to BMW, FCA, Hyundai and Renault. Also, the Engine Segment supplies its award winning R2S® turbocharger technology to Volkswagen for its high-performing 2.0 liter diesel engine and its R3S™ turbocharger system, an industry first, to BMW for its high-powered 3.0 diesel engine. Ford selected the Engine Segment's leading gasoline turbocharger technology for its 1.5 liter, 1.6 liter and 2.0 liter four-cylinder EcoBoost engines, as did Volvo for its new four-cylinder gasoline engines.

The Engine Segment's timing systems enable precise control of air and exhaust flow through the engine, improving fuel economy and emissions. The Engine Segment's timing systems products include timing chain, variable cam timing (“VCT”), crankshaft and camshaft sprockets, tensioners, guides and snubbers, HY-VO® front-wheel drive (“FWD”) transmission chain and four-wheel drive (“4WD”) chain for light vehicles. The Engine Segment is a leading manufacturer of timing systems to OEMs around the world.

BorgWarner timing chain systems are featured on Ford's family of engines, including Duratec, Modular and in-line four-cylinder engines, General Motors' Small Gas Engine, Volkswagen's EA888 family, Hyundai's Gamma, Nu and Theta families and numerous other applications around the world.

The Engine Segment's engine timing technology includes VCT with mid position lock, which allows a greater range of camshaft positioning thereby enabling greater control over airflow and the opportunity to improve fuel economy, reduce emissions and improve engine performance compared with conventional VCT systems. VCT with mid position lock made its debut on Subaru's Boxer® 2.0 liter engine and is now on Hyundai's 3.0 to 3.8 liter six-cylinder engines and Ford's 5.0 liter eight-cylinder engine.

The Engine Segment's emissions and systems products improve emissions performance and fuel economy. Products include electric air pumps and exhaust gas recirculation ("EGR") modules, EGR coolers, EGR tubes and EGR valves for gasoline and diesel applications.

The Engine Segment's thermal systems products are designed to optimize engine temperatures and minimize parasitic horsepower losses, which improve engine efficiency, fuel economy and emissions performance. Products include viscous fan drives that sense and respond to multiple cooling requirements, polymer fans and coolant pumps. The Engine Segment has been awarded the "standard position" (the OEM-designated preferred supplier of component systems available to the end-customer) at several major global commercial vehicle OEMs.

The Engine Segment's ignition systems products improve combustion efficiency for both diesel and gasoline engines. Products include glow plugs and instant starting systems that enhance combustion for diesel engines during cold starts, pressure sensor glow plugs that also monitor the combustion process of a diesel engine and advanced ignition technology for gasoline engines.

On February 28, 2014, the Company acquired

100%

of the equity interests in Gustav Wahler GmbH u. Co. KG and its general partner ("Wahler"). Wahler was a producer of EGR valves, EGR tubes and thermostats, and had operations in Germany, Brazil, the U.S., China and Slovakia. The Wahler acquisition



is expected to strengthen the Company's strategic position as a producer of complete EGR systems and create additional market opportunities in both passenger and commercial vehicle applications.

The Company sold its tire pressure monitoring and spark plug businesses during the fourth quarter of 2011 and third quarter of 2012, respectively. The sale of these businesses will allow the Company to continue to focus on expanding BERU Systems' core products of glow plugs, diesel cold start systems and other gasoline ignition technologies.

In 2009, the Company announced the purchase of advanced gasoline ignition technology and related intellectual property from Florida-based Etatech, Inc. The high-frequency ignition technology is expected to enable high-performing, lean-burning engines to significantly improve fuel economy and reduce emissions compared with conventional combustion technologies.

Drivetrain

The Drivetrain Segment develops and manufactures mechanical products for automatic transmissions and all-wheel drive ("AWD") vehicles and rotating electrical components for light and commercial vehicle OEMs and the aftermarket. Precise controls, better response times and minimal parasitic losses, all of which improve fuel economy and vehicle performance, are the core design features of the Drivetrain Segment's mechanical product portfolio, while meeting the demands of increasing vehicle electric loads, improved fuel efficiency, reduced weight and lowered electrical and mechanical noise are the core design features of its rotating electrical components portfolio. The Drivetrain Segment's mechanical products include friction, mechanical and controls products for automatic transmissions and torque management products for AWD vehicles, and its rotating electrical components include starter motors, alternators and hybrid electric motors.

Friction and mechanical products for automatic transmissions include dual clutch modules, friction clutch modules, friction and steel plates, transmission bands, torque converter clutches, one-way clutches and torsional vibration dampers. Controls products for automatic transmissions feature electro-hydraulic solenoids for standard and high pressure hydraulic systems, transmission solenoid modules and dual clutch control modules. The Company's 50%-owned joint venture in Japan, NSK-Warner KK ("NSK-Warner"), is a leading producer of friction plates and one-way clutches in Japan and China.

The Drivetrain Segment has led the globalization of today's dual clutch transmission ("DCT") technology for over 10 years. BorgWarner's award-winning DualTronic® technology enables a conventional, manual gearbox to function as a fully automatic transmission by eliminating the interruption in power flow that occurs when shifting a single clutch manual transmission. The result is a smooth shifting automatic transmission with the fuel efficiency and driving experience of a manual gearbox.

The Drivetrain Segment established its industry-leading position in 2003 with the production launch of its DualTronic® innovations with VW/Audi, followed by program launches with Ford and BMW. In 2007, the Drivetrain Segment launched its first dual-clutch technology application in a Japanese transmission with Nissan. In 2008, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with China Automobile Development United Investment Company, a company owned by 12 leading Chinese automakers, to produce various DCT modules for the Chinese market. The Company owns 66% of the joint venture. In 2013, the Drivetrain Segment launched its first DCT application in a Chinese transmission with SAIC. The Drivetrain Segment is working on several other DCT programs with OEMs around the world.

The Drivetrain Segment's torque management products include rear-wheel drive (“RWD”)-AWD transfer case systems, FWD-AWD coupling systems and cross-axle coupling systems. The Drivetrain Segment's focus is on developing electronically controlled torque management devices and systems that will benefit fuel economy and vehicle dynamics.



Transfer cases are installed on RWD based light trucks, SUVs, cross-over utility vehicles, and passenger cars. A transfer case attaches to the transmission and distributes torque to the front and rear axles improving vehicle traction and stability in dynamic driving conditions. There are many variants of the Drivetrain Segment's transfer case technology in the market today, including Torque On-Demand (TOD®), chain-driven, gear-driven, Pre-Emptive, Part-Time, 1-speed and 2-speed transfer cases. The Drivetrain Segment's transfer cases are featured on the Ford F-150 and on the Dodge Ram light-duty and heavy-duty trucks.

The Drivetrain Segment is involved in the AWD market for FWD based vehicles with couplings that use electronically-controlled clutches to distribute power to the rear wheels as traction is required. The Drivetrain Segment's latest coupling innovation, the Centrifugal Electro-Hydraulic (“CEH”) Actuator, which is utilized to engage the clutches in the coupling, produces outstanding vehicle stability and traction while promoting better fuel economy with reduced weight. The CEH Actuator is found in the AWD couplings featured in several current FWD-AWD vehicles including the BMW X1, Range Rover Evoque, Volvo XC90 and VW Tiguan.

In 2015, the Company acquired Remy International, Inc. (“Remy”), a global market leader in the design, manufacture, remanufacture and distribution of rotating electrical components for light and commercial vehicles, OEMs and the aftermarket. Principal products include starter motors, alternators and hybrid electric motors. The Company’s starter motors and alternators are used in gasoline, diesel, natural gas and alternative fuel engines for light vehicle, commercial vehicle, industrial, construction and agricultural applications. The product technology continues to evolve to meet the demands of increasing vehicle electrical loads, improved fuel efficiency, reduced weight and lowered electrical and mechanical noise. The Company’s hybrid electric motors are used in both light and commercial vehicles including construction, public transit and agricultural applications. These include both pure electric applications as well as hybrid applications, where the electric motors are combined with traditional gasoline or diesel propulsion systems. While the market for these systems is in early stages of development, BorgWarner’s technology and capabilities are ideally suited for this growing product category.

The Company sells new starters, alternators and hybrid electric motors to OEMs globally for factory installation on new vehicles, and remanufactured and new starters and alternators to aftermarket customers and to OEMs for original equipment service. As a leading remanufacturer, BorgWarner obtains used starters and alternators, commonly referred to as cores, then disassembles, cleans, combines them with new subcomponents and reassembles them into saleable, finished products, which are tested to meet OEM requirements.

In 2011, the Company acquired the Traction Systems division of Haldex Group, a leading provider of innovative AWD products for the global vehicle industry headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden. This acquisition has accelerated BorgWarner's growth in the global AWD market as it continues to shift toward FWD based vehicles. The acquisition adds industry leading AWD technologies for FWD based vehicles, with a strong European customer base, to BorgWarner's portfolio of front- and rear-wheel drive based products and enables BorgWarner to offer global customers a broader range of AWD solutions to meet their vehicle needs.



Joint Ventures

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had eight joint ventures in which it had a less-than-100% ownership interest. Results from the six joint ventures in which the Company is the majority owner are consolidated as part of the Company's results. Results from the two joint ventures in which the Company's effective ownership interest is 50% or less, were reported by the Company using the equity method of accounting.

Management of the unconsolidated joint ventures is shared with the Company's respective joint venture partners. Certain information concerning the Company's joint ventures is set forth below:

________________

The Company made purchases from Turbo Energy Private Limited totaling $36.5 million, $36.5 million and $39.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

(c)

BorgWarner Inc. owns 50% of NSK-Warner, which has a 40% interest in BorgWarner Transmission Systems Korea Ltd. This gives the Company an additional indirect effective ownership percentage of 20%. This results in a total effective ownership interest of 80%.

Financial Information About Geographic Areas

During the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately

75%

of the Company's consolidated net sales were outside the United States ("U.S."), attributing sales to the location of production rather than the location of the customer.

Refer to Note 19, “Reporting Segments and Related Information,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for financial information about geographic areas.

Product Lines and Customers

During the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 84% of the Company's net sales were for light-vehicle applications; approximately 7% were for commercial vehicle applications; approximately 4% were for off-highway vehicle applications; and approximately 5% were to distributors of aftermarket replacement parts.



The Company’s worldwide net sales to the following customers (including their subsidiaries) were approximately as follows:

No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales in any of the years  presented.

The Company's automotive products are generally sold directly to OEMs, substantially pursuant to negotiated annual contracts, long-term supply agreements or terms and conditions as may be modified by the parties. Deliveries are subject to periodic authorizations based upon OEM production schedules. The Company typically ships its products directly from its plants to the OEMs.

Sales and Marketing

Each of the Company's businesses within its two reporting segments has its own sales function. Account executives for each of our businesses are assigned to serve specific customers for one or more of a businesses' products. Our account executives spend the majority of their time in direct contact with customers' purchasing and engineering employees and are responsible for servicing existing business and for identifying and obtaining new business.  Because of their close relationship with customers, account executives are able to identify and meet customers' needs based upon their knowledge of our products' design and manufacturing capabilities. Upon securing a new order, account executives participate in product launch team activities and serve as a key interface with customers. In addition, sales and marketing employees of our Engine and Drivetrain reporting segments often work together to explore cross-development opportunities where appropriate.

Seasonality

Our operations are directly related to the automotive industry. Consequently, we may experience seasonal fluctuations to the extent automotive vehicle production slows, such as in the summer months when many customer plants typically close for model year changeovers or vacations. Historically, model changeovers or vacations have generally resulted in lower sales volume in the third quarter.

Research and Development

The Company conducts advanced Engine and Drivetrain research at the reporting segment level. This advanced engineering function looks to leverage know-how and expertise across product lines to create new Engine and Drivetrain systems and modules that can be commercialized. This function manages a venture capital fund that was created by the Company as seed money for new innovation and collaboration across businesses.

In addition, each of the Company's businesses within its two reporting segments has its own research and development (“R&D”) organization, including engineers and technicians, engaged in R&D activities at facilities worldwide. The Company also operates testing facilities such as prototype, measurement and calibration, life cycle testing and dynamometer laboratories.

By working closely with the OEMs and anticipating their future product needs, the Company's R&D personnel conceive, design, develop and manufacture new proprietary automotive components and systems. R&D personnel also work to improve current products and production processes. The Company believes its commitment to R&D will allow it to continue to obtain new orders from its OEM customers.



The Company's net R&D expenditures are included in selling, general and administrative expenses of the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Customer reimbursements are netted against gross R&D expenditures as they are considered a recovery of cost. Customer reimbursements for prototypes are recorded net of prototype costs based on customer contracts, typically either when the prototype is shipped or when it is accepted by the customer. Customer reimbursements for engineering services are recorded when performance obligations are satisfied in accordance with the contract and accepted by the customer. Financial risks and rewards transfer upon shipment, acceptance of a prototype component by the customer or upon completion of the performance obligation as stated in the respective customer agreement.

Net R&D expenditures as a percentage of net sales were

3.8%

,

4.0%

and

4.1%

for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company has contracts with several customers at the Company's various R&D locations. No such contract exceeded

5%

of net R&D expenditures in any of the years presented.

Intellectual Property

The Company has more than 5,600 active domestic and foreign patents and patent applications pending or under preparation, and receives royalties from licensing patent rights to others. While it considers its patents on the whole to be important, the Company does not consider any single patent, any group of related patents or any single license essential to its operations in the aggregate or to the operations of any of the Company's business groups individually. The expiration of the patents individually and in the aggregate is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial position or future operating results. The Company owns numerous trademarks, some of which are valuable, but none of which are essential to its business in the aggregate.

The Company owns the “BorgWarner” and “Borg-Warner Automotive” trade names and housemarks, and variations thereof, which are material to the Company's business.

Competition

The Company's reporting segments compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. Many of these competitors are larger and have greater resources than the Company. Technological innovation, application engineering development, quality, price, delivery and program launch support are the primary elements of competition.



The Company’s major competitors by product type follow:

In addition, a number of the Company's major OEM customers manufacture, for their own use and for others, products that compete with the Company's products. Other current OEM customers could elect to manufacture products to meet their own requirements or to compete with the Company. There is no assurance that the Company's business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates.

For many of its products, the Company's competitors include suppliers in parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs, lower health care costs, lower tax rates and, in some cases, export subsidies and/or raw materials subsidies. Also, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors."

Workforce

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had a salaried and hourly workforce of approximately 30,000 (as compared with approximately 22,000 at December 31, 2014), of which approximately 6,900 were in the U.S.  Approximately

16%

of the Company's U.S. workforce is unionized. The workforces at certain international facilities are also unionized. The Company believes the present relations with our workforce to be satisfactory.

We have domestic collective bargaining agreements for one facility in New York, which expires in September 2016, and one facility in Oklahoma, which expires in March 2019.



Raw Materials

The Company uses a variety of raw materials in the production of its automotive products including  aluminum, copper, nickel, plastic resins, steel and certain alloy elements. Manufacturing operations for each of the Company's operating segments are dependent upon natural gas, fuel oil and electricity.

The Company uses a variety of tactics in order to limit the impact of supply shortages and inflationary pressures. The Company's global procurement organization works to accelerate cost reductions, purchases from lower cost regions, rationalize the supply base, mitigate risk and collaborate on its buying activities. In addition, the Company uses long-term contracts, cost sharing arrangements, design changes, customer buy programs and limited financial instruments to help control costs. The Company intends to use similar measures in 2016 and beyond.  Refer to Note 10, “Financial Instruments,” of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for information related to the Company's hedging activities.

For 2016, the Company believes that its supplies of raw materials are adequate and available from multiple sources to support its manufacturing requirements.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors

The following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impact our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business including its financial performance, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.

Risks related to our industry

Conditions in the automotive industry may adversely affect our business.

Our financial performance depends on conditions in the global automotive industry. Automotive and truck production and sales are cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors including interest rates, consumer credit, and consumer spending and preferences. Economic declines that result in significant reduction in automotive or truck production would have an adverse effect on our sales to OEMs.



We face strong competition.

We compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell products similar to ours. Price, quality, delivery, technological innovation, engineering development and program launch support are the primary elements of competition. Our competitors include vertically integrated units of our major OEM customers, as well as a large number of independent domestic and international suppliers. We are not as large as a number of these companies and do not have as many financial or other resources. Although OEMs have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside suppliers, a number of our major OEM customers manufacture products for their own uses that directly compete with our products. These OEMs could elect to manufacture such products for their own uses in place of the products we currently supply. The competitive environment has changed dramatically over the past few years as our traditional U.S. OEM customers, faced with intense international competition, have expanded their worldwide sourcing of components. As a result, we have experienced competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages, such as lower labor costs, lower health care costs, lower tax rates and, in some cases, export or raw materials subsidies. Increased competition could adversely affect our business.

Risks related to our business

We are under substantial pressure from OEMs to reduce the prices of our products.

There is substantial and continuing pressure on OEMs to reduce costs, including costs of products we supply. Annual price reductions to OEM customers are a permanent component of our business. To maintain our profit margins, we seek price reductions from our suppliers, improved production processes to increase manufacturing efficiency, updated product designs to reduce costs and develop new products, the benefits of which support stable or increased prices. Our ability to pass through increased raw material costs to our OEM customers is limited, with cost recovery often less than 100% and often on a delayed basis. Inability to reduce costs in an amount equal to annual price reductions, increases in raw material costs, and increases in employee wages and benefits could have an adverse effect on our business.

We continue to face volatile costs of commodities used in the production of our products.

The Company uses a variety of commodities (including aluminum, copper, nickel, plastic resins, steel, other raw materials and energy) and materials purchased in various forms such as castings, powder metal, forgings, stampings and bar stock. Increasing commodity costs will have an impact on our results.  We have sought to alleviate the impact of increasing costs by including a material pass-through provision in our customer contracts wherever possible and by selectively hedging certain commodity exposures. Customers frequently challenge these contractual provisions and rarely pay the full cost of any material increases. The discontinuation or lessening of our ability to pass-through or hedge increasing commodity costs could adversely affect our business.

From time to time, commodity prices may also fall rapidly. When this happens, suppliers may withdraw capacity from the market until prices improve which may cause periodic supply interruptions. The same may be true of our transportation carriers and energy providers.  If these supply interruptions occur, it could adversely affect our business.

We use important intellectual property in our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected.

We own important intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements. Our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve. Our competitors may develop



technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license. Further, as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the enforcement of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases, despite efforts we undertake to protect them. Developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights, and any inability to protect or enforce these rights, could adversely affect our business and our competitive position.

We are subject to business continuity risks associated with increasing centralization of our information technology systems.

To improve efficiency and reduce costs, we have regionally centralized the information systems that support our business processes such as invoicing, payroll and general management operations.  If the centralized systems are disrupted or disabled, key business processes could be interrupted, which could adversely affect our business.

A failure of our information technology (IT) infrastructure could adversely impact our business and operations.

We rely on the capacity, reliability and security of our IT systems and infrastructure. IT systems are vulnerable to disruptions, including those resulting from natural disasters, cyber-attacks or failures in third-party-provided services. Disruptions and attacks on our IT systems pose a risk to the security of our systems and our ability to protect our networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our third-party data. As a result, such attacks or disruptions could potentially lead to the inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, including our intellectual property, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, production downtimes and both internal and external supply shortages. This could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers and suppliers, lead to claims against the Company and ultimately adversely affect our business.

Our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel.

Our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce worldwide.  Any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees in numbers sufficient for our needs could adversely affect our business.

Part of our workforce is unionized which could subject us to work stoppages.

As of December 31, 2015, approximately

16%

of our U.S. workforce was unionized. We have domestic collective bargaining agreements for one facility in New York, which expires in September 2016, and one facility in Oklahoma, which expires in March 2019. The workforce at certain of our international facilities is also unionized. A prolonged dispute with our employees could have an adverse effect on our business.

We are impacted by the rising cost of providing benefits and certain retirement benefit plans we sponsor are currently unfunded or underfunded.

We sponsor certain retirement benefit plans worldwide that are unfunded or underfunded and will require cash payments. If the performance of the assets in our funded pension plans do not meet our expectations, if medical costs continue to increase or actuarial assumptions are modified, our required cash payments may be higher than we expect.



We are subject to extensive environmental regulations.

Our operations are subject to laws governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharges to waters and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste and other materials. The operation of automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas, and we cannot assure  that we will not incur material costs or liabilities as a result. Through various acquisitions over the years, we have acquired a number of manufacturing facilities, and we cannot assure that we will not incur material costs and liabilities relating to activities that predate our ownership. In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental, health and safety laws that may be adopted in the future. Costs associated with failure to comply with environmental regulations could have an adverse effect on our business.

We have liabilities related to environmental, product warranties, litigation and other claims.

We and certain of our current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and equivalent state laws.

We provide product warranties to our customers for some of our products. Under these product warranties, we may be required to bear costs and expenses for the repair or replacement of these products. We cannot assure that costs and expenses associated with these product warranties will not be material, or that those costs will not exceed any amounts accrued for such product warranties in our financial statements.

We are currently, and may in the future become, subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes. These claims typically arise in the normal course of business and may include, but not be limited to, commercial or contractual disputes with our customers and suppliers, intellectual property matters, personal injury, product liability (including claims associated with the presence of asbestos in historical products), environmental and employment claims. There is a possibility that such claims may have an adverse impact on our business that is greater than we anticipate. While the Company maintains insurance for certain risks, the amount of insurance may not be adequate to cover all insured claims and liabilities. The incurring of significant liabilities for which there is no, or insufficient, insurance coverage could adversely affect our business.

Compliance with and changes in laws could be costly and could affect operating results. In addition, government disruptions could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business.

We have operations in multiple countries that can be impacted by expected and unexpected changes in the legal and business environments in which we operate. Compliance related issues in certain countries associated with laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws could also adversely affect our business.

Changes that could impact the legal environment include new legislation, new regulations, new policies, investigations and legal proceedings and new interpretations of existing legal rules and regulations, in particular, changes in import and export control laws or exchange control laws, additional restrictions on doing business in countries subject to sanctions, and changes in laws in countries where we operate or intend to operate. In addition, government disruptions, such as government shutdowns, may delay or halt the granting and renewal of permits, licenses and other items required by us and our customers to conduct our business.



Changes in tax laws or tax rates taken by taxing authorities and tax audits could adversely affect our business.

Changes in tax laws or tax rates, the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various tax authorities, and the ability to fully utilize our tax loss carryforwards and tax credits could adversely affect  our operating results. In addition, we may periodically restructure our legal entity organization.

If taxing authorities were to disagree with our tax positions in connection with any such restructurings, our effective tax rate could be materially affected. Our tax filings for various periods are subject to audit by the tax authorities in most jurisdictions where we conduct business. We have received tax assessments from various taxing authorities and are currently at varying stages of appeals and/or litigation regarding these matters. These audits may result in assessment of additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or through the courts. We believe these assessments may occasionally be based on erroneous and even arbitrary interpretations of local tax law. Resolution of any tax matters involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the outcomes will be favorable.

Our growth strategy may prove unsuccessful.

We have a stated goal of increasing sales and operating income at a rate greater than global vehicle production by increasing content per vehicle with innovative new components and through select acquisitions.

We may not meet our goal because of any of the following, or other factors: (a) the failure to develop new products that will be purchased by our customers; (b) technology changes rendering our products obsolete; and (c) a reversal of the trend of supplying systems (which allows us to increase content per vehicle) instead of components.

We expect to continue to pursue business ventures, acquisitions, and strategic alliances that leverage our technology capabilities, enhance our customer base, geographic representation, and scale to complement our current businesses and we regularly evaluate potential growth opportunities, some of which could be material. While we believe that such transactions are an integral part of our long-term strategy, there are risks and uncertainties related to these activities. Assessing a potential growth opportunity involves extensive due diligence. However, the amount of information we can obtain about a potential growth opportunity may be limited, and we can give no assurance that past or future business ventures, acquisitions, and strategic alliances will positively affect our financial performance or will perform as planned. We may not be able to successfully assimilate or integrate companies that we have acquired or acquire in the future, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures. The integration of companies that we have acquired or acquire in the future may be more difficult, time consuming or costly than expected. Revenues following the acquisition of a company may be lower than expected, customer loss and business disruption (including, without limitation, difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees, customers, or suppliers) may be greater than expected and the retention of key employees at the acquired company may not be achieved. We may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company. If we fail to assimilate or integrate acquired companies successfully, our business, reputation and operating results could be adversely affected. Likewise, our failure to integrate and manage acquired companies successfully may lead to future impairment of any associated goodwill and intangible asset balances. Failure to execute our growth strategy could adversely affect our business.



We are subject to risks related to our international operations.

We have manufacturing and technical facilities in many regions including Europe, Asia, the Americas and Africa. For 2015, approximately

75%

of our consolidated net sales were outside the U.S. Consequently, our results could be affected by changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies, trade restrictions or prohibitions, import or other charges or taxes, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, limitations on the repatriation of funds, changing economic conditions, unreliable intellectual property protection and legal systems, insufficient infrastructures, social unrest, political instability and disputes, and international terrorism. Compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations of various countries is challenging, burdensome and expensive.

The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars using the period-end exchange rate for assets and liabilities and an average exchange rate for each period for revenues, expenses and capital expenditures. The local currency is the functional currency for substantially all of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. Significant foreign currency fluctuations and the associated translation of those foreign currencies could adversely affect our business.

Our business in China is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic, political and market conditions.

Maintaining a strong position in the Chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy. The automotive supply market in China is highly competitive, with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers. As the Chinese market evolves, we anticipate that market participants will act aggressively to increase or maintain their market share. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share. In addition, our business in China is sensitive to economic, political and market conditions that drive sales volume in China. If we are unable to maintain our position in the Chinese market or if vehicle sales in China decrease, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.

A downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets.

Changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately impact our access to the debt capital markets and the costs we incur to borrow funds. If ratings for our debt fall below investment grade, our access to the debt capital markets could become restricted.

Our revolving credit agreement includes an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded.  The interest costs on our revolving credit agreement are based on a rating grid agreed to in our credit agreement.  Further, an increase in the level of our indebtedness and related interest costs may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing.

We could incur additional restructuring charges as we continue to execute actions in an effort to improve future profitability and competitiveness and may not achieve the anticipated savings and benefits from these actions.

We have and may continue to initiate restructuring actions designed to improve future profitability and competitiveness, enhance treasury management flexibility or create an optimal legal entity structure. We may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from past or future actions in full or in part or within the time periods we expect. We are also subject to the risks of labor unrest, negative publicity and business disruption in connection with our actions. Failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our actions could have an adverse effect on our business.



Risks related to our customers

We rely on sales to major customers.

We rely on sales to OEMs around the world of varying credit quality and manufacturing demands. Supply to several of these customers requires significant investment by the Company. We base our growth projections, in part, on commitments made by our customers. These commitments generally renew yearly during a program life cycle. If actual production orders from our customers do not approximate such commitments due to a variety of factors including non-renewal of purchase orders, a customer's financial hardship or other unforeseen reasons, it could adversely affect our business.

Some of our sales are concentrated. Our worldwide sales in 2015 to Volkswagen and Ford constituted approximately

15%

each of our 2015 consolidated net sales.

We are sensitive to the effects of our major customers’ labor relations.

All three of our primary North American customers, Ford, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and General Motors, have major union contracts with the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America. Because of domestic OEMs' dependence on a single union, we are affected by labor difficulties and work stoppages at OEMs' facilities. Similarly, a majority of our global customers' operations outside of North America are also represented by various unions. Any extended work stoppage could have an adverse effect on our business.

Risks related to our suppliers

We could be adversely affected by supply shortages of components from our suppliers.

In an effort to manage and reduce the cost of purchased goods and services, we have been rationalizing our supply base. As a result, we are dependent on fewer sources of supply for certain components used in the manufacture of our products. The Company selects suppliers based on total value (including total landed price, quality, delivery, and technology), taking into consideration their production capacities and financial condition. We expect that they will deliver to our stated written expectations.

However, there can be no assurance that capacity limitations, labor unrest, weather emergencies, commercial disputes, government actions, riots, wars, sabotage, cyber attacks, non-conforming parts, acts of terrorism, “Acts of God," or other problems experienced by our suppliers will not result in occasional shortages or delays in their supply of components to us. If we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers and could not procure the components from other sources, we would be unable to meet the production schedules for some of our key products and could miss customer delivery expectations. This could adversely affect our customer relations and business.

Suppliers’ economic distress could result in the disruption of our operations and could adversely affect our business.

Rapidly changing industry conditions such as volatile production volumes; credit tightness; changes in foreign currencies; raw material, commodity, transportation, and energy price escalation; drastic changes in consumer preferences; and other factors could adversely affect our supply chain, and sometimes with little advanced notice. These conditions could also result in increased commercial disputes and supply interruption risks. In certain instances, it would be difficult and expensive for us to change suppliers that are critical to our business. On occasion, we must provide financial support to distressed suppliers or take other measures to protect our supply lines. We cannot predict with certainty the potential adverse effects these costs might have on our business.



We are subject to possible insolvency of outsourced service providers.

The Company relies on third party service providers for administration of legal claims, health care benefits, pension benefits, stockholder and bondholder registration and other services. These service providers contribute to the efficient conduct of the Company's business.  Insolvency of one or more of these service providers could adversely affect our business.

We are subject to possible insolvency of financial counterparties.

The Company engages in numerous financial transactions and contracts including insurance policies, letters of credit, credit line agreements, financial derivatives, and investment management agreements involving various counterparties. The Company is subject to the risk that one or more of these counterparties may become insolvent and therefore be unable to meet its obligations under such contracts.

Other risks

A variety of other factors could adversely affect our business.

Any of the following could materially and adversely affect our business: the loss of or changes in supply contracts or sourcing strategies of our major customers or suppliers; start-up expenses associated with new vehicle programs or delays or cancellation of such programs, utilization of our manufacturing facilities, which can be dependent on a single product line or customer; inability to recover engineering and tooling costs; market and financial consequences of recalls that may be required on products we supplied; delays or difficulties in new product development; the possible introduction of similar or superior technologies by others; global excess capacity and vehicle platform proliferation; and the impact of fire, flood or other natural disasters.

A summary of non-comparable items impacting the Company’s net earnings for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 is as follows:

Year ended December 31, 2015:

•

The Company incurred restructuring expense of

$65.7 million

, associated with both the Drivetrain and Engine segments and a global realignment plan. The Drivetrain segment charges mostly represent expenses associated with severance agreements with

three

labor unions at separate facilities in Western Europe for approximately


employees, as well as restructuring of the 2015 Remy International, Inc. ("Remy") acquisition. The Engine segment charges primarily relate to the restructuring of the 2014 Gustav Wahler GmbH u. Co. KG and its general partner ("Wahler") acquisition. These expenses included

$41.5 million

related to employee termination benefits and

$11.7 million

of other expenses. Both the Drivetrain and Engine restructuring actions are designed to improve the future profitability and competitiveness of each segment. The Company estimates that additional restructuring expense of approximately $4 million will be incurred related to the Drivetrain segment. Also included in the restructuring amount above is

$12.5 million

related to a global realignment plan intended to enhance treasury management flexibility by creating a legal entity structure that better aligns with the Company's business strategy.

•

The Company incurred a non-cash settlement loss of

•

The Company recorded tax benefits of

$5.1 million

,

$2.0 million

Net Sales

Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled

$8,023.2 million

, a

3.4%

decrease from the year ended December 31, 2014. Excluding the impact of weakening foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, the 2014 Wahler acquisition, the 2015 BERU Diesel acquisition and the 2015 Remy acquisition, net sales increased 4.3%.



Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 totaled

$8,305.1 million

, a

11.7%

increase from the year ended December 31, 2013. Excluding the impact of the 2014 Wahler acquisition and weaker foreign currencies, primarily the Yen and the Real partially offset by the Won, net sales increased 7.9%.

The following table details our results of operations as a percentage of net sales:

Cost of sales

as a percentage of net sales was

78.8%

,

78.9%

and

79.1%

in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company's material cost of sales was 50% to 55% of net sales in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. The Company's remaining cost to convert raw material to finished product, which includes direct labor and manufacturing overhead, had continued to improve during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 compared to 2013. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was

21.2%

,

21.1%

and

20.9%

in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Selling, general and administrative

expenses

(“SG&A”) was

$662.0 million

,

$698.9 million

and

$639.7 million

or

8.3%

,

8.4%

and

8.6%

of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Research and development ("R&D") costs, net of customer reimbursements, was

$307.4 million

, or

3.8%

of net sales, in the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to

$336.2 million

, or

4.0%

of net sales, and

$303.2 million

, or

4.1%

of net sales, in the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We will continue to invest in a number of cross-business R&D programs, as well as a number of other key programs, all of which are necessary for short- and long-term growth. Our current long-term expectation for R&D spending is approximately 4% of net sales.

Other expense, net

was

$101.4 million

,

$93.8 million

and

$62.6 million

for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. This line item is primarily comprised of transactions discussed within the subtitle "Non-comparable items impacting the Company's earnings per diluted share and net earnings" above.

Equity in affiliates' earnings, net of tax

was

$40.0 million

,

$47.3 million

and

$43.5 million

in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. This line item is driven by the results of our 50%-owned Japanese joint venture, NSK-Warner, and our 32.6%-owned Indian joint venture, Turbo Energy Private Limited (“TEL”).  The decrease in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 and 2013 is primarily driven by lower earnings from NSK as a result of lower sales in China. Refer to Note 5, "Balance



Sheet Information," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for further discussion of NSK-Warner.

Interest expense and finance charges

were

$60.4 million

,

$36.4 million

and

$34.2 million

in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was primarily due to the Company's March and November 2015 issuances of senior notes.

Provision for income taxes

The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of

30.3%

for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with rates of

29.9%

and

25.1%

for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

The effective tax rate of

30.3%

for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes tax benefits of

$9.0 million

,

$3.8 million

and

$3.7 million

related to the pension settlement loss, merger and acquisition expense and restructuring expense discussed in Note 3, "Other Expense, Net," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of the report. Additionally, the effective tax rate includes a tax benefit of

$9.9 million

primarily related to foreign tax incentives and tax settlements. Excluding the impact of these non-comparable items, the Company's annual effective tax rate associated with ongoing operations for 2015 was 29.8%.

The effective tax rate of

29.9%

for the year ended December 31, 2014 includes tax benefits of

$15.3 million

,

$0.4 million

and

$1.1 million

related to restructuring expense, intangible asset impairment losses and the pension settlement loss discussed in Note 3, "Other Expense, Net," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Excluding the impact of these non-comparable items, the Company's annual effective tax rate associated with ongoing operations for 2014 was 28.5%.

The effective tax rate of

25.1%

for the year ended December 31, 2013 includes tax benefits of

$5.1 million

,

$2.0 million

,

$3.8 million

and

$2.1 million

related to restructuring expense, intangible asset impairment losses, program termination agreement and retirement related obligations discussed in Note 3, "Other Expense, Net," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. This rate also includes a net tax benefit of

$6.7 million

related to the extension of the federal research and development credit and other international tax provisions resulting from the retroactive impact of U.S. legislation enacted in January 2013,

$2.2 million

related to 2012 provision to return and other tax adjustments and

$8.0 million

related to the reversal of certain state deferred tax asset valuation allowances, partially offset by a

$5.2 million

tax expense related to comprehensive income and other tax adjustments. Excluding the impact of these non-comparable items, the Company's annual effective tax rate associated with ongoing operations for 2013 was 25.9%.

Net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest, net of tax

of

$36.7 million

for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by

$5.0 million

and

$10.0 million

compared to the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was primarily related to higher sales and earnings by the Company's joint ventures.

Results By Reporting Segment

The Company's business is comprised of two reporting segments: Engine and Drivetrain. These segments are strategic business groups, which are managed separately as each represents a specific grouping of related automotive components and systems.

The Company allocates resources to each segment based upon the projected after-tax return on invested capital ("ROIC") of its business initiatives. ROIC is comprised of Adjusted EBIT after deducting notional taxes compared to the projected average capital investment required. Adjusted EBIT is comprised of earnings



before interest, income taxes and noncontrolling interest (“EBIT") adjusted for restructuring, goodwill impairment charges, affiliates' earnings and other items not reflective of ongoing operating income or loss.

Adjusted EBIT is the measure of segment income or loss used by the Company. The Company believes Adjusted EBIT is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our reporting segments.

The following tables show segment information and Adjusted EBIT for the Company's reporting segments.

Net Sales by Reporting Segment

Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes and Noncontrolling Interest ("Adjusted EBIT")

The

Engine

segment's net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased

$205.9 million

, or

3.6%

, and segment Adjusted EBIT decreased

$23.3 million

, or

2.5%

, from the year ended December 31, 2014. Excluding the impact of weakening foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, the 2014 Wahler acquisition and the 2015 BERU Diesel acquisition, net sales increased 6.7% from the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to higher sales of light vehicle turbochargers, partially offset by weak commercial vehicle markets around the world. The segment Adjusted EBIT margin was

16.4%

for the year ended December 31, 2015, up from

16.2%

in the year ended December 31, 2014.



The Engine segment's net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased

$683.8 million

, or

13.6%

, and segment Adjusted EBIT increased

$98.0 million

, or

11.9%

, from the year ended December 31, 2013. Excluding the impact of the 2014 Wahler acquisition and weaker foreign currencies, primarily the Yen and the Real, net sales increased 8.1% from the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to higher sales of turbochargers and engine timing devices. The segment Adjusted EBIT margin was

16.2%

for the year ended December 31, 2014, down from

16.4%

in the year ended December 31, 2013. The Adjusted EBIT margin decrease was driven by the Wahler acquisition, which increased sales with minimal contribution to Adjusted EBIT primarily due to expenses associated with purchase accounting adjustments.

The

Drivetrain

segment's net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased

$74.7 million

, or

2.8%

, and segment Adjusted EBIT decreased

$8.7 million

, or

2.9%

, from the year ended December 31, 2014. Excluding the impact of weakening foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, and the 2015 Remy acquisition, net sales decreased 0.8% from the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to lower sales of transmission components in Europe. The segment Adjusted EBIT margin was

11.5%

in the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to

11.5%

in the year ended December 31, 2014.

The Drivetrain segment's net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased

$184.9 million

, or

7.6%

, and segment Adjusted EBIT increased

$51.1 million

, or

20.3%

, from the year ended December 31, 2013. Excluding the impact of strengthening foreign currencies, primarily the Won, net sales increased 7.4% from the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to higher sales of all-wheel drive systems, traditional transmission components, and dual clutch transmission modules. The segment Adjusted EBIT margin was

11.5%

in the year ended December 31, 2014, up from

10.3%

in the year ended December 31, 2013. The Adjusted EBIT margin increase was primarily driven by operational improvements and continued cost management.

Corporate

represents headquarters' expenses not directly attributable to the individual segments and equity in affiliates' earnings. This net expense was

$113.2 million

,

$112.1 million

and

$110.0 million

for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Outlook

Our overall outlook for 2016 is cautious. The Company expects weak global production growth, but moderate net new business-related sales growth in 2016 due to rapid adoption of BorgWarner products around the world, partially offset by a stronger U.S. dollar, which would reduce the U.S. dollar value of its foreign currency-denominated sales.

The Company maintains a positive long-term outlook for its global business and is committed to new product development and strategic capital investments to enhance its product leadership strategy. The trends that are driving our long-term growth are expected to continue, including the growth of direct injection gasoline engines worldwide, the increased adoption of automated transmissions in Europe and Asia-Pacific, and the move to variable cam and chain engine timing systems in Europe and Asia-Pacific.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Company maintains various liquidity sources including cash and cash equivalents and the unused portion of our multi-currency revolving credit agreement.  At December 31, 2015, the Company had

$577.7 million

of cash, of which $441.3 million of cash was held by our subsidiaries outside of the United States. Cash held by these subsidiaries is used to fund foreign operational activities and future investments, including acquisitions.  The vast majority of cash held outside the United States is available for repatriation, however, doing so could result in increased foreign and U.S. federal, state and local income taxes.  A deferred tax liability has been recorded for the portion of these funds anticipated to be repatriated to the United States.  The Company uses its U.S. liquidity primarily for various corporate purposes, including but not limited to, debt service, share repurchases, dividend distributions and other corporate expenses.



On November 6, 2015, BorgWarner Inc. issued

€500 million

in 1.80% senior notes due November 2022. Interest is payable annually in arrears on November 7 of each year, beginning on November 7, 2016.

These senior notes are not guaranteed by any of BorgWarner Inc.'s subsidiaries.

On March 16, 2015, BorgWarner Inc. issued

$500 million

in 3.375% senior notes due March 2025 and

$500 million

in 4.375% senior notes due March 2045. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year.

The Company used the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, repurchasing shares of the Company's common stock pursuant to our previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program and repaying U.S. short-term debt.

These senior notes are not guaranteed by any of BorgWarner Inc.'s subsidiaries.

The Company has a

$1 billion

multi-currency revolving credit facility which includes a feature that allows the Company's borrowings to be increased to

$1.25 billion

.

The facility provides for borrowings through June 30, 2019. The Company has one key financial covenant as part of the credit agreement which is a debt to EBITDA ("Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization") ratio.

The Company was in compliance with the financial covenant at December 31, 2015 and expects to remain compliant in future periods. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under this facility.

The Company's commercial paper program allows the Company to issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of

$1 billion

.

Under this program, the Company may issue notes from time to time and will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.

At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had outstanding borrowings of

$215.0 million

and

$460.9 million

, respectively,

under this program, which is classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Notes payable and other short-term debt.

The total current combined borrowing capacity under the multi-currency revolving credit facility and commercial paper program cannot exceed

$1 billion

.

In addition to the credit facility, the Company's universal shelf registration has an unlimited amount of various debt and equity instruments that could be issued.

On February 11, 2015, April 29, 2015, July 29, 2015 and November 11, 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of

$0.13

per share of common stock.  These dividends were paid in the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.

The Company's net debt to net capital ratio was

35.4%

at December 31, 2015 versus

12.8%

at December 31, 2014.

From a credit quality perspective, the Company has a credit rating of Baa1 from Moody's and BBB+ from both Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings. On March 5, 2015, Moody's upgraded the Company's credit rating from Baa2 to Baa1. The current outlook from Moody's, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings is stable. None of the Company’s debt agreements require accelerated repayment in the event of a downgrade in credit ratings.



Capitalization

Balance sheet debt increased by

$1,226.1 million

and cash decreased by

$220.1 million

compared with December 31, 2014. The

$1,446.2 million

increase in balance sheet debt (net of cash) was primarily due to the $1 billion issuance of senior notes in March 2015, the

€500 million

issuance of senior notes in November 2015, the 2015 acquisitions of Remy and BERU Diesel, capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividends paid to stockholders, partially offset by net cash provided by operating activities.

Total equity decreased by

$59.4 million

in the year ended December 31, 2015 as follows:

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was

$867.9 million

,

$801.8 million

and

$718.8 million

in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily reflects improved working capital, partially offset by lower net earnings adjusted for non-cash charges to operations.  The increase for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared with the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily reflects higher net earnings adjusted for non-cash charges to operations.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was

$1,759.1 million

,

$665.1 million

and

$384.8 million

in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  The increase in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with the year ended December 31, 2014 is primarily driven by the 2015 acquisitions of Remy and BERU Diesel and higher capital expenditures, partially offset by the 2014 acquisition of Wahler and a gain on the settlement of net investment hedges in 2015.  The increase in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared with the year ended December 31, 2013 is primarily driven by the acquisition of Wahler and higher capital expenditures including tooling outlays. Year over year capital spending increases of

$14.3 million

and

$145.2 million

during the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, were primarily due to higher spending levels required to meet increased program launches worldwide.



Financing Activities

Net cash provided by financing activities was

$736.6 million

for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily driven by the $1 billion issuance of senior notes in March 2015 and the

€500 million

issuance of senior notes in November 2015, partially offset by the decrease in notes payable, treasury stock purchases and dividend payments. Net cash used in financing activities was

$201.7 million

and

$135.4 million

for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The $66.3 million increase in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared with the year ended December 31, 2013 is primarily driven by lower net borrowings in 2014 and higher dividends paid to BorgWarner stockholders, partially offset by higher payments for the purchase of treasury stock in 2013.

The Company's significant contractual obligation payments at December 31, 2015 are as follows:

________________

(a)

Other postretirement employee benefits, excluding pensions, include anticipated future payments to cover retiree medical and life insurance benefits. Refer to Note 11, "Retirement Benefit Plans," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for disclosures related to the Company’s other postretirement employee benefits.

(b)

Since the timing and amount of payments for funded defined benefit pension plans are usually not certain for future years such potential payments are not shown in this table.  Amount contained in “After 2020” column is for unfunded plans and includes estimated payments through 2025. Refer to Note 11, "Retirement Benefit Plans," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for disclosures related to the Company’s pension benefits.

(c)

Refer to Note 4, "Income Taxes," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for disclosures related to the Company’s income taxes.

We believe that the combination of cash from operations, cash balances, available credit facilities, and the universal shelf registration capacity will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for our current level of operations and our planned operations for the foreseeable future. We will continue to balance our needs for internal growth, external growth, debt reduction and cash conservation.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company has certain leases that are recorded as operating leases. Types of operating leases include leases on facilities, an airplane, vehicles and certain office equipment. The total expected future cash outlays for non-cancelable operating lease obligations at December 31, 2015 is

$76.6 million

. Refer to Note 16, "Leases and Commitments," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information on operating leases, including future minimum payments.



Pension and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits

The Company's policy is to fund its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with applicable government regulations and to make additional contributions when appropriate. At December 31, 2015, all legal funding requirements had been met. The Company contributed

$19.3 million

, $53.4 million and $150.4 million to its defined benefit pension plans in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

The Company expects to contribute a total of

$15 million

to

$25 million

into its defined benefit pension plans during 2016. Of the

$15 million

to

$25 million

in projected 2016 contributions,

$8.5 million

are contractually obligated, while any remaining payments would be discretionary.

The funded status of all pension plans was a net unfunded position of

$178.3 million

and

$172.8 million

at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Of these amounts,

$64.3 million

and

$76.5 million

at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, were related to plans in Germany, where there is not a tax deduction allowed under the applicable regulations to fund the plans; hence the common practice is to make contributions as benefit payments become due. In December 2014 and 2013, the Company made discretionary contributions of

$30.2 million

and

$137.5 million

, respectively to its German pension plans.

Other postretirement employee benefits primarily consist of postretirement health care benefits for certain employees and retirees of the Company's U.S. operations. The Company funds these benefits as retiree claims are incurred. Other postretirement employee benefits had an unfunded status of

$145.3 million

and

$169.7 million

at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

The Company believes it will be able to fund the requirements of these plans through cash generated from operations or other available sources of financing for the foreseeable future.

Refer to Note 11, "Retirement Benefit Plans," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits.

OTHER MATTERS

Contingencies

In the normal course of business, the Company is party to various commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints, including matters involving warranty claims, intellectual property claims, general liability and various other risks. It is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the Company will ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal matters or, if not, what the impact might be. The Company's environmental and product liability contingencies are discussed separately below. The Company's management does not expect that an adverse outcome in any of these commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows, although it could be material to the results of operations in a particular quarter.

Litigation

In January 2006, BorgWarner Diversified Transmission Products Inc. ("DTP"), a subsidiary of the Company, filed a declaratory judgment action in United States District Court, Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis Division) against the United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implements Workers of America (“UAW”) Local No. 287 and Gerald Poor, individually and as the representative of a defendant class. DTP sought the Court's affirmation that DTP did not violate the Labor-Management Relations Act or the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) by unilaterally amending certain medical plans effective April 1, 2006 and October 1, 2006, prior to the expiration of the then-current collective bargaining agreements. On September 10, 2008, the Court found that DTP's reservation of the right to make such amendments reducing the level of benefits provided to retirees was limited by its collectively bargained



health insurance agreement with the UAW, which did not expire until April 24, 2009. Thus, the amendments were untimely. In 2008, the Company recorded a charge of

$4.0 million

as a result of the Court's decision.

DTP filed a declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court, Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis Division) against the UAW Local No. 287 and Jim Barrett and others, individually and as representatives of a defendant class, on February 26, 2009 again seeking the Court's affirmation that DTP did not violate the Labor - Management Relations Act or ERISA by modifying the level of benefits provided retirees to make them comparable to other Company retiree benefit plans after April 24, 2009. Certain retirees, on behalf of themselves and others, filed a mirror-image action in the United States District Court, Eastern District of Michigan (Southern Division) on March 11, 2009, for which a class has been certified. During the last quarter of 2009, the action pending in Indiana was dismissed, while the action in Michigan is continuing. The Company is vigorously defending against the suit.  This contingency is subject to many uncertainties, therefore based on the information available to date, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the amount or the range of potential loss, if any.

Environmental

The Company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“Superfund”) and equivalent state laws and, as such, may presently be liable for the cost of clean-up and other remedial activities at


such sites. Responsibility for clean-up and other remedial activities at a Superfund site is typically shared among PRPs based on an allocation formula.

The Company believes that none of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Generally, this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not material or the liability will be shared with other PRPs, although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter.

Based on information available to the Company (which in most cases includes: an estimate of allocation of liability among PRPs; the probability that other PRPs, many of whom are large, solvent public companies, will fully pay the cost apportioned to them; currently available information from PRPs and/or federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs; and remediation alternatives), the Company has an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities of

$5.4 million

and

$6.2 million

at December 31, 2015 and at December 31, 2014, respectively. The Company expects to pay out substantially all of the amounts accrued for environmental liability over the next five years.

In connection with the sale of Kuhlman Electric Corporation (“Kuhlman Electric”), the Company agreed to indemnify the buyer and Kuhlman Electric for certain environmental liabilities, then unknown to the Company, relating to certain operations of Kuhlman Electric that pre-date the Company's 1999 acquisition of Kuhlman Electric. The Company previously settled or obtained dismissals of various lawsuits that were filed against Kuhlman Electric and others, including the Company, on behalf of plaintiffs alleging personal injury relating to alleged environmental contamination at its Crystal Springs, Mississippi plant. The Company filed a lawsuit against Kuhlman Electric and a related entity challenging the validity of the indemnity and the defendants filed counterclaims (the “Indemnity Action”) and a related lawsuit. On September 28, 2015, the parties entered into a confidential settlement agreement that, among other things, released and terminated all of BorgWarner’s indemnity obligations. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the parties voluntarily dismissed the Indemnity Action on September 29, 2015 and the related lawsuit was dismissed on October 13, 2015. The Company continues to pursue insurance coverage actions for reimbursement of amounts it spent under the indemnity. The Company may in the future become subject to further legal proceedings.



Product Liability

Like many other industrial companies who have historically operated in the U.S., the Company (or parties the Company is obligated to indemnify) continues to be named as one of many defendants in asbestos-related personal injury actions. We believe that the Company's involvement is limited because, in general, these claims relate to a few types of automotive products that were manufactured many years ago and contained encapsulated asbestos. The nature of the fibers, the encapsulation and the manner of use lead the Company to believe that these products are highly unlikely to cause harm. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Company had approximately

10,100

and

13,300

pending asbestos-related product liability claims, respectively.

The decrease in the pending claims is primarily a result of the Company's continued efforts to obtain dismissal of dormant claims.

The Company's policy is to vigorously defend against these lawsuits and the Company has been successful in obtaining dismissal of many claims without any payment.  The nature of the historical product being encapsulated and the lifecycle of the product allow the Company to aggressively defend against these lawsuits. The Company expects that the vast majority of the pending asbestos-related product liability claims where it is a defendant (or has an obligation to indemnify a defendant) will result in no payment being made by the Company or its insurers. In the full year of 2015, of the approximately

5,300

claims resolved,


(

7%

)

resulted in payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the Company. In the full year of 2014, of the approximately

6,500

claims resolved,


(

6%

)

resulted in payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the Company.

Prior to June 2004, the settlement and defense costs associated with all claims were paid by the Company's primary layer insurance carriers under a series of interim funding arrangements. In addition to the primary insurance available for asbestos-related claims, the Company has excess insurance coverage available for potential future asbestos-related product claims. In June 2004, primary layer insurance carriers notified the Company of the alleged exhaustion of their policy limits.

A declaratory judgment action was filed in January 2004 in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois by Continental Casualty Company and related companies against the Company and certain of its historical general liability insurers. The court has issued a number of interim rulings and discovery is continuing. The Company has entered into settlement agreements with some of its insurance carriers, resolving their coverage disputes by agreeing to pay specified amounts to the Company. This includes a settlement with a carrier that occurred in the third quarter of 2015. The Company is vigorously pursuing the litigation against the remaining insurers.

In August 2013, the Los Angeles Superior Court entered a jury verdict against the Company in an asbestos-related personal injury action with damages of

$35.0 million

, of which

$32.5 million

were punitive and would not be recoverable through insurance. In July 2015, the Court of Appeal for the State of California issued a decision striking the

$32.5 million

in punitive damages. The plaintiffs sought to reinstate the punitive damages by petitioning for review from the California Supreme Court. In October 2015, the California Supreme Court denied plaintiffs' petition for review. In December 2015, the Company satisfied the amended judgment in full, with respect to compensatory damages only, and received the acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment from the Los Angeles Superior Court. This decision did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

To date, the Company has paid and accrued

$391.7 million

in defense and indemnity costs in advance of insurers' reimbursement and has received

$228.4 million

in cash and notes from insurers. The net balance of

$163.3 million

is expected to be fully recovered. Timing of recovery is dependent on final resolution of the declaratory judgment action referred to above or additional negotiated settlements. At December 31, 2014, insurers owed

$141.9 million

in association with these claims.



In addition to the

$163.3 million

net balance relating to past settlements and defense costs, the Company has estimated a liability of

$108.5 million

for claims asserted, but not yet resolved and their related defense costs at December 31, 2015. The Company also has a related asset of

$108.5 million

to recognize proceeds from the insurance carriers, which is expected to be fully recovered. Receipt of these proceeds is not expected prior to the resolution of the declaratory judgment action referred to above, which is expected to occur subsequent to

December 31, 2016

.

At December 31, 2014, the comparable value of the accrued liability and associated insurance asset was

$111.8 million

.

The amounts recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the estimated future settlement of existing claims are as follows:

The Company believes that its ultimate liability (i.e., the total of its indemnity or other claim dispositions plus legal related fees) cannot be reasonably estimated at this time in excess of amounts accrued.  The Company's ability to reasonably estimate its liability has been significantly affected by, among other factors, the volatility of asbestos-related litigation in the United States, the significant number of co-defendants that have filed for bankruptcy, the magnitude and timing of co-defendant bankruptcy trust payments, the inherent uncertainty of future disease incidence and claiming patterns against the Company, and the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the state or federal levels.  The Company’s ability to reasonably estimate its liability for asbestos-related claims may also be affected in the future by the new discovery of facts; changes in litigation; the impact of any possible tort reform; changes in assumptions regarding the number and nature of asbestos-related claims, including the total population claiming exposure; the amounts of any judgments over time; and changes in settlement/defense strategies. The Company reviews factors relevant to asbestos-related claims that have been, or may in the future, be asserted against it on an ongoing basis.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management makes estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, relating to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our most critical accounting policies are discussed below.

Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the accompanying notes, as well as, the amounts of revenues and expenses reported during the periods covered by these financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.



Concentration of risk

The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its suppliers and customers and, with the exception of certain financing transactions, does not require collateral from its OEM customers. Some automotive parts suppliers continue to experience commodity cost pressures and the effects of industry overcapacity. These factors have increased pressure on the industry's supply base, as suppliers cope with changing commodity costs, lower production volumes and other challenges. The Company receives certain of its raw materials from sole suppliers or a limited number of suppliers. The inability of a supplier to fulfill supply requirements of the Company could affect future operating results.

Revenue recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss pass to the customer, which is usually upon shipment of product. Although the Company may enter into long-term supply agreements with its major customers, each shipment of goods is treated as a separate sale and the prices are not fixed over the life of the agreements.

Cost of sales

The Company includes materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead within cost of sales. Manufacturing overhead is comprised of indirect materials, indirect labor, factory operating costs and other such costs associated with manufacturing products for sale.

Impairment of long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets

The Company reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets, whether held for use or disposal, including other amortizing intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 360.  In assessing long-lived assets for an impairment loss, assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. In assessing long-lived assets for impairment, management generally considers individual facilities the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent. A recoverability review is performed using the undiscounted cash flows if there is a triggering event.  If the undiscounted cash flow test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment, management will perform a fair value analysis.  Management determines fair value under ASC Topic 820 using the appropriate valuation technique of market, income or cost approach.  If the carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.

Management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable; however, changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect the valuations.  Long-lived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.  Significant judgments and estimates used by management when evaluating long-lived assets for impairment include: (i) an assessment as to whether an adverse event or circumstance has triggered the need for an impairment review; (ii) undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset; and (iii) fair valuation of the asset.

Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets

During the fourth quarter of each year, the Company qualitatively assesses its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets assigned to each of its reporting units. This qualitative assessment evaluates various events and circumstances, such as macro economic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, relevant events and financial trends, that may impact a reporting unit's fair value. Using this qualitative assessment, the Company determines whether it is more-likely-than-not the reporting unit's fair value exceeds its carrying value. If it is determined that it is not more-likely-than-not the reporting unit's fair value exceeds the carrying value, or upon consideration of other factors, including recent acquisition or divestiture activity, the Company performs a quantitative, "step one," goodwill impairment analysis.

In addition, the Company may test goodwill in between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.

During the fourth quarter of 2015 and prior to the Remy acquisition, the Company performed a qualitative analysis on each reporting unit, except for reporting units with recent restructuring and acquisition activities,



and determined it was more-likely-than-not the fair value exceeded the carrying value of these reporting units. For the reporting units with recent restructuring and acquisition activities, the Company performed a quantitative, "step one," goodwill impairment analysis, which requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates. The basis of these goodwill impairment analyses is the Company's annual budget and long-range plan (“LRP”). The annual budget and LRP includes a five year projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments and assumes the last year of the LRP data is a fair indication of the future performance. Because the LRP is estimated over a significant future period of time, those estimates and assumptions are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. Further, the market valuation models and other financial ratios used by the Company require certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to the Company's facts and circumstances.

The Company believes the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values are reasonable.  Different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value.  The primary assumptions affecting the Company's December 31, 2015 goodwill quantitative, "step one," impairment reviews are as follows:

•

Discount rate:

The Company used a

10%

weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) as the discount rate for future cash flows. The WACC is intended to represent a rate of return that would be expected by a market participant.

•

Operating income margin:

The Company used historical and expected operating income margins, which may vary based on the projections of the reporting unit being evaluated.

I

n addition to the above primary assumptions, the Company notes the following risks to volume and operating income assumptions that could have an impact on the discounted cash flow models:

•

The automotive industry is cyclical and the Company's results of operations would be adversely affected by industry downturns.

•

The Company is dependent on market segments that use our key products and would be affected by decreasing demand in those segments.

•

The Company is subject to risks related to international operations.

Based on the assumptions outlined above, the impairment testing conducted in the fourth quarter of 2015 indicated the Company's goodwill assigned to these reporting units that were quantitatively assessed was not impaired and contained fair values substantially higher than the reporting units' carrying values. Additionally, sensitivity analyses were completed indicating a

one

percent increase in the discount rate or a

one

percent decrease in the operating margin assumptions would not result in the carrying values exceeding the fair values of the reporting units quantitatively assessed.

Refer to Note 6, "Goodwill and Other Intangibles," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding goodwill.



Product warranties

The Company provides warranties on some, but not all, of its products. The warranty terms are typically from one to three years. Provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold. These estimates are established using historical information about the nature, frequency and average cost of warranty claim settlements as well as product manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from third parties. Management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims. Management believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate; however, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to the accrual. Our warranty provision over the last three years, and as a percentage of net sales, has stabilized based on the Company's improved quality efforts and has trended as follows:

The following table illustrates the sensitivity of a 25 basis point change (as a percentage of net sales) in the assumed warranty trend on the Company's accrued warranty liability:

At December 31, 2015, the total accrued warranty liability was

$107.9 million

. The accrual is represented as

$70.6 million

in current liabilities and

$37.3 million

in non-current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Refer to Note 7, "Product Warranty," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding product warranties.

Other loss accruals and valuation allowances

The Company has numerous other loss exposures, such as customer claims, workers' compensation claims, litigation and recoverability of assets. Establishing loss accruals or valuation allowances for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and ultimate realization. The Company estimates losses under the programs using consistent and appropriate methods; however, changes to its assumptions could materially affect the recorded accrued liabilities for loss or asset valuation allowances.

Environmental contingencies

The Company works with outside experts to determine a range of potential liability for environmental sites. The ranges for each individual site are then aggregated into a loss range for the total accrued liability. We record an accrual at the most probable amount within the range unless one cannot be determined; in which case we record the accrual at the low end of the range. Management's estimate of the loss for environmental liability was

$5.4 million

at December 31, 2015.

Refer to Note 14, "Contingencies," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding environmental accrual.

Pension and other postretirement defined benefits

The Company provides postretirement defined benefits to a number of its current and former employees. Costs associated with postretirement defined benefits include pension and postretirement health care expenses for employees, retirees and surviving spouses and dependents.



The Company's defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 715. The determination of the Company's obligation and expense for its pension and other postretirement employee benefits, such as retiree health care, is dependent on certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. Certain assumptions, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rate, rates of increase in compensation and health care costs trends are described in Note 11, "Retirement Benefit Plans," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. The effects of any modification to those assumptions are either recognized immediately or amortized over future periods in accordance with GAAP.

In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from assumptions used are accumulated and generally amortized over future periods. The primary assumptions affecting the Company's accounting for employee benefits under ASC Topics 712 and 715 as of December 31, 2015 are as follows:

•

Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets

:  The expected long-term rate of return is used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost. The required use of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year.  Over time, however, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is designed to approximate actual earned long-term returns. The expected long-term rate of return for pension assets has been determined based on various inputs, including historical returns for the different asset classes held by the Company's trusts and its asset allocation, as well as inputs from internal and external sources regarding expected capital market return, inflation and other variables.  The Company also considers the impact of active management of the plans' invested assets. In determining its pension expense for the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company used long-term rates of return on plan assets ranging from 1.75% to 6.75% outside of the U.S. and 6.71% in the U.S.

Actual returns on U.S. pension assets were 0.1%, 10.3% and 8.3% for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 6.75% for the same years ended.

Actual returns on U.K. pension assets were 1.0%, 16.5% and 12.8% for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 6.75% for the same years ended.

Actual return on German pension assets was 5.1% and 14.5% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 6.6% for the same years ended.

•

Discount rate

:  At December 31, 2015, the Company changed the method used to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits for plans that utilize a yield curve approach. This change compared to the previous method will result in different service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost (credit) in future periods. Historically, the Company estimated these service and interest cost components utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. The Company elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. The Company made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the spot yield curve rates. The change in the service and interest costs going forward is not expected to be significant. The Company has accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate.

The discount rate is used to calculate pension and postretirement employee benefit obligations (“OPEB”). The Company used discount rates ranging from 0.50% to 8.75% to determine its pension and other



benefit obligations as of December 31, 2015, including weighted average discount rates of 4.15% in the U.S., 2.99% outside of the U.S., and 3.84% for U.S. other postretirement health care plans.  The U.S. discount rate reflects the fact that our U.S. pension plan has been closed for new participants since 1989 (1999 for our U.S. health care plan).

•

Health care cost trend

:  For postretirement employee health care plan accounting, the Company reviews external data and Company specific historical trends for health care cost to determine the health care cost trend rate assumptions.  In determining the projected benefit obligation for postretirement employee health care plans as of December 31, 2015, the Company used health care cost trend rates of

7.14%

, declining to an ultimate trend rate of

5%

by the year 2022.

While the Company believes that these assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the Company's pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations and its future expense.

The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for Company sponsored U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans on its 2016 pre-tax pension expense:

________________

* A one percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have a negligible impact on the Company’s U.S. 2016 pre-tax pension expense.

The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the Company’s U.S. OPEB interest expense:

The sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the Company's total 2016 U.S. OPEB expense is expected to be negligible, as any increase in interest expense will be offset by net actuarial gains.

The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a one-percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend related to the Company's OPEB obligation and service and interest cost:

Refer to Note 11, "Retirement Benefit Plans," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding the Company’s retirement benefit plans.

Income taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between



financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

Management judgment is required in determining the Company’s provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the Company’s net deferred tax assets. In calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis, the Company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial performance of the operation recording the net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information. Since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to the Company’s valuation allowance may be necessary.

The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. at the federal and state level and numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is less than certain. Accruals for income tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of ASC Topic 605. The Company’s U.S. federal and certain state income tax returns and certain non-U.S. income tax returns are currently under various stages of audit by applicable tax authorities. Although the outcome of ongoing tax audits is always uncertain, management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments, if any, which may be proposed by the taxing authorities. At December 31, 2015, the Company has recorded a liability for its best estimate of the more-likely-than-not loss on certain of its tax positions, which is included in other non-current liabilities. Nonetheless, the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year.

Refer to Note 4, "Income Taxes," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding income taxes.



New Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,

"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes."

Under this guidance, deferred tax liabilities and assets are required to be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position.  Prior to this guidance, the deferred taxes for each jurisdiction (or tax-paying component of a jurisdiction) would be presented as a net current asset or liability and net non-current asset or liability. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with earlier application permitted. The Company adopted this guidance prospectively as of December 31, 2015 and accordingly, prior period amounts have not been revised.

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,

"Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments."

Under this guidance, an acquirer is required to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015.  The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15,

"Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements."

Under this guidance, debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements would be deferred as an asset and amortized ratably over the term, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement.  This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015.  The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,

"Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory."

Under this guidance, inventory should be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using LIFO or the retail inventory method. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-07,

"Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent)."

Under this guidance, investments measured at net asset value, as a practical expedient for fair value, are excluded from the fair value hierarchy. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have an impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, but will impact pension asset disclosures.

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,

"Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,"

which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. Under this guidance such costs would be presented as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company's adoption of this guidance as of December 31, 2015 would result in the reduction of assets and liabilities by approximately

$16 million

.

In May 2014, the FASB amended the Accounting Standards Codification to add Topic 606,

"Revenue from Contracts with Customers,"

outlining a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and superseding most current revenue recognition guidance. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.



QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company's primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We are also affected by changes in the prices of commodities used or consumed in our manufacturing operations. Some of our commodity purchase price risk is covered by supply agreements with customers and suppliers. Other commodity purchase price risk is addressed by hedging strategies, which include forward contracts. The Company enters into derivative instruments only with high credit quality counterparties and diversifies its positions across such counterparties in order to reduce its exposure to credit losses. We do not engage in any derivative instruments for purposes other than hedging specific operating risks.

We have established policies and procedures to manage sensitivity to interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and commodity purchase price risk, which include monitoring the level of exposure to each market risk.  For quantitative disclosures about market risk, refer to Note 10, "Financial Instruments," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for information with respect to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates.  The Company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to optimize its interest costs. The Company selectively uses interest rate swaps to reduce market value risk associated with changes in interest rates (fair value hedges). At December 31, 2015, the amount of debt with fixed interest rates was 81.1% of total debt, including the impact of the interest rate swaps.  Our earnings exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to floating money market rates.  A 10% increase or decrease in the average cost of our variable rate debt would result in a change in pre-tax interest expense of approximately $2.1 million, $0.2 million and $1.7 million in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

Foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  Currently, our most significant currency exposures relate to the British Pound, the Chinese Yuan, the Euro, the Hungarian Forint, the Japanese Yen, the Mexican Peso, the Swedish Krona and the South Korean Won.  We mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate risk by establishing local production facilities and related supply chain participants in the markets we serve, by invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of the products and by funding some of our investments in foreign markets through local currency loans. Such non-U.S. Dollar debt was $144.6 million and $129.6 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  We also monitor our foreign currency exposure in each country and implement strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments.  In addition, the Company periodically enters into forward currency contracts in order to reduce exposure to exchange rate risk related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.  As a result of the Remy acquisition, the Company acquired foreign exchange forward contracts with market values reflecting a cumulative loss of

$7.5 million

.  These contracts were assumed by the Company at fair market value and designated as hedges of future cash flows.  As of December 31, 2015, the Company was holding foreign exchange derivatives with positive and negative fair market values of $2.4 million and $2.5 million, respectively, all of which mature in less than one year.

The foreign currency translation adjustment losses of

$260.5 million

and

$341.8 million

for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and the foreign currency translation adjustment income of

$40.3 million

for the year ended December 31, 2013 contained within our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income represent the foreign currency translational impacts of converting our non-U.S. dollar subsidiaries financial statements to the Company’s reporting currency (U.S. Dollar).  The 2015 foreign



currency translation adjustment loss was primarily due to the impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar, which increased approximately 10% in relation to the Euro between December 31, 2014 and 2015. This 10% change in the Euro increased other comprehensive loss by approximately $220 million. The 2014 foreign currency translation adjustment loss was primarily due to the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar, which increased approximately 12% in relation to the Euro between December 31, 2013 and 2014.  This 12% change in the Euro increased other comprehensive loss by approximately $243 million. The 2013 foreign currency translation adjustment income was primarily due to the impact of a weakening U.S. Dollar in relation to the Euro.

Commodity Price Risk

Commodity price risk is the possibility that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in the cost of raw materials used in the production of our products.  Commodity forward and option contracts are executed to offset our exposure to potential change in prices mainly for various non-ferrous metals and natural gas consumption used in the manufacturing of vehicle components.  As a result of the Remy acquisition, the Company acquired commodity derivative contracts with market values reflecting a cumulative loss of

$9.2 million

. These contracts were assumed by the Company at fair market value and have been designated as hedges of future cash flows. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had forward and option commodity contracts with a total notional value of $38.8 million. As of December 31, 2015, the Company was holding commodity derivatives with a negative fair market value of $2.1 million, of which $2.0 million mature in less than one year.

Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

The matters discussed in this Item 7 include forward looking statements. See "Forward Looking Statements" at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of BorgWarner Inc.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of BorgWarner Inc.

and its subsidiaries

at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015

in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Remy International, Inc. from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during November 2015. We have also excluded Remy International, Inc. from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Remy International, Inc. is a wholly-owned business whose total assets and total net sales represent 8% and 2%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INTRODUCTION

BorgWarner Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries (the “Company”) is a leading global supplier of highly engineered automotive systems and components primarily for powertrain applications. Our products help improve vehicle performance, fuel efficiency, stability and air quality. These products are manufactured and sold worldwide, primarily to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) of light vehicles (passenger cars, sport-utility vehicles ("SUVs"), vans and light trucks). The Company's products are also sold to other OEMs of commercial vehicles (medium-duty trucks, heavy-duty trucks and buses) and off-highway vehicles (agricultural and construction machinery and marine applications). We also manufacture and sell our products to certain Tier One vehicle systems suppliers and into the aftermarket for light, commercial and off-highway vehicles. The Company operates manufacturing facilities serving customers in Europe, Asia, the Americas and Africa and is an original equipment supplier to every major automotive OEM in the world. The Company's products fall into two reporting segments:  Engine and Drivetrain.

NOTE 1

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following paragraphs briefly describe the Company's significant accounting policies.

Basis of presentation

On November 13, 2013, the Company's Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend on its common stock. To implement this stock split, shares of common stock were issued on December 16, 2013 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 2, 2013. All prior year share and per share amounts disclosed in this document have been restated to reflect the two-for-one stock split. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.

Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the accompanying notes, as well as, the amounts of revenues and expenses reported during the periods covered by these financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Principles of consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include all majority-owned subsidiaries with a controlling financial interest. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in

20%

to

50%

owned affiliates are accounted for under the equity method when the Company does not have a controlling financial interest.

Revenue recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss pass to the customer, which is usually upon shipment of product. Although the Company may enter into long-term supply agreements with its major customers, each shipment of goods is treated as a separate sale and the prices are not fixed over the life of the agreements.

Cost of sales

The Company includes materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead within cost of sales. Manufacturing overhead is comprised of indirect materials, indirect labor, factory operating costs and other such costs associated with manufacturing products for sale.

Cash

Cash is valued at fair market value. It is the Company's policy to classify all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less as cash. Cash is maintained with several financial institutions.  Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and therefore bear minimal risk.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Restricted cash

Restricted cash relates to amounts deposited with the paying agent to settle shares of Remy International Inc. ("Remy") stock in connection with the acquisition of Remy on November 10, 2015, that have not been paid to the shareholders.

Receivables, net

The Company factors certain receivables through third party financial institutions without recourse. These are treated as a sale. The transactions are accounted for as a reduction in accounts receivable as the agreements transfer effective control over and risk related to the receivables to the buyers. The Company does not service any domestic accounts after the factoring has occurred. The Company does not have any servicing assets or liabilities.

See the Balance Sheet Information footnote to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on receivables, net.

Inventories, net

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost of certain U.S. inventories is determined using the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method, while other U.S. and foreign operations use the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) or average-cost methods. Inventory held by U.S. operations using the LIFO method was

$122.2 million

and

$108.7 million

at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Such inventories, if valued at current cost instead of LIFO, would have been greater by

$14.2 million

and

$18.3 million

at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

See the Balance Sheet Information footnote to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on inventories, net.

Pre-production costs related to long-term supply arrangements

Engineering, research and development and other design and development costs for products sold on long-term supply arrangements are expensed as incurred unless the Company has a contractual guarantee for reimbursement from the customer. Costs for molds, dies and other tools used to make products sold on long-term supply arrangements for which the Company either has title to the assets or has the non-cancelable right to use the assets during the term of the supply arrangement are capitalized in property, plant and equipment and   amortized to cost of sales over the shorter of the term of the arrangement or over the estimated useful lives of the assets, typically

three

to

five

years.  Costs for molds, dies and other tools used to make products sold on long-term supply arrangements for which the Company has a contractual guarantee for lump sum reimbursement from the customer are capitalized in prepayments and other current assets.

Property, plant and equipment, net

Property, plant and equipment is valued at cost less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and renewals of relatively minor items are generally charged to expense as incurred. Renewals of significant items are capitalized. Depreciation is generally computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Useful lives for buildings range from


to


years and useful lives for machinery and equipment range from

three

to


years. For income tax purposes, accelerated methods of depreciation are generally used.

See the Balance Sheet Information footnote to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on property, plant and equipment, net.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Impairment of long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets

The Company reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets, whether held for use or disposal, including other amortizing intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 360.  In assessing long-lived assets for an impairment loss, assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. In assessing long-lived assets for impairment, management generally considers individual facilities the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent. A recoverability review is performed using the undiscounted cash flows if there is a triggering event.  If the undiscounted cash flow test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment, management will perform a fair value analysis.  Management determines fair value under ASC Topic 820 using the appropriate valuation technique of market, income or cost approach.  If the carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.

Management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable; however, changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect the valuations.  Long-lived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.  Significant judgments and estimates used by management when evaluating long-lived assets for impairment include: (i) an assessment as to whether an adverse event or circumstance has triggered the need for an impairment review; (ii) undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset; and (iii) fair valuation of the asset.

Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets

During the fourth quarter of each year, the Company qualitatively assesses its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets assigned to each of its reporting units. This qualitative assessment evaluates various events and circumstances, such as macro economic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, relevant events and financial trends, that may impact a reporting unit's fair value. Using this qualitative assessment, the Company determines whether it is more-likely-than-not the reporting unit's fair value exceeds its carrying value. If it is determined that it is not more-likely-than-not the reporting unit's fair value exceeds the carrying value, or upon consideration of other factors, including recent acquisition or divestiture activity, the Company performs a quantitative, "step one," goodwill impairment analysis.

In addition, the Company may test goodwill in between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.

See the Goodwill and Other Intangibles footnote to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets.

Product warranties

The Company provides warranties on some, but not all, of its products. The warranty terms are typically from

one

to

three

years. Provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold. These estimates are established using historical information about the nature, frequency and average cost of warranty claim settlements as well as product manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from third parties. Management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims. Management believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate; however, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to the accrual. The product warranty accrual is allocated to current and non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

See the Product Warranty footnote to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on product warranties.

Other loss accruals and valuation allowances

The Company has numerous other loss exposures, such as customer claims, workers' compensation claims, litigation and recoverability of assets. Establishing loss accruals or valuation allowances for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and ultimate realization. The Company estimates losses under the programs using



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

consistent and appropriate methods, however, changes to its assumptions could materially affect the recorded accrued liabilities for loss or asset valuation allowances.

Derivative financial instruments

The Company recognizes that certain normal business transactions generate risk. Examples of risks include exposure to exchange rate risk related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency, changes in commodity costs and interest rates. It is the objective and responsibility of the Company to assess the impact of these transaction risks and offer protection from selected risks through various methods, including financial derivatives. Virtually all derivative instruments held by the Company are designated as hedges, have high correlation with the underlying exposure and are highly effective in offsetting underlying price movements. Accordingly, gains and losses from changes in qualifying hedge fair values are matched with the underlying transactions. All hedge instruments are carried at their fair value based on quoted market prices for contracts with similar maturities. The Company does not engage in any derivative transactions for purposes other than hedging specific risks.

See the Financial Instruments footnote to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on derivative financial instruments.

Foreign currency

The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars using the period-end exchange rate for assets and liabilities and an average exchange rate for each period for revenues, expenses and capital expenditures. The local currency is the functional currency for substantially all of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. Translation adjustments for foreign subsidiaries are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in equity. The Company recognizes transaction gains and losses arising from fluctuations in currency exchange rates on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in earnings as incurred.

See the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss footnote to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on accumulated other comprehensive loss.

Environmental contingencies

The Company accounts for environmental costs in accordance with ASC Topic 450. Costs related to environmental assessments and remediation efforts at operating facilities are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of that liability can be reasonably estimated. Estimated costs are recorded at undiscounted amounts, based on experience and assessments and are regularly evaluated. The liabilities are recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other non-current liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

See the Contingencies footnote to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding environmental contingencies.

Pensions and other postretirement employee defined benefits

The Company's defined benefit pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 715. Disability, early retirement and other postretirement employee benefits are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 712.

Pensions and other postretirement employee benefit costs and related liabilities and assets are dependent upon assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, health care cost trends, compensation and other factors. In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions used are accumulated and amortized over future periods, and accordingly, generally affect recognized expense in future periods.

See the Retirement Benefit Plans footnote to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the Company's pension and other postretirement employee defined benefit plans.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Income taxes

In accordance with ASC Topic 740, the Company's income tax expense is calculated based on expected income and statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates and requires the use of management's estimates and judgments.

See the Income Taxes footnote to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding income taxes.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,

"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes."

Under this guidance, deferred tax liabilities and assets are required to be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position.  Prior to this guidance, the deferred taxes for each jurisdiction (or tax-paying component of a jurisdiction) would be presented as a net current asset or liability and net non-current asset or liability. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with earlier application permitted. The Company adopted this guidance prospectively as of December 31, 2015 and accordingly, prior period amounts have not been revised.

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,

"Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments."

Under this guidance, an acquirer is required to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015.  The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15,

"Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements."

Under this guidance, debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements would be deferred as an asset and amortized ratably over the term, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement.  This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015.  The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,

"Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory."

Under this guidance, inventory should be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using LIFO or the retail inventory method. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-07,

"Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent)."

Under this guidance, investments measured at net asset value, as a practical expedient for fair value, are excluded from the fair value hierarchy. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have an impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, but will impact pension asset disclosures.

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,

"Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,"

which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. Under this guidance such costs would be presented as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company's adoption of this guidance as of December 31, 2015 would result in the reduction of assets and liabilities by approximately

$16 million

.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In May 2014, the FASB amended the Accounting Standards Codification to add Topic 606,

"Revenue from Contracts with Customers,"

outlining a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and superseding most current revenue recognition guidance. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

NOTE 2    RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS

The Company's net Research & Development ("R&D") expenditures are included in selling, general and administrative expenses of the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Customer reimbursements are netted against gross R&D expenditures as they are considered a recovery of cost. Customer reimbursements for prototypes are recorded net of prototype costs based on customer contracts, typically either when the prototype is shipped or when it is accepted by the customer. Customer reimbursements for engineering services are recorded when performance obligations are satisfied in accordance with the contract and accepted by the customer. Financial risks and rewards transfer upon shipment, acceptance of a prototype component by the customer or upon completion of the performance obligation as stated in the respective customer agreement.

The following table presents the Company’s gross and net expenditures on R&D activities:

Net R&D expenditures as a percentage of net sales were

3.8%

,

4.0%

and

4.1%

for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company has contracts with several customers at the Company's various R&D locations. No such contract exceeded

5%

of net R&D expenditures in any of the years presented.

NOTE 3    OTHER EXPENSE, NET

Items included in other expense, net consist of:

During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company recorded restructuring expense of

$65.7 million

,

$90.8 million

and

$39.8 million

, respectively, primarily related to Drivetrain and Engine segment actions designed to improve future profitability and competitiveness. The restructuring expense also includes amounts related to a global realignment plan intended to enhance treasury



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

management flexibility. See the Restructuring footnote to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these expenses.

During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company settled approximately

$48 million

of its projected benefit obligation by transferring approximately

$48 million

in plan assets through a lump-sum pension de-risking disbursement made to an insurance company. This agreement unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees all future payments to certain participants that were receiving payments from the U.S. pension plan. The insurance company assumes all investment risk associated with the assets that were delivered as part of this transaction. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash settlement loss of

$25.7 million

related to the accelerated recognition of unamortized losses

. Additionally, during

the third quarter of 2014, the Company discharged certain U.S. pension plan obligations by making lump-sum payments to former employees of the Company. As a result of this action, the Company recorded a settlement loss of

$3.1 million

in the U.S. pension plan.

During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company acquired

100%

of the equity interests in Remy. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred

$21.8 million

of merger and acquisition expenses primarily related to this transaction. This amount includes

$13.0 million

related to investment banker fees and

$8.8 million

related to other professional fees. See the Recent Transactions footnote to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this acquisition.

During the first quarter of 2015, the Company completed the purchase of the remaining

51%

of BERU Diesel Start Systems Pvt. Ltd. ("BERU Diesel") by acquiring the shares of its former joint venture partner. As a result of this transaction, the Company recorded a

$10.8 million

gain on the previously held equity interest in this joint venture. See the Recent Transactions footnote to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this acquisition.

During the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company recorded intangible asset impairment losses of

$10.3 million

related to Engine segment unamortized trade names. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company recorded intangible asset impairment losses of

$12.5 million

related to Drivetrain segment customer relationships and an Engine segment unamortized trade name.

During the first quarter of 2013, the Company recorded an

$11.3 million

expense related to a program termination agreement, which was paid in 2013.

During the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company waived the forfeiture provision associated with future restricted stock grants made to certain retiring Named Executive Officers ("NEOs"). The Company recorded a

$5.9 million

retirement related obligation primarily related to a first quarter 2013 grant of restricted stock awards to these NEOs.

NOTE 4

INCOME TAXES

Earnings before income taxes and the provision for income taxes are presented in the following table.

The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of

30.3%

,

29.9%

and

25.1%

for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. An analysis of the differences between the effective tax rate and the U.S. statutory rate for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 is presented below.

The Company's provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2015, includes tax benefits of

$9.0 million

,

$3.8 million

and

$3.7 million

related to the pension settlement loss, merger and acquisition expense and restructuring expense, respectively, discussed in the Other Expense, Net footnote. Additionally, this rate includes a tax benefit of

$9.9 million

primarily related to foreign tax incentives and tax settlements.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company's provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2014, includes tax benefits of

$15.3 million

,

$0.4 million

and

$1.1 million

related to restructuring expense, intangible asset impairment losses and the pension settlement loss, respectively, discussed in the Other Expense, Net footnote.

The Company's provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2013, includes tax benefits of

$5.1 million

,

$2.0 million

,

$3.8 million

and

$2.1 million

related to restructuring expense, intangible asset impairment losses, program termination agreement and retirement related obligations discussed in the Other Expense, Net footnote. This rate also includes a net tax benefit of

$11.7 million

, which is comprised of tax benefits of

$6.7 million

related to the extension of the federal research and development credit and other international tax provisions resulting from the retroactive impact of U.S. legislation enacted in January 2013,

$2.2 million

related to 2012 provision to return and other tax adjustments and

$8.0 million

related to the reversal of certain state deferred tax asset valuation allowances, partially offset by a

$5.2 million

tax expense related to comprehensive income and other tax adjustments.

A roll forward of the Company's total gross unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, is presented below. Of the total

$127.3 million

of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2015, approximately

$57.2 million

of the total represents the amount, if recognized, would

affect the Company's effective income tax rate in future periods. This amount differs from the gross unrecognized tax benefits presented in the table due to the decrease in the U.S. federal income taxes which would occur upon recognition of the state tax benefits and U.S. foreign tax credits included therein.

Remy applied for a bilateral Advance Pricing Agreement ("APA") between the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and South Korea National Tax Service covering the tax years 2007 through 2014.  The Company recorded a current tax liability and related U.S. foreign tax credits of approximately

$44.0 million

with respect to this matter.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The amount recognized in income tax expense for 2015 and 2014 is

$2.3 million

and

$1.9 million

, respectively. The Company has an accrual of approximately

$12.8 million

and

$10.3 million

for the payment of interest and penalties at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. It is expected that the bilateral APA referenced above may be settled in early 2016. Other possible changes within the next 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company and/or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal, various state jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions. In certain tax jurisdictions, the Company may have more than one taxpayer. The Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities in its major tax jurisdictions as follows:

The gross components of deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 consist of the following:

At December 31, 2015, certain non-U.S. subsidiaries have net operating loss carryforwards totaling

$165.4 million

available to offset future taxable income. Of the total

$165.4 million

,

$130.6 million

expire at various dates from 2016 through 2035 and the remaining

$34.8 million

have no expiration date. The Company has a valuation allowance of

$25.5 million

recorded on

$95.8 million

of non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards. Certain U.S. subsidiaries have state net operating loss carryforwards totaling

$833.2 million

which are partially offset by a valuation allowance of

$591.6 million

. The state net operating loss carryforwards expire at various dates from 2016 to 2035.  Certain non-U.S. subsidiaries located in China, Korea and Poland had tax exemptions or tax holidays, which reduced tax expense approximately

$21.2 million

and

$23.6 million

in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The U.S. has foreign tax credit carryforwards of

$142.6 million

, which expire at various dates from 2018 through 2024.

The Company is not required to provide U.S. federal or state income taxes on cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries when such earnings are considered permanently reinvested. The Company's policy is to evaluate this assertion on a quarterly basis. At December 31, 2015, the Company's deferred tax liability associated with unremitted foreign earnings was

$32.5 million

.

In connection with the acquisition of Remy, management executed a legal restructuring plan to align the Remy and BorgWarner non-US businesses.  This transaction resulted in a taxable gain in the U.S., which will be partially offset by Remy tax attributes including a net operating loss carryforward of

$63.4 million

and foreign tax credits of

$108.1 million

.  The net impact of this transaction resulted in a foreign tax credit carryforward of

$26.0 million

.  The net U.S. cash tax liability resulting from the transaction is estimated to be

$8.6 million

.

The Company has not recorded deferred income taxes on the difference between the book and tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries or foreign equity affiliates totaling approximately

$3.3 billion

in 2015, as these amounts are essentially permanent in nature. The difference will become taxable upon repatriation of assets, sale or liquidation of the investment. Due to fluctuation in tax laws around the world and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, it is not practicable to determine the unrecognized deferred tax liability on this difference because the actual tax liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing when the repatriation occurs.

NOTE 6

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES

During the fourth quarter of each year, the Company qualitatively assesses its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets assigned to each of its reporting units. This qualitative assessment evaluates various events and circumstances, such as macro economic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, relevant events and financial trends, that may impact a reporting unit's fair value. Using this qualitative assessment, the Company determines whether it is more-likely-than-not the reporting unit's fair value exceeds its carrying value. If it is determined that it is not more-likely-than-not the reporting unit's fair value exceeds the carrying value, or upon consideration of other factors, including recent acquisition or divestiture activity, the Company performs a quantitative, "step one," goodwill impairment analysis.

In addition, the Company may test goodwill in between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.

During the fourth quarter of 2015 and prior to the Remy acquisition, the Company performed a qualitative analysis on each reporting unit, except for reporting units with recent restructuring and acquisition activities, and determined it was more-likely-than-not the fair value exceeded the carrying value of these reporting units. For the reporting units with recent restructuring and acquisition activities, the Company performed a quantitative, "step one," goodwill impairment analysis, which requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates. The basis of these goodwill impairment analyses is the Company's annual budget and long-range plan (“LRP”). The annual budget and LRP includes a five year projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments and assumes the last year of the LRP data is a fair indication of the future performance. Because the LRP is estimated over a significant future period of time, those estimates and assumptions are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. Further, the market valuation models



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

and other financial ratios used by the Company require certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to the Company's facts and circumstances.

The Company believes the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values are reasonable.  Different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value.  The primary assumptions affecting the Company's December 31, 2015 goodwill quantitative, "step one," impairment reviews are as follows:

•

Discount rate:

The Company used a

10%

weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) as the discount rate for future cash flows. The WACC is intended to represent a rate of return that would be expected by a market participant.

•

Operating income margin:

The Company used historical and expected operating income margins, which may vary based on the projections of the reporting unit being evaluated.

I

n addition to the above primary assumptions, the Company notes the following risks to volume and operating income assumptions that could have an impact on the discounted cash flow models:

•

The automotive industry is cyclical and the Company's results of operations would be adversely affected by industry downturns.

•

The Company is dependent on market segments that use our key products and would be affected by decreasing demand in those segments.

•

The Company is subject to risks related to international operations.

Based on the assumptions outlined above, the impairment testing conducted in the fourth quarter of 2015 indicated the Company's goodwill assigned to these reporting units that were quantitatively assessed was not impaired and contained fair values substantially higher than the reporting units' carrying values. Additionally, sensitivity analyses were completed indicating a

one

percent increase in the discount rate or a

one

percent decrease in the operating margin assumptions would not result in the carrying values exceeding the fair values of the reporting units quantitatively assessed.

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:

Acquisitions relate to the Company's 2015 purchases of Remy and BERU Diesel and the 2014 purchase of Gustav Wahler GmbH u. Co. KG and its general partner.

Annual principal payments required as of December 31, 2015 are as follows :

The Company's long-term debt includes various covenants, none of which are expected to restrict future operations.

On November 6, 2015, BorgWarner Inc. issued

€500 million

in 1.80% senior notes due November 2022. Interest is payable annually in arrears on November 7 of each year, beginning on November 7, 2016.

These senior notes are not guaranteed by any of BorgWarner Inc.'s subsidiaries.

These notes were designated as a net investment hedge of the Company's investment in a European subsidiary when issued.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

On March 16, 2015, BorgWarner Inc. issued

$500 million

in 3.375% senior notes due March 2025 and

$500 million

in 4.375% senior notes due March 2045. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year.

These senior notes are not guaranteed by any of BorgWarner Inc.'s subsidiaries.

The Company has a

$1 billion

multi-currency revolving credit facility which includes a feature that allows the Company's borrowings to be increased to

$1.25 billion

.

The facility provides for borrowings through June 30, 2019. The Company has one key financial covenant as part of the credit agreement which is a debt to EBITDA ("Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization") ratio.

The Company was in compliance with the financial covenant at December 31, 2015 and expects to remain compliant in future periods. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under this facility.

The Company's commercial paper program allows the Company to issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of

$1 billion

.

Under this program, the Company may issue notes from time to time and will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.

At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had outstanding borrowings of

$215.0 million

and

$460.9 million

, respectively,

under this program, which is classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Notes payable and other short-term debt.

The total current combined borrowing capacity under the multi-currency revolving credit facility and commercial paper program cannot exceed

$1 billion

.

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the estimated fair values of the Company's senior unsecured notes totaled

$2,197.6 million

and

$750.3 million

, respectively. The estimated fair values were

$7.2 million

and

$98.7 million

higher than their carrying value at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Fair market values of the senior unsecured notes are developed using observable values for similar debt instruments, which are considered Level 2 inputs as defined by ASC Topic 820. The carrying values of the Company's multi-currency revolving credit facility and commercial paper program approximates fair value. The fair value estimates do not necessarily reflect the values the Company could realize in the current markets.

The Company had outstanding letters of credit of

$29.3 million

and

$28.3 million

at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The letters of credit typically act as guarantees of payment to certain third parties in accordance with specified terms and conditions.

NOTE 9   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

ASC Topic 820 emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity specific measurement. Therefore, a fair value measurement should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, ASC Topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair values as follows:

Level 1:

Observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;

Level 2:

Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and

Level 3:

Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are based on one or more of the following three valuation techniques noted in ASC Topic 820:

A.

Market approach:

Prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets, liabilities or a group of assets or liabilities, such as a business.

B.

Cost approach:

Amount that would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost).

C.

Income approach:

Techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount based upon market expectations (including present value techniques, option-pricing and excess earnings models).

The following tables classify assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015 and 2014:

NOTE 10

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company’s financial instruments include cash and marketable securities. Due to the short-term nature of these instruments, their book value approximates their fair value. The Company’s financial instruments may include long-term debt, interest rate and cross-currency swaps, commodity derivative contracts and foreign currency derivatives. All derivative contracts are placed with counterparties that have an S&P, or equivalent, investment grade credit rating at the time of the contracts’ placement. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had no derivative contracts that contained credit risk related contingent features.

As a result of the Remy acquisition, the Company acquired foreign exchange forward contracts with market values reflecting a cumulative loss of

$7.5 million

and commodity derivative contracts with market



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

values reflecting a cumulative loss of

$9.2 million

. These contracts were assumed by the Company at fair market value and designated as hedges of future cash flows.

The Company uses certain commodity derivative contracts to protect against commodity price changes related to forecasted raw material and supplies purchases. The Company primarily utilizes forward and option contracts, which are designated as cash flow hedges. At December 31, 2015, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding:

The Company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to optimize its interest costs. The Company selectively uses interest rate swaps to reduce market value risk associated with changes in interest rates (fair value hedges). At December 31, 2015, the following interest rate swaps were outstanding:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to protect against exchange rate movements for forecasted cash flows, including capital expenditures, purchases, operating expenses or sales transactions designated in currencies other than the functional currency of the operating unit.  In addition, the Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge exposure associated with our net investment in certain foreign operations (net investment hedges). The Company has also designated its  Euro denominated debt as a net investment hedge of the Company's investment in a European subsidiary. Foreign currency derivative contracts require the Company, at a future date, to either buy or sell foreign currency in exchange for the operating units’ local currency.  At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the following foreign currency derivative contracts were outstanding:

At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the following amounts were recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as being payable to or receivable from counterparties under ASC Topic 815:

Effectiveness for cash flow and net investment hedges is assessed at the inception of the hedging relationship and quarterly, thereafter. To the extent that derivative instruments are deemed to be effective, gains and losses arising from these contracts are deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI") and reclassified into income as the underlying operating transactions are recognized. These realized gains or losses offset the hedged transaction and are recorded on the same line in the statement of operations. To the extent that derivative instruments are deemed to be ineffective, gains or losses are recognized into income.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The table below shows deferred gains (losses) reported in AOCI as well as the amount expected to be reclassified to income in one year or less. The amount expected to be reclassified to income in one year or less assumes no change in the current relationship of the hedged item at December  31, 2015 market rates.

Derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments as defined by ASC Topic 815 held during the period resulted in the following gains and losses recorded in income:

At December 31, 2015, derivative instruments that were not designated as hedging instruments as defined by ASC Topic 815 were immaterial.

NOTE 11

RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

The Company sponsors various defined contribution savings plans, primarily in the U.S., that allow employees to contribute a portion of their pre-tax and/or after-tax income in accordance with plan specified guidelines. Under specified conditions, the Company will make contributions to the plans and/or match a percentage of the employee contributions up to certain limits. Total expense related to the defined contribution plans was

$28.0 million

,

$27.6 million

and

$24.9 million

in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

The Company has a number of defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement employee benefit plans covering eligible salaried and hourly employees and their dependents. The defined pension benefits provided are primarily based on (i) years of service and (ii) average compensation or a monthly retirement benefit amount. The Company provides defined benefit pension plans in France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan,  Mexico, Monaco, South Korea, Sweden, U.K. and the U.S. The other postretirement employee benefit plans, which provide medical benefits, are unfunded plans. All pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans in the U.S. have been closed to new employees. The measurement date for all plans is December 31.

During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company settled approximately

$48 million

of its projected benefit obligation by transferring approximately

$48 million

in plan assets through a lump-sum pension de-risking disbursement made to an insurance company. This agreement unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees all future payments to certain participants that were receiving payments from the U.S. pension plan. The insurance company assumes all investment risk associated with the assets that were delivered as part of this transaction. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash settlement loss of

$25.7 million

related to the accelerated recognition of unamortized losses

.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

During

the third quarter of 2014, the Company discharged certain U.S. pension plan obligations by making lump-sum payments to former employees of the Company. As a result of this action, the Company recorded a settlement loss of

$3.1 million

The funded status of pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets at December 31 is as follows:

The weighted average asset allocations of the Company’s funded pension plans and target allocations by asset category are as follows:

The Company's investment strategy is to maintain actual asset weightings within a preset range of target allocations. The Company believes these ranges represent an appropriate risk profile for the planned benefit payments of the plans based on the timing of the estimated benefit payments. In each asset category, separate portfolios are maintained for additional diversification. Investment managers are retained in each asset category to manage each portfolio against its benchmark. Each investment manager has appropriate investment guidelines. In addition, the entire portfolio is evaluated against a relevant peer group. The defined benefit pension plans did not hold any Company securities as investments as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. A portion of pension assets is invested in common and comingled trusts.

In December 2014 and 2013, the Company made discretionary contributions of

$30.2 million

and

$137.5 million

, respectively to its German pension plans.

The Company expects to contribute a total of

$15 million

to

$25 million

into its defined benefit pension plans during 2016. Of the

$15 million

to

$25 million

in projected 2016 contributions,

$8.5 million

are contractually obligated, while any remaining payments would be discretionary.

Refer to the Fair Value Measurements footnote to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail surrounding the fair value of each major category of plan assets as well as the inputs and valuation techniques used to develop the fair value measurements of the plans' assets at December 31, 2015 and 2014.

, respectively.

The Company's weighted-average assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations for its defined benefit pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company’s weighted-average assumptions used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for its defined benefit pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:

The Company's approach to establishing the discount rate is based upon the market yields of high-quality corporate bonds, with appropriate consideration of each plan's defined benefit payment terms and duration of the liabilities.

The Company determines its expected return on plan asset assumptions by evaluating estimates of future market returns and the plans' asset allocation. The Company also considers the impact of active management of the plans' invested assets.

The estimated future benefit payments for the pension and other postretirement employee benefits are as follows:

The weighted-average rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits is projected to be

7.14%

in 2016 for pre-65 and post-65 participants, decreasing to

5.0%

by the year 2022. A one-percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend would have the following effects:

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

Under the Company's 2004 Stock Incentive Plan ("2004 Plan"), the Company granted options to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at the fair market value on the date of grant. The options vested over periods up to three years and have a term of 10 years from date of grant. At its November 2007 meeting, the Company's Compensation Committee decided that restricted common stock awards and stock units ("restricted stock") would be awarded in place of stock options for long-term incentive award grants to employees. Restricted stock granted to employees generally vests 50% after two years and the remainder after three years from the date of grant. Restricted stock granted to non-employee directors generally vests on the first anniversary date of the grant. In February 2014, the Company's Board of Directors replaced the expired 2004 Plan by adopting the BorgWarner Inc. 2014 Stock Incentive Plan ("2014 Plan"). On April 30, 2014, the Company's stockholders approved the 2014 Plan. Under the 2014 Plan, approximately

8 million

shares are authorized for grant, of which approximately

7.0 million

shares are available for future issuance as of December 31, 2015.

CONTINGENCIES

In the normal course of business, the Company is party to various commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints, including matters involving warranty claims, intellectual property claims, general liability and various other risks. It is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the Company will ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal matters or, if not, what the impact might be. The Company's environmental and product liability contingencies are discussed separately below. The Company's management does not expect that an adverse outcome in any of these commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows, although it could be material to the results of operations in a particular quarter.

Litigation

In January 2006, BorgWarner Diversified Transmission Products Inc. ("DTP"), a subsidiary of the Company, filed a declaratory judgment action in United States District Court, Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis Division) against the United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implements Workers of America (“UAW”) Local No. 287 and Gerald Poor, individually and as the representative of a defendant class. DTP sought the Court's affirmation that DTP did not violate the Labor-Management Relations Act or the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) by unilaterally amending certain medical plans effective April 1, 2006 and October 1, 2006, prior to the expiration of the then-current collective bargaining agreements. On September 10, 2008, the Court found that DTP's reservation of the right to make such amendments reducing the level of benefits provided to retirees was limited by its collectively bargained

health insurance agreement with the UAW, which did not expire until April 24, 2009. Thus, the amendments were untimely. In 2008, the Company recorded a charge of

$4.0 million

as a result of the Court's decision.

DTP filed a declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court, Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis Division) against the UAW Local No. 287 and Jim Barrett and others, individually and as representatives of a defendant class, on February 26, 2009 again seeking the Court's affirmation that DTP did not violate the Labor - Management Relations Act or ERISA by modifying the level of benefits provided retirees to make them comparable to other Company retiree benefit plans after April 24, 2009. Certain retirees, on behalf of themselves and others, filed a mirror-image action in the United States District Court, Eastern District of Michigan (Southern Division) on March 11, 2009, for which a class has been certified. During the last quarter of 2009, the action pending in Indiana was dismissed, while the action in Michigan is continuing. The Company is vigorously defending against the suit.  This contingency is subject to many uncertainties, therefore based on the information available to date, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the amount or the range of potential loss, if any.

Environmental

The Company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“Superfund”) and equivalent state laws and, as such, may presently be liable for the cost of clean-up and other remedial activities at


such sites. Responsibility for clean-up and other remedial activities at a Superfund site is typically shared among PRPs based on an allocation formula.

The Company believes that none of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Generally, this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not material or the liability will be shared with other PRPs, although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter.

Based on information available to the Company (which in most cases includes: an estimate of allocation of liability among PRPs; the probability that other PRPs, many of whom are large, solvent public companies, will fully pay the cost apportioned to them; currently available information from PRPs and/or federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs; and remediation alternatives), the Company has an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities of

$5.4 million

and

$6.2 million

at December 31, 2015 and at December 31, 2014, respectively. The Company expects to pay out substantially all of the amounts accrued for environmental liability over the next five years.

In connection with the sale of Kuhlman Electric Corporation (“Kuhlman Electric”), the Company agreed to indemnify the buyer and Kuhlman Electric for certain environmental liabilities, then unknown to the Company, relating to certain operations of Kuhlman Electric that pre-date the Company's 1999 acquisition of Kuhlman Electric. The Company previously settled or obtained dismissals of various lawsuits that were filed against Kuhlman Electric and others, including the Company, on behalf of plaintiffs alleging personal injury relating to alleged environmental contamination at its Crystal Springs, Mississippi plant. The Company filed a lawsuit against Kuhlman Electric and a related entity challenging the validity of the indemnity and the defendants filed counterclaims (the “Indemnity Action”) and a related lawsuit. On September 28, 2015, the parties entered into a confidential settlement agreement that, among other things, released and terminated all of BorgWarner’s indemnity obligations. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the parties voluntarily dismissed the Indemnity Action on September 29, 2015 and the related lawsuit was dismissed on October 13, 2015. The Company continues to pursue insurance coverage actions for reimbursement of amounts it spent under the indemnity. The Company may in the future become subject to further legal proceedings.

Product Liability

Like many other industrial companies who have historically operated in the U.S., the Company (or parties the Company is obligated to indemnify) continues to be named as one of many defendants in asbestos-related personal injury actions. We believe that the Company's involvement is limited because, in general, these claims relate to a few types of automotive products that were manufactured many years ago and contained encapsulated asbestos. The nature of the fibers, the encapsulation and the manner of use lead the Company to believe that these products are highly unlikely to cause harm. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Company had approximately

10,100

and

13,300

pending asbestos-related product liability claims, respectively.

The decrease in the pending claims is primarily a result of the Company's continued efforts to obtain dismissal of dormant claims.

The Company's policy is to vigorously defend against these lawsuits and the Company has been successful in obtaining dismissal of many claims without any payment.  The nature of the historical product being encapsulated and the lifecycle of the product allow the Company to aggressively defend against these lawsuits. The Company expects that the vast majority of the pending asbestos-related product liability claims where it is a defendant (or has an obligation to indemnify a defendant) will result in no payment being made by the Company or its insurers. In the full year of 2015, of the approximately

5,300

claims resolved,


(

7%

)

resulted in payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the Company. In the full year of 2014, of the approximately

6,500

claims resolved,


(

6%

)

resulted in payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the Company.

Prior to June 2004, the settlement and defense costs associated with all claims were paid by the Company's primary layer insurance carriers under a series of interim funding arrangements. In addition to the primary insurance available for asbestos-related claims, the Company has excess insurance coverage available for potential future asbestos-related product claims. In June 2004, primary layer insurance carriers notified the Company of the alleged exhaustion of their policy limits.

A declaratory judgment action was filed in January 2004 in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois by Continental Casualty Company and related companies against the Company and certain of its historical general liability insurers. The court has issued a number of interim rulings and discovery is continuing. The Company has entered into settlement agreements with some of its insurance carriers, resolving their coverage disputes by agreeing to pay specified amounts to the Company. This includes a settlement with a carrier that occurred in the third quarter of 2015. The Company is vigorously pursuing the litigation against the remaining insurers.

In August 2013, the Los Angeles Superior Court entered a jury verdict against the Company in an asbestos-related personal injury action with damages of

$35.0 million

, of which

$32.5 million

were punitive and would not be recoverable through insurance. In July 2015, the Court of Appeal for the State of California issued a decision striking the

$32.5 million

in punitive damages. The plaintiffs sought to reinstate the punitive damages by petitioning for review from the California Supreme Court. In October 2015, the California Supreme Court denied plaintiffs' petition for review. In December 2015, the Company satisfied the amended judgment in full, with respect to compensatory damages only, and received the acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment from the Los Angeles Superior Court. This decision did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

To date, the Company has paid and accrued

$391.7 million

in defense and indemnity costs in advance of insurers' reimbursement and has received

$228.4 million

in cash and notes from insurers. The net balance of

$163.3 million

is expected to be fully recovered. Timing of recovery is dependent on final resolution of the declaratory judgment action referred to above or additional negotiated settlements. At December 31, 2014, insurers owed

$141.9 million

in association with these claims.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In addition to the

$163.3 million

net balance relating to past settlements and defense costs, the Company has estimated a liability of

$108.5 million

for claims asserted, but not yet resolved and their related defense costs at December 31, 2015. The Company also has a related asset of

$108.5 million

to recognize proceeds from the insurance carriers, which is expected to be fully recovered. Receipt of these proceeds is not expected prior to the resolution of the declaratory judgment action referred to above, which is expected to occur subsequent to

December 31, 2016

.

At December 31, 2014, the comparable value of the accrued liability and associated insurance asset was

$111.8 million

.

The amounts recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the estimated future settlement of existing claims are as follows:

The Company believes that its ultimate liability (i.e., the total of its indemnity or other claim dispositions plus legal related fees) cannot be reasonably estimated at this time in excess of amounts accrued.  The Company's ability to reasonably estimate its liability has been significantly affected by, among other factors, the volatility of asbestos-related litigation in the United States, the significant number of co-defendants that have filed for bankruptcy, the magnitude and timing of co-defendant bankruptcy trust payments, the inherent uncertainty of future disease incidence and claiming patterns against the Company, and the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the state or federal levels.  The Company’s ability to reasonably estimate its liability for asbestos-related claims may also be affected in the future by the new discovery of facts; changes in litigation; the impact of any possible tort reform; changes in assumptions regarding the number and nature of asbestos-related claims, including the total population claiming exposure; the amounts of any judgments over time; and changes in settlement/defense strategies. The Company reviews factors relevant to asbestos-related claims that have been, or may in the future, be asserted against it on an ongoing basis.

NOTE 15   RESTRUCTURING

In the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company initiated actions primarily in the Drivetrain segment designed to improve future profitability and competitiveness. As a continuation of these actions the Company finalized severance agreements with

three

labor unions at separate facilities in Western Europe for approximately


employees. The Company recorded restructuring expense related to these facilities of

$28.0 million

,

$61.8 million

and

$32.9 million

in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Included in this restructuring expense are employee termination benefits of

$20.1 million

,

$50.6 million

and

$7.5 million

, respectively, and other expense of

$7.9 million

,

$11.2 million

and

$0.6 million

, respectively.  Additionally, the restructuring expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 includes

$24.8 million

of asset impairment charges primarily related to the write-down of machinery and equipment associated with the announced closure of certain European facilities within the Company Drivetrain segment.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In the second quarter of 2014, the Company initiated actions to improve the future profitability and competitiveness of Gustav Wahler GmbH u. Co. KG and its general partner ("Wahler").  The Company recorded restructuring expense related to Wahler of

$11.6 million

and

$6.5 million

in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These restructuring expenses are primarily related to employee termination benefits. These termination benefits relate to approximately


employees in Germany and Brazil in 2015 and


employees in Germany, Brazil, China and the U.S. in 2014.

The Company recorded restructuring expense of

$12.5 million

,

$12.0 million

and

$4.0 million

in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, related to a global realignment plan intended to enhance treasury management flexibility by creating a legal entity structure that better aligns with the Company's business strategy.

On July 1, 2015, the Company completed a structural optimization process involving BorgWarner Morse TEC LLC f/k/a BorgWarner Morse TEC Inc. (“Morse TEC”), a Delaware limited liability company wholly owned by BorgWarner Inc.  As part of that process, (i) Morse TEC's Mexican subsidiary redeemed the variable capital stock held by Morse TEC for cash, which was thereafter distributed by Morse TEC to BorgWarner Inc., and Morse TEC sold the fixed capital stock of that Mexican subsidiary held by Morse TEC to a wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary of BorgWarner Inc. for cash; (ii) Morse TEC sold the stock of its Indian subsidiary to a wholly-owned Luxembourg subsidiary of BorgWarner Inc. in exchange for the cancellation of debt owed by Morse TEC to that Luxembourg subsidiary; (iii) Morse TEC sold certain of its operating assets to BorgWarner Ithaca LLC, a Delaware limited liability company wholly-owned by BorgWarner Inc., in exchange for cash and certain intercompany notes, one of which was subsequently distributed to BorgWarner Inc.; (iv) Morse TEC distributed the stock of the U.S. holding company for its Japanese and Korean subsidiaries to BorgWarner Inc.; and (v) Morse TEC retained the stock of its Canadian subsidiary, certain additional assets, and insurance and related accounts receivable and other assets.

In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company acquired

100%

of the equity interests in Remy.  As a result of actions following this transaction, the Company recorded employee termination benefits of

$10.1 million

in the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily related to contractually required severance associated with Remy executive officers. Cash payments for these restructuring activities are expected to be complete by the end of 2016.

Estimates of restructuring expense are based on information available at the time such charges are recorded. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in estimating restructuring expenses, actual amounts paid for such activities may differ from amounts initially recorded. Accordingly, the Company may record revisions of previous estimates by adjusting previously established accruals.

LEASES AND COMMITMENTS

Certain assets are leased under long-term operating leases, including rent for facilities and one airplane. Most leases contain renewal options for various periods. Leases generally require the Company to pay for insurance, taxes and maintenance of the leased property. The Company leases other equipment such as vehicles and certain office equipment under short-term leases. Total rent expense was

$31.9 million

,

$33.9 million

and

$32.1 million

EARNINGS PER SHARE

The Company presents both basic and diluted earnings per share of common stock (“EPS”) amounts.  Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net earnings attributable to BorgWarner Inc. by the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing net earnings attributable to BorgWarner Inc. by the weighted average shares of common stock and common equivalent stock outstanding during the reporting period.

The dilutive impact of stock-based compensation is calculated using the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method assumes that the Company uses the assumed proceeds from the exercise of awards to repurchase common stock at the average market price during the period. The assumed proceeds under



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the treasury stock method include the purchase price that the grantee will pay in the future, compensation cost for future service that the Company has not yet recognized and any windfall/(shortfall) tax benefits that would be credited/(debited) to capital in excess of par value when the award generates a tax deduction. Options are only dilutive when the average market price of the underlying common stock exceeds the exercise price of the options.

The following table reconciles the numerators and denominators used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share of common stock:

RECENT TRANSACTIONS

Remy International, Inc.

On November 10, 2015, the Company acquired

100%

of the equity interests in Remy for

$29.50

per share in cash. The Company also settled approximately

$361 million

of outstanding debt. Remy was a global market leading producer of rotating electrical components that had key technologies and operations in


countries. The cash paid, net of cash acquired, was

$1,187.0 million

.

The Remy acquisition is expected to strengthen the Company's position in the rapidly developing powertrain electrification trend, with a complementary combination of technologies and global operations.

The operating results and assets are reported within the Company's Drivetrain reporting segment as of the date of the acquisition. Remy's results from the date of acquisition through December 31, 2015 were insignificant to the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Company paid

$1,187.0 million

, which is recorded as an investing activity in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Additionally, the Company assumed retirement-related liabilities of

years. Various valuation techniques were used to determine the fair value of the intangible assets, with the primary techniques being forms of the income approach, specifically, the relief-from-royalty and excess earnings valuation methods, which use significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy. Under these valuation approaches, the Company is required to make estimates and assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates based on budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. Due to the nature of the transaction, goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.

The Company is in the process of finalizing all purchase accounting adjustments related to the Remy acquisition. Certain estimated values for the acquisition, including goodwill, intangible assets and deferred taxes are not yet finalized, and the preliminary purchase price allocations are subject to change as the Company completes its analysis of the fair value at the date of acquisition.

Supplemental Pro Forma Data (Unaudited)

The following supplemental pro forma information for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 is based on the assumption that the acquisition of Remy occurred on January 1, 2014.

REPORTING SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION

The Company's business is comprised of two reporting segments: Engine and Drivetrain. These segments are strategic business groups, which are managed separately as each represents a specific grouping of related automotive components and systems.

The Company allocates resources to each segment based upon the projected after-tax return on invested capital ("ROIC") of its business initiatives. ROIC is comprised of Adjusted EBIT after deducting notional taxes compared to the projected average capital investment required. Adjusted EBIT is comprised of earnings before interest, income taxes and noncontrolling interest (“EBIT") adjusted for restructuring, goodwill impairment charges, affiliates' earnings and other items not reflective of on-going operating income or loss.

Adjusted EBIT is the measure of segment income or loss used by the Company. The Company believes Adjusted EBIT is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our reporting segments. The following tables show segment information and Adjusted EBIT for the Company's reporting segments.

Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Management conducted an assessment of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). As permitted by Securities and Exchange Commission guidance, management excluded from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting Remy International, Inc. which was acquired on November 10, 2015 which accounted for approximately 8% of consolidated total assets and 2% of consolidated net sales as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015. Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2015, the Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Company's consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 as stated in its report included herein.

Changes in Internal Control

There have been no changes in internal controls over the financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting.
