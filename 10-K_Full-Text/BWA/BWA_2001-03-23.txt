INDEX

PART I

Item 1. Business

BorgWarner Inc. (the "Company"), a Delaware corporation, was
incorporated in 1987. The Company is a leading, global Tier I supplier of highly
engineered systems and components, primarily for vehicle powertrain
applications. These products are manufactured and sold worldwide, primarily to
original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") of passenger cars, sport utility
vehicles, trucks, commercial transportation products and industrial equipment.
The Company operates 56 manufacturing and technical facilities in 13 countries
serving customers in North America, South America, Europe and Asia, and is an
original equipment supplier to every major automotive OEM in the world.

Financial Information About Segments

Incorporated herein by reference is
Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 44
through 46 of the Company's Annual Report for the year ended December 31,
2000 (the "Company's Annual Report") filed as an exhibit to this report.

Narrative Description of Operating Segments

The Company's products fall into
five reportable operating segments: Air/Fluid Systems, Cooling Systems, Morse
TEC, TorqTransfer Systems and Transmission Systems. Net revenues by
segment for the three years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, are as
follows (in millions of dollars):

The sales information presented
above excludes the sales by the Company's unconsolidated joint ventures. See
"Joint Ventures." Such sales totaled approximately $348 million in 2000,
$287 million in 1999 and $247 million in 1998. Divested operations and businesses
held for sale includes Kysor-Westran which was sold in 2000, the forged powdered metal
race business sold in 1999, the torque converter and connecting rod businesses sold in
1998 and the fuel systems' business which is currently held for sale.

Air/Fluid Systems

Air/Fluid Systems designs and
manufactures sophisticated electro-mechanical, mechanical and electronic
components and systems used for automated transmissions, fluid pumps, engine air intake modules, engine emission
controls and actuation systems. Key products for transmission controls include
single function solenoids, complex solenoids and multi-function modules. We also manufacture a wide
variety of fluid pumps, including engine hydraulic pumps for variable cam timing and engine lubrication.
Key products for engine air intake management include throttle bodies, intake manifolds, throttle position
sensors and complete engine induction systems.  We also manufacture products to control
emissions and improve gas mileage such as electric air pumps, air control valves and
exhaust gas recirculation valves.

Cooling Systems

Cooling Systems, the Company's
newest segment, is a combination of the businesses acquired from Eaton
Corporation and the Schwitzer cooling businesses acquired as part of the Kuhlman
Corporation acquisition in 1999. Cooling Systems manufactures viscous and electronically
activated fan clutches, on-off fan drives and fans which are used as part of the engine
cooling system. Product features include improved fuel economy and emissions
control by minimizing parasitic power loss. These products are provided from
facilities in the U.S., Germany, U.K., Brazil, Korea and China. The Company
believes it is a leading global supplier of such products but competes with
other large independent producers as well as divisions of its OEM customers. This business
serves the light, medium and heavy duty truck markets.

Morse TEC

Morse TEC manufactures chain and
chain systems, including HY-VO® front-wheel drive ("FWD") transmission chain and
four-wheel drive ("4WD") chain, MORSE GEMINI® Chain Systems, timing chain and
timing chain systems, crankshaft and camshaft sprockets, chain tensioners and
snubbers and turbochargers for passenger car and commercial vehicle
applications. These products are provided from facilities in North America, Europe and Japan.

HY-VO® chain is used in
transmissions and for 4WD transfer case applications. Transmission chain is used
to transfer power from the engine to the transmission. The Company's MORSE
GEMINI® Chain System emits significantly less chain pitch frequency noise than
conventional transmission chain systems. The chain in a transfer case
distributes power between the front and rear output shafts which, in turn, drive
the front and rear wheels. The Company believes it is the world's leading
manufacturer of chain for FWD transmissions and 4WD transfer cases. The Company
is an original equipment supplier to every major manufacturer that uses chain
for such applications.

The Company's timing chain system
is used on Ford's new family of overhead cam engines, including the Duratech and
Triton engines, as well as Chrysler's 2.7 liter, 3.7 liter and 4.7 liter
overhead cam engines. The Company has been selected to provide timing systems
for a number of Japanese and European applications. The
Company believes that it is the world's leading manufacturer of timing chain systems.

This segment also provides
turbochargers for passenger car, commercial vehicle and industrial applications
for diesel and gasoline engine manufacturers in Europe, North America, South
America and Asia. A turbocharger is a device designed to force additional intake air into the engine to create a
cleaner and more powerful ignition. Benefits of turbocharging in both passenger
car and commercial vehicle applications include greater power for a given engine
size, improved fuel economy and significantly reduced emissions. The Company
believes it is a leading manufacturer of turbochargers worldwide.

TorqTransfer Systems

TorqTransfer Systems' products
include 4WD and all-wheel drive transfer cases and torque management systems to
transfer torque within the drivetrain for rear wheel drive and FWD based vehicles.
The main focus is on electronically controlled torque management devices and
systems.

Transfer cases are installed
primarily on light trucks and sport-utility vehicles. A transfer case attaches
to the transmission and distributes torque to the front and rear axles for 4WD,
improving vehicle control during off-road use and in a variety of road conditions.
The Company has designed and developed an exclusive 4WD
TORQUE-ON-DEMAND® ("TOD") transfer case system, which allows vehicles to
automatically shift from two-wheel drive to 4WD when electronic sensors indicate
it is necessary. The TOD® transfer case is available on the Ford Explorer, the
best selling sport-utility vehicle in the United States in 2000, 1999 and 1998,
and the Ford Expedition, Lincoln Navigator, Isuzu Trooper and SsangYong Musso
from Daewoo.


Sales of 4WD transfer cases
represented 19%, 22% and 27% of the Company's total revenues for 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively. The Company believes it is the world's leading
independent manufacturer of 4WD transfer cases, producing approximately
1.1 million transfer cases in 2000. The Company's largest customer of 4WD
transfer cases is Ford Motor Company. The Company supplies the majority of the
4WD transfer cases for Ford, including those installed in the Ford Explorer, the
Ford Expedition, the Ford F-150 and Ranger pick-up trucks, the Mercury
Mountaineer and the Lincoln Navigator.

Our newest four-wheel drive product
is the INTERACTIVE TORQUE MANAGEMENT™ system, which is featured on the new Acura MDX
crossover vehicle under a five year supply agreement.  This product uses electronically controlled
clutches to distribute power to the individual rear wheels when traction is required.  The Company is
actively involved in developing this technology for new applications in both front wheel drive based
crossover vehicles and passenger cars.

Transmission Systems

The Company engineers and
manufactures components for automatic transmissions and the systems that combine
such components around the world. Principal product lines include friction
plates, one-way clutches, transmission bands and torque converter lock-up
clutches for automatic transmissions. The Company is a supplier to virtually
every major automatic transmission manufacturer in the world. The Company's
50%-owned joint venture in Japan, NSK-Warner Kabushiki Kaisha ("NSK Warner"), is
a leading producer of friction plates and one-way clutches in Japan.

Joint Ventures

The Company currently has five joint ventures
in which it has a less-than-100% ownership interest. Results from three of these
ventures, in which the Company is the majority owner, are consolidated as part
of the Company's results. The Company's ownership interest in NSK-Warner is
50%. This is reported using the equity method of accounting. The Company also has an 80%
ownership interest in BorgWarner TorqTransfer Systems (Beijing) Co., Ltd.,
a newly formed joint venture which will manufacture transfer cases in China.
Results from this venture will be consolidated.

Management of the unconsolidated
joint ventures is shared with the Company's respective joint venture partners.
Certain information concerning the Company's joint ventures is set forth below:

(a)

In October 2000, the Company sold its 49.9% ownership interest
in Beijing Warner Gear Co. Ltd.("BWGL"), to its joint venture partner, Beijing Gear
Works. Results for BWGL represent ten months ended October 31, 2000.

(b)

BorgWarner Inc. owns 50% of NSK-Warner, giving the Company an effective
ownership interest of 80%.

See Note 13 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 44 through 46 of the Company's Annual
Report for geographic information.

Customers

Approximately 75% of the Company's
total sales in 2000 were to automotive OEMs, with the remaining 25% of the
Company's sales to a diversified group of industrial, construction and
agricultural vehicle manufacturers, auto part manufacturers and to distributors
of automotive aftermarket and replacement parts.

The Company's worldwide sales in
2000 to Ford, DaimlerChrysler Corporation and General Motors Corporation
constituted approximately 26%, 17% and 12%, respectively, of its 2000
consolidated sales. Approximately 26% of consolidated sales for 2000 were
outside the United States, including exports. However, a substantial portion of
such sales were to foreign OEMs of vehicles that are, in turn, exported to the
United States. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements on pages 44 through 46 of the Company's Annual Report.

The Company's automotive products
are generally sold directly to OEMs substantially pursuant to either negotiated long
term supply agreements or terms and conditions as may be modified by the Company.
Deliveries are subject to periodic authorizations based
upon the production schedules of the OEMs. The Company ships its products
directly from its plants to the OEMs.


Sales and Marketing

Each of the Company's operating
segments has its own sales function headed by a vice president of sales. Account
executives for each group are assigned to serve specific OEM customers for one
or more of a business group's products. Such account executives spend the
majority of their time in direct contact with OEM purchasing and engineering
employees and are responsible for servicing existing business and for
identifying and obtaining new business. Because of their close relationship with
the OEMs, account executives are able to identify and meet customers' needs
based upon their knowledge of the Company's products and design and
manufacturing capabilities. Upon securing a new order, account executives
participate in product launch team activities as a key interface to the
customers.

Research and Development

Each of the Company's operating
segments has its own research and development ("R&D") organization. Over
600 employees, including engineers, mechanics and technicians, are engaged
in R&D activities at Company facilities worldwide. The Company also operates
testing facilities such as prototype, measurement and calibration, life testing
and dynamometer laboratories.

By working closely with the OEMs
and anticipating their future product needs, the Company's R&D personnel
conceive, design, develop and manufacture new proprietary automotive components
and systems. R&D personnel also work to improve current products and
production processes. The Company believes its commitment to R&D will allow
it to obtain new orders from its OEM customers.

Consistent with its strategy of
developing technologically innovative products, the Company spent approximately
$112.0 million, $91.6 million and $65.1 million in 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively, on R&D activities. Not included in the reported R&D
activities were customer-sponsored R&D activities that were approximately
$12.5 million, $9.4 million and $8.4 million in 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively.

Patents and Licenses

The Company has approximately 2,800
active domestic and foreign patents and patent applications pending or under
preparation, and receives royalties from licensing patent rights to others.
While it considers its patents on the whole to be important, the Company does
not consider any single patent, group of related patents or any single license
essential to its operations in the aggregate or to the operations of any of the
Company's business groups individually. The expiration of the patents
individually and in the aggregate is not expected to have a material effect on
the Company's financial position or future operating results. The Company owns
numerous trademarks, some of which are valuable but none of which are essential
to its business in the aggregate.

The Company owns the "BorgWarner"
and "Borg-Warner Automotive" trade names and housemarks, and variations thereof,
which are material to the Company's business.

Competition

Each of the Company's operating
segments competes worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and
distributors which produce and sell similar products. Price, quality and
technological innovation are the primary elements of competition. Competitors
include vertically integrated units of the Company's major OEM customers, as
well as a large number of independent domestic and international suppliers
(some of which were formerly part of our OEM customers). Many
of these companies are larger and have greater resources than the Company.

A number of the Company's major OEM
customers manufacture, for their own use and for others, products which compete
with the Company's products. Although these OEM customers have indicated that
they will continue to rely on outside suppliers, the OEMs could elect to
manufacture products to meet their own requirements or to compete with the
Company. There can be no assurance that the Company's business will not be
adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates.


The competitive environment has
changed dramatically over the past few years as the Company's traditional United
States OEM customers, faced with intense international competition, have
expanded their worldwide sourcing of components with the stated objective of
better competing with lower-cost imports. As a result, the Company has
experienced competition from suppliers in other parts of the world enjoying
economic advantages such as lower labor costs, lower health care costs and, in
some cases, export subsidies and/or raw materials subsidies.

Employees

As of December 31, 2000, the
Company and its consolidated subsidiaries had approximately 14,000 salaried and
hourly employees (as compared with approximately 14,400 employees at
December 31, 1999), of which approximately 9,219 were U.S. employees.
Approximately 39% of the Company's domestic hourly workers are unionized. The
hourly workers at the Company's European facilities are also unionized. The
Company believes its present relations with employees to be satisfactory.

Raw Materials

Each of the Company's operating
segments believes that its supplies of raw materials for manufacturing
requirements in 2001 are adequate and are available from multiple sources. It is
common, however, for customers to require their prior approval before certain
raw materials or components can be used, thereby reducing sources of supply that
would otherwise be available. Manufacturing operations for each of the Company's
operating segments are dependent upon natural gas, fuel oil, propane and
electricity.

Environmental Regulation and Proceedings

The Company's operations are
subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing,
among other things, emissions to air, discharge to waters and the generation,
handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste and other
materials. The Company believes that it has operated its business and facilities
in compliance in all material respects with
applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, many of
which provide for substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations.
However, the operation of automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in
these areas even for a company complying with all laws, and there can be no assurance that the Company will not incur
material costs or liabilities. In addition, through various acquisitions over the
years, the Company has acquired a number of manufacturing facilities and there
can be no assurance that the Company will not incur material costs and liabilities
relating to activities which predate the Company's ownership. In addition, potentially significant expenditures
could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental and health and
safety laws, regulations or requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the
future.

The Company believes that the
overall impact of compliance with regulations and legislation protecting the
environment will not have a material effect on its financial position or future
operating results, although no assurance can be given in this regard. Capital
expenditures and expenses in 2000 attributable to compliance with such
legislation were not material.

The Company and certain of its
current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and
divisions have been identified by the United States Environmental Protection
Agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as
potentially responsible parties ("PRPs") at various hazardous waste disposal
sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
Act ("Superfund") and equivalent state laws and, as such, may presently be liable for the
cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at 42 such sites. Responsibility
for cleanup and other remedial activities at a Superfund site is typically
shared among PRPs based on an allocation formula.

Based on information available to
the Company which, in most cases, includes: an estimate of allocation of
liability among PRPs; the probability that other PRPs, many of whom are large,
solvent public companies, will fully pay the costs apportioned to them;
currently available information from PRPs and/or federal or state environmental
agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation costs;
remediation alternatives; estimated legal fees; and other factors, the


Company has established a reserve for indicated environmental
liabilities in the aggregate amount of approximately $20.7 million at
December 31, 2000. The Company expects this amount to be expended over the
next three to five years.

The Company believes that none of
these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse
effect on its financial position or future operating results, generally either
because estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not large or
because liability will be shared with other PRPs, although no assurance can be
given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter.

In connection with the sale of Kuhlman Electric Corporation, we agreed
to indemnify the buyer and Kuhlman Electric for certain environmental liabilities
relating to the past operations of Kuhlman Electric.  During 2000, Kuhlman Electric notified
us that it discovered potential environmental contamination at its Crystal Springs, Mississippi
plant while undertaking an expansion of the plant.

We have been working with the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality and Kuhlman
Electric to investigate the extent of the contamination.  To date, the investigation has revealed
the presence of PCBs in portions of the soil at the plant and neighboring areas.  We have
filed a lawsuit against Kuhlman Electric seeking a declaration of the scope of the Company's contractual
indemnity.  As the investigation is in its early stages, and the court has not yet ruled on the lawsuit,
we cannot now estimte the potential liability associated with this matter.

The following is additional
information concerning the headquarters and the major manufacturing plants
operated by the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. Unless otherwise
noted, these plants are owned by the Company.


(1)

The figure shown in each case is a weighted average of the
      percentage utilization of each major plant within the category, with an
      individual plant weighted in proportion to the number of employees
      employed when such plant runs at 100% capacity. Capacity utilization at
      the 100% level is defined as operating five days per week, with two
      eight-hour shifts per day and normal vacation schedules.

(2)

The table excludes joint ventures owned 50% or
  less.

(3)

The Company has announced its intention to divest its fuel

established adequate provisions for litigation liabilities in its financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. These
provisions include both legal fees and possible outcomes of legal proceedings.

It is the opinion of the Company
that the various asserted claims and litigation in which the Company is
currently involved will not materially affect its financial position or future
operating results, although no assurance can be given with respect to the
ultimate outcome for any such claim or litigation.
