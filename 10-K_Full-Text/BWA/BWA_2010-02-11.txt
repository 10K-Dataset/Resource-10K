PART I

Item 1.

Business

BorgWarner Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) is a Delaware corporation that was
    incorporated in 1987. We are a leading, global supplier of
    highly engineered automotive systems and components, primarily
    for powertrain applications. Our products help improve vehicle
    performance, fuel efficiency, stability and air quality. These
    products are manufactured and sold worldwide, primarily to
    original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) of
    light-vehicles (passenger cars, sport-utility vehicles, vans and
    light-trucks). The Company’s products are also sold to
    other OEMs of commercial trucks, buses and agricultural and
    off-highway vehicles. We also manufacture and sell our products
    to certain Tier One vehicle systems suppliers and into the
    aftermarket for light and commercial vehicles. The Company
    operates manufacturing facilities serving customers in the
    Americas, Europe and Asia, and is an original equipment supplier
    to every major automotive OEM in the world.

Engine

The Engine Group develops and manufactures products to manage
    engines for fuel efficiency, reduced emissions, and enhanced
    performance. Concern about fuel prices and availability, and the
    need to lower
    CO


emissions are driving demand for the Company’s products in
    smaller, more efficient gasoline and diesel engines and
    alternative powertrains in hybrid vehicles. Engine Group
    products currently fall into the following major categories:
    turbochargers, chain products, emissions systems, thermal
    systems, diesel cold start and gasoline ignition technology and
    cabin heaters.

The Engine Group provides turbochargers for light-vehicle,
    commercial-vehicle and off-road applications for diesel and
    gasoline engine manufacturers in Europe, North America, South
    America and Asia. The Engine Group has greatly benefited from
    the growth in turbocharger demand in Europe. This growth is
    linked to increasing demand for diesel engines in light vehicles
    which typically use turbochargers and for turbocharged gasoline
    engines. Benefits of turbochargers in both light-vehicle and
    commercial-vehicle applications include increased power for a
    given engine size, improved fuel economy and significantly
    reduced emissions.

Sales of turbochargers for light-vehicles represented
    approximately 27%, 24%, and 21% of the Company’s total
    revenues for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company
    currently supplies light-



vehicle turbochargers to many OEMs including Volkswagen,
    Renault, PSA, Daimler, Hyundai, Fiat, BMW, Ford and General
    Motors. The Company also supplies commercial-vehicle
    turbochargers to Caterpillar, John Deere, Daimler,
    International, Deutz and MAN.

The Company’s newest technologies are its regulated
    two-stage turbocharging system known as
    R2S

®

,

    variable turbine geometry (“VTG”) turbochargers and
    turbochargers for gasoline direct injected engines. In 2008, the
    Company announced the start of production of its award winning
    R2S technology for Daimler’s new 4 cylinder diesel engine
    range. The Company also began shipping VTG turbochargers for
    VW’s new common-rail engine range and announced the launch
    of a VTG turbocharger for use with low-pressure exhaust gas
    recirculation to reduce emissions on VW’s Jetta Clean
    Diesel TDI. In 2009, the Company began shipping turbochargers
    for Ford’s 3.5 liter V6 direct-injected gasoline engines
    for rear-wheel drive cars and trucks. Additionally, Ford
    selected BorgWarner’s leading gasoline turborcharger
    technology for their new four-cylinder EcoBoost engine,
    scheduled to make its global debut early in 2010.

The Engine Group also designs and manufactures products to
    control emissions and improve fuel economy. These products
    include electric air pumps, turbo actuators that use integrated
    electronics to precisely control turbocharger speed and pressure
    ratio, and exhaust gas recirculation valves for gasoline and
    diesel applications.

The Engine Group’s chain and chain systems products include
    timing chain and timing drive systems, variable cam timing
    (“VCT”) systems, crankshaft and camshaft sprockets,
    tensioners, guides and snubbers, HY-VO

®

front-wheel drive (“FWD”) transmission chain and
    four-wheel drive (“4WD”) chain, and MORSE GEMINI

®

chain systems for light-vehicle and commercial-vehicle
    applications.

The Company’s timing chain systems are used in Ford’s
    family of overhead cam engines, including the Duratec and
    Modular, and in-line 4 cylinder engines, as well as on
    Chrysler’s 3.7 liter and 4.7 liter, overhead cam engines,
    and the 4 cylinder World Engine family of engines. In addition,
    the Company provides timing systems to a number of Asian OEMs
    and their North American operations, including Honda, Nissan,
    and Hyundai, and to several European OEMs. The Company believes
    that it is the world’s leading manufacturer of timing chain
    systems.

The Engine Group has successfully launched its latest VCT
    product; Cam Torque
    Actuated

tm

(“CTA”) VCT. VCT is a means of precisely controlling
    the flow of air into and out of an engine by allowing the
    camshaft to be dynamically phased relative to its crankshaft.
    The Company’s CTA technology utilizes camshaft torque as
    its main actuation energy, instead of the conventional
    oil-pressure actuated approach. The CTA system has been launched
    on Ford’s 3.0 liter Duratec engine featured in the Ford
    Escape, Ford Fusion, Mazda 6, and Mercury Mariner.

The Company believes it is the world’s leading manufacturer
    of chain for FWD transmissions and 4WD transfer cases. HY-VO
    chain is used to transfer power from the engine to the
    drivetrain. The chain in a transfer case distributes power
    between a vehicle’s front and rear output shafts which, in
    turn, provide torque to the front and rear wheels. The
    Company’s MORSE GEMINI transmission chain system emits
    significantly less chain pitch frequency noise than conventional
    transmission chain systems.

The Engine Group believes it is a leading global provider of
    engine thermal solutions for truck, agricultural and off-highway
    applications. The group designs, manufactures and markets
    viscous fan drives that control fans to sense and respond to
    multiple cooling requirements. The Engine Group also
    manufactures and markets polymer fans for engine cooling
    systems. The Company’s thermal products provide improved
    vehicle fuel economy and reduced engine emissions while
    minimizing parasitic horsepower loss. The Company has been
    awarded the “standard position” (the OEM-designated
    preferred supplier of component systems available to the
    end-customer) at the major global heavy truck producers.

In 2005, the Company acquired approximately 69.4% of the
    outstanding shares of BERU Aktiengesellschaft
    (“BERU”), headquartered in Ludwigsburg, Germany. In
    2007, the Company increased its ownership to approximately
    82.2%. In the second quarter of 2008, the Company and BERU
    completed a Domination and Profit Transfer Agreement
    (“DPTA”), giving BorgWarner full control of BERU. On
    January 7, 2009 the Company informed BERU of its intention
    to purchase the remaining outstanding shares at that time



of approximately 4%, using the required German legal process
    referred to as a “squeeze-out” to gain 100% ownership.
    The “squeeze-out” became effective on
    September 30, 2009, making the Company the only shareholder
    of BERU. The Company’s corporate form and name were changed
    to BorgWarner BERU Systems GMBH (“BERU Systems”) in
    late 2009. Refer to Note 18, “Recent
    Transactions” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this report for further information
    related to the Company’s DPTA agreement with BERU.

BERU System’s operating results are included within the
    Company’s Engine Group segment. BERU Systems is a leading
    global automotive supplier of diesel cold starting technology
    (glow plugs and instant starting systems). It also designs and
    manufactures gasoline ignition technology (spark plugs and
    ignition coils); and electronic control units and sensor
    technology (tire pressure sensors, diesel cabin heaters and
    selected sensors). In 2008, BERU launched its new Pressure
    Sensor Glow Plug with which the combustion process of a diesel
    engine is monitored and enhanced, allowing the lowest
    CO


and
    NO

x

emissions possible.

On June 2, 2009, the Company announced the purchase of
    advanced gasoline ignition technology and related intellectual
    property from Florida-based Etatech, Inc. The high-frequency
    ignition technology enables high-performing, lean burning
    engines to significantly improve fuel economy and reduce
    emissions compared with conventional combustion technologies.

Drivetrain

The Drivetrain Group leverages the Company’s expertise in
    clutching and control systems to enable efficient transmission
    of engine torque through the vehicle drivetrain and management
    of torque distribution to the driven wheels. The Company’s
    technology can improve fuel efficiency and help reduce emissions
    in all types of powertrains. The Drivetrain Group’s major
    products are transmission components and systems, and AWD torque
    management systems.

The Drivetrain Group designs and manufactures automatic
    transmission components and modules and is a supplier to
    virtually every major automatic transmission manufacturer in the
    world for both conventional automatic, new dual-clutch
    transmissions (“DCT”) and automated manual
    transmissions.

Friction and mechanical products include dual clutch modules,
    friction clutch modules, friction plates, transmission bands,
    torque converter clutches, one-way clutches and torsional
    vibration dampers. Controls products feature electro-hydraulic
    solenoids for standard and high pressure hydraulic systems,
    transmission solenoid modules and dual clutch control modules.

The Company’s 50%-owned joint venture in Japan, NSK-Warner
    Kabushiki Kaisha (“NSK-Warner”), is a leading producer
    of friction plates and one-way clutches in Japan. NSK-Warner is
    also the joint venture partner with a 40% interest in the
    Drivetrain Group’s Korean subsidiary, BorgWarner
    Transmission Systems Korea, Inc.

The Company has led the globalization of today’s DCT
    technology for over ten years. Following the development of its
    DCT technology in the 1990s, the Company established its
    industry-leading position in Europe in 2003 with the production
    launch of its award-winning
    DualTronic

®

innovations with VW/Audi. In 2007, the Company launched its
    first dual-clutch technology application in a Japanese
    transmission with Nissan.

The Company has announced DCT programs with customers that
    include VW, Audi, SAIC and Nissan, in addition to Getrag DCT
    programs with BMW, Ford and other global automakers. Also, the
    Company is working on several programs with OEMs around the
    world. BorgWarner DualTronic technology enables a conventional,
    manual gearbox to function as a fully automatic transmission by
    eliminating the interruption in power flow that occurs when a
    single clutch manual transmission shifts gears. The result is a
    smooth shifting automatic transmission with the fuel efficiency
    and great driving experience of a manual gearbox.

On November 18, 2008, we entered into a joint venture
    agreement with China Automobile Development United Investment
    Company, a company owned by leading Chinese automakers, to
    produce various dual clutch transmission modules. The joint
    venture will be located in Dalian, China and production is
    scheduled to begin in 2011. BorgWarner will own 66% of the joint
    venture.



In conventional automatic transmissions, there has been a global
    market trend from four and five speeds to six, seven, and even
    eight speed transmissions. Transmissions with more speeds
    improve fuel economy and vehicle performance and offer growth
    opportunities.

The Drivetrain Group’s torque management products include
    rear-wheel drive (“RWD”)/all-wheel drive
    (“AWD”) transfer case systems, FWD/AWD electromagnetic
    coupling systems and advanced products. The Company’s focus
    is on electronically controlled (active) torque management
    devices and systems for their vehicle dynamics, fuel economy and
    stability benefits.

Transfer cases are installed primarily on light-trucks,
    sport-utility vehicles (“SUV”s), rear-wheel drive
    based cross-over utility vehicles (“CUV”s) and
    passenger cars. A transfer case attaches to the transmission and
    distributes torque to the front and rear axles improving vehicle
    traction and stability in dynamic driving conditions.

The Company is involved in the FWD/AWD market with
    electromagnetic couplings that use electronically controlled
    clutches to distribute power to the rear wheels instantly as
    traction is required. The
    NexTrac

®

AWD device is our latest product innovation that produces
    outstanding stability and traction while promoting better fuel
    economy. The NexTrac AWD device launched in 2008 on the Hyundai
    Santa Fe, Tucson and KIA Sportage.

With the trend toward vehicle electrification gaining momentum,
    the Company is also applying its years of expertise to deliver
    robust and highly efficient single and multiple speed electric
    gear reduction solutions for hybrids and electric vehicles.
    Currently, we supply our
    eGearDrive

tm

single-speed gearbox to the all-electric Tesla Roadster, and
    will also supply our eGearDrive to the all-electric CODA sedan
    scheduled for introduction in California in 2010. Additionally,
    we are actively engaged with traditional and non-traditional
    OEMs on seven other transmission programs for plug-in hybrid and
    electric vehicles.

Joint
    Ventures

As of December 31, 2009, the Company had 11 joint ventures
    in which it had a less-than-100% ownership interest. Results
    from the seven ventures in which the Company is the majority
    owner are consolidated as part of the Company’s results.
    Results from the four ventures in which the Company’s
    effective ownership interest is 50% or less, were reported by

Financial
    Information About Geographic Areas

Refer to Note 19, “Reporting Segments and Related
    Information” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this report for financial
    information about geographic areas.

Approximately 73% of the Company’s consolidated sales for
    2009 were outside the United States, including exports. However,
    a portion of such sales were to OEMs headquartered outside the
    United States that produce vehicles that are, in turn, exported
    to the United States.

Customers

Approximately 75% of the Company’s total sales in 2009 were
    for light-vehicle applications; 17% of the Company’s sales
    were to a diversified group of commercial truck, bus,
    construction and agricultural vehicle manufacturers; and the
    remaining 8% to distributors of aftermarket replacement parts.

For the most recent three-year period, the Company’s
    worldwide sales to the following customers (including their
    subsidiaries) were approximately as follows:

Customer




Volkswagen


%


%


%

Ford


%


%


%

No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of our
    consolidated sales in any year of the periods presented.

The Company’s automotive products are generally sold
    directly to OEMs substantially pursuant to negotiated annual
    contracts, long-term supply agreements or terms and conditions
    as may be modified by the parties. Deliveries are subject to
    periodic authorizations based upon the production schedules of
    the OEMs. The Company typically ships its products directly from
    its plants to the OEMs.

Sales and
    Marketing

Each of the Company’s business units within its two
    reporting segments has its own sales function. Account
    executives for each of our business units are assigned to serve
    specific OEM customers for one or more of a business unit’s
    products. Our account executives spend the majority of their
    time in direct contact



with OEM purchasing and engineering employees and are
    responsible for servicing existing business and for identifying
    and obtaining new business. Because of their close relationship
    with OEMs, account executives are able to identify and meet
    customers’ needs based upon their knowledge of our
    customer’s needs and our products and design and
    manufacturing capabilities. Upon securing a new order, account
    executives participate in product launch team activities and
    serve as a key interface with the customers.

In addition, the sales and marketing employees of our Engine
    segment and Drivetrain segment often work together to explore
    cross-development opportunities for the business units. The
    development of DualTronic, the Company’s wet-clutch and
    control-system technology for a new-concept automated
    transmission, is an example of a successful collaboration.

Seasonality

The Company’s business is moderately seasonal because the
    Company’s largest North American customers typically halt
    vehicle production for approximately two weeks in July and one
    week in December. Additionally, customers in Europe and Asia
    typically shut down vehicle production during portions of July
    or August and one week in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, the
    Company’s third and fourth quarters may reflect those
    practices.

Research and
    Development

The Company conducts advanced engine and drivetrain research at
    the segment level. This advanced engineering function looks to
    leverage know-how and expertise across product lines to create
    new engine and drivetrain systems and modules that can be
    commercialized. A venture capital fund that was created by the
    Company as seed money for new innovation and collaboration
    across businesses is managed by this function.

In addition, each of the Company’s business units within
    its two reporting segments has its own research and development
    (“R&D”) organization. The Company has
    approximately 700 employees, including engineers, mechanics
    and technicians, engaged in R&D activities at facilities
    worldwide. The Company also operates testing facilities such as
    prototype, measurement and calibration, life cycle testing and
    dynamometer laboratories.

By working closely with the OEMs and anticipating their future
    product needs, the Company’s R&D personnel conceive,
    design, develop and manufacture new proprietary automotive
    components and systems. R&D personnel also work to improve
    current products and production processes. The Company believes
    its commitment to R&D will allow it to obtain new orders
    from its OEM customers.

The following table presents the Company’s gross and net
    expenditures on R&D activities:

    as a percentage of net sales were 3.9% in 2009 and 2008 and 4.0%
    in 2007. Customer reimbursements are netted against gross
    R&D expenditures upon billing of services performed. The
    Company has contracts with several customers at the
    Company’s various R&D locations. No such contract
    exceeded $6.0 million in any of the years presented.

Patents and
    Licenses

The Company has approximately 4,200 active domestic and foreign
    patents and patent applications pending or under preparation,
    and receives royalties from licensing patent rights to others.
    While it considers



its patents on the whole to be important, the Company does not
    consider any single patent, any group of related patents or any
    single license essential to its operations in the aggregate or
    to the operations of any of the Company’s business groups
    individually. The expiration of the patents individually and in
    the aggregate is not expected to have a material effect on the
    Company’s financial position or future operating results.
    The Company owns numerous trademarks, some of which are
    valuable, but none of which are essential to its business in the
    aggregate.

The Company owns the “BorgWarner” and
    “Borg-Warner Automotive” trade names and housemarks,
    and variations thereof, which are material to the Company’s
    business.

Competition

The Company’s operating segments compete worldwide with a
    number of other manufacturers and distributors which produce and
    sell similar products. Many of these competitors are larger and
    have greater resources than the Company. Price, quality,
    delivery, technological innovation, application engineering
    development and program launch support are the primary elements
    of competition.

The Company’s major competitors by product type follow:

Product Type: Engine

Name of Competitor

Turbochargers:

Holset (Cummins Inc.)

Honeywell

IHI

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI)

Schaeffler Group

In addition, a number of the Company’s major OEM customers
    manufacture, for their own use and for others, products which
    compete with the Company’s products. Other current OEM
    customers could elect to manufacture products to meet their own
    requirements or to compete with the Company. There can be no
    assurance that the Company’s business will not be adversely
    affected by increased competition in the markets in which it
    operates.

For many of its products, the Company’s competitors include
    suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic
    advantages such as lower labor costs, lower health care costs
    and, in some cases, export subsidies

and/or

raw
    materials subsidies. Also, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.



Employees

As of December 31, 2009, the Company and its consolidated
    subsidiaries had approximately 12,500 salaried and hourly
    employees (as compared with approximately 13,800 employees
    at December 31, 2008), of which approximately 4,100 were
    U.S. employees. The approximately 13,800 employees at
    December 31, 2008 included anticipated reductions, which
    did occur in 2009. Refer to Note 17,
    “Restructuring” of the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for a
    discussion of actions taken in 2009. Approximately 19% of the
    Company’s U.S. workforce is unionized. The hourly
    employees at certain of our international facilities are also
    unionized. The Company believes its present relations with
    employees to be satisfactory.

Our only domestic collective bargaining agreement is for our
    Ithaca and Cortland, New York facilities. This agreement expires
    in September 2012.

Raw
    Materials

The company uses a variety of raw materials in the production of
    its automotive products including steel, aluminum, copper,
    plastic resins, and certain alloying elements. Manufacturing
    operations for each of the Company’s operating segments are
    dependent upon natural gas, fuel oil, and electricity.

Commodity prices dropped sharply in 2009 due to falling global
    demands and their subsequent oversupply. Commodity prices have
    recovered much of their value and have returned to 2007 levels
    after bottoming out during the recession of 2009.

As developed economies recover and auto production accelerates,
    certain commodities may experience temporary shortages and
    inflated prices until production volumes again reach equilibrium
    with market demands. The Company uses a variety of tactics in
    order to limit the impact of supply shortages and inflationary
    pressures.

The Company formed a global procurement organization to
    accelerate: cost reductions, purchases from lower cost regions,
    supplier rationalization, risk mitigation efforts, and
    collaborative buying activities. In addition, the Company uses
    long-term contracts, cost sharing arrangements, design changes,
    customer buy programs, and limited financial instruments to help
    control costs. The Company intends to use similar measures in
    2010 and beyond. Refer to Note 10, “Financial
    Instruments” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this report for information related
    to the Company’s hedging activities.

For 2010, the Company believes that its supplies of raw
    materials and energy are adequate and available from multiple
    sources to support its manufacturing requirements.

Environmental
    Regulation and Proceedings

The Company and certain of its current and former direct and
    indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have
    been identified by the United States Environmental Protection
    Agency and certain state environmental agencies and private
    parties as potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) at
    various hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive
    Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
    (“Superfund”) and equivalent state laws and, as such,
    may presently be liable for the cost of

clean-up

and
    other remedial activities at 35 such sites. Responsibility for

clean-up

and
    other remedial activities at a Superfund site is typically
    shared among PRPs based on an allocation formula.

The Company believes that none of these matters, individually or
    in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its
    results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
    Generally, this is because either the estimates of the maximum
    potential liability at a site are not large or the liability
    will be shared with other PRPs, although no assurance can be
    given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter.

Based on information available to the Company (which in most
    cases includes: an estimate of allocation of liability among
    PRPs; the probability that other PRPs, many of whom are large,
    solvent public companies, will fully pay the cost apportioned to
    them; currently available information from PRPs

and/or

federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of
    contamination and estimated remediation and consulting



costs; remediation alternatives; and estimated legal fees), the
    Company has an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities
    with a balance at December 31, 2009 of $21.0 million.
    The Company has accrued amounts that do not exceed
    $3.0 million related to any individual site except for the
    Crystal Springs site discussed below, and we do not believe that
    the costs related to any of these sites will have a material
    adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash
    flows or financial condition. The Company expects to pay out
    substantially all of the amounts accrued for environmental
    liability over the next three to five years.

In connection with the sale of Kuhlman Electric Corporation, the
    Company agreed to indemnify the buyer and Kuhlman Electric for
    certain environmental liabilities, then unknown to the Company,
    relating to certain operations of Kuhlman Electric that pre-date
    the Company’s 1999 acquisition of Kuhlman Electric. During
    2000, Kuhlman Electric notified the Company that it discovered
    potential environmental contamination at its Crystal Springs,
    Mississippi plant while undertaking an expansion of the plant.
    The Company is continuing to work with the Mississippi
    Department of Environmental Quality and Kuhlman Electric to
    investigate and remediate to the extent necessary, historical
    contamination at the plant and surrounding area. Kuhlman
    Electric and others, including the Company, were sued in
    numerous related lawsuits, in which multiple claimants alleged
    personal injury and property damage relating to the alleged
    environmental contamination. In 2005, the Company and other
    defendants entered into settlements that resolved approximately
    99% of those claims and the remainder of them have since been
    dismissed.

In 2007 and 2008, four additional lawsuits were filed against
    Kuhlman Electric and others, including the Company, on behalf of
    approximately 340 plaintiffs, alleging personal injury relating
    to the alleged environmental contamination. At this stage of the
    litigation, the Company cannot make any predictions as to the
    outcome, but it is vigorously defending against the suits.

Conditional Asset
    Retirement Obligations

In March 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Codification
    (“ASC”) Topic 410, Accounting for Conditional Asset
    Retirement Obligations, which requires the Company to recognize
    legal obligations to perform asset retirements in which the
    timing

and/or

method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may
    or may not be within the control of the entity. Certain
    government regulations require the removal and disposal of
    asbestos from an existing facility at the time the facility
    undergoes major renovations or is demolished. The liability
    exists because the facility will not last forever, but it is
    conditional on future renovations (even if there are no
    immediate plans to remove the materials, which pose no health or
    safety hazard in their current condition). Similarly, government
    regulations require the removal or closure of underground
    storage tanks and above ground storage tanks when their use
    ceases, the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyl transformers
    and capacitors when their use ceases, and the disposal of used
    furnace bricks and liners, and lead-based paint in conjunction
    with facility renovations or demolition. The Company currently
    has 31 manufacturing locations that have been identified as
    containing these items. The fair value to remove and dispose of
    this material has been estimated and recorded at
    $1.3 million as of December 31, 2009 and
    $1.4 million as of December 31, 2008.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

The following risk factors and other information included in
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

should be considered. The risks and uncertainties described
    below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and
    uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently
    deem immaterial also may impact our business operations. If any
    of the following risks occur, our business including its
    financial performance, financial condition, operating results
    and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

Our industry
    is cyclical and our results of operations will be adversely
    affected by industry downturns.

Automotive and truck production and sales are cyclical and
    sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors
    including interest rates, consumer credit, and consumer spending
    and preferences. Further economic decline that results in
    further significant reduction in automotive or truck production
    would have a material adverse effect on our sales to original
    equipment manufacturers.

We continue to take steps to realign and resize our production
    capacity and cost structure to meet current and projected
    operational and market requirements. Further significant
    declines in the automotive industry and financial declines and
    restructurings by our significant customers may make it
    necessary to take further restructuring actions and charges.

We are
    dependent on market segments that use our key products and would
    be affected by decreasing demand in those
    segments.

Some of our products, in particular turbochargers, are currently
    used primarily in diesel passenger cars and commercial vehicles.
    Any significant reduction in production in these market segments
    or loss of business in these market segments could have a
    material adverse effect on our sales to original equipment
    manufacturers.

We face strong
    competition.

We compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and
    distributors that produce and sell products similar to ours.
    Price, quality, delivery, technological innovation, application
    engineering development and program launch support are the
    primary elements of competition. Our competitors include
    vertically integrated units of our major original equipment
    manufacturer customers, as well as a large number of independent
    domestic and international suppliers. We are not as large as a
    number of these companies and do not have as many financial or
    other resources. The competitive environment has changed
    dramatically over the past few years as our traditional
    U.S. original equipment manufacturer customers, faced with
    intense international competition, have expanded their worldwide
    sourcing of components. As a result, we have experienced
    competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that
    enjoy economic advantages, such as



lower labor costs, lower health care costs and, in some cases,
    export or raw materials subsidies. Increased competition could
    adversely affect our businesses.

We are under
    substantial pressure from original equipment manufacturers to
    reduce the prices of our products.

There is substantial and continuing pressure on original
    equipment manufacturers to reduce costs, including costs of
    products we supply. Although original equipment manufacturers
    have indicated that they will continue to rely on outside
    suppliers, a number of our major original equipment manufacturer
    customers manufacture products for their own uses that directly
    compete with our products. These original equipment
    manufacturers could elect to manufacture such products for their
    own uses in place of the products we currently supply. We
    believe that our ability to develop proprietary new products and
    to control our costs will allow us to remain competitive.
    However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to improve or
    maintain our gross margins on product sales to original
    equipment manufacturers or that the recent trend by original
    equipment manufacturers towards increased outsourcing will
    continue.

Annual price reductions to original equipment manufacturer
    customers appear to have become a permanent feature of our
    business environment. To maintain our profit margins, we seek
    price reductions from our suppliers, improve production
    processes to increase manufacturing efficiency, update product
    designs to reduce costs and develop new products, the benefits
    of which support stable or increased prices. Our ability to pass
    through increased raw material costs to our original equipment
    manufacturer customers is limited, with cost recovery often less
    than 100% and often on a delayed basis. We cannot assure you
    that we will be able to reduce costs in an amount equal to
    annual price reductions and increases in raw material costs.

We are
    sensitive to the effects of our major customers’ labor
    relations.

All three of our primary North American customers, Ford,
    Chrysler and General Motors, have major union contracts with the
    United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers
    of America. Because of domestic original equipment
    manufacturers’ dependence on a single union, we are
    affected by labor difficulties and work stoppages at original
    equipment manufacturers’ facilities. Similarly, a majority
    of our global customers’ operations outside of North
    America are also represented by various unions. Any extended
    work stoppage could have an adverse effect on our business.

Part of our
    labor force is unionized which could subject us to work
    stoppages.

As of December 31, 2009, approximately 19% of our
    U.S. workforce was unionized. Our only domestic collective
    bargaining agreement is for our Ithaca and Cortland, New York
    facilities. This agreement expires in September 2012. The hourly
    employees at certain of our international facilities are also
    unionized. While we believe that our relations with our
    employees are satisfactory, a prolonged dispute with our
    employees could have an adverse effect on our business.

We are subject
    to extensive environmental regulations.

Our operations are subject to laws governing, among other
    things, emissions to air, discharges to waters and the
    generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and
    disposal of waste and other materials. We believe that our
    business, operations and activities have been and are being
    operated in compliance in all material respects with applicable
    environmental, health and safety laws. However, the operation of
    automotive parts manufacturing plants entails risks in these
    areas, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur material
    costs or liabilities as a result. Furthermore, through various
    acquisitions over the years, we have acquired a number of
    manufacturing facilities, and we cannot assure you that we will
    not incur materials costs and liabilities relating to activities
    that predate our ownership. In addition, potentially significant
    expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving
    environmental, health and safety laws that may be adopted in the
    future.



We have
    contingent liabilities related to environmental, product
    warranties, regulatory matters, litigation and other
    claims.

We and certain of our current and former direct and indirect
    corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have been
    identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency
    and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as
    potentially responsible parties at various hazardous waste
    disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
    Compensation and Liability Act and equivalent state laws. As a
    result, as of December 31, 2009, we may be liable for the
    cost of

clean-up

and
    other remedial activities at 35 of these sites.

We work with outside experts to determine a range of potential
    liability for environmental sites. The ranges for each
    individual site are then aggregated into a loss range for the
    total accrued liability. Management’s estimate of the loss
    range for environmental liability, including conditional asset
    retirement obligations, for 2009 is between approximately
    $20 million and $40 million. We record an accrual at
    the most probable amount within the range unless one cannot be
    determined; in which case we record the accrual at the low end
    of the range. Based on information available to us, we have
    established an accrual in our financial statements for indicated
    environmental liabilities, including our conditional asset
    retirement obligation under ASC Topic 410, with a balance of
    $1.3 million at December 31, 2009. We currently expect
    the substantial portion of this amount to be expended over the
    next three to five years.

We provide warranties to our customers for some of our products.
    Under these warranties, we may be required to bear costs and
    expenses for the repair or replacement of these products. We
    cannot assure you that costs and expenses associated with these
    product warranties will not be material, or that those costs
    will not exceed any amounts accrued for such warranties in our
    financial statement. Based upon information available to us, we
    have established an accrual in our financial statements for
    product warranties of $61.7 million at December 31,
    2009.

We are also party to, or have an obligation to defend a party
    to, various legal proceedings, including those described in
    Note 14 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in the Company’s Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

We are currently, and may in the future become, subject to legal
    proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes. These claims
    typically arise in the normal course of business and may
    include, but not be limited to, commercial or contractual
    disputes with our suppliers, intellectual property matters and
    employment claims. There is a possibility that such claims may
    have an adverse impact on our business that is greater than we
    anticipate.

Our growth
    strategy may prove unsuccessful.

We have a stated goal of increasing revenues and operating
    income at a rate greater than global vehicle production by
    increasing content per vehicle with innovative new components
    and through select acquisitions. We may not meet our goal
    because of any of the following: (a) the failure to develop
    new products which will be purchased by our customers;
    (b) technology changes rendering our products obsolete;
    (c) a reversal of the trend of supplying systems (which
    allows us to increase content per vehicle) instead of
    components; and (d) the failure to find suitable
    acquisition targets or the failure to integrate operations of
    acquired businesses quickly and cost effectively.

We are subject
    to risks related to our international operations.

We have manufacturing and technical facilities in many regions
    and countries, including North America, Europe, China, India,
    South Korea, Japan, and Brazil and sell our products worldwide.
    For 2009, approximately 72% of our sales were outside North
    America. Consequently, our results could be affected by changes
    in trade, monetary and fiscal policies, trade restrictions or
    prohibitions, import or other charges or taxes, and fluctuations
    in foreign currency exchange rates, limitations on the
    repatriation of funds changing economic conditions, social
    unrest, political instability and disputes, and international
    terrorism. Compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting
    laws and regulations of various countries is burdensome and



expensive. See Note 19, “Reporting Segments and
    Related Information” to Consolidated Financial Statements
    in the Company’s Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

regarding the size of our international operations.

We may not
    realize sales represented by awarded business.

We base our growth projections, in part, on commitments made by
    our customers. These commitments generally renew yearly during a
    program life cycle. If actual production orders from our
    customers do not approximate such commitments, it could
    adversely affect our business.

We are
    impacted by the rising cost of providing pension and other post
    employment benefits.

The automotive industry, like other industries, continues to be
    impacted by the rising cost of providing pension and other post
    employment benefits. To partially address this impact, we
    continue to make adjustments to certain retiree medical and
    pension plans. See Note 11, “Retirement Benefit
    Plans” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the
    Company’s Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Certain
    defined benefit pension plans we sponsor are currently
    underfunded.

We sponsor certain defined benefit pension plans worldwide that
    are underfunded and will require cash payments. Additionally, if
    the performance of the assets in our pension plans does not meet
    our expectations, or if other actuarial assumptions are
    modified, our required contributions may be higher than we
    expect. See Note 11, “Retirement Benefit Plans”
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company’s
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Negative or
    unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our
    business.

Adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial
    outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to
    changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets
    and other tax accruals that could adversely affect our financial
    performance.

Additionally, we are subject to tax audits by governmental
    authorities in the U.S. and numerous

non-U.S. jurisdictions.

Because the results of tax audits are inherently uncertain,
    negative or unexpected results from one or more such tax audits
    could adversely affect our business.

We rely on
    sales to major customers.

We rely on sales to original equipment manufacturers around the
    world. Supply to several of these customers requires significant
    investment by the Company in working capital, plant and
    equipment. Some of our customers are rated by the credit rating
    agencies as below investment grade. The loss of sales to a major
    customer, due to any of a variety of factors including
    non-renewal of purchase orders, the customer’s financial
    hardship or other unforeseen reasons, could adversely affect our
    business.

Furthermore, some of our sales are concentrated. Our worldwide
    sales in 2009 to Volkswagen and Ford constituted approximately
    22% and 12%, respectively, of our 2009 consolidated sales.

Suppliers’
    economic distress could result in the disruption of our
    operations and have a material effect on our
    business.

Unfavorable industry conditions such as lower production
    volumes; credit tightness; changes in foreign currencies; raw
    material, commodity, transportation, and energy price
    escalation; drastic changes in consumer preferences; and others
    could adversely affect our supply chain, and sometimes with
    little advanced notice. These conditions could also result in
    increased commercial disputes and supply interruption risks. In
    certain instances, it would be difficult and expensive for us to
    change suppliers that are critical to our business. On occasion,
    we must provide financial support to distressed suppliers or
    take other measures to protect our supply lines. While we have
    taken definite actions to mitigate these factors, we can not
    predict with certainty the potential adverse effects these costs
    might have on our business.



We continue to
    face highly volatile commodity costs used in the production of
    our products.

The Company uses a variety of commodities (including steel,
    nickel, copper, aluminum, plastic resins, other raw materials
    and energy) and materials purchased in various forms such as
    castings, powder metal, forgings, stampings, and bar stock.
    Increasing commodity costs will have an impact on our results.
    We have sought to alleviate the impact of increasing costs by
    including a material pass-through provision in our customer
    contracts wherever possible or by selectively hedging certain
    commodity exposures. Customers frequently challenge these
    contractual provisions and rarely pay the full cost of any
    materials increases. The discontinuation of being able to
    pass-through or hedge increasing commodity costs would adversely
    affect our business.

From time to time, commodity prices may also fall rapidly. When
    this happens, suppliers may withdraw capacity from the market
    until prices improve which may cause periodic supply
    interruptions. The same may be true of our transportation
    carriers and energy providers.

We could be
    adversely affected by supply shortages of components from our
    suppliers.

In an effort to manage and reduce the cost of purchased goods
    and services, we have been rationalizing our supply base. As a
    result, we are dependent on fewer sources of supply for certain
    components used in the manufacture of our products. The Company
    selects suppliers based on total value (including total landed
    price, quality, delivery, and technology), taking into
    consideration their production capacities and financial
    condition. We expect that they will deliver to our stated
    written expectations.

However, there can be no assurance that capacity limitations,
    labor unrest, weather emergencies, commercial disputes,
    government actions, riots, wars, sabotage, non-conforming parts,
    acts of terrorism, “Acts of God”, or other problems
    experienced by our suppliers will not result in occasional
    shortages or delays in their supply of components to us. If we
    were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of
    critical components from any of our suppliers and could not
    procure the components from other sources, we would be unable to
    meet the production schedules for some of our key products and
    could miss customer delivery expectations. This would adversely
    affect our customer relations and business.

A downgrade in
    the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the
    debt capital markets.

Changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt
    may ultimately impact our access to the debt capital markets and
    the costs we incur to borrow funds. If ratings for our debt fall
    below investment grade, our access to the debt capital markets
    would become restricted.

Additionally, our revolving credit agreement includes an
    increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are
    downgraded. Further, an increase in the level of our
    indebtedness and related interest costs may increase our
    vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry
    conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional
    financing.

Conditions in
    the automotive industry may adversely affect our
    business.

Our financial performance depends on conditions in the global
    automotive industry. Original equipment manufactures have
    experienced difficulties from a weakened economy and tightened
    credit markets. If our customers reduce their orders to us, it
    would adversely affect our results of operations. A prolonged
    downturn in the automotive industry or a significant product mix
    shift due to consumer demand could require us to shut down
    plants or incur impairment charges. Continued uncertainty
    relating to the financial condition of automakers would have a
    negative impact on our business.

We are subject
    to possible insolvency of financial
    counterparties.

The Company engages in numerous financial transactions and
    contracts including insurance policies, letters of credit,
    credit line agreements, financial derivatives, and investment
    management agreements involving various counterparties. The
    Company is subject to the risk that one or more of these
    counterparties may become insolvent and therefore be unable to
    discharge its obligations under such contracts.



We are subject
    to possible insolvency of outsourced service
    providers.

The Company relies on third party service providers for
    administration of workers’ compensation claims, health care
    benefits, pension benefits, stockholder and bondholder
    registration and similar services. These service providers
    contribute to the efficient conduct of the Company’s
    business, so the Company could be adversely affected in the
    event of insolvency of one or more of these service providers.

A variety of
    other factors could adversely affect our business.

Any of the following could materially and adversely affect our
    business: the loss of or changes in supply contracts or sourcing
    strategies of our major customers or suppliers;
    start — up expenses associated with new vehicle
    programs or delays or cancellation of such programs,
    underutilization of our manufacturing facilities, which can be
    dependent on a single product line or customer; inability to
    recover engineering and tooling costs; market and financial
    consequences of recalls that may be required on products we
    supplied; delays or difficulties in new product development; the
    possible introduction of similar or superior technologies by
    others; and global excess capacity and vehicle platform
    proliferation.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

The Company is subject to a number of claims and judicial and
    administrative proceedings (some of which involve substantial
    amounts) arising out of the Company’s business or relating
    to matters for which the Company may have a contractual
    indemnity obligation. Refer to Note 14,
    “Contingencies” of the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for a
    discussion of environmental, asbestos and other litigation.

In January 2006, BorgWarner Diversified Transmission Products
    Inc (“DTP”), a subsidiary of the Company, filed a
    declaratory judgment action in United States District Court,
    Southern District of Indiana



(Indianapolis Division) against the United Automobile,
    Aerospace, and Agricultural Implements Workers of America
    (“UAW”) Local No. 287 and Gerald Poor,
    individually and as the representative of a defendant class. DTP
    sought the Court’s affirmation that DTP did not violate the
    Labor-Management Relations Act or the Employee Retirement Income
    Security Act by unilaterally amending certain medical plans
    effective April 1, 2006 and October 1, 2006, prior to
    the expiration of the then-current collective bargaining
    agreements. On September 10, 2008, the Court found that
    DTP’s reservation of the right to make such amendments
    reducing the level of benefits provided to retirees was limited
    by its collectively bargained health insurance agreement with
    the UAW, which did not expire until April 24, 2009. Thus,
    the amendments were untimely. In 2008 the Company recorded a
    charge of $4.0 million as a result of the Court’s
    decision.

DTP filed a declaratory judgment action in the United States
    District Court, Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis
    Division) against the UAW Local No. 287 and Jim Barrett and
    others, individually and as representatives of a defendant
    class, on February 26, 2009 again seeking the Court’s
    affirmation that DTP will not violate the Labor —
    Management Relations Act or the Employment Retirement Income
    Security Act (ERISA) by modifying the level of benefits provided
    retirees to make them comparable to other Company retiree
    benefit plans after April 24, 2009. Certain retirees, on
    behalf of themselves and others, filed a mirror-image action in
    the United States District Court, Eastern District of Michigan
    (Southern Division) on March 11, 2009, for which a class
    has been certified. During the last quarter of 2009 the action
    pending in Indiana was dismissed, while the action in Michigan
    is continuing. At this stage of the litigation, the Company
    cannot make any predictions as to the outcome, but it is
    vigorously defending against the suit.

The Company had a loss for the year ended December 31,

    loss per share in the period, as any dilutive securities would
    reduce the loss per share.

On November 14, 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors
    approved a two-for-one stock split effected in the form of a
    stock dividend on its common stock. To implement this stock
    split, shares of common stock were issued on December 17,
    2007 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on
    December 6, 2007. All prior year share and per share
    amounts disclosed in this document have been restated to reflect
    the two-for-one stock split.

    manufacturers (“OEMs”) of light vehicles (i.e.
    passenger cars, sport-utility vehicles (“SUVs”),
    cross-over vehicles, vans and light trucks). Our products are
    also manufactured and sold to OEMs of commercial trucks, buses
    and agricultural and off-highway vehicles. We also manufacture
    for and sell our products to certain Tier One vehicle
    systems suppliers and into the aftermarket for light and
    commercial vehicles. We operate manufacturing facilities serving
    customers in the Americas, Europe and Asia, and are an original
    equipment supplier to every major automaker in the world.

A summary of major factors impacting the Company’s net
    earnings for the year ended December 31, 2009 in comparison
    to 2008 and 2007 is as follows:

•

Global financial market and economic crisis in the second half
    of 2008 and full year of 2009 significantly impacted consumer
    demand for light vehicles and negatively impacted our sales.

•

Continued benefits from our cost reduction programs, including
    containment of raw material and energy cost increases, and
    health care cost inflation in 2009, 2008, and 2007.

•

Restructuring expenses in the third and fourth quarters of 2008
    and second quarter of 2009 to adjust headcount and capacity
    levels, in North America, Europe and Asia.

•

$27.9 million net pre-tax gain in 2009 related to retiree
    obligations resulting from the closure of the Muncie, Indiana,
    Drivetrain facility.

•

$4.8 million charge in 2009 upon the adoption of ASC Topic
    805, Business Combinations (formerly referred to as
    FAS 141(R)).

•

$3.0 million net loss in 2009 from interest rate derivative

Data provided by CSM Worldwide.

Our net sales decrease in 2009 of 24.7% was worse than the
    estimated worldwide market production decrease of 13.7%. This is
    due to the Company’s relative higher percentage of business
    in Europe and North America versus Asia; and certain
    product mix changes due to scrappage incentives. Our net sales
    decrease in 2008 of 1.2% was slightly better than the estimated
    worldwide market production decrease of 3.7%. The effect of
    changing currency rates had a negative impact on the
    Company’s net sales and net earnings in 2009, but had a
    positive impact on the Company’s net sales and net earnings
    in 2008. The effect of

non-U.S. currencies,

primarily the Euro, decreased net sales by approximately
    $169 million and decreased the Company’s net earnings
    by approximately $4 million in 2009. In 2008,

non-U.S. currencies,

primarily the Euro, increased net sales by approximately
    $191 million and reduced the Company’s net loss by
    approximately $13 million. The year over year decrease in
    net sales, excluding the unfavorable impact of currency, was
    21.5% in 2009. The year over year decrease in net sales,
    excluding the favorable impact of currency, was 4.8% in 2008.



Consolidated net sales to a single customer (including their
    subsidiaries), which exceeded 10% of our total sales, were to
    Volkswagen of approximately 22%, 19%, and 15%; and to Ford of
    approximately 12%, 9%, and 12% for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Both of our
    reporting segments had significant sales to the customers listed
    above. Such sales consisted of a variety of products to a
    variety of customer locations and regions. No other single
    customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated sales in
    any year of the periods presented.

Outlook

The Company is cautiously optimistic about 2010. The Company
    expects global production volumes to be higher in 2010 compared
    with 2009. However, visibility is limited in Europe due to
    uncertainty surrounding consumer demand, the impact of expiring
    government-sponsored incentive programs and other market
    dynamics.

The Company maintains a positive long-term outlook for its
    global business and is committed to new product development and
    strategic capital investments to enhance its product leadership
    strategy. The trends that are driving our long-term growth are
    expected to continue, including the growth of direct injection
    diesel and gasoline engines worldwide, the increased adoption of
    automated transmissions in Europe and Asia-Pacific, and the move
    to variable cam and chain engine timing systems in both Europe
    and Asia-Pacific. As the recovery from current global economic
    conditions occurs, we expect long-term sales and net earnings
    growth to resume to historical rates.

Results By
    Reporting Segment

The Company’s business is comprised of two reporting
    segments: Engine and Drivetrain. These reporting segments are
    strategic business groups, which are managed separately as each
    represents a specific grouping of related automotive components
    and systems.

The Company allocates resources to each segment based upon the
    projected after-tax return on invested capital
    (“ROIC”) of its business initiatives. The ROIC is
    comprised of projected earnings before interest, income taxes
    and noncontrolling interest (“EBIT”) adjusted for
    taxes compared to the projected average capital investment
    required.

EBIT is considered a “non-GAAP financial measure.”
    Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure
    of a company’s financial performance, financial position or
    cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included
    in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure
    calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. EBIT is
    defined as earnings before restructuring expense, goodwill
    impairment charge, interest, income taxes and noncontrolling
    interest. “Earnings” is intended to mean net earnings
    as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations under
    GAAP.

The Company believes that EBIT is useful to demonstrate the
    operational profitability of its segments by excluding
    restructuring expense, goodwill impairment charge, interest,
    income taxes and noncontrolling interest, which are generally
    accounted for across the entire Company on a consolidated basis.
    EBIT is also one of the measures used by the Company to
    determine resource allocation within the Company. Although the
    Company believes that EBIT enhances understanding of its
    business and performance, it should not be considered an
    alternative to, or more meaningful than, net earnings or cash
    flows from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP.

The

Engine

segment 2009 net sales were down 25.3%
    from 2008, with a 44.3% decrease in Segment EBIT over the same
    period. The Engine segment decrease was primarily driven by
    reduced global vehicle production and depressed demand for
    engine products. The Segment EBIT margin was 7.6% in 2009, down
    from 10.2% in 2008, due to the significant reduction in customer
    production schedules in the U.S. and European markets.

The Engine segment 2008 net sales were up 2.7% from 2007,
    with a 5.5% decrease in Segment EBIT over the same period. The
    Engine segment continued to benefit from Asian automaker demand
    for turbochargers and timing systems, European automaker demand
    for turbochargers, timing systems, exhaust gas recirculation
    (“EGR”) valves and diesel engine ignition systems.
    This benefit was offset by lower North American production of
    light truck and sport-utility vehicles. The Segment EBIT margin
    was 10.2% in 2008, down from 11.1% in 2007 (which includes the
    one-time write-off in 2008 of the excess purchase price
    allocated to BERU’s IPR&D, order backlog and
    inventory), due to the significant reduction in customer
    production schedules in the U.S. and European markets, and
    increased costs for raw materials, principally steel.



The

Drivetrain

segment 2009 net sales decreased
    23.3% from 2008 with a 175.5% decrease in Segment EBIT over the
    same period. The group was negatively impacted by lower global
    production of light trucks and SUVs equipped with its torque
    transfer products and lower sales of its traditional
    transmission products. Segment EBIT margin was (1.2)% in 2009,
    down from (0.3)% in the prior year, primarily due to lower
    global production of light trucks and sport-utility vehicles
    equipped with its torque transfer products.

The Drivetrain segment 2008 net sales decreased 10.8% from
    2007 with a 104.1% decrease in Segment EBIT over the same
    period. The group was negatively impacted by lower
    U.S. production of light trucks and SUVs equipped with its
    torque transfer products and lower sales of its traditional
    transmission products. Segment EBIT margin was (0.3)% in 2008,
    down from 7.4% in the prior year, due to the combined effect of
    DCT product

start-up

cost pressures and lower North American production of light
    trucks and sport-utility vehicles equipped with its torque
    transfer products.

Corporate

is the difference between calculated total
    consolidated EBIT and the total of the Segments’ EBIT. It
    represents corporate headquarters’ expenses, expenses not
    directly attributable to the individual segments, expenses
    associated with divested operations and equity in
    affiliates’ earnings. This net expense was
    $111.3 million in 2009, $60.0 million in 2008 and
    $77.7 million in 2007. The increase in Corporate expenses
    in 2009 is primarily related to a decline in affiliate earnings,
    an increase in pension and other postemployment expenses and an
    increase in performance related compensation.

Gross profit

as a percentage of net sales was 14.2%,
    15.9% and 17.8% in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our gross
    profit decrease in 2009 was due to sales volumes declining
    faster than our ability to reduce our cost structure. Cost
    reduction actions taken in 2009 to reduce our cost structure
    included headcount reductions, global pay cuts, selected plant
    shutdowns and reduced work weeks outside of the U.S.

Selling, general and administrative

expenses
    (“SG&A”) as a percentage of net sales were 11.6%,
    10.3% and 10.0% in 2009, 2008 and 2007 respectively. 2009
    SG&A expenses decreased $83.1 million or 15.3%
    compared to 2008. The 2009 increase in SG&A as a percentage
    of net sales was primarily due to a



significant year over year reduction in sales with increased
    pension and other postemployment expenses and performance
    related compensation, net of salary wage reductions.

Research and development (“R&D”) is a major
    component of our SG&A expenses. R&D spending, net of
    customer reimbursements, was $155.2 million or 3.9% of
    sales in 2009, compared to $205.7 million, or 3.9% of sales
    in 2008, and $210.8 million, or 4.0% of sales in 2007. We
    currently intend to continue to increase our spending in
    R&D, although the growth rate in the future may not
    necessarily match the rate of our sales growth. We also intend
    to continue to invest in a number of cross-business R&D
    programs, as well as a number of other key programs, all of
    which are necessary for short and long-term growth. Our current
    long-term expectation for R&D spending is approximately
    4.0% of sales. We intend to maintain our commitment to R&D
    spending while continuing to focus on controlling other
    SG&A costs.

Restructuring expense

of $50.3 million in 2009 and
    $127.5 million in 2008 was in response to declines in
    global customer production levels, customer restructurings and a
    subsequent evaluation of our headcount levels in North America,
    Europe and Asia and our long-term capacity needs.

In the second quarter of 2009, the Company took additional
    restructuring actions. The Company reduced its North American
    workforce by approximately 550 people, or 12%; its European
    workforce by approximately 150 people, or 2%; and its Asian
    workforce by approximately 60 people, or 3% in the second
    quarter. The net restructuring expense recognized in the second
    quarter was $9.0 million for employee termination benefits.
    In addition to employee termination costs, the Company recorded
    $36.3 million of asset impairment and $5.0 million of
    other charges in the second quarter of 2009 related to the North
    American and European restructuring. The combined 2009
    restructuring expenses of $50.3 million are broken out by
    segment as follows: Engine $27.2 million, Drivetrain
    $19.7 million and Corporate $3.4 million.

Included in the second quarter of 2009 asset impairment charge
    is $22.3 million related to one of the Company’s
    European locations. During the second quarter of 2009
    circumstances caused the Company to evaluate the long range
    outlook of the facility using an undiscounted and discounted
    cash flow model, both of which indicated that assets were
    impaired. The Company then used a replacement cost technique to
    determine the fair value of the assets at the facility. This
    reduction of asset value was included in the Engine segment.

On July 31, 2008, the Company announced a restructuring of
    its operations to align ongoing operations with a continuing,
    fundamental market shift in the auto industry. As a continuation
    of the Company’s third quarter restructuring, on
    December 11, 2008, the Company announced plans for
    additional restructuring actions. As a result of these third and
    fourth quarter 2008 restructuring actions, the Company had
    reduced its North American workforce by approximately
    2,400 people, or 33%; its European workforce by
    approximately 1,600 people, or 18%; and its Asian workforce
    by approximately 400 people, or 17%. The restructuring
    expense recognized for employee termination benefits was
    $54.6 million. In addition to employee termination costs,
    the Company recorded $72.9 million of asset impairment
    charges related to the North American and European
    restructuring. The combined restructuring expenses of
    $127.5 million are broken out by segment as follows: Engine
    $85.3 million, Drivetrain $40.9 million and Corporate
    $1.3 million.

Refer to Note 17, “Restructuring” of the Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this
    report for further discussion.

Equity in affiliates’ earnings, net of tax

was
    $21.8 million, $38.4 million and $40.3 million in
    2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. This line item is primarily
    driven by the results of our 50% owned Japanese joint venture,
    NSK-Warner, and our 32.6% owned Indian joint venture, Turbo
    Energy Limited (“TEL”). The significant reduction to
    equity in affiliates’ earnings in 2009 is primarily due to
    lower vehicle production in Asia. For more discussion of
    NSK-Warner, see Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Interest expense and finance charges

were
    $57.2 million, $38.8 million and $34.7 million in
    2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in 2009 expense
    over 2008 was primarily due to increased debt levels, resulting
    from the Company’s $373.8 million convertible debt
    offering, which provided the Company increased liquidity. The
    increase in 2008 expense over 2007 expense was primarily due to
    costs related to acquiring 100% of BERU.



The provision for income taxes

The provision for income
    taxes resulted in an effective tax rate for 2009 of (103.4%)
    compared with rates of 237.9% in 2008 and 26.5% in 2007. The
    effective tax rate of (103.4%) for 2009 differs from the
    U.S. statutory rate primarily due to a reduction in
    U.S. income; foreign rates, which differ from those in the
    U.S.; the realization of certain business tax credits including
    R&D and U.S. based foreign tax credits; and favorable
    permanent differences between book and tax treatment for items,
    including equity in affiliates’ earnings.

Noncontrolling interest, net of tax

of $9.4 million
    decreased by $6.9 million from 2008 and by
    $18.6 million from 2007. The decrease is primarily related
    to the Company’s increased ownership to 100% of BERU.

The currency translation component of other comprehensive income
    increased in 2009 primarily due to the strengthening of the
    Euro, Korean Won and British Pound in relation to the
    U.S. Dollar.

Operating
    Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was
    $351.0 million, $400.8 million and $603.5 million
    in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The $49.8 million
    decrease in 2009 from 2008 was primarily due to lower
    operational earnings, somewhat offset by lower working capital
    needs. The $202.7 million decrease in 2008 from 2007 was
    primarily due to lower earnings and increased working capital.
    The $351.0 million of net cash provided by operating
    activities in 2009 consists of net earnings of
    $36.4 million, increased for non-cash



charges of $297.6 million and a $17.0 million increase
    in net operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges are
    primarily comprised of $260.9 million in depreciation and
    amortization.

Inventory decreased in 2009 by $143.0 million excluding the
    impact of currency due to lower business levels, particularly in
    North America and Europe.

Investing
    Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $154.8 million,
    $343.9 million and $229.2 million in 2009, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. Capital expenditures, including tooling
    outlays (“capital spending”) of $172.0 million in
    2009, or 4.3% of sales and decreased $197.7 million over
    the 2008 level of $369.7 million, or 7.0% of sales.
    Selective capital spending remains an area of focus for us, both
    in order to support our book of new business and for cost
    reduction and other purposes. Heading into 2010, we plan to
    continue to spend capital to support the launch of our new
    applications and for cost reductions and productivity
    improvement projects.

Financing
    Activities and Liquidity

Liquidity:

The Company had $357.4 million of cash on
    hand at December 31, 2009. The Company has a multi-currency
    revolving credit facility, which provides for borrowings up to
    $250 million through January 22, 2011. The facility is
    secured by unperfected pledges of the Company’s equity
    interests in its subsidiaries and certain assets. No secured
    party is entitled to perfect its lien on any of the collateral
    until the long term unsecured senior, non-credit enhanced debt
    rating of the Company is rated less than or equal to BB+ by
    Standard & Poor’s and less than or equal to Ba1
    by Moody’s. The three key covenants of the credit agreement
    are a net worth test, a debt compared to EBITDA (“Earnings
    Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization”)
    test, and an interest coverage test. The Company was in
    compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2009 and
    expects to be compliant in future periods. At December 31,
    2009 and 2008 there were no outstanding borrowings under the
    facility. In addition to the credit facility, as of
    December 31, 2009, the Company had approximately
    $376 million available under a universal shelf registration
    statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission
    under which a variety of debt and equity instruments could be
    issued. From a credit quality perspective, the Company has a
    credit rating of BBB from Standard & Poor’s and
    Ba1 from Moody’s. On March 18, 2009, Moody’s
    downgraded the Company’s credit rating from Baa3 to Ba1.
    The current outlook from Standard & Poor’s and
    Moody’s is negative. None of the Company’s debt
    agreements require accelerated repayment in the event of a
    decrease in credit ratings.

On April 24, 2009 the Company’s $50 million
    accounts receivable securitization facility matured and was
    repaid. On December 21, 2009 the Company entered into a new
    $50 million accounts receivable securitization facility.
    This facility matures on December 21, 2012, subject to
    extension or replacement of the revolving credit facility by
    January 2011. Both the maturity and repayment; as well as the
    subsequent renewal of our accounts receivable securitization
    facility are reflected as Financing activities in the
    Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

We believe that the combination of cash from operations, cash
    balances, available credit facilities, and the remaining shelf
    registration capacity will be sufficient to satisfy our cash
    needs for our current level of operations and our planned
    operations for the foreseeable future. We will continue to
    balance our needs for internal growth, external growth, debt
    reduction and cash conservation.

Financing Activities:

Net debt increases, excluding the
    impact of currency translation, were $102.4 million and
    $107.5 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively. Net debt
    decreases were $101.7 million in 2007 excluding the impact
    of currency translation. Proceeds from stock options exercised,
    net of tax benefit were $8.7 million, $17.1 million
    and $46.3 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
    Company paid dividends to BorgWarner stockholders of
    $13.8 million, $51.1 million and $39.4 million in
    2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company had treasury
    stock purchases of $55.9 million and $47.0 million in
    2008 and 2007, respectively.



The Company purchased approximately 0.4 million,
    1.34 million and 1.28 million BERU shares in 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. The cost for these shares was
    $46.6 million, $136.8 million and $138.8 million
    for 2009, 2008 and 2007 respectively and has been reflected as
    “payments for noncontrolling interest acquired” in the
    Financing section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
    See Note 18, “Recent Transactions” for further
    information.

Off Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

On April 24, 2009 the Company’s $50 million
    accounts receivable securitization facility matured and was
    repaid. On December 21, 2009 the Company entered into a new
    $50 million accounts receivable securitization facility.
    This facility matures on December 21, 2012, subject to
    extension or replacement of the revolving credit facility by
    January 2011. Both the maturity and repayment; as well as the
    subsequent renewal of our accounts receivable securitization
    facility are reflected as Financing activities in the
    Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

The Company is required to adopt Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 166, Accounting for Transfer of
    Financial Assets — an amendment of ASC Topic 860
    (“FAS 166”) and Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 167, Amendments to ASC Topic 810
    (“FAS 167”) on January 1, 2010. This
    adoption requires the Company to reflect its receivable
    securitization facility in its financial statements. Accounting
    rules prior to January 1, 2010 allowed off-balance sheet
    treatment. The first quarter 2010 impact of this adoption is
    expected to be an increase in receivables of $50 million
    and an increase in debt of $50 million in the
    Company’s December 31, 2009 and March 31, 2010
    Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company has certain leases that are recorded as operating
    leases. Types of operating leases include leases on the
    headquarters facility, an airplane, vehicles, and certain office
    equipment. The Company also has a lease obligation for
    production equipment at one of its facilities. The total
    expected future cash outlays for all lease obligations at the
    end of 2009 is $62.0 million. See Note 15 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on
    operating leases, including future minimum payments.

The Company has guaranteed the residual values of certain leased
    machinery and equipment at its facilities. The guarantees extend
    through the maturity of the underlying lease, which is in
    September 2010. In the event the Company exercises its option
    not to purchase the remaining machinery and equipment, the
    Company has guaranteed a residual value of $6.0 million at
    September 30, 2010.

Pension and
    Other Post Employment Benefits

The Company’s policy is to fund its defined benefit pension
    plans in accordance with applicable government regulations and
    to make additional contributions when appropriate. At
    December 31, 2009, all legal funding requirements had been
    met. The Company contributed $39.3 million to its defined
    benefit pension plans in 2009 and $13.3 million in 2008. The
    Company expects to contribute a total of $10 million to
    $20 million in 2010.

The funded status of all pension plans was a net unfunded
    position of $(229.9) million and $(253.5) million at
    the end of 2009 and 2008, respectively. Of these amounts,
    $(131.1) million and $(110.9) at the end of 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, were related to plans in Germany, where there is
    not a tax deduction allowed under the applicable regulations to
    fund the plans; hence the common practice is that they are
    unfunded plans.

Other post employment benefits primarily consist of post
    employment health care benefits for certain employees and
    retirees of the Company’s U.S. operations. The Company
    funds these benefits as retiree claims are incurred. Other post
    employment benefits had an unfunded status of
    $(278.5) million at the end of 2009 and
    $(328.5) million at the end of 2008. The unfunded levels
    decreased due to the closure of the Company’s Muncie,
    Indiana automotive components plant and changes in certain plan
    designs.

The Company believes it will be able to fund the requirements of
    these plans through cash generated from operations or other
    available sources of financing for the foreseeable future.



See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee
    retirement benefits.

OTHER
    MATTERS

Contingencies

In the normal course of business the Company and its
    subsidiaries are parties to various commercial and legal claims,
    actions and complaints, including matters involving warranty
    claims, intellectual property claims, general liability and
    various other risks. See Notes 7 and 14 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements. It is not possible to predict with
    certainty whether or not the Company and its subsidiaries will
    ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal
    matters or, if not, what the impact might be. The Company’s
    environmental and product liability contingencies are discussed
    separately below. The Company’s management does not expect
    that the results in any of these commercial and legal claims,
    actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect on
    the Company’s results of operations, financial position or
    cash flows.

Litigation
    Outcome

In January 2006, DTP, a subsidiary of the Company, filed a
    declaratory judgment action in United States District Court,
    Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis Division) against the
    United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implements
    Workers of America (“UAW”) Local No. 287 and
    Gerald Poor, individually and as the representative of a
    defendant class. DTP sought the Court’s affirmation that
    DTP did not violate the Labor-Management Relations Act or the
    Employee Retirement Income Security Act by unilaterally amending
    certain medical plans effective April 1, 2006 and
    October 1, 2006, prior to the expiration of the
    then-current collective bargaining agreements. On
    September 10, 2008, the Court found that DTP’s
    reservation of the right to make such amendments reducing the
    level of benefits provided to retirees was limited by its
    collectively bargained health insurance agreement with the UAW,
    which did not expire until April 24, 2009. Thus, the
    amendments were untimely. In 2008 the Company recorded a charge
    of $4.0 million as a result of the Court’s decision.

DTP filed a declaratory judgment action in the United States
    District Court, Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis
    Division) against the UAW Local No. 287 and Jim Barrett and
    others, individually and as representatives of a defendant
    class, on February 26, 2009 again seeking the Court’s
    affirmation that DTP will not violate the Labor —
    Management Relations Act or the Employment Retirement Income
    Security Act (ERISA) by modifying the level of benefits provided
    retirees to make them comparable to other Company retiree
    benefit plans after April 24, 2009. Certain retirees, on
    behalf of themselves and others, filed a mirror-image action in
    the United States District Court, Eastern District of Michigan
    (Southern Division) on March 11, 2009, for which a class
    has been certified. During the last quarter of 2009 the action
    pending in Indiana was dismissed, while the action in Michigan
    is continuing. At this stage of the litigation, the Company
    cannot make any predictions as to the outcome, but it is
    vigorously defending against the suit.

Environmental

The Company and certain of its current and former direct and
    indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have
    been identified by the United States Environmental Protection
    Agency and certain state environmental agencies and private
    parties as potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) at
    various hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive
    Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
    (“Superfund”) and equivalent state laws and, as such,
    may presently be liable for the cost of

clean-up

and
    other remedial activities at 35 such sites. Responsibility for

clean-up

and
    other remedial activities at a Superfund site is typically
    shared among PRPs based on an allocation formula.

The Company believes that none of these matters, individually or
    in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its
    results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
    Generally, this is because either the estimates of the maximum
    potential liability at a site are not large or the liability
    will be shared with other PRPs, although no assurance can be
    given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter.



Based on information available to the Company (which in most
    cases includes: an estimate of allocation of liability among
    PRPs; the probability that other PRPs, many of whom are large,
    solvent public companies, will fully pay the cost apportioned to
    them; currently available information from PRPs

and/or

federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of
    contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs;
    remediation alternatives; and estimated legal fees), the Company
    has an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities with a
    balance at December 31, 2009 of $21.0 million. The
    Company has accrued amounts that do not exceed $3.0 million
    related to any individual site except for the Crystal Springs
    site discussed below, and we do not believe that the costs
    related to any of these sites will have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows
    or financial condition. The Company expects to pay out
    substantially all of the amounts accrued for environmental
    liability over the next three to five years.

In connection with the sale of Kuhlman Electric Corporation, the
    Company agreed to indemnify the buyer and Kuhlman Electric for
    certain environmental liabilities, then unknown to the Company,
    relating to certain operations of Kuhlman Electric that pre-date
    the Company’s 1999 acquisition of Kuhlman Electric. During
    2000, Kuhlman Electric notified the Company that it discovered
    potential environmental contamination at its Crystal Springs,
    Mississippi plant while undertaking an expansion of the plant.
    The Company is continuing to work with the Mississippi
    Department of Environmental Quality and Kuhlman Electric to
    investigate and remediate to the extent necessary, historical
    contamination at the plant and surrounding area. Kuhlman
    Electric and others, including the Company, were sued in
    numerous related lawsuits, in which multiple claimants alleged
    personal injury and property damage relating to the alleged
    environmental contamination. In 2005, the Company and other
    defendants entered into settlements that resolved approximately
    99% of those claims and the remainder of them have since been
    dismissed.

In 2007 and 2008, four additional lawsuits were filed against
    Kuhlman Electric and others, including the Company, on behalf of
    approximately 340 plaintiffs, alleging personal injury relating
    to the alleged environmental contamination. At this stage of the
    litigation, the Company cannot make any predictions as to the
    outcome, but it is vigorously defending against the suits.

Conditional
    Asset Retirement Obligations

In March 2005, the FASB issued ASC Topic 410, Accounting for
    Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires the
    Company to recognize legal obligations to perform asset
    retirements in which the timing

and/or

method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may
    or may not be within the control of the entity. Certain
    government regulations require the removal and disposal of
    asbestos from an existing facility at the time the facility
    undergoes major renovations or is demolished. The liability
    exists because the facility will not last forever, but it is
    conditional on future renovations (even if there are no
    immediate plans to remove the materials, which pose no health or
    safety hazard in their current condition). Similarly, government
    regulations require the removal or closure of underground
    storage tanks and above ground storage tanks when their use
    ceases, the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyl transformers
    and capacitors when their use ceases, and the disposal of used
    furnace bricks and liners, and lead-based paint in conjunction
    with facility renovations or demolition. The Company currently
    has 31 manufacturing locations that have been identified as
    containing these items. The fair value to remove and dispose of
    this material has been estimated and recorded at
    $1.3 million as of December 31, 2009 and
    $1.4 million as of December 31, 2008.

Product
    Liability

Like many other industrial companies who have historically
    operated in the U.S., the Company (or parties the Company is
    obligated to indemnify) continues to be named as one of many
    defendants in asbestos-related personal injury actions. We
    believe that the Company’s involvement is limited because,
    in general, these claims relate to a few types of automotive
    friction products that were manufactured many years ago and
    contained encapsulated asbestos. The nature of the fibers, the
    encapsulation and the manner of use lead the Company to believe
    that these products are highly unlikely to cause harm. As of
    December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 the Company
    had approximately 23,000 and 27,000 pending asbestos-related
    product liability claims, respectively. Of the 23,000
    outstanding claims at December 31, 2009, approximately
    12,000 were pending in just three jurisdictions, where
    significant tort and judicial reform activities are underway.



The Company’s policy is to vigorously defend against these
    lawsuits and the Company has been successful in obtaining
    dismissal of many claims without any payment. The Company
    expects that the vast majority of the pending asbestos-related
    product liability claims where it is a defendant (or has an
    obligation to indemnify a defendant) will result in no payment
    being made by the Company or its insurers. In 2009, of the
    approximately 5,300 claims resolved, only 223 (4.2%) resulted in
    any payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the
    Company. In 2008, of the approximately 17,500 claims resolved,
    only 210 (1.2%) resulted in any payment being made to a claimant
    by or on behalf of the Company.

Prior to June 2004, the settlement and defense costs associated
    with all claims were covered by the Company’s primary layer
    insurance coverage, and these carriers administered, defended,
    settled and paid all claims under a funding arrangement. In June
    2004, primary layer insurance carriers notified the Company of
    the alleged exhaustion of their policy limits. This led the
    Company to access the next available layer of insurance
    coverage. Since June 2004, secondary layer insurers have paid
    asbestos-related litigation defense and settlement expenses
    pursuant to a funding arrangement. To date, the Company has paid
    $79.8 million in defense and indemnity in advance of
    insurers’ reimbursement and has received $21.2 million
    in cash from insurers. The net outstanding balance of
    $58.6 million is expected to be fully recovered, of which
    $23.0 million is expected to be recovered in 2010. Timing
    of the recovery is dependent on final resolution of the
    declaratory judgment action referred to below. At
    December 31, 2008, insurers owed $35.9 million in
    association with these claims.

In addition, at December 31, 2009, the Company has
    estimated a liability of $49.9 million for claims asserted,
    but not yet resolved and their related defense costs. The
    Company also has a related asset of $49.9 million to
    recognize the proceeds receivable from the insurance carriers.
    Insurance carrier reimbursement of 100% is expected based on the
    Company’s experience, its insurance contracts and decisions
    received to date in the declaratory judgment action referred to
    below. At December 31, 2008, the comparable value of the
    insurance receivable and accrued liability was
    $34.7 million.

The amounts recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets related
    to the estimated future settlement of existing claims are as
    follows:

The Company cannot reasonably estimate possible losses, if any,
    in excess of those for which it has accrued, because it cannot
    predict how many additional claims may be brought against the
    Company (or parties the Company has an obligation to indemnify)
    in the future, the allegations in such claims, the possible
    outcomes, or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be
    enacted at the State or Federal levels.

A declaratory judgment action was filed in January 2004 in the
    Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois by Continental Casualty
    Company and related companies (“CNA”) against the
    Company and certain of its other historical general liability
    insurers. CNA provided the Company with both primary and
    additional layer insurance, and, in conjunction with other
    insurers, is currently defending and indemnifying the Company in
    its pending asbestos-related product liability claims. The
    lawsuit seeks to determine the extent of insurance coverage
    available to the Company including whether the available limits
    exhaust on a “per occurrence” or an
    “aggregate” basis, and to determine how the applicable
    coverage responsibilities should be apportioned. On
    August 15, 2005, the Court issued an interim order
    regarding the apportionment matter. The interim order has



the effect of making insurers responsible for all defense and
    settlement costs pro rata to

time-on-the-risk,

with the pro-ration method to hold the insured harmless for
    periods of bankrupt or unavailable coverage. Appeals of the
    interim order were denied. However, the issue is reserved for
    appellate review at the end of the action. In addition to the
    primary insurance available for asbestos-related claims, the
    Company has substantial additional layers of insurance available
    for potential future asbestos-related product claims. As such,
    the Company continues to believe that its coverage is sufficient
    to meet foreseeable liabilities.

Although it is impossible to predict the outcome of pending or
    future claims or the impact of tort reform legislation that may
    be enacted at the State or Federal levels, due to the
    encapsulated nature of the products, the Company’s
    experiences in vigorously defending and resolving claims in the
    past, and the Company’s significant insurance coverage with
    solvent carriers as of the date of this filing, management does
    not believe that asbestos-related product liability claims are
    likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity
    with GAAP. In preparing these financial statements, management
    has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts
    included in the financial statements, giving due consideration
    to materiality. Critical accounting policies are those that are
    most important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial
    condition and results of operations. These policies require
    management’s most difficult, subjective or complex
    judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and
    accompanying notes. Management makes estimates and assumptions
    about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain,
    relating to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues,
    expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities. Our most critical accounting policies are discussed
    below.

Revenue
    Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss pass
    to the customer, which is usually upon shipment of product.
    Although the Company may enter into long-term supply agreements
    with its major customers, each shipment of goods is treated as a
    separate sale and the price is not fixed over the life of the
    agreements.

Impairment of
    Long-Lived Assets

In accordance with ASC Topic 360, the Company periodically
    reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets, whether
    held for use or disposal, including other intangible assets,
    when events and circumstances warrant such a review. Such events
    and circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant
    decrease in market volumes, or project life, or a loss of a
    major customer application (i.e., a “triggering
    event”). The Company’s impairment review is performed
    at each manufacturing, assembly, and technical site by local and
    business unit management, using data that is the basis for the
    Company’s annual budget (or forecast on an interim basis)
    and long-range plan (“LRP”). The annual budget and LRP
    include a five year projection of future cash flows based on
    actual new products and customer commitments. If the operating
    site review reflects that a triggering event has occurred, the
    assets identified by the operating location as potentially
    impaired will be reviewed by management. The review will
    determine if a current or future alternative use exists for
    additional customer applications or if redeployment of the
    assets to any of the Company’s other operating sites around
    the world is justified. If a future alternative use can not be
    identified, a test for recoverability is performed at the lowest
    level for which cash flows can be identified. The test compares
    projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value
    of a product line or a specific customer application or asset
    grouping, as applicable. If the undiscounted cash flow test for
    recoverability identifies a possible impairment, management will
    perform a test based on the discounted future cash flows. (The
    discount rate used for impairment testing is the same for both
    long-lived assets and goodwill). If the carrying value of the
    long-lived assets is considered impaired based on the discounted
    future cash flow analysis, an impairment charge is recorded for
    the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived assets
    exceeds their fair value. In certain cases, management will
    consider estimates obtained from third parties as evidence of
    the assets’ fair value, including among other factors, the
    assets’ orderly liquidation value. Management believes that
    the



estimates of future cash flows and fair value assumptions are
    reasonable. However, changes in assumptions with respect to
    future volumes, program project life or future asset use, in
    addition to future cash flows underlying these estimates could
    affect the Company’s fair value evaluations.

Due to the sudden decline in the global automotive markets in
    2008 and 2009, the Company reviewed the carrying value of its
    long-lived assets. As a result of these reviews, the Company
    recognized $36.3 million and $72.9 million in
    impairment of long-lived assets (i.e., plant and equipment) as
    part of restructuring expenses in 2009 and 2008, respectively.
    The 2009 and 2008 impairment charges are broken out by segment
    as follows:

Further declines in the industry could result in additional
    impairment charges on the Company’s remaining property,
    plant and equipment balance of $1,490.3 million and
    amortized intangible assets balance of $111.2 million at
    December 31, 2009.

See Note 17, “Restructuring” and Note 9
    “Fair Value Measurements”, to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for more information regarding the
    Company’s 2009 and 2008 impairment of long-lived assets and
    a discussion of market-based measurements.

Goodwill

The Company annually reviews its goodwill for impairment in the
    fourth quarter of each year for all of its reporting units, or
    more often when events and circumstances warrant such a review.

The Company’s goodwill impairment review utilizes the
    “two-step impairment test” required under ASC Topic
    350, which requires us to make significant assumptions and
    estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows,
    discount rates and growth rates. The basis of our goodwill
    impairment analysis is the Company’s annual budget and
    long-range plan (“LRP”). The annual budget and LRP
    include a five year projection of future cash flows based on
    actual new products and customer commitments. As part of the
    projection, we assumed the last year of the LRP data is a fair
    indication, on average, including fundamental industry growth,
    of the future performance of the business beyond the five year
    period into perpetuity. As the LRP is estimated over a
    significant future period of time, those estimates and
    assumptions are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. We also
    utilize market valuation models and other financial ratios,
    which require us to make certain assumptions and estimates
    regarding the applicability of those models to our assets and
    businesses. We believe that the assumptions and estimates used
    to determine the estimated fair values of each of our business
    units are reasonable. Different assumptions could materially
    affect the estimated fair value. The primary assumptions
    affecting the Company’s December 31, 2009 goodwill
    impairment review are as follows:

•

Discount Rate: The Company used a 10% weighted average cost of
    capital (“WACC”) as the discount rate for future cash
    flows. The WACC is intended to represent an estimate of the
    Company’s weighted average cost of debt and equity. We
    believe this 10% discount rate is representative of a rate of
    return that would be expected by a market participant.

•

Operating Income Margin: The Company utilized historical and
    expected operating income margins, which varied based on the
    projections of each business unit being evaluated.

While the Company believes that these assumptions are
    appropriate, significant changes in these assumptions may
    materially affect the Company’s analysis. The following
    table illustrates the sensitivity to an



increase in our discount rate and decrease in our operating
    income margin assumptions; as it would have reduced the
    Company’s goodwill of $1,061.4 million as of
    December 31, 2009:

Environmental
    Accrual

We work with outside experts to determine a range of potential
    liability for environmental sites. The ranges for each
    individual site are then aggregated into a loss range for the
    total accrued liability. Management’s estimate of the loss
    range for environmental liability, including conditional asset
    retirement obligations, for 2009 is between approximately
    $20 million and $40 million. We record an accrual at
    the most probable amount within the range unless one cannot be
    determined; in which case we record the accrual at the low end
    of the range. At the end of 2009, our total accrued
    environmental liability was $22.3 million, which includes
    our conditional asset retirement obligation under ASC Topic 410
    of $1.3 million.

See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information regarding environmental accrual.

Product
    Warranty

The Company provides warranties on some of its products. The
    warranty terms are typically from one to three years. Provisions
    for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at
    the time products are sold. These estimates are established
    using historical information about the nature, frequency, and
    average cost of warranty claim settlements; as well as product
    manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from
    third parties. Management actively studies trends of warranty
    claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize
    warranty claims. Management believes that the warranty accrual
    is appropriate; however, actual claims incurred could differ
    from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to the
    accrual. Our warranty provision over the last three years, and
    as a percentage of net sales, has trended as follows:

At the end of 2009, our total accrued warranty liability was

    $32.5 million in current liabilities and $29.2 million
    in non-current liabilities on our balance sheet.

See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information regarding product warranty.

Other Loss
    Accruals and Valuation Allowances

The Company has numerous other loss exposures, such as customer
    claims, workers’ compensation claims, litigation, and
    recoverability of assets. Establishing loss accruals or
    valuation allowances for these matters requires the use of
    estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and
    ultimate realization. We



estimate losses under the programs using consistent and
    appropriate methods; however, changes to our assumptions could
    materially affect our recorded accrued liabilities for loss or
    asset valuation allowances.

Pension and Other
    Post Employment Defined Benefits

The Company provides post employment defined benefits to a
    number of its current and former employees. Costs associated
    with post employment defined benefits include pension and post
    employment health care expenses for employees, retirees and
    surviving spouses and dependents.

Using appropriate actuarial methods and assumptions, the
    Company’s defined benefit pension and non-pension
    postretirement employee benefit plans are accounted for in
    accordance with ASC Topic 715. Disability, early retirement and
    other postretirement employee benefits are accounted for in
    accordance with ASC Topic 712.

The determination of the Company’s obligation and expense
    for its pension and other postretirement employee benefits, such
    as retiree health care, is dependent on certain assumptions used
    by actuaries in calculating such amounts. Certain of the more
    important assumptions are described in Note 11
    “Retirement Benefit Plans” to the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements included in Item 8
    “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K

and include the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return
    on plan assets, rates of increase in compensation and health
    care costs, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors.
    The effects of any modification to those assumptions are either
    recognized immediately or amortized over future periods in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States (“GAAP”).

In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from
    assumptions used are accumulated and generally amortized over
    future periods. The primary assumptions affecting the
    Company’s accounting for employee benefits under ASC Topics
    712 and 715 as of December 31, 2009 are as follows:

•

Long-term rate of return on plan assets: The expected long-term
    rate of return is used in the calculation of net periodic
    pension cost. The required use of the expected long-term rate of
    return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are
    greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in
    any given year. Over time, however, the expected long-term rate
    of return on plan assets is designed to approximate actual
    earned long-term returns. The expected long-term rate of return
    for pension assets has been determined based on various inputs.
    These inputs include historical returns for the different asset
    classes held by the Company’s trusts and its asset
    allocation, as well as inputs from internal and external sources
    regarding expected capital market return, inflation and other
    variables. The Company also considers the impact of active
    management of the plans’ invested assets. In determining
    its pension expense for 2009, the Company used long-term rates
    of return on plan assets ranging from 2.25% to 9.50% outside of
    the U.S. and 7.50% in the U.S.

Actual return on U.S. pension assets for 2009, 2008 and
    2007 were 25.3%, (25.7%) and 3.9%, respectively, compared to the
    expected rate of return assumption of 7.50% in 2009 and 8.75%
    for 2008 and 2007.

Actual return on U.K. pension assets for 2009, 2008 and 2007
    were 15.1%, (18.7%) and 6.4%, respectively, compared to the
    expected rate of return assumption of 7.50% in 2009 and 7.25%
    for 2008 and 2007.

•

Discount rate: The discount rate is used to calculate pension
    and postretirement employee benefit obligations
    (“OPEB”). The discount rate assumption is based on a
    constant effective yield from matching projected plan cash flows
    to high quality (Aa) bond yields of corresponding maturities as
    of the measurement date. The Company used discount rates ranging
    from 2.0% to 9.0% to determine its pension and other benefit
    obligations as of December 31, 2009, including weighted
    average discount rates of 5.75% for U.S. pension plans,
    5.43% for

non-U.S. pension

plans, and 5.50% for U.S. other post employment health care
    plans. The U.S. discount rate reflects the fact that our
    U.S. pension plan has been closed for new participants
    since 1989 (1999 for our U.S. health care plan), and with
    the closing of our Muncie facility in 2009, there will be
    negligible service cost going forward.



•

Health care cost trend: For postretirement employee health care
    plan accounting, the Company reviews external data and Company
    specific historical trends for health care cost to determine the
    health care cost trend rate assumptions. In determining the
    projected benefit obligation for postretirement employee health
    care plans as of December 31, 2009, the Company used health
    care cost trend rates of 7.70%, declining to an ultimate trend
    rate of 5% by the year 2019.

While the Company believes that these assumptions are
    appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or
    significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect
    the Company’s pension and other postretirement employee
    benefit obligations and its future expense.

The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in
    certain assumptions for Company sponsored U.S. and

non-U.S. pension

plans on its 2010 pre-tax pension expense:

Income
    Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC
    Topic 740. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
    for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
    between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
    and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating
    loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
    apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
    differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company
    records a valuation allowance that primarily represents foreign
    net operating losses and U.S. based foreign tax credits for
    which utilization is uncertain. Management judgment



is required in determining the Company’s provision for
    income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and the
    valuation allowance recorded against the Company’s net
    deferred tax assets. In calculating the provision for income
    taxes on an interim basis, the Company uses an estimate of the
    annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances
    known at each interim period. In determining the need for a
    valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial
    performance of the operation recording the net deferred tax
    asset is considered along with any other pertinent information.
    Since future financial results may differ from previous
    estimates, periodic adjustments to the Company’s valuation
    allowance may be necessary.

The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. at the
    federal and state level and numerous

non-U.S. jurisdictions.

Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide
    provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and
    liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are
    many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax
    determination is less than certain. Accruals for income tax
    contingencies are provided for in accordance with the
    requirements of ASC Topic 605. The Company’s
    U.S. federal and certain state income tax returns and
    certain

non-U.S. income

tax returns are currently under various stages of audit by
    applicable tax authorities. Although the outcome of ongoing tax
    audits is always uncertain, management believes that it has
    appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns
    and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient
    to pay assessments, if any, which may be proposed by the taxing
    authorities. At December 31, 2009, the Company has recorded
    a liability for its best estimate of the more likely than not
    loss on certain of its tax positions, which is included in other
    non-current liabilities. Nonetheless, the amounts ultimately
    paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing
    authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for
    each year.

See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information regarding income taxes.

New Accounting
    Pronouncements

In June 2006, FASB ASC amended Topic 740,

Income Taxes

.
    The interpretation prescribes a consistent recognition threshold
    and measurement attribute, as well as clear criteria for
    subsequently recognizing, derecognizing and measuring such tax
    positions for financial statement purposes. ASC Topic 740 also
    requires expanded disclosure with respect to the uncertainty in
    income taxes. The Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic
    740 on January 1, 2007. As a result of the implementation
    of ASC Topic 740, the Company recognized a $16.6 million
    reduction to its January 1, 2007 retained earnings balance.

In September 2006, the FASB ASC amended Topic 820,

Fair Value
    Measurements and Disclosures

. ASC Topic 820 defines fair
    value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP
    and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. On
    January 1, 2009, the Company fully adopted as required, ASC
    Topic 820. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for more information regarding the implementation of
    ASC Topic 820.

In February 2007, the FASB ASC amended Topic 825,

Financial
    Instruments

. ASC Topic 825 allows entities to irrevocably
    elect to recognize most financial assets and financial
    liabilities at fair value on an

instrument-by-instrument

basis. The stated objective of ASC Topic 825 is to improve
    financial reporting by giving entities the opportunity to elect
    to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair
    value in order to mitigate earnings volatility caused when
    related assets and liabilities are measured differently. ASC
    Topic 825 was effective for the Company beginning with its
    quarter ending March 31, 2008. The Company chose to not
    make the election to adopt.

In December 2007, the FASB ASC amended Topic 805,

Business
    Combinations

. ASC Topic 805 establishes principles and
    requirements for recognizing identifiable assets acquired,
    liabilities assumed, noncontrolling interest in the acquiree,
    goodwill acquired in the combination or the gain from a bargain
    purchase, and disclosure requirements. Under this revised
    statement, all costs incurred to effect an acquisition are
    recognized separately from the acquisition. Also, restructuring
    costs that are expected but the acquirer is not obligated to
    incur are recognized separately from the acquisition. On
    January 1, 2009, the Company adopted ASC Topic 805. In the
    first quarter of 2009, the Company expensed $4.8 million
    related to on-going acquisition related activity.



In December 2007, the FASB ASC amended Topic 810,

Consolidation

. For consolidated subsidiaries that are
    less than wholly owned, the third party holdings of equity
    interests are referred to as noncontrolling interests. The
    portion of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling
    interests for such subsidiaries is presented as net income
    (loss) applicable to noncontrolling interest on the consolidated
    statement of operation, and the portion of stockholders’
    equity of such subsidiaries is presented as noncontrolling
    interest on the consolidated balance sheet. Effective
    January 1, 2009, the Company adopted ASC Topic 810.

The adoption of ASC Topic 810 did not have a material impact on
    the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or
    cash flows. However, it did impact the presentation and
    disclosure of noncontrolling (minority) interests in our
    consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated
    financial statements. As a result of the retrospective
    presentation and disclosure requirements of ASC Topic 810, the
    Company was required to reflect the change in presentation and
    disclosure for the period ending March 31, 2009 and all
    periods presented in future filings.

    the adoption of ASC Topic 810 is summarized as follows:

In March 2008, the FASB ASC amended Topic 815,

Derivatives
    and Hedging

. ASC Topic 815 requires entities to provide
    enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative
    instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items
    are accounted for under ASC Topic 815 and its related
    interpretations, and how derivative instruments and related
    hedged items affect an entity’s financial position,
    financial performance, and cash flows. On January 1, 2009,
    the Company adopted ASC Topic 815. See Note 10 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding
    the implementation of ASC Topic 815.

In May 2008, the FASB ASC amended Topic 470,

Debt

. Under
    ASC Topic 470, an entity must separately account for the
    liability and equity components of the convertible debt
    instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash
    upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer’s
    interest cost. ASC Topic 470 is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008, and for interim periods
    within those fiscal years, with retrospective application
    required. As a result of our adoption of ASC Topic 470 for
    fiscal 2009 and the Company’s April 9, 2009 issuance
    of $373.8 million convertible senior notes due
    April 15, 2012, we recorded the equity and liability
    components of the notes on our December 31, 2009
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additionally, ASC Topic 470 requires
    us to accrete the discounted carrying value of the convertible
    notes to



their face value over the term of the notes. The Company’s
    interest expense associated with this amortization is based on
    the effective interest rate of the convertible senior notes of
    9.365%. The total interest expense related to the convertible
    notes in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations
    for the year ended December 31, 2009 was
    $22.2 million. The non-cash portion of interest expense for
    the convertible notes for the year ended December 31, 2009
    was $12.7 million. See Note 8 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for more information regarding this
    issuance.

In December 2008, the FASB ASC amended Topic 715,

Compensation — Retirement Benefits

. ASC Topic
    715 requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures about how
    investment allocation decisions are made, the major categories
    of plan assets, the inputs and valuation techniques used to
    measure fair value of plan assets, the effect of fair value
    measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in
    plan assets for the period, and significant concentrations of
    risk within plan assets. See Note 9 and Note 11 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding
    the implementation of ASC Topic 715 on December 31, 2009.

In May 2009, the FASB ASC amended Topic 855,

Subsequent
    Events

. ASC Topic 855 requires entities to disclose the date
    through which subsequent events have been evaluated, as well as
    whether that date is the date the financial statements were
    issued or the date the financial statements were available to be
    issued. The Company adopted ASC Topic 855 in the second quarter
    of 2009 and has evaluated all subsequent events through
    February 11, 2010 (the date the Company’s financial
    statements are issued).

In June 2009, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 166, Accounting for Transfer of Financial
    Assets — an amendment of ASC Topic 860
    (“FAS 166”). FAS 166 removes the concept of
    a qualifying special-purpose entity from ASC Topic 860 and
    removes the exception from applying ASC Topic 810, Consolidation
    of Variable Interest Entities, to qualifying special-purpose
    entities. This Statement modifies the financial-components
    approach used in ASC Topic 860 and limits the circumstances in
    which a financial asset, or portion of a financial asset, should
    be derecognized. Additionally, enhanced disclosures are required
    to provide financial statement users with greater transparency
    about transfers of financial assets and a transferor’s
    continuing involvement with transferred financial assets.
    FAS 166 is effective for the Company beginning with its
    quarter ending March 31, 2010. The first quarter 2010
    impact of this adoption is expected to be an increase in
    receivables of $50 million and an increase in debt of
    $50 million in the Company’s December 31, 2009
    and March 31, 2010 Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In June 2009, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 167, Amendments to ASC Topic 810
    (“FAS 167”). FAS 167 amends ASC Topic 810 to
    require ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the
    primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. Additionally,
    FAS 167 requires enhanced disclosures that will provide
    users of financial statements with more transparent information
    about an enterprise’s involvement in variable interest
    entities. FAS 167 is effective for the Company beginning
    with its quarter ending March 31, 2010. The adoption of
    FAS 167 is not expected to have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

In June 2009, the FASB ASC amended Topic 105,

Generally
    Accepted Accounting Principles

. This ASC Topic instituted a
    major change in the way accounting standards are organized. The
    accounting standards Codification became the single official
    source of authoritative, nongovernmental GAAP. As of
    September 30, 2009 only one level of authoritative GAAP
    exists, other than guidance issued by the Securities and
    Exchange Commission. All other literature is non-authoritative.
    The Company adopted the Codification in the third quarter of
    2009. The adoption of the Codification had no impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

This adoption required all issued authoritative literature to be
    disclosed using Codification Sections. Authoritative literature
    has been referenced within our 2009 report on

Form 10-K

under these new Codification Sections. New standards not yet
    codified have been referenced as issued and will be updated when
    codified.



QUALITATIVE AND
    QUANTITIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company’s primary market risks include fluctuations in
    interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We are also
    affected by changes in the prices of commodities used or
    consumed in our manufacturing operations. Some of our commodity
    purchase price risk is covered by supply agreements with
    customers and suppliers. Other commodity purchase price risk is
    addressed by hedging strategies, which include forward
    contracts. The Company enters into derivative instruments only
    with high credit quality counterparties and diversifies its
    positions across such counterparties in order to reduce its
    exposure to credit losses. We do not engage in any derivative
    instruments for purposes other than hedging specific operating
    risks.

We have established policies and procedures to manage
    sensitivity to interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and
    commodity purchase price risk, which include monitoring the
    level of exposure to each market risk.

Interest Rate
    Risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic
    losses due to adverse changes in interest rates. The Company
    manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to
    fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its
    interest costs. The Company selectively uses interest rate swaps
    to reduce market value risk associated with changes in interest
    rates (fair value hedges). At the end of 2009, the amount of
    debt with fixed interest rates was 62.0% of total debt,
    including the impact of the interest rate swaps. Our earnings
    exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is
    primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt
    instruments that are indexed to floating money market rates. A
    10% increase or decrease in the average cost of our variable
    rate debt would result in a change in pre-tax interest expense
    of approximately $1.5 million in 2009, and
    $2.1 million in 2008.

We also measure interest rate risk by estimating the net amount
    by which the fair value of all of our interest rate sensitive
    assets and liabilities would be impacted by selected
    hypothetical changes in market interest rates. Fair value is
    estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis. Assuming a
    hypothetical instantaneous 10% change in interest rates as of
    December 31, 2009, the net fair value of these instruments
    would increase by approximately $22.0 million if interest
    rates decreased and would decrease by approximately
    $20.0 million if interest rates increased. Our interest
    rate sensitivity analysis assumes a constant shift in interest
    rate yield curves. The model, therefore, does not reflect the
    potential impact of changes in the relationship between
    short-term and long-term interest rates. Interest rate
    sensitivity at December 31, 2008, measured in a similar
    manner, was slightly more than at December 31, 2009.

Foreign Currency
    Exchange Rate Risk

Foreign currency risk is the risk that we will incur economic
    losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates. Currently, our most significant currency exposures relate
    to the British Pound, the Euro, the Hungarian Forint, the
    Japanese Yen, and the South Korean Won. We mitigate our foreign
    currency exchange rate risk principally by establishing local
    production facilities and related supply chain participants in
    the markets we serve, by invoicing customers in the same
    currency as the source of the products and by funding some of
    our investments in foreign markets through local currency loans
    and cross currency swaps. Such

non-U.S. Dollar

debt was $303.1 million as of December 31, 2009 and
    $495.8 million as of December 31, 2008. We also
    monitor our foreign currency exposure in each country and
    implement strategies to respond to changing economic and
    political environments. In addition, the Company periodically
    enters into forward currency contracts in order to reduce
    exposure to exchange rate risk related to transactions
    denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. As
    of December 31, 2009, the Company was holding foreign
    exchange derivatives with positive and negative fair market
    values of $3.8 million and $(17.5) million,
    respectively, of which $3.6 million in gains and
    $(14.5) million in losses mature in less than one year. As
    of December 31, 2009, $0.5 million in gains and
    $(2.3) million in losses did not qualify for deferral.



Commodity Price
    Risk

Commodity price risk is the possibility that we will incur
    economic losses due to adverse changes in the cost of raw
    materials used in the production of our products. Commodity
    forward and option contracts are executed to offset our exposure
    to the potential change in prices mainly for various non-ferrous
    metals and natural gas consumption used in the manufacturing of
    vehicle components. As of December 31, 2009, the Company
    had forward and option commodity contracts with a total notional
    value of $14.8 million. As of December 31, 2009, the
    Company was holding commodity derivatives with positive and
    negative fair market values of $8.4 million and
    $(0.1) million, respectively, all of which mature in less
    than one year.

Disclosure
    Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations may
    contain forward-looking statements as contemplated by the 1995
    Private Securities Litigation Reform Act that are based on
    management’s current expectations, estimates and
    projections. Words such as “outlook”,
    “expects,” “anticipates,”
    “intends,” “plans,” “believes,”
    “estimates,” or variations of such words and similar
    expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking
    statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and

REPORT OF
    MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
    REPORTING

The information in this report is the responsibility of
    management. BorgWarner Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) has in place reporting guidelines and
    policies designed to ensure that the statements and other
    information contained in this report present a fair and accurate
    financial picture of the Company. In fulfilling this management
    responsibility, we make informed judgments and estimates
    conforming with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America.

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been
    audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
    public accounting firm.

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting.

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
    a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
    America. The internal control process includes those policies
    and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
    detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
    dispositions of the assets of the Company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
    that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made
    only in accordance with authorizations of management and
    directors of the Company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Any system of internal control, no matter how well designed, has
    inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined
    to be effective may not prevent or detect misstatements and can
    provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
    statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any
    evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
    risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
    conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
    or procedures may deteriorate.

The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009. In making this assessment, the
    Company’s management used the criteria set forth by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (“COSO”) in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

.

Based on management’s assessment and those criteria, we
    believe that, as of December 31, 2009, the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting is effective.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, has audited the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements and the effectiveness of internal controls
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 as stated
    in their report.

The Company’s Audit Committee, composed entirely of
    directors of the Company who are not employees, meets
    periodically with the Company’s management and independent
    registered public accounting firm to review financial results
    and procedures, internal financial controls and internal and
    external audit plans and recommendations. In carrying out these
    responsibilities, the Audit Committee and the independent
    registered public accounting firm have unrestricted access to
    each other with or without the presence of management
    representatives.

Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of BorgWarner Inc.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as
    of December 31, 2009 and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and
    comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for the year then
    ended present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of BorgWarner Inc. and its subsidiaries at
    December 31, 2009, and the results of their operations and
    their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009 based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting, included in
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to
    express opinions on these financial statements and on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our integrated audit. We conducted our audit in accordance
    with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
    whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
    maintained in all material respects. Our audit of the financial
    statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
    supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
    statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
    provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note 1, the Company has changed the manner
    in which it accounts for noncontrolling interests in 2009.

We also have audited the reclassifications to the 2008 and 2007
    consolidated financial statements to retrospectively apply the
    change in the manner in which the Company accounts for
    noncontrolling interests, as described in Note 1. In our
    opinion, such adjustments are appropriate and have been properly
    applied. We were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any
    procedures to the 2008 and 2007 consolidated financial
    statements of the Company other than with respect to the
    adjustments and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or
    any other form of assurance on the 2008 and 2007 consolidated
    financial statements taken as a whole.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of BorgWarner Inc.

Auburn Hills, Michigan

We have audited, before the effects of the adjustments to
    retrospectively apply the change in accounting discussed in
    Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the
    consolidated balance sheets of BorgWarner Inc. and Consolidated
    Subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31,
    2008, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss), and
    cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007
    (the 2008 and 2007 consolidated financial statements before the
    effects of the adjustments discussed in Note 1 to the
    consolidated financial statements are not presented herein).
    These financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such 2008 and 2007 consolidated financial
    statements, before the effects of the adjustments discussed in
    Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
    BorgWarner Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2008, and the results of their operations and
    their cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2008 and
    2007, in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America.

We were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to
    the adjustments to retrospectively apply the change in
    accounting discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated
    financial statements and, accordingly, we do not express an
    opinion or any other form of assurance about whether such
    retrospective adjustments are appropriate and have been properly
    applied. Those retrospective adjustments were audited by other
    auditors.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed its method of accounting in 2007
    for income taxes as a result of adopting new accounting guidance
    on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INTRODUCTION

BorgWarner Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) is a leading global supplier of highly
    engineered systems and components primarily for powertrain
    applications. These products are manufactured and sold
    worldwide, primarily to original equipment manufacturers of
    passenger cars, sport-utility vehicles, crossover vehicles,
    trucks, commercial transportation products and industrial
    equipment and to certain Tier One vehicle systems
    suppliers. The Company’s products fall into two reporting
    segments: Engine and Drivetrain.

NOTE 1

SUMMARY OF
    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following paragraphs briefly describe the Company’s
    significant accounting policies.

Basis of presentation

We have reclassified certain prior
    year amounts to conform to the presentation of our 2009
    Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Company’s
    presentation of the Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated
    Statements of Operations, Consolidated Statements of
    Stockholders’ Equity and Comprehensive Income (Loss), and
    Reporting Segments and Related Information Note have been
    adjusted to conform with the requirements of Accounting
    Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 810,
    Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements and
    ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. Refer to New Accounting
    Pronouncements for further information regarding these
    reclassifications.

Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements
    in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
    the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires
    management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates
    and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
    at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
    of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
    results could differ from those estimates.

Concentrations of risk

Cash is maintained with several
    financial institutions. Deposits held with banks may exceed the
    amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these
    deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with
    financial institutions of reputable credit and therefore bear
    minimal risk.

The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its suppliers
    and customers and, with the exception of certain financing
    transactions, does not require collateral from its customers.
    The Company’s customers are primarily original equipment
    manufacturers (“OEMs”) of light-vehicles (passenger
    cars, sport-utility vehicles, vans and light-trucks). The
    Company’s products are also sold to other OEMs of
    commercial trucks, buses and agricultural and off-highway
    vehicles. We also manufacture and sell our products to certain
    Tier One vehicle systems suppliers and into the aftermarket
    for light and commercial vehicles.

Some automotive parts suppliers continue to experience commodity
    cost pressures and the effects of industry overcapacity. These
    factors have increased pressure on the industry’s supply
    base, as suppliers cope with higher commodity costs, lower
    production volumes and other challenges. The Company receives
    certain of its raw materials from sole suppliers or a limited
    number of suppliers. The inability of a supplier to fulfill
    supply requirements of the Company could materially affect
    future operating results.

Principles of consolidation

The Consolidated Financial
    Statements include all majority-owned subsidiaries. All
    inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
    consolidation.

Revenue recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when
    title and risk of loss pass to the customer, which is usually
    upon shipment of product. Although the Company may enter into
    long-term supply agreements with its major customers, each
    shipment of goods is treated as a separate sale and the price is
    not fixed over the life of the agreements.

Cash

Cash is valued at fair market value. It is the
    Company’s policy to classify all highly liquid investments
    with original maturities of three months or less as cash.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Accounts receivable

On April 24, 2009 the
    Company’s $50 million accounts receivable
    securitization facility matured and was repaid. On
    December 21, 2009 the Company entered into a new
    $50 million accounts receivable securitization facility.
    This facility matures on December 21, 2012, subject to
    extension or replacement of the revolving credit facility by
    January 2011. Both the maturity and repayment; as well as the
    subsequent renewal of our accounts receivable securitization
    facility are reflected as Financing activities in the
    Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, total
    cash proceeds from sales of accounts receivable were
    $250 million and $600 million, respectively. The
    Company paid servicing fees related to these receivables for the
    year ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 of
    $0.4 million, $1.9 million, and $2.9 million,
    respectively. These amounts are recorded in interest expense and
    finance charges in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost
    or market. Cost of U.S. inventories is determined by the

last-in,

first-out (“LIFO”) method, while the foreign
    operations use the

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) or average-cost methods. Inventory
    held by U.S. operations was $81.2 million and
    $124.1 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. This reduction in inventory caused a liquidation
    of some of the Company’s LIFO layers and required the
    company to record $5.0 million of income in the fourth
    quarter of 2009. Such inventories, if valued at current cost
    instead of LIFO, would have been greater by $11.6 million
    in 2009 and $16.6 million in 2008.

See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information on inventories.

Pre-production costs related to long-term supply arrangements

Engineering, research and development, and other design and
    development costs for products sold on long-term supply
    arrangements are expensed as incurred unless the Company has a
    contractual guarantee for reimbursement from the customer. Costs
    for molds, dies and other tools used to make products sold on
    long-term supply arrangements for which the Company either has
    title to the assets or has the non-cancelable right to use the
    assets during the term of the supply arrangement are capitalized
    in property, plant and equipment. Capitalized items specifically
    designed for a supply arrangement are amortized to cost of sales
    over the shorter of the term of the arrangement or over the
    estimated useful lives of the assets, typically 3 to
    5 years. Carrying values of assets capitalized according to
    the foregoing policy are reviewed for impairment when events and
    circumstances warrant such a review. Costs for molds, dies and
    other tools used to make products sold on long-term supply
    arrangements for which the Company has a contractual guarantee
    for lump sum reimbursement from the customer are capitalized in
    prepayments and other current assets.

Property, plant and equipment and depreciation

Property,
    plant and equipment are valued at cost less accumulated
    depreciation. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and renewals
    of relatively minor items are generally charged to expense as
    incurred. Renewals of significant items are capitalized.
    Depreciation is computed generally on a straight-line basis over
    the estimated useful lives of the assets. Useful lives for
    buildings range from 15 to 40 years and useful lives for
    machinery and equipment range from 3 to 12 years. For
    income tax purposes, accelerated methods of depreciation are
    generally used. The Company’s property, plant and equipment
    are all held for use at December 31, 2009 and 2008.

See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information on property, plant and equipment and
    depreciation.

Impairment of long-lived assets

The Company reviews the
    carrying value of its long-lived assets, whether held for use or
    disposal, including other intangible assets, when events and
    circumstances warrant such a review. This review is performed
    using estimates of future cash flows. If the carrying value of a
    long-lived asset is considered impaired, an impairment charge is
    recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the
    long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. Management believes
    that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value
    assumptions are reasonable; however, changes in assumptions
    underlying these estimates could affect the evaluations.
    Long-lived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of
    their



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Significant
    judgments and estimates used by management when evaluating
    long-lived assets for impairment include: (i) an assessment
    as to whether an adverse event or circumstance has triggered the
    need for an impairment review; and (ii) undiscounted future
    cash flows generated by the asset. The Company recognized
    $36.3 million and $72.9 million in impairment of
    long-lived assets as part of restructuring expenses in 2009 and
    2008, respectively. The 2009 and 2008 impairment charges are
    broken out by segment as follows:

millions of dollars

See Note 17, “Restructuring” and Note 9
    “Fair Value Measurements”, to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for more information regarding the
    Company’s 2009 and 2008 impairment of long-lived assets and
    a discussion of market-based measurements.

Goodwill and other intangible assets

Under ASC Topic 350,
    goodwill is no longer amortized; however, it must be tested for
    impairment at least annually. In the fourth quarter of each
    year, or when events and circumstances warrant such a review,
    the Company reviews the goodwill of all of its reporting units
    for impairment. The fair value of the Company’s businesses
    used in the determination of goodwill impairment is computed
    using the expected present value of associated future cash
    flows. This review requires the Company to make significant
    assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future
    cash flows, discount rates and growth rates. The cash flows are
    estimated over a significant future period of time, which makes
    those estimates and assumptions subject to an even higher degree
    of uncertainty. The Company also utilizes market valuation
    models and other financial ratios, which require the Company to
    make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the
    applicability of those models to its assets and businesses. The
    Company believes that the assumptions and estimates used to
    determine the estimated fair values of each of its reporting
    units are reasonable. However, different assumptions could
    materially affect the estimated fair value. The Company
    recognized goodwill impairment of $156.8 million in the
    Engine segment in 2008. No goodwill impairment was recorded in
    2009 or 2007.

See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information regarding goodwill.

Product warranty

The Company provides warranties on some
    of its products. The warranty terms are typically from one to
    three years. Provisions for estimated expenses related to
    product warranty are made at the time products are sold. These
    estimates are established using historical information about the
    nature, frequency, and average cost of warranty claim
    settlements as well as product manufacturing and industry
    developments and recoveries from third parties. Management
    actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to
    improve product quality and minimize warranty claims. Management
    believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate; however,
    actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates,
    requiring adjustments to the accrual. The accrual is represented
    in both current and non-current liabilities on the balance sheet.

See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information on product warranties.

Other loss accruals and valuation allowances

The Company
    has numerous other loss exposures, such as customer claims,
    workers’ compensation claims, litigation, and
    recoverability of assets. Establishing loss accruals or
    valuation allowances for these matters requires the use of
    estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and
    ultimate realization. The Company estimates losses under the
    programs using consistent and appropriate methods; however,
    changes to its assumptions could materially affect its recorded
    accrued liabilities for loss or asset valuation allowances.

Derivative financial instruments

The Company recognizes
    that certain normal business transactions generate risk.
    Examples of risks include exposure to exchange rate risk related
    to transactions denominated



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

in currencies other than the functional currency, changes in
    cost of major raw materials and supplies, and changes in
    interest rates. It is the objective and responsibility of the
    Company to assess the impact of these transaction risks, and
    offer protection from selected risks through various methods
    including financial derivatives. Virtually all derivative
    instruments held by the Company are designated as hedges, have
    high correlation with the underlying exposure and are highly
    effective in offsetting underlying price movements. Accordingly,
    gains and losses from changes in qualifying hedge fair values
    are matched with the underlying transactions. All hedge
    instruments are carried at their fair value based on quoted
    market prices for contracts with similar maturities. The Company
    does not engage in any derivative transactions for purposes
    other than hedging specific risks.

See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information on derivative financial instruments.

Foreign currency

The financial statements of foreign
    subsidiaries are translated to U.S. Dollars using the
    period-end exchange rate for assets and liabilities and an
    average exchange rate for each period for revenues, expenses,
    and capital expenditures. The local currency is the functional
    currency for substantially all the Company’s foreign
    subsidiaries. Translation adjustments for foreign subsidiaries
    are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss) in stockholders’ equity. The Company
    recognizes transaction gains and losses arising from
    fluctuations in currency exchange rates on transactions
    denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in
    earnings as incurred, except for those transactions which hedge
    purchase commitments and for those intercompany balances which
    are designated as long-term investments.

See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information on other comprehensive income (loss).

Environmental Contingencies

The Company accounts for
    environmental costs in accordance with ASC Topic 450. Costs
    related to environmental assessments and remediation efforts at
    operating facilities are accrued when it is probable that a
    liability has been incurred and the amount of that liability can
    be reasonably estimated. Estimated costs are recorded at
    undiscounted amounts, based on experience and assessments and
    are regularly evaluated. The liabilities are recorded in other
    current liabilities and other long-term liabilities in the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information regarding environmental contingencies.

Pensions and Other Postretirement Employee Defined Benefits

The Company’s defined benefit pension and other
    postretirement employee benefit plans are accounted for in
    accordance with ASC Topic 715. Disability, early retirement and
    other postretirement employee benefits are accounted for in
    accordance with ASC Topic 712.

Pensions and other postretirement employee benefit costs and
    related liabilities and assets are dependent upon assumptions
    used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include
    discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, health care
    cost trends, compensation and other factors. In accordance with
    GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions used are
    accumulated and amortized over future periods, and accordingly,
    generally affect recognized expense in future periods.

See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information regarding the Company’s retirement benefit
    plans.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income tax expense
    based on expected income and statutory tax rates in the various
    jurisdictions in which we operate. Judgment is required in
    determining our income tax expense. We establish accruals under
    ASC Topic 740. For uncertain tax positions, the ASC Topic 740
    approach is based on a two-step benefit recognition model. In
    the first step, ASC Topic 740 requires that a position taken or
    expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized in the
    financial statements



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits
    and without consideration of detection risk, that the position
    will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related
    appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to
    measure the appropriate amount of the benefit to recognize. The
    amount of benefit to recognize is measured as the largest amount
    of the tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely
    to ultimately be realized upon settlement. The tax position must
    be derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not to be
    sustained. The interpretation also provides guidance on
    recognition and classification of related penalties and
    interest, classification of liabilities, and disclosures of
    unrecognized tax benefits. The change in net assets, if any, as
    a result of applying the provisions of this interpretation is
    considered a change in accounting principle with the cumulative
    effect of the change treated as a offsetting adjustment to the
    opening balance of retained earnings in the period of
    transition. The Company adopted ASC Topic 740 as of the
    beginning of its 2007 calendar year.

The Company’s effective tax rate includes the impact of
    accrual provisions and changes to accruals that we consider
    appropriate, as well as interest and penalties. A period of time
    may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have or have
    not established an accrual is audited and finally resolved.
    While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the
    timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe
    that our accruals are appropriate under GAAP. Favorable or
    unfavorable adjustments of an accrual for any particular issue
    would be recognized as an increase or decrease to our income tax
    expense in the period of a change in facts and circumstances.

Tax laws require items to be included in the tax return at
    different times than the items are reflected in the financial
    statements. As a result, the income tax expense reflected in our
    financial statements is different than the liability reported in
    our tax return. Some of the differences are permanent in nature,
    however, there are many differences that are temporary
    differences, such as depreciation expense. Deferred tax assets
    and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
    attributable to differences between financial statement carrying
    amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
    tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
    Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
    tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in
    which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered
    or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce
    deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such
    assets may not be realized. This assessment requires significant
    judgment, and must be done on a

jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction

basis. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, all
    available positive and negative evidence, including historical
    and projected financial performance, is considered along with
    any other pertinent information.

See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information regarding income taxes.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2006, Financial
    Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification
    (“FASB ASC”) amended ASC Topic 740,

Income
    Taxes

. The interpretation prescribes a consistent
    recognition threshold and measurement attribute, as well as
    clear criteria for subsequently recognizing, derecognizing and
    measuring such tax positions for financial statement purposes.
    ASC Topic 740 also requires expanded disclosure with respect to
    the uncertainty in income taxes. The Company adopted the
    provisions of ASC Topic 740 on January 1, 2007. As a result
    of the implementation of ASC Topic 740, the Company recognized a
    $16.6 million reduction to its January 1, 2007
    retained earnings balance.

In September 2006, the FASB ASC amended Topic 820,

Fair Value
    Measurements and Disclosures

. ASC Topic 820 defines fair
    value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP
    and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. On
    January 1, 2009, the Company fully adopted as required, ASC
    Topic 820. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for more information regarding the implementation of
    ASC Topic 820.

In February 2007, the FASB ASC amended Topic 825,

Financial
    Instruments

. ASC Topic 825 allows entities to irrevocably
    elect to recognize most financial assets and financial
    liabilities at fair value on an

instrument-by-instrument

basis. The stated objective of ASC Topic 825 is to improve
    financial reporting by giving entities the opportunity to elect
    to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair
    value in order to



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

mitigate earnings volatility caused when related assets and
    liabilities are measured differently. ASC Topic 825 was
    effective for the Company beginning with its quarter ending
    March 31, 2008. The Company chose to not make the election
    to adopt.

In December 2007, the FASB ASC amended Topic 805,

Business
    Combinations

. ASC Topic 805 establishes principles and
    requirements for recognizing identifiable assets acquired,
    liabilities assumed, noncontrolling interest in the acquiree,
    goodwill acquired in the combination or the gain from a bargain
    purchase, and disclosure requirements. Under this revised
    statement, all costs incurred to effect an acquisition are
    recognized separately from the acquisition. Also, restructuring
    costs that are expected but the acquirer is not obligated to
    incur are recognized separately from the acquisition. On
    January 1, 2009, the Company adopted ASC Topic 805. In the
    first quarter of 2009, the Company expensed $4.8 million
    related to on-going acquisition related activity.

In December 2007, the FASB ASC amended Topic 810,

Consolidation

. For consolidated subsidiaries that are
    less than wholly owned, the third party holdings of equity
    interests are referred to as noncontrolling interests. The
    portion of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling
    interests for such subsidiaries is presented as net income
    (loss) applicable to noncontrolling interest on the consolidated
    statement of operation, and the portion of stockholders’
    equity of such subsidiaries is presented as noncontrolling
    interest on the consolidated balance sheet. Effective
    January 1, 2009, the Company adopted ASC Topic 810.

The adoption of ASC Topic 810 did not have a material impact on
    the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or
    cash flows. However, it did impact the presentation and
    disclosure of noncontrolling (minority) interests in our
    consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated
    financial statements. As a result of the retrospective
    presentation and disclosure requirements of ASC Topic 810, the
    Company was required to reflect the change in presentation and
    disclosure for the period ending March 31, 2009 and all
    periods presented in future filings.

In March 2008, the FASB ASC amended Topic 815,

Derivatives
    and Hedging

. ASC Topic 815 requires entities to provide
    enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative
    instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items
    are accounted for under ASC Topic 815 and its related
    interpretations, and how derivative instruments and related
    hedged items affect an entity’s financial position,
    financial performance, and cash flows. On January 1, 2009,
    the Company adopted ASC Topic 815. See Note 10 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding
    the implementation of ASC Topic 815.

In May 2008, the FASB ASC amended Topic 470,

Debt

. Under
    ASC Topic 470, an entity must separately account for the
    liability and equity components of the convertible debt
    instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash
    upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer’s
    interest cost. ASC Topic 470 is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008, and for interim periods
    within those fiscal years, with retrospective application
    required. As a result of our adoption of ASC Topic 470 for
    fiscal 2009 and the Company’s April 9, 2009 issuance
    of $373.8 million convertible senior notes due
    April 15, 2012, we recorded the equity and liability
    components of the notes on our December 31, 2009
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additionally, ASC Topic 470 requires
    us to accrete the discounted carrying value of the convertible
    notes to their face value over the term of the notes. The
    Company’s interest expense associated with this
    amortization is based on the effective interest rate of the
    convertible senior notes of 9.365%. The total interest expense
    related to the convertible notes in the Company’s
    Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 was $22.2 million. The non-cash
    portion of interest expense for the convertible notes for the
    year ended December 31, 2009 was $12.7 million. See
    Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more
    information regarding this issuance.

In December 2008, the FASB ASC amended Topic 715,

Compensation — Retirement Benefits

. ASC Topic
    715 requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures about how
    investment allocation decisions are made, the major categories
    of plan assets, the inputs and valuation techniques used to
    measure fair value of plan assets, the effect of fair value
    measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in
    plan assets for the period, and significant concentrations of
    risk within plan assets. See Note 9 and Note 11 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding
    the implementation of ASC Topic 715 on December 31, 2009.

In May 2009, the FASB ASC amended Topic 855,

Subsequent
    Events

. ASC Topic 855 requires entities to disclose the date
    through which subsequent events have been evaluated, as well as
    whether that date is the date the financial statements were
    issued or the date the financial statements were available to be
    issued. The Company adopted ASC Topic 855 in the second quarter
    of 2009 and has evaluated all subsequent events through
    February 11, 2010 (the date the Company’s financial
    statements are issued).

In June 2009, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 166, Accounting for Transfer of Financial
    Assets — an amendment of ASC Topic 860
    (“FAS 166”). FAS 166 removes the concept of
    a qualifying special-purpose entity from ASC Topic 860 and
    removes the exception from applying ASC Topic 810, Consolidation
    of Variable Interest Entities, to qualifying special-purpose
    entities. This Statement modifies the financial-components
    approach used in ASC Topic 860 and limits the circumstances in
    which a financial asset, or portion of a financial asset, should
    be derecognized. Additionally, enhanced disclosures are required
    to provide financial statement users with greater transparency
    about transfers of financial assets and a transferor’s
    continuing involvement with transferred financial assets.
    FAS 166 is effective for the Company



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

beginning with its quarter ending March 31, 2010. The first
    quarter 2010 impact of this adoption is expected to be an
    increase in receivables of $50 million and an increase in
    debt of $50 million in the Company’s December 31,
    2009 and March 31, 2010 Condensed Consolidated Balance
    Sheets.

In June 2009, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 167, Amendments to ASC Topic 810
    (“FAS 167”). FAS 167 amends ASC Topic 810 to
    require ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the
    primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. Additionally,
    FAS 167 requires enhanced disclosures that will provide
    users of financial statements with more transparent information
    about an enterprise’s involvement in variable interest
    entities. FAS 167 is effective for the Company beginning
    with its quarter ending March 31, 2010. The adoption of
    FAS 167 is not expected to have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

In June 2009, the FASB ASC amended Topic 105,

Generally
    Accepted Accounting Principles

. This ASC Topic instituted a
    major change in the way accounting standards are organized. The
    accounting standards Codification became the single official
    source of authoritative, nongovernmental GAAP. As of
    September 30, 2009 only one level of authoritative GAAP
    exists, other than guidance issued by the Securities and
    Exchange Commission. All other literature is non-authoritative.
    The Company adopted the Codification in the third quarter of
    2009. The adoption of the Codification had no impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

This adoption required all issued authoritative literature to be
    disclosed using Codification Sections. Authoritative literature
    has been referenced within our 2009 report on

Form 10-K

under these new Codification Sections. New standards not yet
    codified have been referenced as issued and will be updated when
    codified.

The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate
    for 2009 of (103.4)% compared with rates of 237.9% in 2008 and
    26.5% in 2007. The effective tax rate of (103.4)% for 2009
    differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to a
    reduction in U.S. income; foreign rates, which differ from
    those in the U.S.; the realization of certain business tax
    credits including R&D and U.S. based foreign tax
    credits; and favorable permanent differences between book and
    tax treatment for items, including equity in affiliates’
    earnings.

The Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 740 on
    January 1, 2007. As a result of the implementation of ASC
    Topic 740, the Company recognized a $16.6 million reduction
    to the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. At
    December 31, 2007, the Company reported $71.7 million
    of unrecognized tax benefits; approximately $62.5 million
    represent the amount that, if recognized, would affect the
    Company’s global effective income tax rate in future
    periods.

Following is a reconciliation of the Company’s total gross
    unrecognized tax benefits for the year-to-date periods ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Of the total
    $34.8 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of
    December 31, 2009, approximately $28.9 million of this
    total represents the amount that, if recognized, would affect
    the Company’s effective income tax rate in future periods.
    This amount differs from the gross unrecognized tax benefits
    presented in the table due to the decrease in the
    U.S. federal income taxes which would occur upon
    recognition of the state tax benefits included therein.

The other non-current assets and liabilities have been netted
    within their respective taxing jurisdictions due to
    consolidation (primarily U.S. and Germany).

The deferred income taxes — current assets are
    primarily comprised of amounts from the U.S., France, Hungary,
    Japan and the U.K. The deferred income taxes — current
    liabilities are primarily comprised of amounts from Germany. The
    other non-current assets are primarily comprised of amounts from
    the U.S. The other non-current liabilities are primarily
    comprised of amounts from Germany, Hungary, Italy, Monaco and
    the U.K.

The Company has a U.S. capital loss carryforward of
    $10.1 million, which will expire in 2010. A full valuation
    allowance has been recorded on this loss carryforward due to
    risk of realization.

The U.S. based foreign tax credits of $138.3 million
    will expire beginning in 2013 through 2019. A valuation
    allowance of $21.2 million has been recorded for the tax
    effect of some of this carryforward.

At December 31, 2009, the Company has a U.S. net
    operating loss carryforward of $165.1 million that is
    available to offset future taxable income. This loss
    carryforward expires in 2030. Certain

non-U.S. subsidiaries

have net operating loss carryforwards totaling
    $64.9 million that are available to offset future taxable
    income. Carryforwards of $14.2 million expire at various
    dates from 2011 through 2019 and the balance has no expiration
    date. A valuation allowance of $3.0 million has been
    recorded for the tax effect on $15.1 million of the loss
    carryforwards. Certain U.S. subsidiaries have state net
    operating loss carryforwards totaling $429.0 million which
    are completely offset by a valuation allowance due to risk of
    realization. Certain

non-U.S. subsidiaries

located in China, Korea and Poland have tax exemptions or tax
    holidays. The cumulative impact of these tax exemptions or tax
    holidays was a reduction to tax expense of approximately
    $7.2 million in 2009.

No deferred income taxes have been provided on the excess of the
    amount for financial reporting over the tax basis of investments
    in foreign subsidiaries or foreign equity affiliates totaling
    $1,592.7 million in 2009, as these amounts are essentially
    permanent in nature. The excess amount will become taxable upon
    repatriation of assets, sale, or liquidation of the investment.
    It is not practicable to determine the unrecognized deferred tax
    liability on the excess amount because the actual tax liability
    on the excess amount, if any, is dependent on circumstances
    existing when remittance occurs.

Interest costs capitalized during 2009 and 2008 were
    $11.2 million and $13.3 million, respectively. As of
    December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, accounts
    payable of $28.6 million and $43.2 million,
    respectively, were related to property, plant and equipment
    purchases. As of December 31, 2009 and December 31,
    2008, specific assets of $3.7 million and
    $7.4 million, respectively, were pledged as collateral
    under certain of the Company’s long-term debt agreements.

As a result of the impairment charges recorded in the third and
    fourth quarters of 2008, depreciation expense for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 was reduced by approximately
    $11 million.

During the first quarter of 2009, based on current market
    conditions and asset utilization rates, the Company elected to
    extend the useful lives of certain machinery and equipment. As a
    result of this change in estimate, depreciation expense for the
    year ended December 31, 2009 was reduced by approximately
    $18 million.

NOTE 6

GOODWILL AND
    OTHER INTANGIBLES

The Company annually reviews its goodwill for impairment in the
    fourth quarter of each year for all of its reporting units, or
    more often when events and circumstances warrant such a review.

The Company’s goodwill impairment review utilizes the
    “two-step impairment test” required under ASC Topic
    350, which requires us to make significant assumptions and
    estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows,
    discount rates and growth rates. The basis of our goodwill
    impairment analysis is the Company’s annual budget and
    long-range plan (“LRP”). The annual budget and LRP
    include a five year projection of future cash flows based on
    actual new products and customer commitments. As part of the
    projection, we assumed the last year of the LRP data is a fair
    indication, on average, including fundamental industry growth,
    of the future performance of the business beyond the five year
    period into perpetuity. As the LRP is estimated over a
    significant future period of time, those estimates and
    assumptions are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. We also
    utilize market valuation models and other financial ratios,
    which require us to make certain assumptions and estimates
    regarding the applicability of those models to our assets and
    businesses. We believe that the assumptions and estimates used
    to determine the estimated fair values of each of our business
    units are reasonable. Different assumptions could materially
    affect the estimated fair value. The primary assumptions
    affecting the Company’s December 31, 2009 goodwill
    impairment review are as follows:

•

Discount Rate: The Company used a 10% weighted average cost of
    capital (“WACC”) as the discount rate for future cash
    flows. The WACC is intended to represent an estimate of the
    Company’s weighted average cost of debt and equity. We
    believe this 10% discount rate is representative of a rate of
    return that would be expected by a market participant.

•

Operating Income Margin: The Company utilized historical and
    expected operating income margins, which varied based on the
    projections of each business unit being evaluated.

While the Company believes that these assumptions are
    appropriate, significant changes in these assumptions may
    materially affect the Company’s analysis. The following
    table illustrates the sensitivity to an increase in our discount
    rate and decrease in our operating income margin assumptions; as
    it would have reduced the Company’s goodwill of
    $1,061.4 million as of December 31, 2009:

1 percentage point decrease in operating income margin

As of September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2008, the
    Company recorded an impairment charge of €104.3
    $(146.8) million and €7.2 $(10.0) million,
    respectively, to adjust BERU’s goodwill to its estimated
    fair value. The impairment charge is attributable to a decrease
    in the operating unit’s estimated fair value based
    primarily upon the effect of the decline in European market
    conditions on current and projected operating results. The
    impairment charge was also impacted by the recognition of
    additional goodwill in the second quarter of 2008, which was
    based on the court determined buy out value of €71.32 per
    share related to the Domination and Profit Transfer Agreement.
    Any differences in future results compared to management’s
    estimates could result in fair values different from estimated
    fair values, which could materially impact the Company’s
    future results of operations and financial condition.

See Note 18, “Recent Transactions”, for further
    discussion on the BERU Domination and Profit Transfer Agreement.

    estimated useful lives of the Company’s amortized
    intangible assets range from 4 to 12 years. The Company
    utilizes the straight line method of amortization, recognized
    over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated
    future annual amortization expense, primarily for acquired
    intangible assets, is as follows: $27.1 million in 2010,
    $16.5 million in 2011, $16.5 million in 2012,

In 2006, the Company entered into several interest rate swaps
    that had the effect of converting $325.0 million of fixed
    rate notes to variable rates. The weighted average effective
    interest rate of these borrowings, including the effects of
    outstanding swaps as noted in Note 9 was 5.3% as of
    December 31, 2008. In the first quarter of 2009,
    $100 million in interest rate swaps related to the
    Company’s 2009 fixed rate debt matured and the Company
    terminated $150 million in interest rate swap agreements
    related to the Company’s 2016 fixed rate debt and
    $75 million of interest rate swap agreements related to the
    Company’s 2019 fixed rate debt. As a result of the first
    quarter 2009 swap terminations, a $34.5 million gain
    remained in debt to be amortized over the remaining lives of the
    respective 2016 and 2019 debt. As of December 31, 2009, the
    unamortized portion was $31.4 million.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company’s multi-currency revolving credit facility
    provided for borrowings up to $600 million through
    July 22, 2009. On April 30, 2009, the Company extended
    its revolving credit facility for eighteen months, maturing
    January 22, 2011. The facility was reduced to
    $250 million beginning July 23, 2009. The facility is
    now secured by unperfected pledges of the Company’s equity
    interests in its subsidiaries and certain assets. No secured
    party is entitled to perfect its lien on any of the collateral
    until the long term unsecured senior, non-credit enhanced debt
    rating of the Company is rated less than or equal to BB+ by
    Standard & Poor’s and less than or equal to Ba1
    by Moody’s. The Company’s credit rating as of
    December 31, 2009 was BBB by Standard &
    Poor’s and Ba1 by Moody’s. The three key covenants of
    the credit agreement are a net worth test, a debt compared to
    EBITDA (“Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and
    Amortization”) test, and an interest coverage test. The
    Company was in compliance with all covenants at
    December 31, 2009 and expects to remain compliant in future
    periods. At December 31, 2009 and 2008 there were no
    outstanding borrowings under the facility.

The Company had outstanding letters of credit at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008 of $15.2 million and
    $21.4 million, respectively. The letters of credit
    typically act as a guarantee of payment to certain third parties
    in accordance with specified terms and conditions.

The Company’s 6.50% Senior Notes of
    $136.7 million matured on February 17, 2009. On
    April 9, 2009, the Company issued $373.8 million in
    convertible senior notes due April 15, 2012. Under ASC
    Topic 470, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May
    be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash
    Settlement), the Company must account for the convertible senior
    notes by bifurcating the instrument between their liability and
    equity components. The value of the debt component is based on
    the fair value of issuing a similar nonconvertible debt
    security. The equity component of the convertible debt security
    is calculated by deducting the value of the liability from the
    proceeds received at issuance. Therefore, the Company’s
    December 31, 2009 Consolidated Balance Sheet includes an
    increase in debt of $330.2 million and an increase in
    capital in excess of par of $36.5 million. Additionally,
    ASC Topic 470 requires us to accrete the discounted carrying
    value of the convertible notes to their face value over the term
    of the notes. The Company’s interest expense associated
    with this bond accretion is based on the effective interest rate
    of the convertible senior notes of 9.365%. The total interest
    expense related to the convertible notes in the Company’s
    Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 is $22.2 million, of which
    $12.7 million will be non-cash. The notes will pay interest
    semi-annually of $6.5 million, which is at a coupon rate of
    3.50% per year.

Holders of the notes may convert their notes at their option at
    any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled
    trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the
    notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount. The initial
    conversion rate for the notes is 30.4706 shares of the
    Company’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes
    (representing an initial conversion price of approximately
    $32.82 per share of common stock). The conversion price
    represents a conversion premium of 27.50% over the last reported
    sale price of the Company’s common stock on the New York
    Stock Exchange on April 6, 2009, of $25.74 per share. Since
    the Company’s stock price was above the convertible senior
    notes conversion price of $32.82 as of December 31, 2009,
    the if-converted value was approximately $4.6 million at
    December 31, 2009. There was no dilutive impact to weighted
    average shares outstanding for the year-ended December 31,
    2009 due to the convertible senior notes. In conjunction with
    the note offering, the Company entered into a bond hedge overlay
    at a net pre-tax cost of $25.2 million, effectively raising
    the conversion premium to 50.0%, or approximately $38.61 per
    share. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver cash,
    shares of our common stock or a combination thereof at our
    election. The convertible senior notes were issued under the
    Company’s $750 million universal shelf registration
    filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, leaving
    approximately $376 million available as of
    December 31, 2009.

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the estimated fair values
    of the Company’s senior unsecured notes totaled
    $776 million and $532.3 million, respectively. The
    estimated fair values were $43.3 million higher at
    December 31, 2009 and $6.7 million lower at
    December 31, 2008 than their respective carrying values.
    Fair market values are developed by the use of estimates

    the values the Company could realize in the current markets.

NOTE 9

FAIR VALUE
    MEASUREMENTS

On January 1, 2009, the Company fully adopted as required,
    ASC Topic 820 — “Fair Value Measurements”
    which expands the disclosure of fair value measurements and its
    impact on the Company’s financial statements.

ASC Topic 820 emphasizes that fair value is a market-based
    measurement, not an entity specific measurement. Therefore, a
    fair value measurement should be determined based on assumptions
    that market participants would use in pricing an asset or
    liability. As a basis for considering market participant
    assumptions in fair value measurements, ASC Topic 820
    establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs
    used in measuring fair values as follows:

Level 1:

Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;

Level 2:

Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are
    observable either directly or indirectly; and

Level 3:

Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data,
    which require the reporting entity to develop its own
    assumptions.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are based on one
    or more of the following three valuation techniques noted in ASC
    Topic 820:

A.

Market approach: Prices and other relevant information generated
    by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets
    or liabilities.

B.

Cost approach: Amount that would be required to replace the
    service capacity of an asset (replacement cost).

C.

Income approach: Techniques to convert future amounts to a
    single present amount based upon market expectations (including
    present value techniques, option-pricing and excess earnings
    models).

NOTE 10

FINANCIAL
    INSTRUMENTS

On January 1, 2009, the Company adopted as required, ASC
    Topic 815, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and
    Hedging Activities” which expands the disclosure of
    financial instruments.

The Company’s financial instruments include cash and
    marketable securities. Due to the short-term nature of these
    instruments, their book value approximates their fair value. The
    Company’s financial instruments also include long-term
    debt, interest rate and currency swaps, commodity forward
    contracts, and foreign currency forward contracts. All
    derivative contracts are placed with counterparties that have an
    S&P, or equivalent, investment grade credit rating at the
    time of the contracts’ placement. At December 31, 2009
    the Company had no derivative contracts that contained credit
    risk related contingent features.

The Company selectively uses cross-currency swaps to hedge the
    foreign currency exposure associated with our net investment in
    certain foreign operations (net investment hedges). Fair values
    of cross currency swaps are based on observable inputs, such as
    interest rate, yield curves, credit risks, currency exchange
    rates and other external valuation methodology (Level 2
    inputs under ASC Topic 820).

The Company uses certain commodity derivative instruments to
    protect against commodity price changes related to forecasted
    raw material and supplies purchases. The primary purpose of our
    commodity price hedging activities is to manage the volatility
    associated with these forecasted purchases. The Company
    primarily utilizes forward and option contracts, which are
    designated as cash flow hedges. The fair values for certain
    commodity derivative instruments are based on Level 2
    evidence (for example, future prices reported on commodity
    exchanges) under ASC Topic 820. To the extent that derivative
    instruments are deemed to be effective as defined by ASC Topic
    815, gains and losses arising from these contracts are deferred
    in other comprehensive income or loss. Such gains and losses
    will be reclassified into income as the underlying operating
    transactions are realized. Gains and losses not qualifying for
    deferral treatment have been credited/charged to income as they
    are recognized.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company uses foreign exchange forward and option contracts
    to protect against exchange rate movements for forecasted cash
    flows for purchases, operating expenses or sales transactions
    designated in currencies other than the functional currency of
    the operating unit. Most contracts mature in less than one year,
    however, certain long-term commitments are covered by forward
    currency arrangements to protect against currency risk through
    2011. Foreign currency contracts require the Company, at a
    future date, to either buy or sell foreign currency in exchange
    for the operating units’ local currency. To the extent that
    derivative instruments are deemed to be effective as defined by
    ASC Topic 815, gains and losses arising from these contracts are
    deferred in other comprehensive income or loss. Such gains and
    losses will be reclassified into income as the underlying
    operating transactions are realized. Gains and losses not
    qualifying for deferral treatment have been credited/charged to
    income as they are recognized. The fair values of foreign
    exchange forward and option contracts are based on Level 2
    inputs under ASC Topic 820, such as observable exchange rates on
    various exchanges.

In 2006, the Company entered into a series of interest rate
    swaps designated as fair value hedges of a portion of its senior
    notes. In the first quarter of 2009 the company terminated
    interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of debt.
    Therefore, the basis adjustments of $34.5 million present
    at the termination of the hedging relationship will be amortized
    over the remaining life of the respective debt maturing in 2016
    and 2019. The $30.0 million cash received related to the
    termination of these interest rate swaps is included in the
    Financing section of the Statement of Cash Flows. The Company
    recognized $5.7 million in interest expense in the first
    quarter of 2009 as a result of the early termination. As of
    December 31, 2009, there were no outstanding fixed to
    floating interest rate swap agreements.

Effectiveness for cash flow, fair value and net investment
    hedges is assessed at the inception of the hedging relationship
    and quarterly, thereafter. Ineffectiveness is measured quarterly
    and results are recognized in earnings.

The Company selectively uses cross-currency swaps to hedge the
    foreign currency exposure associated with our net investment in
    certain foreign operations (net investment hedges). At
    December 31, 2009 the following cross-currency swaps were

The Company may also enter into derivative contracts that are
    not designated as hedging instruments as defined by ASC Topic
    815. Undesignated derivative instruments substantially pertain
    to foreign exchange contracts that are used to offset the impact
    of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. The
    Company does not apply hedge accounting because the gain (loss)
    on the derivative contract is generally offset by the ASC Topic
    830, “Foreign Currency Translation,” remeasurement
    gain (loss) of the foreign currency asset or liability in the
    same reporting period.

NOTE 11

RETIREMENT
    BENEFIT PLANS

The Company sponsors various defined contribution savings plans
    primarily in the U.S. that allow employees to contribute a
    portion of their pre-tax

and/or

after-tax income in accordance with plan specified guidelines.
    Under specified conditions, the Company will make contributions
    to the plans

and/or

match
    a percentage of the employee contributions up to certain limits.
    Total expense related to the defined contribution plans was
    $16.6 million, $22.1 million and $23.7 million in
    2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company has a number of defined benefit pension plans and
    other post employment benefit plans covering eligible salaried
    and hourly employees and their dependents. The defined pension
    benefits provided are primarily based on (i) years of
    service and (ii) average compensation or a monthly
    retirement benefit amount. The Company provides defined benefit
    pension plans in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Japan, South Korea,
    Italy, France, Ireland, Monaco and Mexico. The other post
    employment benefit plans, which provide medical and life
    insurance benefits, are unfunded plans. All pension and other
    post employment benefit plans in the U.S. have been closed
    to new employees since 1999. The measurement date for all plans
    is December 31.

On February 26, 2009, the Company’s subsidiary,
    BorgWarner Diversified Transmission Products Inc.
    (“DTP”), entered into a Plant Shutdown Agreement with
    the United Auto Workers (“UAW”) for its Muncie,
    Indiana automotive component plant (the “Muncie
    Plant”). Management subsequently wound-down production
    activity at the plant, with operations effectively ceased as of
    March 31, 2009. As a result of the closure of the Muncie
    Plant, the Company recorded a curtailment gain of
    $41.9 million in the other post employment benefit plan in
    the first quarter of 2009.

The Plant Shutdown Agreement with the UAW for the Muncie Plant
    also included a settlement of a portion of the UAW retiree
    health care obligation, resulting in the remeasurement of the
    retiree medical plan. The financial impact of this settlement
    resulted in expense recognition of $14.0 million, a
    $47.2 million reduction to retirement-related liabilities,
    a $27.2 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive
    income and a $34.0 million increase in accounts payable and
    accrued expenses in the first quarter of 2009. The
    $34.0 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses will
    be paid in monthly installments, which began in May 2009 and
    will conclude in April 2010.

The combined pre-tax impact of these actions was a net gain of
    $27.9 million, comprised of a $41.9 million
    curtailment gain and $14.0 million settlement loss on the
    Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations
    as of March 31, 2009.

As part of the Plant Shutdown Agreement with the UAW for the
    Muncie Plant, the Company changed certain pension plan
    provisions. The pre-tax impact of this change was a
    $2.3 million reduction in 2009 U.S. pension expense
    and a $13.5 million reduction in the projected benefit
    obligation.

In April 2009, the Company made changes to certain Muncie
    retirees medical program. The effect of the changes to this
    group is that members will pay a higher percentage of the annual
    premium for Company-sponsored retiree medical coverage from
    retirement to age 65, and the group will not receive
    Company-sponsored Medicare Supplemental coverage once entitled
    to Medicare. Consistent with the majority of other
    U.S. BorgWarner retiree medical plans, retirees will
    receive an annual per member allowance toward the purchase of
    individual Medicare health plan coverage and for reimbursement
    of healthcare

out-of-pocket

expenses The financial impact of this change was a
    $22.2 million reduction to retirement-related liabilities
    and a $22.2 million increase in accumulated other
    comprehensive income.

In June 2009, the Company announced its plan to freeze its
    defined benefit plan at its Bradford plant in the United Kingdom
    in consultation with affected employees and their
    representatives. The effect of this change was that participants
    in the Bradford defined benefit plan ceased to accrue defined
    benefits after October 31, 2009. Future pension benefits
    will be earned within an existing defined contribution plan
    going forward. The financial impact of this change was a
    $3.7 million reduction to retirement-related liabilities, a
    $3.5 increase in accumulated other comprehensive income and
    $0.2 million in income recognition in the second quarter of
    2009.

On December 11, 2009, the Company offered a proposed
    settlement agreement regarding the closure of the Muncie plant
    to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (“PBGC”)
    in which the Company will make certain payments directly to the
    Muncie Plant’s defined benefit pension plan (the
    “Plan”). On December 23, 2009 the Company made an
    initial cash contribution of $23 million for the 2009 Plan
    year, consistent with the proposed settlement agreement. Also
    under the proposed settlement agreement for each of the Plan
    years



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

beginning in 2011, 2012, and 2013, the Company will make a cash
    contribution to the Plan in the amount of $15 million,
    unless this contribution exceeds the maximum amounts deductible
    under the applicable US tax regulations.

In September 2008 and 2007, the Company made changes to its
    U.S. retiree medical program that impact certain union and
    non-union active employees with a future retiree benefit and
    current retirees participating in a health care plan. The effect
    of the changes to both groups is that most members will pay a
    higher percentage of the annual premium for Company-sponsored
    retiree medical coverage between retirement and age 65, and
    neither group will receive Company-sponsored Medicare health
    plan coverage once entitled to Medicare. Instead, certain active
    employees received a lump sum credit into a non-contributory
    cash balance pension plan earning interest each year. Current
    retirees receive an annual per member allowance toward the
    purchase of individual Medicare health plan coverage and for
    reimbursement of healthcare

The Company’s investment strategy is to maintain actual
    asset weightings within a preset range of target allocations.
    The Company believes these ranges represent an appropriate risk
    profile for the planned benefit payments of the plans based on
    the timing of the estimated benefit payments. Within each asset
    category, separate portfolios are maintained for additional
    diversification. Investment managers are retained within each
    asset category to manage each portfolio against its benchmark.
    Each investment manager has appropriate investment guidelines.
    In addition, the entire portfolio is evaluated against a
    relevant peer group. The defined benefit pension plans did not
    hold any Company securities as investments as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008. A portion of pension assets are
    invested in common and comingled trusts.

The Company expects to contribute a total of $10 million to
    $20 million into its defined benefit pension plans during
    2010.

Refer to Note 9, “Fair Value Measurements”, for
    more detail surrounding the fair value of each major category of
    plan assets as well as the inputs and valuation techniques used

Note: In the year ended December 31, 2009, the other post
    employment benefits settlement/curtailment of
    $61.9 million, in the table above, was offset by a
    $34.0 million cost to settle, resulting in a net pre-tax
    gain of $27.9 million. Excluding the $61.9 million
    settlement/curtailment gain, the Company’s 2009 other post
    employment benefit expense was $13.5 million.

The estimated net loss for the defined benefit pension plans
    that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss) into net periodic benefit cost over the next
    fiscal year is $7.4 million. The estimated net loss and
    prior service credit for the other post employment plans that
    will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss) into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year
    are $9.1 million and $(6.9) million, respectively.

The Company’s approach to establishing the discount rate is
    based upon the market yields of high-quality corporate bonds,
    with appropriate consideration of each plan’s defined
    benefit payment terms and duration of the liabilities. The
    discount rate assumption is typically rounded up or down to the
    nearest 25 basis points for each plan.

The Company determines its expected return on plan asset
    assumptions by evaluating estimates of future market returns and
    the plans’ asset allocation. The Company also considers the
    impact of active management of the plans’ invested assets.
    The Company’s expected return on assets assumption reflects
    the asset allocation of each plan. The Company’s assumed
    long-term rate of return on assets for its U.S. pension
    plans was 7.50% in 2009 and 8.75% for 2008 and 2007. The
    Company’s assumed long-term rate of return on assets for
    its U.K. pension plan was 7.50% in 2009 and 7.25% for 2008 and
    2007.

    post employment benefits are as follows:

STOCK INCENTIVE
    PLANS

Under the Company’s 1993 Stock Incentive Plan (“1993
    Plan”), the Company granted options to purchase shares of
    the Company’s common stock at the fair market value on the
    date of grant. The options vest over periods up to three years
    and have a term of ten years from date of grant. As of
    December 31, 2003, there were no options available for
    future grants under the 1993 Plan. The 1993 Plan expired at the
    end of 2003 and was replaced by the Company’s 2004 Stock
    Incentive Plan, which was amended at the Company’s 2009
    Annual Stockholders Meeting, among other things, to increase the
    number of shares available for issuance under the Plan. Under
    the BorgWarner Inc. Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive
    Plan (“2004 Stock Incentive Plan”), the number of
    shares authorized for grant was 12,500,000, of which
    approximately 2,900,000 shares are available for future
    issuance. As of December 31, 2009, there were a total of
    5,177,282 outstanding options under the 1993 and 2004 Stock

The weighted average fair value at date of grant for options
    granted during 2007 was $10.52 and was estimated using the
    Black-Scholes options pricing model with the following weighted
    average assumptions:


Risk-free interest rate

4.82%

Dividend yield

0.97%

Volatility factor

28.64%

Weighted average expected life

4.7 years

The expected lives of the awards are based on historical
    exercise patterns and the terms of the options. The risk-free
    interest rate is based on zero coupon Treasury bond rates
    corresponding to the expected life of the awards. The expected
    volatility assumption was derived by referring to changes in the
    Company’s historical common stock prices over the same
    timeframe as the expected life of the awards. The expected
    dividend yield of stock is based on the Company’s
    historical dividend yield. The Company has no reason to believe
    that the expected dividend yield or the future stock volatility
    is likely to differ from historical patterns.

Restricted Stock

At its November 2007 meeting, our
    Compensation Committee decided that restricted common stock and
    stock units would be awarded in place of stock options for
    long-term incentive award grants to employees. These restricted
    shares and units for employees vest fifty percent after two
    years and the remainder after three years from the date of
    grant. The Company also grants restricted common stock to its
    non-employee directors. For non-employee directors restricted
    shares generally vest ratably on the anniversary of the date of
    the grant over a period of three years. The market value of the
    Company’s restricted common stock and stock units at the
    date of grant determines the value of the restricted common
    stock. In February 2009, 1,000,643 restricted shares and units
    were granted to employees under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan.
    In April 2009, 43,349 restricted shares were granted to
    non-employee directors under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan. The
    value of the awards is recorded as unearned compensation within
    capital in excess of par value in stockholders’ equity, and
    is amortized as compensation expense over the restriction
    periods.

Restricted stock compensation expense reduced earnings before
    income taxes and noncontrolling interest and net earnings for
    the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 by:

Performance Share Plans

The 2004 Stock Incentive Plan
    provides for awarding of performance shares to members of senior
    management at the end of successive three-year periods based on
    the Company’s performance in terms of total shareholder
    return relative to a peer group of automotive companies. Awards
    earned are payable 40% in cash and 60% in the Company’s
    common stock.

The Company recognizes compensation expense for the 40% cash
    component and 60% stock component ratably over the performance
    period. Compensation expense for the 60% stock component is
    based on the performance shares fair value at the date of grant.
    This fair value is calculated using a lattice model (Monte Carlo
    simulation). The compensation expense for the 40% cash component
    is based on quarterly marking to market the cash liability. The
    amounts expensed under the plan and the share issuances for the
    three-year measurement periods ended December 31, 2009,
    2008 and 2007 were as follows:

In calculating earnings or loss per share, earnings or loss are
    the same for the basic and diluted calculations. Due to the
    effects of stock options issued and issuable and restricted
    shares issued under the 1993 Plan and 2004 Stock Incentive Plan,
    shares increased for diluted earnings per share for the year
    ended December 31, 2009 and 2007 by 417,000 and 1,838,000,
    respectively. There was no dilutive impact to weighted average
    shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2008 due
    to the Company’s net loss.

NOTE 14

CONTINGENCIES

In the normal course of business the Company and its
    subsidiaries are parties to various commercial and legal claims,
    actions and complaints, including matters involving warranty
    claims, intellectual property claims, general liability and
    various other risks. It is not possible to predict with
    certainty whether or not the Company and its subsidiaries will
    ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal
    matters or, if not, what the impact might be. The Company’s
    environmental and product liability contingencies are discussed
    separately below. The Company’s management does not expect
    that the results in any of these commercial and legal claims,
    actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect on
    the Company’s results of operations, financial position or
    cash flows.

Litigation
    Outcome

In January 2006, DTP, a subsidiary of the Company, filed a
    declaratory judgment action in United States District Court,
    Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis Division) against the
    United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implements
    Workers of America (“UAW”) Local No. 287 and
    Gerald Poor, individually and as the representative of a
    defendant class. DTP sought the Court’s affirmation that
    DTP did not violate the Labor-Management Relations Act or the
    Employee Retirement Income Security Act by unilaterally amending
    certain medical plans effective April 1, 2006 and
    October 1, 2006, prior to the expiration of the
    then-current collective



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

bargaining agreements. On September 10, 2008, the Court
    found that DTP’s reservation of the right to make such
    amendments reducing the level of benefits provided to retirees
    was limited by its collectively bargained health insurance
    agreement with the UAW, which did not expire until
    April 24, 2009. Thus, the amendments were untimely. In 2008
    the Company recorded a charge of $4.0 million as a result
    of the Court’s decision.

DTP filed a declaratory judgment action in the United States
    District Court, Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis
    Division) against the UAW Local No. 287 and Jim Barrett and
    others, individually and as representatives of a defendant
    class, on February 26, 2009 again seeking the Court’s
    affirmation that DTP will not violate the Labor —
    Management Relations Act or the Employment Retirement Income
    Security Act (ERISA) by modifying the level of benefits provided
    retirees to make them comparable to other Company retiree
    benefit plans after April 24, 2009. Certain retirees, on
    behalf of themselves and others, filed a mirror-image action in
    the United States District Court, Eastern District of Michigan
    (Southern Division) on March 11, 2009, for which a class
    has been certified. During the last quarter of 2009 the action
    pending in Indiana was dismissed, while the action in Michigan
    is continuing. At this stage of the litigation, the Company
    cannot make any predictions as to the outcome, but it is
    vigorously defending against the suit.

Environmental

The Company and certain of its current and former direct and
    indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have
    been identified by the United States Environmental Protection
    Agency and certain state environmental agencies and private
    parties as potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) at
    various hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive
    Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
    (“Superfund”) and equivalent state laws and, as such,
    may presently be liable for the cost of

clean-up

and
    other remedial activities at 35 such sites. Responsibility for

clean-up

and
    other remedial activities at a Superfund site is typically
    shared among PRPs based on an allocation formula.

The Company believes that none of these matters, individually or
    in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its
    results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
    Generally, this is because either the estimates of the maximum
    potential liability at a site are not large or the liability
    will be shared with other PRPs, although no assurance can be
    given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter.

Based on information available to the Company (which in most
    cases includes: an estimate of allocation of liability among
    PRPs; the probability that other PRPs, many of whom are large,
    solvent public companies, will fully pay the cost apportioned to
    them; currently available information from PRPs

and/or

federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of
    contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs;
    remediation alternatives; and estimated legal fees), the Company
    has an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities with a
    balance at December 31, 2009 of $21.0 million. The
    Company has accrued amounts that do not exceed $3.0 million
    related to any individual site except for the Crystal Springs
    site discussed below, and we do not believe that the costs
    related to any of these sites will have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows
    or financial condition. The Company expects to pay out
    substantially all of the amounts accrued for environmental
    liability over the next three to five years.

In connection with the sale of Kuhlman Electric Corporation, the
    Company agreed to indemnify the buyer and Kuhlman Electric for
    certain environmental liabilities, then unknown to the Company,
    relating to certain operations of Kuhlman Electric that pre-date
    the Company’s 1999 acquisition of Kuhlman Electric. During
    2000, Kuhlman Electric notified the Company that it discovered
    potential environmental contamination at its Crystal Springs,
    Mississippi plant while undertaking an expansion of the plant.
    The Company is continuing to work with the Mississippi
    Department of Environmental Quality and Kuhlman Electric to
    investigate and remediate to the extent necessary, historical
    contamination at the plant and surrounding area. Kuhlman
    Electric and others, including the Company, were sued in
    numerous related lawsuits, in which multiple claimants alleged
    personal injury and property damage relating to the alleged
    environmental contamination. In 2005, the Company and other
    defendants entered into settlements that resolved approximately
    99% of those claims and the remainder of them have since been
    dismissed.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In 2007 and 2008, four additional lawsuits were filed against
    Kuhlman Electric and others, including the Company, on behalf of
    approximately 340 plaintiffs, alleging personal injury relating
    to the alleged environmental contamination. At this stage of the
    litigation, the Company cannot make any predictions as to the
    outcome, but it is vigorously defending against the suits.

Conditional Asset
    Retirement Obligations

In March 2005, ASC Topic 410, Accounting for Conditional Asset
    Retirement Obligations, which requires the Company to recognize
    legal obligations to perform asset retirements in which the
    timing

and/or

method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may
    or may not be within the control of the entity. Certain
    government regulations require the removal and disposal of
    asbestos from an existing facility at the time the facility
    undergoes major renovations or is demolished. The liability
    exists because the facility will not last forever, but it is
    conditional on future renovations (even if there are no
    immediate plans to remove the materials, which pose no health or
    safety hazard in their current condition). Similarly, government
    regulations require the removal or closure of underground
    storage tanks and above ground storage tanks when their use
    ceases, the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyl transformers
    and capacitors when their use ceases, and the disposal of used
    furnace bricks and liners, and lead-based paint in conjunction
    with facility renovations or demolition. The Company currently
    has 31 manufacturing locations that have been identified as
    containing these items. The fair value to remove and dispose of
    this material has been estimated and recorded at
    $1.3 million as of December 31, 2009 and
    $1.4 million as of December 31, 2008.

Product
    Liability

Like many other industrial companies who have historically
    operated in the U.S., the Company (or parties the Company is
    obligated to indemnify) continues to be named as one of many
    defendants in asbestos-related personal injury actions. We
    believe that the Company’s involvement is limited because,
    in general, these claims relate to a few types of automotive
    friction products that were manufactured many years ago and
    contained encapsulated asbestos. The nature of the fibers, the
    encapsulation and the manner of use lead the Company to believe
    that these products are highly unlikely to cause harm. As of
    December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 the Company
    had approximately 23,000 and 27,000 pending asbestos-related
    product liability claims, respectively. Of the 23,000
    outstanding claims at December 31, 2009, approximately
    12,000 were pending in just three jurisdictions, where
    significant tort and judicial reform activities are underway.

The Company’s policy is to vigorously defend against these
    lawsuits and the Company has been successful in obtaining
    dismissal of many claims without any payment. The Company
    expects that the vast majority of the pending asbestos-related
    product liability claims where it is a defendant (or has an
    obligation to indemnify a defendant) will result in no payment
    being made by the Company or its insurers. In 2009, of the
    approximately 5,300 claims resolved, only 223 (4.2%) resulted in
    any payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the
    Company. In 2008, of the approximately 17,500 claims resolved,
    only 210 (1.2%) resulted in any payment being made to a claimant
    by or on behalf of the Company.

Prior to June 2004, the settlement and defense costs associated
    with all claims were covered by the Company’s primary layer
    insurance coverage, and these carriers administered, defended,
    settled and paid all claims under a funding arrangement. In June
    2004, primary layer insurance carriers notified the Company of
    the alleged exhaustion of their policy limits. This led the
    Company to access the next available layer of insurance
    coverage. Since June 2004, secondary layer insurers have paid
    asbestos-related litigation defense and settlement expenses
    pursuant to a funding arrangement. To date, the Company has paid
    $79.8 million in defense and indemnity in advance of
    insurers’ reimbursement and has received $21.2 million
    in cash from insurers. The net outstanding balance of
    $58.6 million is expected to be fully recovered, of which
    $23.0 million is expected to be recovered in 2010. Timing
    of the recovery is dependent on final resolution of the
    declaratory judgment action referred to below. At
    December 31, 2008, insurers owed $35.9 million in
    association with these claims.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In addition, at December 31, 2009, the Company has
    estimated a liability of $49.9 million for claims asserted,
    but not yet resolved and their related defense costs. The
    Company also has a related asset of $49.9 million to
    recognize the proceeds receivable from the insurance carriers.
    Insurance carrier reimbursement of 100% is expected based on the
    Company’s experience, its insurance contracts and decisions
    received to date in the declaratory judgment action referred to
    below. At December 31, 2008, the comparable value of the
    insurance receivable and accrued liability was
    $34.7 million.

The amounts recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets related
    to the estimated future settlement of existing claims are as

The Company cannot reasonably estimate possible losses, if any,
    in excess of those for which it has accrued, because it cannot
    predict how many additional claims may be brought against the
    Company (or parties the Company has an obligation to indemnify)
    in the future, the allegations in such claims, the possible
    outcomes, or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be
    enacted at the State or Federal levels.

A declaratory judgment action was filed in January 2004 in the
    Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois by Continental Casualty
    Company and related companies (“CNA”) against the
    Company and certain of its other historical general liability
    insurers. CNA provided the Company with both primary and
    additional layer insurance, and, in conjunction with other
    insurers, is currently defending and indemnifying the Company in
    its pending asbestos-related product liability claims. The
    lawsuit seeks to determine the extent of insurance coverage
    available to the Company including whether the available limits
    exhaust on a “per occurrence” or an
    “aggregate” basis, and to determine how the applicable
    coverage responsibilities should be apportioned. On
    August 15, 2005, the Court issued an interim order
    regarding the apportionment matter. The interim order has the
    effect of making insurers responsible for all defense and
    settlement costs pro rata to

time-on-the-risk,

with the pro-ration method to hold the insured harmless for
    periods of bankrupt or unavailable coverage. Appeals of the
    interim order were denied. However, the issue is reserved for
    appellate review at the end of the action. In addition to the
    primary insurance available for asbestos-related claims, the
    Company has substantial additional layers of insurance available
    for potential future asbestos-related product claims. As such,
    the Company continues to believe that its coverage is sufficient
    to meet foreseeable liabilities.

Although it is impossible to predict the outcome of pending or
    future claims or the impact of tort reform legislation that may
    be enacted at the State or Federal levels, due to the
    encapsulated nature of the products, the Company’s
    experiences in vigorously defending and resolving claims in the
    past, and the Company’s significant insurance coverage with
    solvent carriers as of the date of this filing, management does
    not believe that asbestos-related product liability claims are
    likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

NOTE 15

LEASES AND
    COMMITMENTS

Certain assets are leased under long-term operating leases.
    These include production equipment at one plant, rent for the
    corporate headquarters and an airplane. Most leases contain
    renewal options for various



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

periods. Leases generally require the Company to pay for
    insurance, taxes and maintenance of the leased property. The
    Company leases other equipment such as vehicles and certain
    office equipment under short-term leases. Total rent expense was
    $28.5 million in 2009, $31.5 million in 2008, and
    $29.8 million in 2007. The Company does not have any
    material capital leases.

The Company has guaranteed the residual values of certain leased
    machinery and equipment at its facilities. The guarantees extend
    through the maturity of the underlying lease, which is in
    September 2010. In the event the Company exercises its option
    not to purchase the remaining machinery and equipment, the
    Company has guaranteed a residual value of $6.0 million at
    September 30, 2010.

Future minimum operating lease payments at December 31,

RESTRUCTURING

In the second quarter of 2009, the Company took additional
    restructuring actions. The Company reduced its North American
    workforce by approximately 550 people, or 12%; its European
    workforce by



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

approximately 150 people, or 2%; and its Asian workforce by
    approximately 60 people, or 3% in the second quarter. The
    net restructuring expense recognized in the second quarter was
    $9.0 million for employee termination benefits. In addition
    to employee termination costs, the Company recorded
    $36.3 million of asset impairment and $5.0 million of
    other charges in the second quarter of 2009 related to the North
    American and European restructuring. The combined 2009
    restructuring expenses of $50.3 million are broken out by
    segment as follows: Engine $27.2 million, Drivetrain
    $19.7 million and Corporate $3.4 million.

Included in the second quarter of 2009 asset impairment charge
    is $22.3 million related to one of the Company’s
    European locations. During the second quarter of 2009
    circumstances caused the Company to evaluate the long range
    outlook of the facility using an undiscounted and discounted
    cash flow model, both of which indicated that assets were
    impaired. The Company then used a replacement cost technique to
    determine the fair value of the assets at the facility. This
    reduction of asset value was included in the Engine segment.

On July 31, 2008, the Company announced a restructuring of
    its operations to align ongoing operations with a continuing,
    fundamental market shift in the auto industry. As a continuation
    of the Company’s third quarter restructuring, on
    December 11, 2008, the Company announced plans for
    additional restructuring actions. As a result of these third and
    fourth quarter 2008 restructuring actions, the Company had
    reduced its North American workforce by approximately
    2,400 people, or 33%; its European workforce by
    approximately 1,600 people, or 18%; and its Asian workforce
    by approximately 400 people, or 17%. The restructuring
    expense recognized for employee termination benefits was
    $54.6 million. In addition to employee termination costs,
    the Company recorded $72.9 million of asset impairment
    charges related to the North American and European
    restructuring. The combined restructuring expenses of
    $127.5 million are broken out by segment as follows: Engine
    $85.3 million, Drivetrain $40.9 million and Corporate
    $1.3 million.

Estimates of restructuring expense are based on information
    available at the time such charges are recorded. Due to the
    inherent uncertainty involved in estimating restructuring
    expenses, actual amounts paid for such activities may differ
    from amounts initially recorded. Accordingly, the Company may
    record revisions of previous estimates by adjusting previously
    established reserves.

RECENT
    TRANSACTIONS

BERU

In 2005, the Company acquired approximately 69.4% of the
    outstanding shares of BERU Aktiengesellschaft
    (“BERU”), headquartered in Ludwigsburg, Germany.

The Company acquired approximately 12.8% of additional BERU
    shares in 2007. The purchase price paid for these shares was
    $138.8 million, including transaction fees. In connection
    with the purchase, the Company recorded fair value of identified
    intangible assets and beginning inventory of $28.5 million.
    Of this total, $2.1 million, net of tax, of in process
    R&D, order backlog and beginning inventory were immediately
    written off in the selling, general, and administrative line in
    the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Net liabilities of
    $1.0 million and goodwill of $48.7 million were also
    recorded. The Company also recorded a reduction in the minority
    interest of BERU of $62.6 million.

In the second quarter of 2008, the Company and BERU completed a
    Domination and Profit Transfer Agreement (“DPTA”),
    giving BorgWarner full control of BERU. Under this agreement
    BERU is obligated to transfer 100% of its annual profits or
    losses to the Company. Upon request of BERU noncontrolling
    shareholders, the Company is obligated to purchase their shares
    for a cash payment of €71.32 per share. Those BERU
    noncontrolling shareholders who did not sell their shares are
    entitled to receive an annual compensatory payment (perpetual
    dividend) of €4.23 (net) per share. The DPTA is a binding
    agreement. However, certain noncontrolling shareholders of BERU
    initiated an appraisal proceeding in the German court system
    that challenged the valuation of the €71.32 purchase price
    and €4.23 annual compensatory payment (perpetual dividend).

On January 7, 2009 the Company informed BERU of its
    intention to purchase the remaining outstanding shares at that
    time of approximately 4%, using the required German legal
    process referred to as a “squeeze-out” to gain 100%
    ownership. This process included an affirmative vote of BERU
    shareholders at its May 20, 2009 annual shareholder
    meeting. The registration of the “squeeze-out” was
    challenged by certain noncontrolling shareholders of BERU with
    the commercial register in June 2009. The
    “squeeze-out” share price passed by the BERU
    shareholders in May 2009 was €73.39. The increase in price
    per share of €2.07 resulting from the “squeeze
    out” was reflected as an increase to the Company’s
    total DPTA obligation.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

On September 18, 2009 the noncontrolling shareholders of
    BERU who had challenged the “squeeze-out” resolution
    dropped their complaint. The elimination of all actions against
    the resolution allowed BERU to register the
    “squeeze-out” with the commercial register. The
    “squeeze-out” became effective on September 30,
    2009, making the Company the only shareholder of BERU. On
    October 2, 2009 BERU was delisted as a public company in
    Germany. In October 2009 the Company paid €22.9
    ($33.5) million for the approximately 311,000 outstanding
    shares of BERU. Certain noncontrolling shareholders have
    challenged the “squeeze out” share price of
    €73.39. A hearing date for this action is expected to be
    set in 2010.

As a result of the tendering of shares, the Company owned 100%
    of all BERU’s outstanding shares at December 31, 2009.
    The tendering of approximately 4.4% of BERU shares, at a cost of
    $46.6 million, has been reflected as a Financing activity
    in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the year ended
    December 31, 2009. Additionally, on May 22, 2009 the
    Company paid the annual perpetual dividend of $1.9 million,
    which is also reflected as a Financing activity in the
    Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended
    December 31, 2009.

See Note 6, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets”, for further discussion on BERU’s goodwill
    impairment charge recorded in the third and fourth quarters of
    2008.

Other

In the third quarter of 2008, the Company purchased the
    remaining 26% interest in its joint venture located in India,
    BorgWarner Morse TEC Murugappa Pvt. Ltd, for $4.4 million.

In the third quarter of 2008, BERU divested its 50% interest in
    Impco BERU Technologies B.V. (located in the Netherlands) for
    $5.5 million, which approximated its carrying value.

On November 18, 2008, we entered into a joint venture
    agreement with China Automobile Development United Investment
    Company, a company owned by leading Chinese automakers, to
    produce various dual clutch transmission modules. The joint
    venture will be located in Dalian, China and production is
    scheduled to begin in 2011. BorgWarner will own 66% of the joint
    venture.

On June 2, 2009, the Company announced the purchase of
    advanced gasoline ignition technology and related intellectual
    property from Florida-based Etatech, Inc. The high-frequency
    ignition technology enables high-performing, lean burning
    engines to significantly improve fuel economy and reduce
    emissions compared with conventional combustion technologies.
    Amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2009
    was approximately $1.3 million. For the year ended
    December 31, 2009, a $7.5 million payment for Etatech,
    Inc. has been reflected as an investing activity in the
    Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

NOTE 19

REPORTING
    SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION

The Company’s business is comprised of two reporting
    segments: Engine and Drivetrain. These segments are strategic
    business groups, which are managed separately as each represents
    a specific grouping of automotive components and systems. The
    Company allocates resources to each segment based upon the
    projected after-tax return on invested capital
    (“ROIC”) of its business initiatives. The ROIC is
    comprised of projected earnings before interest, income taxes
    and noncontrolling interest (“EBIT”) adjusted for
    taxes compared to the projected average capital investment
    required.

EBIT is considered a “non-GAAP financial measure.”
    Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure
    of a company’s financial performance, financial position or
    cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included
    in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure
    calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. EBIT is
    defined as earnings before restructuring expense, goodwill
    impairment charge, interest, income taxes and noncontrolling
    interest. “Earnings” is intended to mean net earnings
    as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations under
    GAAP.

The Company believes that EBIT is useful to demonstrate the
    operational profitability of its segments by excluding
    restructuring expense, goodwill impairment charge, interest,
    income taxes and noncontrolling interest, which are generally
    accounted for across the entire Company on a consolidated basis.
    EBIT is also one of the measures used by the Company to
    determine resource allocation within the Company. Although the
    Company believes that EBIT enhances understanding of its
    business and performance, it should not be considered an
    alternative to, or more meaningful than, net earnings or cash
    flows from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP.

Sales to Major
    Customers

Consolidated net sales to a single customer (including their
    subsidiaries), which exceeded 10% of our total sales, were to
    Volkswagen of approximately 22%, 19%, and 15%; and to Ford of
    approximately 12%, 9%, and 12% for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Both of the
    Company’s reporting segments had significant sales to
    Volkswagen and Ford in 2009, 2008 and 2007. Accounts receivable
    from these customers at December 31, 2009 comprised
    approximately 23% ($170.2 million) of total accounts
    receivable. Such sales consisted of a variety of products to a
    variety of customer locations and regions. No other single
    customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated sales in
    any year of the periods presented.

Sales by Product
    Line

Sales of turbochargers for light-vehicles represented
    approximately 27%, 24%, and 21% of the Company’s total
    revenues for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company
    currently supplies light-vehicle turbochargers to many OEMs
    including Volkswagen, Renault, PSA, Daimler, Hyundai, Fiat, BMW,
    Ford and General Motors.

No other single product line accounted for more than 10% of
    consolidated sales in any year of the periods presented.

The Company had a loss for the quarters ended March 31,
    2009, June 30, 2009, September 30, 2008,
    December 31, 2008 and the year ended December 31,
    2008. As a result, diluted loss per share is the same as basic
    loss per share in each period, as any dilutive securities would
    reduce the loss per share.

(1)

The Company’s first quarter 2009 results were impacted by
    the following:

•

$4.8 million charge related to the adoption of Topic 805.

•

$27.9 million net gain related to retiree obligations
    resulting from the closure of the Muncie, Indiana, Drivetrain
    facility.

•

$11.4 million net loss from interest rate derivative
    agreements.

(2)

The Company’s second quarter 2009 results were impacted by
    the following:

•

$50.3 million of restructuring expenses, including
    $9.0 million for employee termination benefits,
    $36.3 million of asset impairment and $5.0 million of
    other charges.

•

$6.6 million net gain from interest rate derivative
    agreements.

(3)

The Company’s fourth quarter 2009 results were impacted by
    the following:



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

•

$3.1 million tax benefit related to an ASC Topic 740
    adjustment.

(4)

Third quarter 2008 results were impacted by the following:

•

$25.0 million of restructuring expenses, including
    $18.0 million related to severance and other employee
    related costs and $7.0 million of asset impairments.

•

An impairment charge of €104.3 ($146.8) million
    goodwill impairment charge to adjust the fair value of BERU
    goodwill to its’ carrying value.

•

A tax expense of $13.5 million was recorded to establish a
    valuation allowance, based on potential lack of utilization of
    foreign tax credits.

•

A retiree health care litigation charge of $4.0 million was
    recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses.

(5)

The Company’s fourth quarter 2008 results were impacted by
    the following:

•

Restructuring charges of $102.5, of which $65.9 million
    related to asset impairments and $36.6 million for
    severance and other employee related costs.

•

A goodwill impairment charge of $10.0 million, relating to
    further adjustment of the BERU carrying value.

•

A charge of $23.5 million, related to a warranty-related
    issue associated with the company’s transmission product
    sold in Europe, limited to mid-2007 through May 2008 production.

•

Sales decreased 32% from fourth quarter 2007 primarily as a
    result of poor global economic conditions, including lower North
    American, European, and Asian production of light trucks and
    sport-utility vehicles.



Item 9.

Changes
    in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and
    Financial Disclosure

In 2008, the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of
    Directors solicited proposals from the four major accounting
    firms and conducted an extensive evaluation process in
    connection with the selection of the Company’s independent
    auditor for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2009.
    Following this process, on October 6, 2008, the Audit
    Committee (i) elected to replace, and thereby dismissed,
    Deloitte & Touche LLP (“Deloitte”) as its
    independent auditor for the Company’s fiscal year ending
    December 31, 2009, and (ii) appointed
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) to serve as the
    Company’s independent auditor for 2009. Deloitte continued
    as the Company’s auditor for the fiscal year ending
    December 31, 2008. With the filing on February 12,
    2009, of the Company’s Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2008, Deloitte was
    dismissed as the Company’s independent auditor and the
    Company’s auditor-client relationship with Deloitte
    effectively ceased.

Deloitte’s audit report dated February 12, 2009 on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements for the Fiscal
    Years Ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 did not contain an
    adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor was it qualified
    or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting
    principles, except that the audit report included an emphasis of
    a matter indicating that as discussed in Note 1 to the
    consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its
    method of accounting in 2007 for income taxes as a result of
    adopting ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, and in 2006 for defined
    benefit pension and other postretirement plans as a result of
    adopting ASC Topic 715, February 12, 2009 on the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2008 did not contain an adverse opinion or
    disclaimer of opinion, nor was it qualified or modified as to
    uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.

During the Company’s two most recent fiscal years and the
    subsequent interim period from January 1, 2009 through
    February 12, 2009, (i) there were no disagreements
    between the Company and Deloitte on any matters of accounting
    principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or
    auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not
    resolved to the satisfaction of Deloitte, would have caused
    Deloitte to make reference to the subject matter of the
    disagreement in its report on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements, and (ii) there were no
    “reportable events” as that term is defined in
    Item 304(a)(1)(v) of

Regulation S-K.

Deloitte has provided us with a letter stating that they agree
    that there were no such disagreements during our last two fiscal
    years ended and the subsequent interim period from
    January 1, 2009 through February 12, 2009, and we
    filed a copy of such letter under cover of

Form 8-K/A

within the time period prescribed by the SEC.

During 2007 and 2008 and the subsequent interim period from
    January 1, 2009 through February 12, 2009, neither the
    Company nor anyone acting on behalf of the Company, consulted
    PwC regarding any of the matters or events set forth in
    Item 3.04(a)(2) of

Regulation S-K.

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can
    provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
    objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of
    a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
    constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered
    relative to costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all
    control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
    assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if
    any, within the company have been detected. Because of the
    inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,
    misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be
    detected. However, our disclosure controls and procedures are
    designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their
    objectives.

The Company has adopted and maintains disclosure controls and
    procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance
    that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed
    or submitted under the Exchange Act, such as this

Form 10-K,

is collected, recorded, processed, summarized and reported
    within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
    Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure
    that such information is



accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely
    decisions regarding required disclosure. As required under
    Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15,

the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation
    of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of
    the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that
    evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures
    are effective.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting, as defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

Management conducted an assessment of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on the framework
    and criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework. Based on the
    assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31,
    2009, the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting is effective based on those criteria.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, has audited the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements and the effectiveness of internal controls
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 as stated
    in their report included herein.

Changes in
    Internal Control

There have been no changes in internal controls over the
    financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal
    quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
    to materially affect our internal controls over financial
    reporting.
