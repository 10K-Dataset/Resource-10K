Manufacturing and Operations

Global Ceramic Segment

The Company’s tile manufacturing operations are vertically integrated from the production of raw material for body and glaze preparation to the manufacturing and distribution of ceramic and porcelain tile. The Company believes that its manufacturing organization offers competitive advantages due to its ability to manufacture a differentiated product line consisting of one of the industry’s broadest product offerings of colors, textures and finishes and its ability to utilize the industry’s newest technology, as well as the industry’s largest offering of trim and decorative pieces.

The manufacturing facilities for roofing elements, insulation boards, MDF, chipboards and other wood products in the Flooring ROW segment are all configured for cost-efficient manufacturing and production flexibility and are competitive in the European market.

Inputs and Suppliers

Global Ceramic Segment

The principal raw materials used in the production of ceramic tile are clay, talc, industrial minerals and glazes.  The Company has long-term clay mining rights in the U.S. and Russia that satisfy a portion of its clay requirements for producing tile. The Company also purchases a number of different grades of clay for the manufacture of its tile.  The Company has entered into long-term supply agreements for a portion of its talc requirements. Glazes are used on a significant percentage of manufactured tiles.  Glazes consist of frit (ground glass), zircon, stains and other materials, with frit being the largest ingredient. The Company manufactures a significant amount of its frit requirements.  The Company believes that there is an adequate supply of all grades of clay, talc and industrial minerals that are readily available from a number of independent sources.  If these suppliers were unable to satisfy the Company's requirements, the Company believes that alternative supply arrangements would be available.

Flooring NA Segment

The principal raw materials used in the production of carpet and rugs are nylon, triexta, polyester, polypropylene, recycled post-consumer plastics, synthetic backing materials, latex and various dyes and chemicals, the majority of which are petroleum based. The Company uses wood chips, wood veneers, lumber, and resins in its production of laminate and hardwood products.  In its vinyl flooring operations, the Company uses plasticizers and pvc resins. Major raw materials used in the Company’s manufacturing process are available from independent sources and the Company obtains most of its raw materials from major suppliers providing inputs to each major product category. If these suppliers were unable to satisfy the requirements, the Company believes that alternative supply arrangements would be available. Although the market for raw materials is sensitive to temporary disruptions, the North American flooring industry has not experienced a significant shortage of raw materials in recent years.

Flooring ROW Segment

The principal raw materials used in the production of boards, laminate and hardwood flooring are wood, paper and resins. The wood suppliers provide a variety of wood species giving the Company a cost-effective and secure supply of raw material. In its vinyl flooring operations, the Company uses glass fiber, plasticizers and pvc resins. Major raw materials used in the Company’s manufacturing process are available from independent sources and the Company has long-standing relationships with a number of suppliers.

Industry and Competition

The Company is the largest flooring manufacturer in a fragmented industry composed of a wide variety of companies from small privately held firms to large multinationals.  In


, the U.S. floor covering industry reported $21.8 billion in sales, up approximately 5.6% over 2013's sales of $20.7 billion.  In


, the primary categories of flooring in the U.S., based on sales, were carpet and rug (49%), hardwood (15%), resilient (includes vinyl and LVT) and rubber (14%), ceramic tile (12%), stone (6%) and laminate (5%).  In


, the primary categories of flooring in the U.S., based on square feet, were carpet and rug (56%), resilient (includes vinyl and LVT) and rubber (18%), ceramic tile (13%), hardwood (7%), laminate (5%) and stone (1%).  Each of these categories is influenced by the residential construction, commercial construction, and residential remodeling markets. These markets are influenced by many factors including consumer confidence, spending for durable goods, interest rates, availability of credit, turnover in housing and the overall strength of the economy.

The principal methods of competition within the floor covering industry generally are service, style, quality, price, product innovation and technology. In each of the markets, price and market coverage are particularly important because there is limited differentiation among competing product lines. The Company’s investments in manufacturing equipment, computer systems and



Index to Financial Statements

distribution network, as well as the Company’s marketing strategy, contribute to its ability to compete on the basis of performance, quality, style and service, rather than just price.

Global Ceramic Segment

Globally, the ceramic tile industry is significantly fragmented. Based on industry publications, the 2014 market sales globally for ceramic tile and stone surfaces was over $73 billion. The Company faces competition in the ceramic tile flooring market from a large number of foreign and domestic manufacturers who all compete for sales of ceramic tile to customers. The Company believes it is the largest manufacturer, distributor and marketer of ceramic tile in the world. The Company also believes it is the largest manufacturer and distributor of ceramic tile in the U.S.

Flooring NA Segment

The North American carpet and rug industry is highly competitive. Based on industry publications, the top five North American carpet and rug manufacturers (including their foreign divisions) in


had carpet and rug sales in excess of $7 billion of the over $10.7 billion market. The Company believes it is one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of hardwood flooring in the U.S. The Company also believes it is the second largest producer of carpets and rugs (in terms of sales dollars) in the world based on its


net sales. The sheet vinyl and LVT industry is also highly competitive, but according to industry publications grew 10.7% in 2014. Based on industry publications the top twenty manufacturers in North America had sheet vinyl and LVT sales of $1.7 billion of the over $2.6 billion market in 2014.

Flooring ROW Segment

The Company faces competition in the laminate and hardwood flooring business from a large number of domestic and foreign manufacturers.  The Company believes it is one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of laminate flooring in the world, with a focus on high-end products.  In addition, the Company believes it has a competitive advantage in the laminate flooring market as a result of the Flooring ROW segment’s industry leading design, patented technologies and brand recognition, which allow the Company to distinguish its laminate and hardwood flooring products in the areas of finish, quality, installation and assembly. The Company faces competition in the resilient flooring channel from a large number of domestic and foreign manufacturers, but believes it has a competitive advantage in the sheet vinyl and vinyl tile (including LVT) market due to industry leading design, patented technologies, brand recognition, and vertical integration.

Patents and Trademarks

Intellectual property is important to the Company’s business and the Company relies on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to protect its interests.

The Company uses several trademarks that it considers important in the marketing of its products, including American Olean, Bigelow, Daltile, Durkan, IVC, Karastan, Lees, Marazzi, Mohawk, Pergo, Quick-Step

and Unilin. These trademarks represent innovations that highlight competitive advantages and provide differentiation from competing brands in the market.

The Flooring ROW segment owns a number of patent families in Europe and the U.S. some of which the Company licenses to manufacturers throughout the world.  The most important of these patent families is the UNICLIC family, which include the snap, pretension, clearance and the beveled edge patents.  The UNICLIC family of patents will expire in 2017.  The licensing earnings from patents included in the Flooring ROW segment's results were approximately €118 million in 2015, only a portion of which will be retained following the UNICLIC expiration. The Company continues to explore additional opportunities to generate revenue from its patent portfolio.  The licensing revenue from patents generated in the Flooring ROW segment's operations is partially offset by various expenses such as amortization, developing new technologies, filing new patents, supporting existing patents, defending patent lawsuits, collection and auditing of receivables, bad debt and other administrative activities.

Sales Terms and Major Customers

The Company’s sales terms are substantially the same as those generally available throughout the industry. The Company generally permits its customers to return products purchased from it within specified time periods from the date of sale, if the customer is not satisfied with the quality of the product.



Index to Financial Statements

During


, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of total net sales and the top 10 customers accounted for less than 20% of the Company’s net sales. The Company believes the loss of one major customer would not have a material adverse effect on its business.

Employees

As of

December 31, 2015

, the Company employed approximately 34,100 persons consisting of approximately 20,400 in the United States, approximately 5,000 in Europe, approximately 3,900 in Mexico, approximately 3,500 in Russia, approximately 1,000 in Malaysia and approximately 300 in various other countries. The majority of the Company’s European and Mexican manufacturing employees are members of unions. Most of the Company’s U.S. employees are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement. Additionally, the Company has not experienced any strikes or work stoppages in recent years. The Company believes that its relations with its employees are good.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

In addition to the other information provided in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating an investment in shares of the Company’s Common Stock.  If any of the events described in these risks were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

The floor covering industry is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, such as consumer confidence, income and spending, corporate and government spending, interest rate levels, availability of credit and demand for housing. Significant or prolonged declines in the U.S. or global economies could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

Downturns in the U.S. and global economies, negatively impact the floor covering industry and the Company’s business.  During times of economic uncertainty or decline, end consumers tend to spend less on remodeling their homes, which is how the Company derives a majority of its sales. Likewise new home construction - and the corresponding need for new flooring materials - tends to slow down during recessionary periods. Although the impact of a decline in new construction activity is typically accompanied by an increase in remodeling and replacement activity, these activities lagged in the most recent downturn. Although the difficult economic conditions have improved in the U.S., European and other markets have not recovered as quickly and there may be additional downturns that could cause the industry to deteriorate in the foreseeable future. A significant or prolonged decline in residential or commercial remodeling or new construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations.

The Company may be unable to predict customer preferences or demand accurately, or to respond to technological developments.

The Company operates in a market sector where demand is strongly influenced by rapidly changing customer preferences as to product design and technical features.  Failure to quickly and effectively respond to changing customer demand or technological developments could have a material adverse effect on our business.



Index to Financial Statements

The Company faces intense competition in the flooring industry that could decrease demand for the Company’s products or force it to lower prices, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

The floor covering industry is highly competitive. The Company faces competition from a number of manufacturers and independent distributors.  Maintaining the Company’s competitive position may require substantial investments in the Company’s product development efforts, manufacturing facilities, distribution network and sales and marketing activities. Competitive pressures may also result in decreased demand for the Company’s products or force the Company to lower prices. Moreover, a strong U.S. dollar combined with lower fuel costs may contribute to more attractive pricing for imports that compete with the Company’s products, which may put pressure on the Company’s pricing.  Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

Changes in the global economy could affect the Company’s overall availability and cost of credit.

Despite recent improvement in overall economic conditions in the U.S., continued weakness elsewhere in the world or changes in market conditions could impact the Company’s ability to obtain financing in the future, including any financing necessary to refinance existing indebtedness.  The cost and availability of credit during uncertain economic times could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition.

Further, negative economic conditions may factor into the Company’s periodic credit ratings assessment by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's"), Standard & Poor’s Financial Services, LLC ("S&P") and Fitch, Inc.  Any future changes in the credit rating agencies’ methodology in assessing our credit strength and any downgrades in the Company’s credit ratings could increase the cost of its existing credit and could adversely affect the cost of and ability to obtain additional credit in the future. The Company can provide no assurances that downgrades will not occur.

If the Company were unable to meet certain covenants contained in its existing credit facilities, it may be required to repay borrowings under the credit facilities prior to their maturity and may lose access to the credit facilities for additional borrowings that may be necessary to fund its operations and growth strategy.

On March 26, 2015, the Company entered into a

$1,800 million

, senior revolving credit facility (the "2015 Senior Credit Facility").  As of

December 31, 2015

, the amount utilized under the 2015 Senior Credit Facility, including the commercial paper issuance, was

$892.3 million

resulting in a total of

$907.7 million

available. The amount utilized included

$756.9 million

of commercial paper issued,

$134.1 million

of direct borrowings, and

$1.4 million

of standby letters of credit related to various insurance contracts and foreign vendor commitments. In addition, on December 19, 2012, the Company entered into an on-balance sheet U.S. trade accounts receivable securitization agreement (the "Securitization Facility") that after an amendment on September 11, 2014 allows the Company to borrow up to $500 million based on available accounts receivable and is secured by the Company's U.S. trade accounts receivable. At

December 31, 2015

, the amount utilized under the Securitization Facility was

$500.0 million

.

During the term of the credit facilities, if the Company’s cash flow is worse than expected or the U.S. trade accounts receivables are lower than expected, the Company may need to refinance all or a portion of its indebtedness through a public and/or private debt offering or a new bank facility and may not be able to do so on terms acceptable to it, or at all. If the Company is unable to access debt markets at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts due to credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, or weakness in the Company's businesses, the Company’s ability to finance its operations or repay existing debt obligations may be materially and adversely affected.

Additionally, the credit facilities include certain affirmative and negative covenants that impose restrictions on the Company’s financial and business operations, including limitations on liens, indebtedness, fundamental changes, asset dispositions, dividends and other similar restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, payments and modifications of certain existing debt, future negative pledges, and changes in the nature of the Company’s business.  In addition, the 2015 Senior Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of at least 3.0 to 1.0 and a Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of no more than 3.75 to 1.0.  A failure to comply with the obligations contained in our current or future credit facilities or indentures relating to our outstanding public debt could result in an event of default or an acceleration of debt under other instruments that may contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. We cannot be certain that we would have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments.

Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and may affect the comparability of results between the Company’s financial periods.



Index to Financial Statements

The results of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries reported in the local currency are translated into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The exchange rates between some of these currencies and the U.S. Dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future. The Company may not be able to manage effectively the Company’s currency translation risks, and volatility in currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and affect comparability of the Company’s results between financial periods.

The Company has significant operations in emerging markets, including Bulgaria, Malaysia, Mexico and Russia, therefore, has exposure to doing business in potentially unstable areas of the world.

Operations in emerging markets are subject to greater risk than more developed markets, including in some cases significant legal, economic and political risks.  Market conditions and the political structures that support them are subject to rapid change in these economies, and the Company may not be able to react quickly enough to protect its assets and business operations.  In particular, developing markets in which the Company operates may be characterized by one or more of the following:

•

heavy state control of natural resources and energy supplies;

•

state ownership of transportation and supply chain assets;

•

high protective tariffs and inefficient customs processes;

•

complex and conflicting laws and regulations, which may be inconsistently or arbitrarily enforced;

•

underdeveloped infrastructure;

•

high incidences of corruption in state regulatory agencies;

•

high crime rates;

•

volatile inflation;

•

widespread poverty and resulting political instability;

•

compliance with laws governing international relations, including U.S. laws that relate to sanctions and corruptions;

•

immature legal and banking systems; and

•

uncertainty with respect to title to real and personal property.

Changes in any one or a combination of these factors could have a material adverse affect on the Company’s business.

In periods of rising costs, the Company may be unable to pass raw materials, labor, energy and fuel-related cost increases on to its customers, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.

The prices of raw materials, labor, energy and fuel-related costs vary significantly with market conditions. While the Company is currently experiencing a low-cost environment with respect to energy and fuel related costs, the Company expects these costs to rise in the future. Although the Company generally attempts to pass on increases in raw material, labor, energy and fuel-related costs to its customers, the Company’s ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase, competitive pressures and market conditions for the Company’s products. There have been in the past, and may be in the future, periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be recovered. During such periods of time, the Company’s business may be materially adversely affected.

The Company may be unable to obtain raw materials or sourced product on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.

The principal raw materials used in the Company’s manufacturing operations include triexta, nylon, polypropylene, and polyester resins and fibers, which are used in the Company’s carpet and rugs business; clay, talc, nepheline syenite and glazes, including frit (ground glass), zircon and stains, which are used in the Company’s ceramic tile business; wood, paper, and resins which are used in the Company’s wood and laminate flooring business; and glass fiber, plasticizers, and pvc resins, which are used in the Company’s vinyl and luxury vinyl tile business. In addition to raw materials, the Company sources finished goods. For certain raw materials and sourced products, the Company is dependent on one or a small number of suppliers. An adverse change in the Company’s relationship with such a supplier, the financial condition of such a supplier or such supplier’s ability to manufacture or deliver such raw materials or sourced products to the Company could lead to an interruption of supply or require the Company to purchase more expensive alternatives. An extended interruption in the supply of these or other raw materials or



Index to Financial Statements

sourced products used in the Company’s business or in the supply of suitable substitute materials or products would disrupt the Company’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

The Company relies on information systems in managing the Company’s operations and any system failure or

deficiencies of such systems may have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.

The Company’s businesses rely on sophisticated software applications to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data. The Company relies on these systems to, among other things:

•

facilitate the purchase, management, distribution, and payment for inventory items;

•

manage and monitor the daily operations of our distribution network;

•

receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis;

•

manage accurate billing to and collections from customers;

•

control logistics and quality control for our retail operations;

•

manage financial reporting; and

•

monitor point of sale activity.

We also rely on our computer hardware, software and network for the storage, delivery and transmission of data to our sales and distribution systems, and certain of our production processes are managed and conducted by computer.

Any event causes interruptions to the input, retrieval and transmission of data or increase in the service time, whether caused by human error, natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses, system conversion, intentional acts of vandalism, various forms of cybercrimes including and not limited to hacking, intrusions, malware or otherwise, could disrupt our normal operations. There can be no assurance that we can effectively carry out our disaster recovery plan to handle the failure of our information systems, or that we will be able to restore our operational capacity within sufficient time to avoid material disruption to our business. The occurrence of any of these events could cause unanticipated disruptions in service, decreased customer service and customer satisfaction, harm to our reputation and loss or misappropriation of sensitive information, which could result in loss of customers, increased operating expenses and financial losses. Any such events could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.

The Company’s inability to protect its intellectual property rights or collect license revenues, with respect to the Company’s patented laminate flooring technology, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

The profit margins of certain of the Company’s businesses, particularly the Company’s laminate flooring business, depend in part upon the Company’s ability to obtain, maintain and license proprietary technology used in the Company’s principal product families. The Company relies, in part, on the patent, trade secret and trademark laws of the U.S., countries in the European Union and elsewhere, as well as confidentiality agreements with some of the Company’s employees, to protect that technology.

The Company has obtained a number of patents relating to the Company’s products and associated methods and has filed applications for additional patents, including the UNICLIC and Pergo family of patents, which protects its interlocking laminate flooring technology. The Company generates license revenue from these patents, the majority of which will expire in 2017. The Company continues to develop new sources of revenue that may partially offset the expiration of its revenue-producing patents. The failure to develop alternative revenues could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.

In addition, the Company cannot assure investors that any patents owned by or issued to it will provide the Company with competitive advantages, that third parties will not challenge these patents, or that the Company’s pending patent applications will be approved. The Company may be unable to prevent competitors and/or third parties from using the Company's technology without the Company's authorization, independently developing technology that is similar to that of the Company or designing around the Company's patents. The use of the Company's technology or similar technology by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage the Company has developed, cause the Company to lose sales or otherwise

Furthermore, despite the Company’s efforts, the Company may be unable to prevent competitors and/or third parties from using the Company’s technology without the Company’s authorization, independently developing technology that is similar to that of the Company or designing around the Company’s patents. The use of the Company’s technology or similar technology by



Index to Financial Statements

others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage the Company has developed, cause the Company to lose sales or otherwise harm the Company’s business.

The Company has obtained and applied for numerous U.S. and foreign service marks and trademark registrations and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional service marks and trademarks, as appropriate. The Company cannot guarantee that any of the Company’s pending or future applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities.  A failure to obtain trademark registrations in the U.S. and in other countries could limit the Company’s ability to protect the Company’s trademarks and impede the Company’s marketing efforts in those jurisdictions and could have a material effect on the Company’s business.

The Company generally requires third parties with access to the Company’s trade secrets to agree to keep such information confidential. While such measures are intended to protect the Company’s trade secrets, there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that the Company will have adequate remedies for any breach or that the Company’s confidential and proprietary information and technology will not be independently developed by or become otherwise known to third parties. In any of these circumstances, the Company’s competitiveness could be significantly impaired, which would limit the Company’s growth and future revenue.

The Company may experience certain risks associated with acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments.

The Company intends to grow its business through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. Growth through acquisitions involves risks, many of which may continue to affect the Company after the acquisition. The Company cannot give assurance that an acquired company will achieve the levels of revenue, profitability and production that the Company expects. Acquisitions may require the issuance of additional securities or the incurrence of additional indebtedness, which may dilute the ownership interests of existing security holders or impose higher interest costs on the Company. Additional challenges related to the Company's acquisition strategy include:

•

maintaining executive offices in different locations;

•

manufacturing and selling different types of products through different distribution channels;

•

conducting business from various locations;

•

maintaining different operating systems and software on different computer hardware; and

•

retaining key employees.

Failure to successfully manage and integrate an acquisition with the Company’s existing operations could lead to the potential loss of customers of the acquired business, the potential loss of employees who may be vital to the new operations, the potential loss of business opportunities or other adverse consequences that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. Even if integration occurs successfully, failure of the acquisition to achieve levels of anticipated sales growth, profitability, or otherwise perform as expected, may result in goodwill or other asset impairments or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

In addition, we have made certain investments, including through joint ventures, in which we have a minority equity interest and lack management and operational control. The controlling joint venture partner may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of the controlling joint venture partner, or the joint venture company, may result in harm to our reputation or adversely affect the value of our investment in the joint venture.

A failure to identify suitable acquisition candidates or partners for strategic investments and to complete acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

As part of the Company’s business strategy, the Company intends to pursue a wide array of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of complementary businesses, as well as strategic investments and joint ventures. Although the Company regularly evaluates such opportunities, the Company may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates or to obtain sufficient financing on acceptable terms to fund such strategic transactions.

The Company manufactures, sources and sells many products internationally and is exposed to risks associated with doing business globally.

The Company's international activities are significant to its manufacturing capacity, revenues and profits, and the Company is further expanding internationally. The Company sells products, operates plants and invests in companies around the world.  Currently, the Company's Flooring ROW segment has significant operations in Europe, Russia, Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand, and the Company's Global Ceramic segment has significant operations in Europe, Russia and Mexico.  In addition, the Company has invested in joint ventures in Brazil and India related to laminate flooring.

The business, regulatory and political environments in these countries differ from those in the U.S.  The Company’s international sales, operations and investments are subject to risks and uncertainties, including:

•

changes in foreign country regulatory requirements;

•

differing business practices associated with foreign operations;

•

various import/export restrictions and the availability of required import/export licenses;

•

imposition of foreign tariffs and other trade barriers;

•

foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;

•

differing inflationary or deflationary market pressures;

•

foreign country tax rules, regulations and other requirements, such as changes in tax rates and statutory and judicial interpretations in tax laws;

•

differing labor laws and changes in those laws;

•

work stoppages and disruptions in the shipping of imported and exported products;

•

government price controls;

•

extended payment terms and the inability to collect accounts receivable;

•

potential difficulties repatriating cash from non-U.S. subsidiaries; and

•

compliance with laws governing international relations, including those U.S. laws that relate to sanctions and corruption.

The Company cannot assure investors that it will succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies to address the foregoing risks effectively in each location where the Company does business, and, therefore that the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

Negative tax consequences could materially and adversely affect the Company's business.

The Company is subject to the tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which we operate.  These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to our facts is sometimes open to interpretation.  In calculating the provision for income taxes, we must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws.  Our domestic and international tax liabilities are largely dependent upon the distribution of profit before tax among these many jurisdictions.  However, it also includes estimates of additional tax which may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the Company that could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets.  Our future results of operations and tax liability could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the overall profitability of the Company, changes in tax legislation and rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns, and ongoing assessments of our tax exposures.

The Company has been, and in the future may be, subject to costs, liabilities and other obligations under existing or new laws and regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

The Company is subject to increasingly numerous and complex laws, regulations and licensing requirements in each of the jurisdictions in which the Company conducts business. The Company faces risks and uncertainties related to compliance with such laws and regulations. In addition, new laws and regulations may be enacted in the U.S. or abroad that may require the Company to incur additional personnel-related, environmental, or other costs on an ongoing basis, such as recently enacted healthcare legislation in the United States.



Index to Financial Statements

In particular, the Company’s operations are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, and the use, storage, treatment, recycling and disposal of materials and finished product. The applicable requirements under these laws are subject to amendment, to the imposition of new or additional requirements and to changing interpretations of agencies or courts. The Company could incur material expenditures to comply with new or existing regulations, including fines and penalties and increased costs of its operations. For example, our manufacturing facilities may become subject to further limitations on the emission of “greenhouse gases” due to public policy concerns regarding climate change issues or other environmental or health and safety concerns. While the form of any additional regulations cannot be predicted, a “cap-and-trade” system similar to the system that applies to our businesses in the European Union could be adopted in the United States. The Company’s manufacturing processes use a significant amount of energy, especially natural gas. Any such “cap-and-trade” system or other limitations imposed on the emission of “greenhouse gases” could require us to increase our capital expenditures, use our cash to acquire emission credits or restructure our manufacturing operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

The Company’s business operations could suffer significant losses from natural disasters, catastrophes, fire or other unexpected events.

Many of the Company’s business activities involve substantial investments in manufacturing facilities and many products are produced at a limited number of locations. These facilities could be materially damaged by natural disasters, such as floods, tornados, hurricanes and earthquakes, or by fire or other unexpected events. The Company could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from such events, including damage to its reputation, and/or suffer material losses in operational capacity, which could have a material adverse impact on its business.

The Company may be exposed to litigation, claims and other legal proceedings relating to its products, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to a variety of product-related claims, lawsuits and legal proceedings, including those relating to product liability, product warranty, product recall, personal injury, and other matters. A very large claim or several similar claims asserted by a a large class of plaintiffs could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, if the Company is unable to successfully defend against or resolve these matters or if its insurance coverage is insufficient to satisfy any judgments against the Company or settlements relating to these matters. Although the Company has product liability insurance, the policies may not provide coverage for certain claims against the Company or may not be sufficient to cover all possible liabilities. Further, the Company may not be able to maintain insurance at commercially acceptable premium levels. Moreover, adverse publicity arising from claims made against the Company, even if the claims are not successful, could adversely affect the Company’s reputation or the reputation and sales of its products.

Third parties may claim that the Company infringed their intellectual property or proprietary rights, which could cause it to incur significant expenses or prevent it from selling the Company’s products.

In the past, third parties have claimed that certain technologies incorporated in the Company’s products infringe their patent rights.  The Company cannot be certain that the Company’s products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others. Historically, patent applications in the U.S. and some foreign countries have not been publicly disclosed until the patent is issued (or, in some recent cases, until 18 months following submission), and the Company may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to the Company’s products or processes. If patents are later issued on these applications, the Company may be liable for infringement.

As a result, the Company might be required to pay substantial damages (including punitive damages and attorney’s fees), discontinue the use and sale of infringing products, expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology or obtain licenses authorizing the use of infringing technology. There can be no assurance that licenses for disputed technology or intellectual property rights would be available on reasonable commercial terms, if at all. In the event of a successful claim against the Company along with failure to develop or license a substitute technology, the Company’s business would be materially and adversely affected.

The long-term performance of the Company’s business relies on its ability to attract, develop and retain talented management.



Index to Financial Statements

To be successful, the Company must attract, develop and retain qualified and talented personnel in management, sales, marketing, product design, and operations, and as it considers entering new international markets, skilled personnel familiar with those markets. The Company competes with multinational firms for these employees and invests resources in recruiting, developing, motivating and retaining them. The failure to attract, develop, motivate and retain key employees could negatively affect the Company’s competitive position and its operating results.

The Company is subject to changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both costs and the risk of noncompliance.

The Company’s stock is publicly traded. As a result, the Company is subject to the rules and regulations of federal and state agencies and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. These entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange, frequently issue new requirements and regulations. The Company’s efforts to comply with the regulations and interpretations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative costs and diversion of management’s time and attention from profit generating activities to compliance activities.

Declines in the Company’s business conditions may result in an impairment of the Company’s assets which could result in a material non-cash charge.

A significant or prolonged decrease in the Company’s market capitalization, including a decline in stock price, or a negative long-term performance outlook, could result in an impairment of its assets which results when the carrying value of the Company’s assets exceed their fair value.

Forward-Looking Information

Certain of the statements in this Form 10-K, particularly those anticipating future performance, business prospects, growth and operating strategies, and similar matters, and those that include the words “could,” “should,” “believes,” “anticipates,” “expects” and “estimates” or similar expressions constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. For those statements, Mohawk claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. There can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements will be accurate because they are based on many assumptions, which involve risks and uncertainties. The following important factors could cause future results to differ: changes in economic or industry conditions; competition; inflation and deflation in raw material prices and other input costs; inflation and deflation in consumer markets; energy costs and supply; timing and level of capital expenditures; timing and implementation of price increases for the Company’s products; impairment charges; integration of acquisitions; international operations; introduction of new products; rationalization of operations; tax, product and other claims; litigation; and other risks identified in Mohawk’s SEC reports and public announcements.

Legal Proceedings

The Company is involved in litigation from time to time in the regular course of its business. Except as noted below, there are no material legal proceedings pending or known by the Company to be contemplated to which the Company is a party or to which any of its property is subject.

Polyurethane Foam Litigation

Beginning in August 2010, a series of civil lawsuits were initiated in several U.S. federal courts alleging that certain manufacturers of polyurethane foam products and competitors of the Company’s carpet underlay division had engaged in price fixing in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The Company was named as a defendant in a number of the individual cases (the first filed on August 26, 2010), as well as in

two

consolidated amended class action complaints (the first filed on February 28, 2011, on behalf of a class of all direct purchasers of polyurethane foam products, and the second filed on March 21, 2011, on behalf of a class of indirect purchasers). All pending cases in which the Company was named as a defendant were filed in or transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio for consolidated pre-trial proceedings under the name

In re: Polyurethane Foam Antitrust Litigation, Case No. 1:10-MDL-02196.

In these actions, the plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and/or a class of purchasers, sought damages allegedly suffered as a result of alleged overcharges in the price of polyurethane foam products from at least 1999 to the present. Any damages actually awarded at trial would have been subject to being tripled under US antitrust laws.

On March 23, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement to settle all claims brought by the class of direct purchasers, and the trial court entered an order granting final approval of this settlement on November 19, 2015. On April 30, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement to settle all claims brought by the class of indirect purchasers, and the trial court entered an order granting final approval of this settlement on January 27, 2016. The Company has also entered into settlement agreements resolving all of the claims brought on behalf of all but one of the consolidated individual lawsuits. The Company denies all allegations of wrongdoing but settled the class actions and individual lawsuits to avoid the uncertainty, risk, expense and distraction of protracted litigation.

The Company remains a defendant in one case involving an individual purchaser of polyurethane foam products not sold by the Company. This sole remaining case is in its early stages, no trial date has been set, and the amount of the damages has not yet been specified by the plaintiff. In addition to as yet unspecified actual damages, the plaintiff also seeks attorney fees, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, court costs and injunctive relief against future violations.

In December 2011, the Company was named as a defendant in a Canadian Class action,

Hi! Neighbor Floor Covering Co. Limited v. Hickory Springs Manufacturing Company, et al

., filed in the Superior Court of Justice of Ontario, Canada and

Options Consommateures v. Vitafoam, Inc. et.al.

, filed in the Superior Court of Justice of Quebec, Montreal, Canada, both of which alleged similar claims against the Company as raised in the U.S. actions and sought unspecified damages and punitive damages. On June 12, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement to settle all claims brought by the class of Canadian plaintiffs, as well as a separate action pending in the Supreme Court of British Columbia. The courts in Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia have all approved the settlement although certain administrative issues remain. The Company continues to deny all allegations of wrongdoing but settled the case to avoid the uncertainty, risk, expense and distraction of protracted litigation.

During the

twelve months ended

December 31, 2015

the Company recorded a

$122.5 million

charge within selling, general and administrative expenses for the settlement and defense of the antitrust cases.  The Company believes that adequate provisions for resolution of all of these cases have been made. The Company does not believe that the ultimate outcome of the remaining case will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition.

Belgian Tax Matter

In January 2012, the Company received a

€23.8 million

assessment from the Belgian tax authority related to its year ended December 31, 2008, asserting that the Company had understated its Belgian taxable income for that year. The Company filed a formal protest in the first quarter of 2012 refuting the Belgian tax authority's position.  The Belgian tax authority set aside the assessment in the third quarter of 2012 and refunded all related deposits, including interest income of

€1.6 million

earned on such deposits. However, on October 23, 2012, the Belgian tax authority notified the Company of its intent to increase the Company's taxable income for the year ended December 31, 2008 under a revised theory. On December 28, 2012, the Belgian tax authority issued assessments for the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2009, in the amounts of

€46.1 million

and

€35.6 million

, respectively, including penalties, but excluding interest. The Company filed a formal protest during the first quarter of 2013 relating to the new assessments. In September 2013, the Belgian tax authority denied the Company's protests, and the Company has brought these two years before the Court of First Appeal in Bruges. In December 2013, the Belgian tax authority issued additional assessments related to the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007, and 2010, in the amounts of

€38.8 million

,

€39.6 million

, and

€43.1 million

, respectively, including penalties, but excluding interest.  The Company filed formal protests during the first quarter of 2014, refuting the Belgian tax authority's position for each of the years assessed.  In the quarter ended June 28, 2014, the Company received a formal assessment for the year ended December 31, 2008, totaling

€30.1 million

, against which the Company also submitted its formal protest. All 4 additional years have been brought before the Court of First Appeal in November 2014. In January of 2015, the Company met with the Court of First Appeal in Bruges, Belgium and agreed with the Belgium tax authorities to consolidate and argue the issues regarding the years 2005 and 2009, and apply the ruling to all of the open years (to the extent there are no additional facts/procedural arguments in the other years).

On January 27, 2016, the Court of First Appeal in Bruges, Belgium ruled in favor of the Company with respect to the calendar years ending December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2009. The Company anticipates that the Belgian tax authority will appeal this ruling.

The Company disagrees with the views of the Belgian tax authority on this matter and will persist in its vigorous defense if there is an appeal. Although there can be no assurances, the Company believes the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition but could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, liquidity or cash flows in a given quarter or year.

The Company believes that adequate provisions for resolution of all contingencies, claims and pending litigation have been made for probable losses that are reasonably estimable.  These contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and we are unable to estimate the amount or range of loss, if any, in excess of amounts accrued.  The Company does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition but could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, cash flows or liquidity in a given quarter or year.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

During the second quarter of 2015, the Company realigned its reportable segments to reflect how the Company’s results will be reported by management. The Company has reorganized its business into three segments: Global Ceramic, Flooring North America ("Flooring NA") and Flooring Rest of the World ("Flooring ROW"). In order to leverage its relationships and distribution capabilities, the Company organized its carpet, wood, laminate, luxury vinyl tile ("LVT") and vinyl operations by geography into the Flooring NA segment and Flooring ROW segment. The Company did not make any changes to the Global Ceramic segment. Previously reported segment results have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

This new segment structure is consistent with the strategic objective that management now applies to manage the growth and profitability of the Company’s business. The Global Ceramic segment includes all worldwide tile and natural stone operations. The Flooring NA segment includes North American operations in all product categories except tile and natural stone. The new segment combines the former Carpet segment with the North American operations of the former Laminate and Wood segment and the North American operations of the Company’s newly acquired LVT and vinyl flooring businesses. The Flooring ROW segment includes operations outside of North America in all product categories except tile and natural stone. The new segment combines the European and Rest of the World operations of the former Laminate and Wood segment and the European and Rest of the World operations of the Company’s newly acquired LVT and vinyl flooring businesses.

The Global Ceramic segment designs, manufactures, sources and markets a broad line of ceramic tile, porcelain tile, natural stone and other products, which it distributes primarily in North America, Europe and Russia through its network of regional distribution centers and Company-operated service centers using Company-operated trucks, common carriers or rail transportation. The segment’s product lines are sold through Company-operated service centers, independent distributors, home center retailers, tile and flooring retailers and contractors. The Flooring NA segment designs, manufactures, sources and markets its floor covering product lines, including carpets, rugs, carpet pad, hardwood, laminate and vinyl products, including LVT, which it distributes through its network of regional distribution centers and satellite warehouses using Company-operated trucks, common carrier or rail transportation. The segment’s product lines are sold through various selling channels, including independent floor covering retailers, distributors, home centers, mass merchandisers, department stores, shop at home, buying groups, commercial contractors and commercial end users. The Flooring ROW segment designs, manufactures, sources, licenses and markets laminate, hardwood flooring, roofing elements, insulation boards, medium-density fiberboard ("MDF"), chipboards, other wood products and vinyl products, including LVT, which it distributes primarily in Europe and Russia through various selling channels, which include retailers, independent distributors and home centers.

Senior Credit Facility

On

September 25, 2013

, the Company entered into a

$1,000.0 million

,


-year, senior revolving credit facility (the "2013 Senior Credit Facility").  The 2013 Senior Credit Facility provided for a maximum of

$1,000.0 million

of revolving credit, including limited amounts of credit in the form of letters of credit and swingline loans. The Company paid financing costs of

$1.8 million

in connection with its 2013 Senior Credit Facility. These costs were deferred and, along with unamortized costs of

$11.4 million

related to the Company’s previous credit facility, were amortized over the term of the 2013 Senior Credit Facility.

On March 26, 2015, the Company amended and restated the 2013 Senior Credit Facility increasing its size from

$1,000.0 million

to

$1,800.0 million

and extending the maturity from

September 25, 2018

to

March 26, 2020

(the "2015 Senior Credit Facility").  The 2015 Senior Credit Facility eliminates certain provisions in the 2013 Senior Credit Facility, including those that: (a) accelerated the maturity date to 90 days prior to the maturity of senior notes due in January 2016 if certain specified liquidity levels were not met; and (b) required that certain subsidiaries guarantee the Company's obligations if the Company’s credit ratings fell below investment grade.  The 2015 Senior Credit Facility also modified certain negative covenants to provide the Company with additional flexibility, including that to make acquisitions and incur indebtedness.

At the Company's election, revolving loans under the 2015 Senior Credit Facility bear interest at annual rates equal to either (a) LIBOR for 1, 2, 3 or 6 month periods, as selected by the Company, plus an applicable margin ranging between

1.00%



Index to Financial Statements

and

1.75%

(

1.25%

), or (b) the higher of the Wells Fargo Bank, National Association prime rate, the Federal Funds rate plus

0.5%

, and a monthly LIBOR rate plus

1.0%

, plus an applicable margin ranging between

0.00%

and

0.75%

(

0.25%

as of

December 31, 2015

).  The Company also pays a commitment fee to the lenders under the 2015 Senior Credit Facility on the average amount by which the aggregate commitments of the lenders' exceed utilization of the 2015 Senior Credit Facility ranging from

0.10%

to

0.225%

per annum. As of

December 31, 2015

, the Company is paying a commitment fee of

0.15%

. The applicable margins and the commitment fee are determined based on whichever of the Company's Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio or its senior unsecured debt rating (or if not available, corporate family rating) results in the lower applicable margins and commitment fee (with applicable margins and the commitment fee increasing as that ratio increases or those ratings decline, as applicable).

The obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries in respect of the 2015 Senior Credit Facility are unsecured.

The 2015 Senior Credit Facility includes certain affirmative and negative covenants that impose restrictions on the Company's financial and business operations, including limitations on liens, subsidiary indebtedness, fundamental changes, asset dispositions, dividends and other similar restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, future negative pledges, and changes in the nature of the Company's business.  These limitations are subject to exceptions.  The Company is also required to maintain a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of at least

3.0

to 1.0 and a Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of no more than

3.75

to 1.0, each as of the last day of any fiscal quarter.

The 2015 Senior Credit Facility also contains customary representations and warranties and events of default, subject to customary grace periods.

The Company paid financing costs of

$2.6 million

in connection with its 2015 Senior Credit Facility.  These costs were deferred and, along with unamortized costs of

$8.7 million

, amounts utilized under the 2015 Senior Credit Facility included

$134.1 million

of borrowings and

$1.4 million

of standby letters of credit related to various insurance contracts and foreign vendor commitments.  The outstanding borrowings of

$756.9 million

under the Company's U.S. and European commercial paper programs as of

December 31, 2015

reduce the availability of the 2015 Senior Credit Facility.  Taking the commercial paper borrowings into account, the Company has utilized

$892.3 million

under the 2015 Senior Credit Facility resulting in a total of

$907.7 million

available under the 2015 Senior Credit Facility.

Commercial Paper

On

February 28, 2014

, the Company established a U.S. commercial paper program for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the United States capital markets. Under the commercial paper program, the Company issues commercial paper notes from time to time. On

May 21, 2015

, following the amendment and restatement of the 2013 Credit Facility, the Company expanded the amount of borrowings permitted under its U.S. commercial paper program from

$1,000.0 million

to

$1,800.0 million

.  The U.S. commercial paper notes have maturities ranging from

one

day to


days and are not subject to voluntary prepayment by the Company or redemption prior to maturity. The U.S. commercial paper notes rank pari passu with all of the Company's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.

On

July 31, 2015

, the Company established a European commercial paper program for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the Eurozone capital markets. Under the European commercial paper program, the Company issues commercial paper notes from time to time, subject to a cap equal to

€1,000.0 million

. The European commercial paper notes have maturities ranging from

one

day to


days and are not subject to voluntary prepayment by the Company or redemption prior to maturity. The European commercial paper notes rank pari passu with all of the Company's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. To the extent European commercial paper notes are issued by a subsidiary of the Company, payment on such notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company.

The Company uses its 2015 Senior Credit Facility as a liquidity backstop for its commercial paper programs. Accordingly, the total amount due and payable under all of the Company's commercial paper programs may not exceed

$1,800.0 million

(less any amounts drawn on the 2015 Senior Credit Facility) at any time.

The proceeds from the sale of commercial paper notes will be available for general corporate purposes. The Company used the initial proceeds from the sale of U.S. commercial paper notes to repay borrowings under its 2013 Senior Credit Facility and certain of its industrial revenue bonds.  The Company used the initial proceeds from the sale of European commercial paper notes to repay euro-denominated borrowings under its 2015 Senior Credit Facility. As of

December 31, 2015

, the amount utilized

On June 9, 2015, the Company issued

€500.0 million

aggregate principal amount of

2.00%

Senior Notes due

January 14, 2022

.  The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and rank pari passu with all of the Company’s existing and future unsecured indebtedness.  Interest on the Notes is payable annually in cash on

January 14

of each year, commencing on

January 14, 2016

.  The Company paid financing costs of

$4.2 million

in connection with the

2.00%

Senior Notes. These costs were deferred and are being amortized over the term of the

2.00%

Senior Notes. These costs were deferred and are being amortized over the term of the

3.85%

Senior Notes.

On January 17, 2006, the Company issued

$900.0 million

aggregate principal amount of

6.125%

Senior Notes due

January 15, 2016

. On

August 15, 2014

, the Company purchased for cash approximately

$200.0 million

aggregate principal amount of its outstanding

6.125%

senior notes due

January 15, 2016

at a price equal to

107.73%

of the principal amount, resulting in a premium to redeeming noteholders of approximately

$15.5 million

and fees of

$1.1 million

associated with the redemption.  The premium as well as the fees are included in interest expense on the condensed consolidated statement of operations as at

December 31, 2014

. On November 3, 2014, the Company purchased for cash approximately

$54.4 million

aggregate principal amount of its outstanding

6.125%

of the principal amount, resulting in a premium to redeeming noteholders of approximately

$3.5 million

. The premium is included in interest expense on the condensed consolidated statement of operations as at

December 31, 2014

.

On January 15, 2016, the Company paid the remaining approximately

$645.6 million

outstanding principal of its

6.125%

Senior Notes using cash on hand and borrowings under its 2015 Senior Credit Facility.

Accounts Receivable Securitization

On December 19, 2012, the Company entered into a

three

-year on-balance sheet trade accounts receivable securitization agreement (the "Securitization Facility"). On September 11, 2014, the Company made certain modifications to its Securitization Facility, which modifications, among other things, increased the aggregate borrowings available under the facility from

$300.0 million

to

$500.0 million

and decreased the interest margins on certain borrowings.  On

December 10, 2015

, the Company amended the terms of the Securitization Facility, reducing the applicable margin and extending the termination date from

December 19, 2015

to

December 19, 2016

.  The Company paid financing costs of

$0.3 million

in connection with this extension. These costs were deferred and are being amortized over the remaining term of the Securitization Facility.

Under the terms of the Securitization Facility, certain subsidiaries of the Company sell at a discount certain of their trade accounts receivable (the “Receivables”) to Mohawk Factoring, LLC (“Factoring”) on a revolving basis.  The Company has determined that Factoring is a bankruptcy remote subsidiary, meaning that Factoring is a separate legal entity whose assets are available to satisfy the claims of the creditors of Factoring only, not the creditors of the Company or the Company’s other subsidiaries.  Factoring may borrow up to

$500.0 million

based on the amount of eligible Receivables owned by Factoring, and Factoring has granted a security interest in all of such Receivables to the third-party lending group as collateral for such borrowings.  Amounts loaned to Factoring under the Securitization Facility bear interest at commercial paper interest rates, in the case of lenders that are commercial paper conduits, or LIBOR, in the case of lenders that are not commercial paper conduits, in each case, plus an applicable margin of

0.65%

per annum. Factoring also pays a commitment fee at a per annum rate of

0.35%

on the unused amount of each lender’s commitment.  At

December 31, 2015

, the amount utilized under the Securitization Facility was

$500.0 million

.

The Company may continue, from time to time, to retire its outstanding debt through cash purchases in the open market, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, the Company’s liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amount involved may be material.

As of

December 31, 2015

, the Company had cash of

$81.7 million

, of which

$61.2 million

was held outside the United States.  While the Company plans to permanently reinvest the cash held outside the United States, the estimated cost of repatriation for the cash as of

December 31, 2015

was approximately

$21.4 million

. The Company believes that its cash and cash equivalents



Index to Financial Statements

on hand, cash generated from operations and availability under its 2015 Senior Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet its capital expenditure, working capital and debt servicing requirements over the next twelve months.

The Company’s Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to

15 million

shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock. Since the inception of the program in 1999, a total of approximately

11.5 million

shares have been repurchased at an aggregate cost of approximately

$335.5 million

. All of these repurchases have been financed through the Company’s operations and banking arrangements. The Company did not repurchase shares during the year ended

December 31, 2015

.

Contractual obligations

The following is a summary of the Company’s future minimum payments under contractual obligations as of

December 31, 2015

(in millions):

(1)

For fixed rate debt, the Company calculated interest based on the applicable rates and payment dates. For variable rate debt, the Company estimated average outstanding balances for the respective periods and applied interest rates in effect as of

December 31, 2015

to these balances.

(2)

Includes volume commitments for natural gas, electricity and raw material purchases.

(3)

Includes the estimated pension contributions for

. The Company’s projected benefit obligation and plan assets as of

December 31, 2015

were

$23.7 million

and

$20.5 million

, respectively. The projected benefit obligation liability has not been presented in the table above due to uncertainty as to amounts and timing regarding future payments.

(4)

Excludes

$36.4 million

of non-current accrued income tax liabilities and related interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions. These liabilities have not been presented in the table above due to uncertainty as to amounts and timing regarding future payments.

(5)

Includes bank guarantees and letters of credit.

Critical Accounting Policies

In preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the Company must make decisions which impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures. Such decisions include the selection of appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates. In reaching such decisions, the Company applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis



Index to Financial Statements

of the relevant circumstances and historical experience. Actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared.

The Company’s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. Some of those significant accounting policies require the Company to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.

The Company believes the following accounting policies require it to use judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and represent critical accounting policies.

•

Accounts receivable and revenue recognition.

Revenues are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred, the price has been fixed or is determinable, and collectability can be reasonably assured. The Company provides allowances for expected cash discounts, sales allowances, returns, claims and doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debt and claims experience and periodic evaluation of specific customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. A 10% change in the Company’s allowance for discounts, returns, claims and doubtful accounts would have affected net earnings by approximately

$5 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2015

.

•

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (net realizable value).

Cost has been determined using the first-in first-out method (“FIFO”). Costs included in inventory include raw materials, direct and indirect labor and employee benefits, depreciation, general manufacturing overhead and various other costs of manufacturing. Market, with respect to all inventories, is replacement cost or net realizable value. Inventories on hand are compared against anticipated future usage, which is a function of historical usage, anticipated future selling price, expected sales below cost, excessive quantities and an evaluation for obsolescence. Actual results could differ from assumptions used to value obsolete inventory, excessive inventory or inventory expected to be sold below cost and additional reserves may be required. A 10% change in the Company’s reserve for excess or obsolete inventory would have affected net earnings by approximately

$7 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2015

.

•

Acquisition Accounting.

The fair value of the consideration we pay for each new acquisition is allocated to tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets, liabilities assumed, any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity and goodwill.  The accounting for acquisitions involves a considerable amount of judgment and estimate, including the fair value of certain forms of consideration; fair value of acquired intangible assets involving projections of future revenues and cash flows that are then either discounted at an estimated discount rate or measured at an estimated royalty rate; fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including potential contingencies; and the useful lives of the acquired assets. The assumptions used are determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation models.  Projections are developed using internal forecasts, available industry and market data and estimates of long-term rates of growth for our business. The impact of prior or future acquisitions on our financial position or results of operations may be materially impacted by the change in or initial selection of assumptions and estimates.  See Note 2-Acquisitions for further discussion of business combination accounting valuation methodology and assumptions.

•

Goodwill and other intangibles.

Goodwill is tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances. The Company considers the relationship between its market capitalization and its book value, among other factors, when reviewing for indicators of impairment. The goodwill impairment tests are based on determining the fair value of the specified reporting units based on management judgments and assumptions using the discounted cash flows and comparable company market valuation approaches. The Company has identified Global Ceramic, Flooring NA and Flooring ROW as its reporting units for the purposes of allocating goodwill and intangibles as well as assessing impairments. The valuation approaches are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change such as judgments and assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”), and comparable company market multiples. When developing these key judgments and assumptions, the Company considers economic, operational and market conditions that could impact the fair value of the reporting unit. However, estimates are inherently uncertain and represent only management’s reasonable expectations regarding future developments. These estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will, in all likelihood, differ in some respects from actual future results. Should a significant or prolonged deterioration in economic conditions occur, such as declines in spending for new construction, remodeling and replacement activities; the inability to pass increases in the costs of raw materials and fuel on to customers; or a decline in comparable company market multiples, then key judgments and assumptions could be



Index to Financial Statements

impacted. Generally, a decline in estimated after tax cash flows of more than

35%

or a more than

28%

increase in WACC or a significant or prolonged decline in market capitalization could result in an additional indication of impairment.

The impairment test for intangible assets not subject to amortization involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, royalty rates, WACC and the amount of expected future cash flows. These judgments and assumptions are subject to the variability discussed above.

The impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets, which for the Company are its trademarks, is conducted during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. The determination of fair value used in the impairment evaluation is based on discounted estimates of future sales projections attributable to ownership of the trademarks. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, royalty rates, WACC and the amount of expected future cash flows. The judgments and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with past performance and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in operating plans. Such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. The determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the trademarks. Estimated cash flows are sensitive to changes in the economy among other things.

The Company reviews its long-lived asset groups, which include intangible assets subject to amortization, which for the Company are its patents and customer relationships, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset groups may not be recoverable. Recoverability of asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of long-lived assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by these asset groups. If such asset groups are considered to be impaired, the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs of disposal and are no longer depreciated.

The Company conducted its annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles in the fourth quarter and no impairment was indicated for


.

•

Income taxes.

The Company’s effective tax rate is based on its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company’s tax expense and in evaluating the Company’s tax positions. Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in a future period. The Company evaluates the recoverability of these future tax benefits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income inherently rely on estimates, including business forecasts and other projections of financial results over an extended period of time. In the event that the Company is not able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance is provided. The Company would recognize such amounts through a charge to income in the period in which that determination is made or when tax law changes are enacted. The Company had valuation allowances of

$287.6 million

in


,

$300.5 million

in


and

$375.9 million

in


. For further information regarding the Company’s valuation allowances, see Note 13-Income Taxes.

In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the Company’s income tax positions. The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the Company’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available as of the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information, as required by the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic ("ASC") 740-10. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. As of

December 31, 2015

, the Company has

$51.0 million

accrued for uncertain tax positions. For further information regarding the Company’s uncertain tax positions, see Note 13-Income Taxes.

•

Environmental and legal accruals.

Environmental and legal accruals are estimates based on judgments made by the Company relating to ongoing environmental and legal proceedings, as disclosed in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In determining whether a liability is probable and reasonably estimable, the Company consults with its internal



Index to Financial Statements

experts. The Company believes that the amounts recorded in the accompanying financial statements are based on the best estimates and judgments available to it.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 1(v), “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies", of our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent accounting pronouncements including the dates, or expected dates of adoption, and effects, or expected effects, on our disclosures, results of operations, and financial condition.

Impact of Inflation

Inflation affects the Company’s manufacturing costs, distribution costs and operating expenses. The Company expects raw material prices, many of which are petroleum based, to fluctuate based upon worldwide supply and demand of commodities utilized in the Company’s production processes. Although the Company attempts to pass on increases in raw material, energy and fuel-related costs to its customers, the Company’s ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase, competitive pressures and market conditions for the Company’s products. There have been in the past, and may be in the future, periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be fully recovered. In the past, the Company has often been able to enhance productivity and develop new product innovations to help offset increases in costs resulting from inflation in its operations.

Seasonality

The Company is a calendar year-end company. With respect to its Flooring NA and Global Ceramic segments, its results of operations for the first quarter tend to be the weakest followed by the fourth quarter. The second and third quarters typically produce higher net sales and operating income in these segments. These results are primarily due to consumer residential spending patterns which have historically decreased during the holiday season and the first two months following. The Flooring ROW segment’s second quarter typically produces the highest net sales and earnings followed by a moderate first and fourth quarter and a weaker third quarter.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

The Company’s market risk is impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and certain commodity prices. Financial exposures to these risks are monitored as an integral part of the Company’s risk management program, which seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect that the volatility of these markets may have on its operating results. The Company does not regularly engage in speculative transactions, nor does it regularly hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Excluding the hedge of net investment discussed in Note 1(o) "Hedges of Net Investments in Non-U.S. Operations", of our accompanying consolidated financial statements and supplementary data in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company did not have any derivative contracts outstanding as of

December 31, 2015

and


.

Interest Rate Risk

As of

December 31, 2015

, approximately

57%

of the Company’s debt portfolio was comprised of fixed-rate debt and

43%

was floating-rate debt.  The Company believes that probable near-term changes in interest rates would not materially affect its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The annual impact on interest expense of a one-percentage point interest rate change on the outstanding balance of our variable rate debt as of December 31, 2015 would be approximately $14 million or $0.12 to diluted EPS.

Foreign Exchange Risk

As a result of being a global enterprise, there is exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect the operating results and financial condition of the Company.  Principal foreign currency exposures relate primarily to the euro and to a lesser extent the Russian ruble, the Mexican peso, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the British pound and the Malaysian ringgit.

The Company’s objective is to balance, where possible, non-functional currency denominated assets to non-functional currency denominated liabilities to have a natural hedge and minimize foreign exchange impacts. The Company enters into cross border transactions through importing and exporting goods to and from different countries and locations. These transactions generate foreign exchange risk as they create assets, liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than their functional currency. This also applies to services provided and other cross border agreements among subsidiaries.


The Company takes steps to minimize risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through normal operating and financing activities.  The Company does not enter into any speculative positions with regard to derivative instruments.

Based on financial results for the year ended December 31, 2015, a hypothetical overall 10 percent change in the U.S. dollar against the euro and Russian ruble would have resulted in a translational adjustment of approximately $31 million.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Mohawk Industries, Inc.:

We have audited Mohawk Industries, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2015

, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Mohawk Industries, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as set forth in Item 9A. of Mohawk Industries, Inc.’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended

December 31, 2015

. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Mohawk Industries, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2015

, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

On May 12, 2015, June 12, 2015 and December 7, 2015, the Company completed the acquisitions of the KAI Group, the IVC Group and Xtratherm, respectively. As a result, management excluded the KAI Group, the IVC Group and Xtratherm from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting. The KAI Group, the IVC Group and Xtratherm represent 12.7% of the Company's total assets (excluding goodwill and intangible assets of 32.9%); and 4.9% of the Company's net sales of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended

December 31, 2015

, respectively.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Mohawk Industries, Inc. also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the KAI Group, the IVC Group and Xtratherm.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Mohawk Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries as of

(In thousands, except per share data)

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a) Basis of Presentation

Mohawk Industries, Inc. (“Mohawk” or the “Company”), a term which includes the Company and its subsidiaries, is a leading global flooring manufacturer that creates products to enhance residential and commercial spaces around the world.  The Company's vertically integrated manufacturing and distribution processes provide competitive advantages in the production of carpet, rugs, ceramic tile, laminate, wood, stone, luxury vinyl tile ("LVT") and vinyl flooring.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

(b) Segment Realignment

During the second quarter of 2015, the Company realigned its reportable segments to reflect how the Company’s results will be reported by management. The Company has reorganized its business into

three

segments - Global Ceramic, Flooring North America ("Flooring NA") and Flooring Rest of the World ("Flooring ROW"). In order to leverage its relationship and distribution capabilities, the Company organized its carpet, wood, laminate, LVT and vinyl operations by geography into the Flooring NA segment and Flooring ROW segment. The Company did not make changes to the Global Ceramic segment, which includes our ceramic tile and stone operations. Previously reported segment results have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

This new segment structure is consistent with the strategic objective that management now applies to manage the growth and profitability of the Company’s business. The Global Ceramic segment includes all worldwide tile and natural stone operations. The Flooring NA segment includes North American operations in all product categories except tile and natural stone. The new segment combines the former Carpet segment with the North American operations of the former Laminate and Wood segment and the North American operations of the Company’s newly acquired LVT and vinyl flooring businesses. The Flooring ROW segment includes operations outside of North America in all product categories except tile and natural stone. The new segment combines the European and Rest of the World operations of the former Laminate and Wood segment and the European and Rest of the World operations of the Company’s newly acquired LVT and vinyl flooring businesses.

(c) Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.  As of

December 31, 2015

, the Company had cash of

$81,692

of which

$61,173

was held outside the United States.  As of

December 31, 2014

, the Company had cash of

$97,877

of which

was held outside the United States.

(d) Accounts Receivable and Revenue Recognition

The Company is principally a carpet, rugs, ceramic tile, laminate, vinyl and hardwood flooring manufacturer and sells carpet, rugs, ceramic tile, natural stone, hardwood, sheet vinyl, LVT and laminate flooring products in the U.S. and to a lesser extent, Mexico, Europe and Russia principally for residential and commercial use.  The Company grants credit to customers, most of whom are retail-flooring dealers, home centers and commercial end users, under credit terms that the Company believes are customary in the industry.

Revenues, which are recorded net of taxes collected from customers, are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred, the price has been fixed or is determinable, and collectability can be reasonably assured. The Company provides allowances for expected cash discounts, returns, claims, sales allowances and doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debt and claims experience and periodic evaluations of specific customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable. Licensing revenues received from third parties for patents are recognized based on contractual agreements.

(e) Inventories

The Company accounts for all inventories on the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (net realizable value). Cost has been determined using the FIFO method. Costs included in inventory include raw materials, direct and indirect labor and employee benefits, depreciation, general manufacturing overhead and various other costs of manufacturing. Market, with respect to all inventories, is replacement cost or net realizable value. Inventories on hand are compared against anticipated future usage, which is a function of historical usage, anticipated future selling price, expected sales below cost, excessive quantities and an evaluation for obsolescence. Actual results could differ from assumptions used to value obsolete inventory, excessive inventory or inventory expected to be sold below cost and additional reserves may be required.

(f) Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, including capitalized interest. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated remaining useful lives, which are


-


years for buildings and improvements,


-


years for machinery and equipment, the shorter of the estimated useful life or lease term for leasehold improvements and


-


years for furniture and fixtures.

(g) Accounting for Business Combinations

The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting which requires it to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. While the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, the estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company records adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the Company's consolidated statements of operations.

(h) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

In accordance with the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification Topic ("ASC") 350,

“Intangibles-Goodwill and Other,”

the Company tests goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter (or on an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value). The Company considers the relationship between its market capitalization and its book value, among other factors, when reviewing for indicators of impairment. The goodwill impairment tests are based on determining the fair value of the specified reporting units based on management’s judgments and assumptions using the discounted cash flows and comparable company market valuation approaches. The Company has identified Global Ceramic, Flooring NA, and Flooring ROW as its reporting units for the purposes of allocating goodwill and intangibles as well as assessing impairments. The valuation approaches are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change such as judgments and assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”), and comparable company market multiples.

When developing these key judgments and assumptions, the Company considers economic, operational and market conditions that could impact the fair value of the reporting unit. However, estimates are inherently uncertain and represent only management’s reasonable expectations regarding future developments. These estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will, in all likelihood, differ in some respects from actual future results. Should a significant or prolonged deterioration in economic conditions occur, such as continued declines in spending for new construction, remodeling and replacement activities; the inability to pass increases in the costs of raw materials and fuel on to customers; or a decline in comparable company market multiples, then key judgments and assumptions could be impacted.

The impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets, which for the Company are its trademarks, is conducted during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. During 2012, the Company adopted Accounting Standard Update No. 2011-08,

"Testing Goodwill for Impairment,"

and early adopted Accounting Standard Update No. 2012-02,

"Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment."

As a result, beginning in 2012, the first step of the impairment tests for our indefinite lived intangible assets is a thorough assessment of qualitative factors to determine the existence of events or circumstances that would indicate that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of these assets is less than their carrying amounts.  If the qualitative test indicates it is not more likely than not that the fair value of these assets is less than their carrying amounts, a quantitative assessment is not required.  If a quantitative test is



Index to Financial Statements

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

necessary, the second step of our impairment test involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount.  The determination of fair value used in the impairment evaluation is based on discounted estimates of future sales projections attributable to ownership of the trademarks. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, royalty rates, WACC and the amount of expected future cash flows. The judgments and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with past performance and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans. Such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. The determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the trademarks. Estimated cash flows are sensitive to changes in the economy among other things.  If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

Intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives are amortized based on average lives, which range from


-


years.

(i) Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized.  Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.  The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

(j) Financial Instruments

The Company’s financial instruments consist primarily of receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and long-term debt. The carrying amounts of receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair value because of the short-term maturity of such instruments. The carrying amount of the Company’s floating rate debt approximates its fair value based upon level two fair value hierarchy. Interest rates that are currently available to the Company for issuance of long-term debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate the fair value of the Company’s long-term debt.

(k) Advertising Costs and Vendor Consideration

Advertising and promotion expenses are charged to earnings during the period in which they are incurred. Advertising and promotion expenses included in selling, general, and administrative expenses were

$49,056

in


,

$45,487

in


and

$42,627

in


.

Vendor consideration, generally cash, is classified as a reduction of net sales, unless specific criteria are met regarding goods or services that the Company may receive in return for this consideration. The Company makes various payments to customers, including rebates, slotting fees, advertising allowances, buy-downs and co-op advertising. All of these payments reduce gross sales with the exception of co-op advertising. Co-op advertising is classified as a selling, general and administrative expense in accordance with ASC 605-50. Co-op advertising expenses, a component of advertising and promotion expenses, were

$5,419

in


,

$4,826

in


and

$4,307

in


.

(l) Product Warranties

The Company warrants certain qualitative attributes of its flooring products. The Company has recorded a provision for estimated warranty and related costs, based on historical experience and periodically adjusts these provisions to reflect actual experience.

(m) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company reviews its long-lived asset groups, which include intangible assets subject to amortization, which for the Company are its patents and customer relationships, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset groups may not be recoverable. Recoverability of asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of long-lived assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by these asset groups. If such asset groups are considered to be impaired, the impairment recognized is the amount by which the



Index to Financial Statements

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs of disposal and are no longer depreciated.

(n) Foreign Currency Translation

The Company’s subsidiaries that operate outside the United States use their local currency as the functional currency. The functional currency is translated into U.S. Dollars for balance sheet accounts using the month end rates in effect as of the balance sheet date and average exchange rate for revenue and expense accounts for each respective period. The translation adjustments are deferred as a separate component of stockholders’ equity, within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains or losses resulting from transactions denominated in foreign currencies are included in other income or expense, within the consolidated statements of operations.

(o) Hedges of Net Investments in Non-U.S. Operations

The Company has numerous investments outside the United States. The net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to changes and volatility in currency exchange rates. The Company uses foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its non-U.S. net investments against adverse movements in exchange rates. The gains and losses on the Company's net investments in its non-U.S. operations are economically offset by losses and gains on its foreign currency borrowings.  The Company designated its

€500,000

2.00%

Senior Notes borrowing as a net investment hedge of a portion of its European operations.  For the year ended

December 31, 2015

, the change in the U.S. dollar value of the Company's euro denominated debt was

$18,025

(

$11,266

net of taxes), which is recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The increase in the U.S. dollar value of the Company's debt partially offsets the euro-to-dollar translation of the Company's net investment in its European operations.

(p) Earnings per Share (“EPS”)

Basic net earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated using net earnings available to common stockholders divided by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is similar to basic EPS except that the weighted-average number of shares is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive common shares had been issued.

Dilutive common stock options are included in the diluted EPS calculation using the treasury stock method. There were no common stock options and unvested restricted shares (units) that were not included in the diluted EPS computation because the price was greater than the average market price of the common shares for the periods presented for


,


and


.

Computations of basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations are presented in the following table:

(a) Represents the accretion of the Company's redeemable noncontrolling interest to redemption value. See Note 2 - Acquisitions for further information.

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

(q) Stock-Based Compensation

The Company recognizes compensation expense for all share-based payments granted based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with ASC 718-10, “

Stock Compensation

”. Compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the awards' estimated lives for fixed awards with ratable vesting provisions.

(r) Employee Benefit Plans

The Company has a 401(k) retirement savings plan (the “Mohawk Plan”) open to substantially all U.S. and Puerto Rico based employees who have completed


days of eligible service. The Company contributes

$.50

for every

$1.00

of employee contributions up to a maximum of

6%

of the employee’s salary based upon each individual participants election. Employee and employer contributions to the Mohawk Plan were

$45,279

and

$18,882

in


,

$42,681

and

$17,654

in


and

$38,632

and

$15,994

in


, respectively.

The Company also has various pension plans covering employees in Belgium, France, and the Netherlands (the “Non-U.S. Plans”) within the Flooring ROW segment. Benefits under the Non-U.S. Plans depend on compensation and years of service.  The Non-U.S. Plans are funded in accordance with local regulations. The Company uses December 31 as the measurement date for its Non-U.S. Plans. As of

December 31, 2015

, the funded status of the Non-U.S. Plans was a liability of

$3,224

of which

$1,075

was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, for a net liability of

$2,149

recorded in other long-term liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets. As of

December 31, 2014

, the funded status of the Non-U.S. Plans was a liability of

$3,320

of which

$1,450

was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), for a net liability of

$1,870

recorded in other long-term liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets.

(s) Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) includes foreign currency translation of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, effects of exchange rate changes on intercompany balances of a long-term nature and pensions. The Company does not provide income taxes on currency translation adjustments, as earnings from foreign subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely reinvested.

Effective January 1, 2013, the Company adopted the accounting guidance that requires the Company to separately disclose, on a prospective basis, the change in each component of other comprehensive income (loss) relating to reclassification adjustments and current period other comprehensive income (loss).  As the guidance relates to presentation only, the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

The changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by component, net of tax, for years ended

December 31, 2015

,


and


are as follows:

(t) Self-Insurance Reserves



Index to Financial Statements

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

The Company is self-insured in the U.S. for various levels of general liability, auto liability, workers’ compensation and employee medical coverage. Insurance reserves, excluding workers' compensation, are calculated on an undiscounted basis based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed utilizing historical claim trends. Projected settlements and incurred but not reported claims are estimated based on pending claims and historical trends and data. Though the Company does not expect them to do so, actual settlements and claims could differ materially from those estimated. Material differences in actual settlements and claims could have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.

(u) Fiscal Year

The Company ends its fiscal year on December 31. Each of the first three quarters in the fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the calendar quarter end with a thirteen week fiscal quarter.

(v) Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

. This topic converges the guidance within U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") and supersedes ASC 605,

Revenue Recognition.

The new standard requires companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard will also result in enhanced disclosures about revenue, provide guidance for transactions that were not previously addressed comprehensively, and improve guidance for multiple-element arrangements. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period and early application is not permitted. On July 9, 2015, the FASB decided to defer the effective date of ASC 606 for one year.  The deferral results in the new revenue standard being effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company currently plans to adopt the provisions of this new accounting standard at the beginning of fiscal year 2018, and is currently assessing the impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,

Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs

.  This topic converges the guidance within U.S. GAAP and IFRS.  The new standard intends to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability, versus recording the costs as a prepaid expense in other assets that is amortized. The new standard will more closely align the presentation of debt issuance costs under U.S. GAAP with the presentation under comparable IFRS. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15,

Interest - Imputation of Interest

(Subtopic 835-30) to address the measurement of debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements. ASU 2015-15 states that an entity can defer and present debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortize the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless if there are outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period and early application is permitted. Accordingly, the Company plans to adopt the provisions of this new accounting standard at the beginning of fiscal year 2016. As this standard impacts only the classification of certain amounts within the consolidated balance sheets, the Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,

Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory

.  This update changes the measurement principle for inventory for entities using FIFO or average cost from the lower of cost or market to lower of cost and net realizable value. Entities that measure inventory using LIFO or the retail inventory method are not affected. This update will more closely align the accounting for inventory under U.S. GAAP with IFRS. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 including interim periods within that reporting period and early adoption is permitted. The Company currently accounts for inventory using the FIFO method. Accordingly, the Company plans to adopt the provisions of this update at the beginning of fiscal year 2017, and is currently assessing the impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,

Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments

, which eliminates the requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. Under this ASU, acquirers must recognize measurement-period adjustments in the period in which they determine the amounts, including the effect on earnings of any amounts they would have recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. Accordingly, the Company plans to adopt the provisions of this update at the beginning of fiscal year 2017, and is currently assessing the impact on its consolidated financial statements.



Index to Financial Statements

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,

Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes

.  The new standard intends to simplify the accounting for and presentation of deferred taxes by requiring that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. The new standard will more closely align the presentation of deferred taxes under U.S. GAAP with the presentation under comparable IFRS. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period and early application is permitted. The guidance may be applied prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company has elected to apply the provisions of this guidance effective

December 31, 2015

retrospectively. Accordingly, deferred tax liabilities and assets of

$9,090

and

$151,784

, respectively, were reclassified from current to noncurrent in the December 31, 2014 consolidated balance sheet.

(2) Acquisitions

IVC Group

On

January 13, 2015

, the Company entered into a share purchase agreement (the “Share Purchase Agreement”) with Enterhold S.A., a Luxembourg

societe anonyme

(the “Seller”), to acquire all of the outstanding shares of International Flooring Systems S.A., a Luxembourg

societe anonyme

, and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “IVC Group”). The IVC Group is a global manufacturer, distributor and marketer of luxury vinyl tile ("LVT") and sheet vinyl.  On

June 12, 2015

, pursuant to the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, the Company completed the acquisition of IVC Group for

$1,146,437

.  The results of the IVC Group's operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since that date in the Flooring NA and the Flooring ROW segments. The IVC Group acquisition will position the Company as a major participant in both the fast growing LVT category and the expanding fiberglass sheet vinyl business.

Pursuant to the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, the Seller will indemnify the Company for uncertain tax positions and tax liabilities that were incurred by the Seller. The Company has recorded these tax liabilities and related indemnification asset in the amount of

$34,781

as of the acquisition date in other long-term liabilities and other long-term assets, respectively. During the fourth quarter of


, the Company reversed

$11,180

of these tax liabilities due to the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain tax exposures, and released the related indemnification asset.

The equity value of IVC Group was paid to the Seller in cash and in shares of the Company's common stock (the “Shares”). Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, the Company (i) acquired the entire issued share capital of IVC Group and (ii) acquired

$17,122

of indebtedness of the IVC Group, in exchange for a net cash payment of

$732,189

, debt paid of

$261,152

, and


issued treasury shares for a value of

$153,096

.

The Company funded the cash portion of the IVC Group acquisition through a combination of proceeds from the

2.00%

Senior Notes (as discussed in Note 9 - Long-Term Debt), cash on hand and borrowings under the 2015 Senior Credit Facility (as discussed in Note 9 - Long-Term Debt).

KAI Group

On

May 12, 2015

, the Company purchased approximately

90%

of all outstanding shares of Advent KAI Luxembourg Holdings S.a r.l., a Luxembourg

societe a respsonsabilite limitee

, and its subsidiaries

(collectively, the "KAI Group"), an eastern European ceramic tile floor manufacturer. The Company completed the acquisition of the KAI Group for

$194,613

.  The results of the KAI Group's operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition in the Global Ceramic segment.  The KAI Group has a low cost position in the Bulgarian and Romanian markets.  The combination with the Company will present opportunities to enhance the group's product offering, upgrade its technology and expand its exports to other countries.  The remaining

10%

ownership interest in the KAI Group is controlled by a third party. The 10% interest is subject to redemption provisions that are not solely within the Company’s control and therefore is recorded as a redeemable noncontrolling interest in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet for

$21,952

as of

December 31, 2015

. Pursuant to the share purchase agreement, the Company (i) acquired approximately

90%

of the issued share capital of the KAI Group and (ii) acquired

$24

of indebtedness of the KAI Group, in exchange for a net cash payment of

$169,540

and debt paid of

$25,073

.

The Company accounted for the acquisitions of the IVC Group and the KAI Group (the “Acquisitions”) using the acquisition method of accounting, with the Company as the acquirer of the IVC Group and the KAI Group.  The preliminary estimated combined consideration transferred of

$1,341,050

, including debt paid and shares issued, was determined in accordance with the respective share purchase agreements.  The preliminary consideration transferred is allocated to tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based upon their respective fair values.



Index to Financial Statements

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

During the year ended

December 31, 2015

, the Company incurred direct transaction costs of

$9,502

for the Acquisitions which were expensed as incurred in selling, general and administrative expenses.

The following table summarizes the preliminary acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred for the Acquisitions and the estimated fair value of the consideration transferred to assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of the Acquisitions, and the allocation of the aggregate purchase price of the IVC Group and the KAI Group acquisitions to the estimated fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed (in thousands):

The Company is continuing to obtain information to complete its valuation of tax accounts, legal liabilities and other contingency attributes. The purchase price allocation is preliminary until the Company obtains final information regarding these fair values.

Intangible assets subject to amortization of

$224,326

related to customer relationships have estimated lives of


to


years. In addition to the amortizable intangible assets, there is an additional

$48,563

in indefinite-lived tradename intangible assets. The goodwill of

$740,140

was allocated to the Company's segments as disclosed in Note 7, Goodwill and Intangible Assets. The factors contributing to the recognition of the amount of goodwill are based on strategic and synergistic benefits that are expected to be realized from the Acquisitions. These benefits include the opportunities to improve the Company's performance by leveraging best practices, operational expertise, product innovation and manufacturing assets. The recognized goodwill from the Acquisitions is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

The amount of net sales and earnings of the Acquisitions since the acquisition date included in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended

December 31, 2015

was approximately

$396,000

for net sales and not material for earnings. The results of operations for the Acquisitions were not significant to the Company's consolidated results of operations and, accordingly, the Company has not provided pro forma information relating to the Acquisitions.

Xtratherm

On December 7, 2015, the Company completed its purchase of Xtratherm Limited, an Irish company, and certain of its affiliates (collectively, "Xtratherm"), a manufacturer of insulation boards in Ireland, the UK and Belgium. The total value of the acquisition was

$158,851

.  The Xtratherm acquisition will expand the Company's existing insulation board footprint to include Ireland, the UK and Belgium while capitalizing on expanded product offerings in Belgium.  The acquisition's results and purchase price allocation have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition.  The Company's acquisition of Xtratherm resulted in a preliminary goodwill allocation of

$32,086

, indefinite-lived trademark intangible assets of



Index to Financial Statements

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

$4,681

and intangible assets subject to amortization of

$39,839

.  The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.  The factors contributing to the recognition of the amount of goodwill include the opportunity to optimize the assets of Xtratherm with the Company's existing insulation assets.  The Xtratherm results are reflected in the Flooring ROW segment.

The Company is continuing to obtain information to complete its valuation of intangible assets, as well as to determine the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities including tax accounts, legal liabilities and other attributes. The purchase price allocation is preliminary until the Company obtains final information regarding these fair values.

Other Acquisitions

During the first quarter of 2015, the Company acquired certain assets of a distribution business in the Flooring ROW segment for

$2,822

, resulting in a preliminary goodwill allocation of

$2,659

.

During the third quarter of 2015, the Company acquired certain assets of a ceramic business in the Global Ceramic segment for

$20,423

, resulting in a preliminary goodwill allocation of

$269

.

(3) Restructuring, Acquisition and Integration-Related Costs

The Company incurs costs in connection with acquiring, integrating and restructuring acquisitions and in connection with its global cost-reduction/productivity initiatives.  For example:

•

In connection with acquisition activity, the Company typically incurs costs associated with executing the transactions, integrating the acquired operations (which may include expenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes), and restructuring the combined company (which may include charges related to employees, assets and activities that will not continue in the combined company); and

•

In connection with the Company's cost-reduction/productivity initiatives, it typically incurs costs and charges associated with site closings and other facility rationalization actions including accelerated depreciation and workforce reductions.

Restructuring, acquisition transaction and integration-related costs consisted of the following during the year ended

December 31, 2015

,


and


, respectively (in thousands):

(a)  The restructuring costs for 2015, 2014 and 2013 primarily relate to the Company's actions taken to lower its cost structure and improve efficiencies of manufacturing and distribution operations as the Company adjusted to changing economic conditions as well as actions related to the Company's recent acquisitions.  In 2015 and 2014 restructuring costs included accelerated depreciation of

$8,650

and

$8,982

, respectively.

The restructuring activity for the

twelve months ended

(4) Discontinued Operations

On

January 22, 2014

, the Company sold a non-core sanitary ware business acquired as part of the Marazzi acquisition because the Company did not believe the business was consistent with its long-term strategy.

The Company determined that the business met the definition of discontinued operations.  Sales attributable to discontinued operations for the year ended

December 31, 2013

were immaterial.  The loss on sale of

$16,569

(

$15,651

, net of tax) related to the disposition of the business was recorded in discontinued operations for the year ended

(9) Long-Term Debt

Senior Credit Facility

On

September 25, 2013

, the Company entered into a

$1,000,000

,


-year, senior revolving credit facility (the "2013 Senior Credit Facility").  The 2013 Senior Credit Facility provided for a maximum of

$1,000,000

of revolving credit, including limited amounts of credit in the form of letters of credit and swingline loans. The Company paid financing costs of

$1,836

in connection with its 2013 Senior Credit Facility. These costs were deferred and, along with unamortized costs of

$11,440

related to the Company’s previous credit facility, were amortized over the term of the 2013 Senior Credit Facility.

On March 26, 2015, the Company amended and restated the 2013 Senior Credit Facility increasing its size from

$1,000,000

to

$1,800,000

and extending the maturity from

September 25, 2018

to

March 26, 2020

(the "2015 Senior Credit Facility").  The 2015 Senior Credit Facility eliminates certain provisions in the 2013 Senior Credit Facility, including those that: (a) accelerated the maturity date to 90 days prior to the maturity of senior notes due in January 2016 if certain specified liquidity levels were not met; and (b) required that certain subsidiaries guarantee the Company's obligations if the Company’s credit ratings fell below investment grade.  The 2015 Senior Credit Facility also modified certain negative covenants to provide the Company with additional flexibility, including that to make acquisitions and incur indebtedness.

At the Company's election, revolving loans under the 2015 Senior Credit Facility bear interest at annual rates equal to either (a) LIBOR for 1, 2, 3 or 6 month periods, as selected by the Company, plus an applicable margin ranging between

1.00%

and

1.75%

(

1.25%

as of

December 31, 2015

), or (b) the higher of the Wells Fargo Bank, National Association prime rate, the Federal Funds rate plus

0.5%

, and a monthly LIBOR rate plus

1.0%

, plus an applicable margin ranging between

0.00%

and

0.75%

(

0.25%

as of

December 31, 2015

).  The Company also pays a commitment fee to the lenders under the 2015 Senior Credit Facility



Index to Financial Statements

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

on the average amount by which the aggregate commitments of the lenders' exceed utilization of the 2015 Senior Credit Facility ranging from

0.10%

to

0.225%

per annum. As of

December 31, 2015

, the Company is paying a commitment fee of

0.15%

. The applicable margins and the commitment fee are determined based on whichever of the Company's Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio or its senior unsecured debt rating (or if not available, corporate family rating) results in the lower applicable margins and commitment fee (with applicable margins and the commitment fee increasing as that ratio increases or those ratings decline, as applicable).

The obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries in respect of the 2015 Senior Credit Facility are unsecured.

The 2015 Senior Credit Facility includes certain affirmative and negative covenants that impose restrictions on the Company's financial and business operations, including limitations on liens, subsidiary indebtedness, fundamental changes, asset dispositions, dividends and other similar restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, future negative pledges, and changes in the nature of the Company's business.  These limitations are subject to exceptions.  The Company is also required to maintain a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of at least

3.0

to 1.0 and a Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of no more than

3.75

to 1.0, each as of the last day of any fiscal quarter.

The 2015 Senior Credit Facility also contains customary representations and warranties and events of default, subject to customary grace periods.

The Company paid financing costs of

$2,641

in connection with its 2015 Senior Credit Facility.  These costs were deferred and, along with unamortized costs of

$8,654

related to the Company’s 2013 Senior Credit Facility, are being amortized over the term of the 2015 Senior Credit Facility.

As of

December 31, 2015

, amounts utilized under the 2015 Senior Credit Facility included

$134,075

of borrowings and

$1,381

of standby letters of credit related to various insurance contracts and foreign vendor commitments.  The outstanding borrowings of

$756,867

under the Company's U.S. and European commercial paper programs as of

December 31, 2015

reduce the availability of the 2015 Senior Credit Facility.  Taking the commercial paper borrowings into account, the Company has utilized

$892,323

under the 2015 Senior Credit Facility resulting in a total of

$907,677

available under the 2015 Senior Credit Facility.

Commercial Paper

On

February 28, 2014

, the Company established a U.S. commercial paper program for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the United States capital markets. Under the commercial paper program, the Company issues commercial paper notes from time to time. On

May 21, 2015

, following the amendment and restatement of the 2013 Credit Facility, the Company expanded the amount of borrowings permitted under its U.S. commercial paper program from

$1,000,000

to

$1,800,000

.  The U.S. commercial paper notes have maturities ranging from

one

day to


days and are not subject to voluntary prepayment by the Company or redemption prior to maturity. The U.S. commercial paper notes rank pari passu with all of the Company's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.

On

July 31, 2015

, the Company established a European commercial paper program for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the Eurozone capital markets. Under the European commercial paper program, the Company issues commercial paper notes from time to time, subject to a cap equal to

€1,000,000

. The European commercial paper notes have maturities ranging from

one

day to


days and are not subject to voluntary prepayment by the Company or redemption prior to maturity. The European commercial paper notes rank pari passu with all of the Company's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. To the extent European commercial paper notes are issued by a subsidiary of the Company, payment on such notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company.

The Company uses its 2015 Senior Credit Facility as a liquidity backstop for its commercial paper programs. Accordingly, the total amount due and payable under all of the Company's commercial paper programs may not exceed

$1,800,000

(less any amounts drawn on the 2015 Credit Facility) at any time.

The proceeds from the sale of commercial paper notes will be available for general corporate purposes. The Company used the initial proceeds from the sale of U.S. commercial paper notes to repay borrowings under its 2013 Senior Credit Facility and certain of its industrial revenue bonds.  The Company used the initial proceeds from the sale of European commercial paper notes to repay euro-denominated borrowings under its 2015 Senior Credit Facility. As of

December 31, 2015

, the amount utilized under the commercial paper programs was

$756,867

with a weighted-average interest rate and maturity period of

0.65%

and

28.35

Accounts Receivable Securitization

On December 19, 2012, the Company entered into a

three

-year on-balance sheet trade accounts receivable securitization agreement (the "Securitization Facility"). On September 11, 2014, the Company made certain modifications to its Securitization Facility, which modifications, among other things, increased the aggregate borrowings available under the facility from

$300,000

to

$500,000

and decreased the interest margins on certain borrowings.  On

December 10, 2015

, the Company amended the terms of the Securitization Facility, reducing the applicable margin and extending the termination date from

December 19, 2015

to

December 19, 2016

.  The Company paid financing costs of

$250

in connection with this extension. These costs were deferred and are being amortized over the remaining term of the Securitization Facility.

Under the terms of the Securitization Facility, certain subsidiaries of the Company sell at a discount certain of their trade accounts receivable (the “Receivables”) to Mohawk Factoring, LLC (“Factoring”) on a revolving basis.  The Company has determined that Factoring is a bankruptcy remote subsidiary, meaning that Factoring is a separate legal entity whose assets are available to satisfy the claims of the creditors of Factoring only, not the creditors of the Company or the Company’s other subsidiaries.  Factoring may borrow up to

$500,000

based on the amount of eligible Receivables owned by Factoring, and Factoring has granted a security interest in all of such Receivables to the third-party lending group as collateral for such borrowings.  Amounts loaned to Factoring under the Securitization Facility bear interest at commercial paper interest rates, in the case of lenders that are commercial paper conduits, or LIBOR, in the case of lenders that are not commercial paper conduits, in each case, plus an applicable margin of

0.65%

per annum. Factoring also pays a commitment fee at a per annum rate of

0.35%

on the unused amount of each lender’s commitment.  At

December 31, 2015

, the amount utilized under the Securitization Facility was

$500,000

.

Income tax expense (benefit) from continuing operations for the years ended

and


consists of the following:

The geographic dispersion of earnings and losses contributes to the annual changes in the Company’s effective tax rates. Approximately

43%

of the Company’s current year earnings from continuing operations before income taxes was generated in the United States at a combined federal and state effective tax rate that is higher than the Company’s overall effective tax rate. The Company is also subject to taxation in other jurisdictions where it has operations, including Australia, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Russia and Spain. The effective tax rates that the Company pays in these



Index to Financial Statements

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

jurisdictions vary widely, but they are generally lower than the Company’s overall effective tax rate. The Company’s domestic effective tax rates for the years ended

December 31, 2015

,


and


were

39.8%

,

42.8%

, and

, respectively, and its non-U.S. effective tax rates for the years ended

December 31, 2015

,


and


were

0.7%

,

(3.1)%

, and

(10.0)%

, respectively. The difference in rates applicable in foreign jurisdictions results from a number of factors, including lower statutory rates, historical loss carry-forwards, financing arrangements and other factors. The Company’s effective tax rate has been and will continue to be impacted by the geographical dispersion of the Company’s earnings and losses. To the extent that domestic earnings increase while the foreign earnings remain flat or decrease, or increase at a lower rate, the Company’s effective tax rate will increase.

Income tax expense (benefit) attributable to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes differs from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes as follows:

(a) Foreign income taxes includes statutory rate differences, financing arrangements, withholding taxes, local income taxes, notional deductions, and other miscellaneous items.

(b) 2015 includes the

$11,180

reversal of uncertain tax positions.

The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of

and


are presented below:



Index to Financial Statements

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

The Company evaluates its ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing its forecasted taxable income using both historic and projected future operating results, the reversal of existing temporary differences, taxable income in prior carry-back years (if permitted) and the availability of tax planning strategies. The valuation allowance as of

December 31, 2015

, and


is

$287,580

and

$300,472

, respectively. The valuation allowance as of

December 31, 2015

relates to the net deferred tax assets of certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries as well as certain state net operating losses and tax credits. The total change in the


valuation allowance was a decrease of

$12,892

which includes (

$24,718

) related to foreign currency translation.  The total change in the


valuation allowance was a decrease of

$75,387

, which includes

$(39,243)

related to foreign currency translation and

$(61,148)

related to the disposal of a subsidiary.

Management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, based upon the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities and the level of historic and forecasted taxable income over periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible.

As of

December 31, 2015

, the Company has state net operating loss carry forwards and state tax credits with potential tax benefits of

$56,745

, net of federal income tax benefit; these carry forwards expire over various periods based on taxing jurisdiction. A valuation allowance totaling

$35,490

has been recorded against these state deferred tax assets as of

December 31, 2015

. In addition, as of

December 31, 2015

, the Company has net operating loss carry forwards in various foreign jurisdictions with potential tax benefits of

$401,999

. A valuation allowance totaling

$218,577

has been recorded against these deferred tax assets as of

December 31, 2015

.

The Company does not provide for U.S. federal and state income taxes on the cumulative undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are deemed to be permanently reinvested. As of

December 31, 2015

, the Company had not provided federal income taxes on earnings of approximately

$1,680,000

from its foreign subsidiaries. Should these earnings be distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to both U.S. income taxes and withholding taxes in various foreign jurisdictions. These taxes may be partially offset by U.S. foreign tax credits. Determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred U.S. tax liability is not practical because of the complexities associated with this hypothetical calculation.

Tax Uncertainties

In the normal course of business, the Company’s tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing jurisdictions. Accordingly, the Company accrues liabilities when it believes that it is not more likely than not that it will realize the benefits of tax positions that it has taken in its tax returns or for the amount of any tax benefit that exceeds the cumulative probability threshold in accordance with ASC 740-10. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest and penalties in income tax expense (benefit). Differences between the estimated and actual amounts determined upon ultimate resolution, individually or in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position but could possibly be material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations or cash flow in any given quarter or annual period.

As of

December 31, 2015

, the Company’s gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits is

$51,037

, excluding interest and penalties. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions,

$32,662

of the unrecognized tax benefits would affect the Company’s effective tax rate, exclusive of any benefits related to interest and penalties.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:



Index to Financial Statements

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

The Company will continue to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of its income tax provision. As of

December 31, 2015

and


, the Company has

$5,394

and

$9,409

, respectively, accrued for the payment of interest and penalties, excluding the federal tax benefit of interest deductions where applicable. During the years ending

December 31, 2015

,


and


, the Company accrued interest and penalties through the consolidated statements of operations of

$(5,635)

,

$(3,579)

and

$74

, respectively.

The Company believes that its unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by

$10,273

within the next twelve months.  The Company has effectively settled all Federal income tax matters related to years prior to 2010.  Various other state and foreign income tax returns are open to examination for various years.

Belgian Tax Matter

In January 2012, the Company received a

€23,789

assessment from the Belgian tax authority related to its year ended December 31, 2008, asserting that the Company had understated its Belgian taxable income for that year. The Company filed a formal protest in the first quarter of 2012 refuting the Belgian tax authority's position.  The Belgian tax authority set aside the assessment in the third quarter of 2012 and refunded all related deposits, including interest income of

€1,583

earned on such deposits. However, on October 23, 2012, the Belgian tax authority notified the Company of its intent to increase the Company's taxable income for the year ended December 31, 2008 under a revised theory. On December 28, 2012, the Belgian tax authority issued assessments for the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2009, in the amounts of

€46,135

and

€35,567

, respectively, including penalties, but excluding interest. The Company filed a formal protest during the first quarter of 2013 relating to the new assessments. In September 2013, the Belgian tax authority denied the Company's protests, and the Company has brought these two years before the Court of First Appeal in Bruges. In December 2013, the Belgian tax authority issued additional assessments related to the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007, and 2010, in the amounts of

€38,817

,

€39,635

, and

€43,117

, respectively, including penalties, but excluding interest.  The Company filed formal protests during the first quarter of 2014, refuting the Belgian tax authority's position for each of the years assessed.  In the quarter ended June 28, 2014, the Company received a formal assessment for the year ended December 31, 2008, totaling

€30,131

, against which the Company also submitted its formal protest. All 4 additional years have been brought before the Court of First Appeal in November 2014. In January of 2015, the Company met with the Court of First Appeal in Bruges, Belgium and agreed with the Belgium tax authorities to consolidate and argue the issues regarding the years 2005 and 2009, and apply the ruling to all of the open years (to the extent there are no additional facts/procedural arguments in the other years).

On January 27, 2016, the Court of First Appeal in Bruges, Belgium ruled in favor of the Company with respect to the calendar years ending December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2009. The Company anticipates that the Belgian tax authority will appeal this ruling.

The Company disagrees with the views of the Belgian tax authority on this matter and will persist in its vigorous defense if there is an appeal. Although there can be no assurances, the Company believes the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition but could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, liquidity or cash flows in a given quarter or year.

, there are no material legal proceedings pending or known by the Company to be contemplated to which the Company is a party or to which any of its property is subject.

Polyurethane Foam Litigation

Beginning in August 2010, a series of civil lawsuits were initiated in several U.S. federal courts alleging that certain manufacturers of polyurethane foam products and competitors of the Company’s carpet underlay division had engaged in price fixing in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The Company was named as a defendant in a number of the individual cases (the first filed on August 26, 2010), as well as in

two

consolidated amended class action complaints (the first filed on February 28, 2011, on behalf of a class of all direct purchasers of polyurethane foam products, and the second filed on March 21, 2011, on behalf of a class of indirect purchasers). All pending cases in which the Company was named as a defendant were filed in or transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio for consolidated pre-trial proceedings under the name

In re: Polyurethane Foam Antitrust Litigation, Case No. 1:10-MDL-02196.

In these actions, the plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and/or a class of purchasers, sought damages allegedly suffered as a result of alleged overcharges in the price of polyurethane foam products from at least 1999 to the present. Any damages actually awarded at trial would have been subject to being tripled under US antitrust laws.

On March 23, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement to settle all claims brought by the class of direct purchasers, and the trial court entered an order granting final approval of this settlement on November 19, 2015. On April 30, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement to settle all claims brought by the class of indirect purchasers, and the trial court entered an order granting final approval of this settlement on January 27, 2016. The Company has also entered into settlement agreements resolving all of the claims brought on behalf of all but one of the consolidated individual lawsuits. The Company denies all allegations of wrongdoing but settled the class actions and individual lawsuits to avoid the uncertainty, risk, expense and distraction of protracted litigation.

The Company remains a defendant in one case involving an individual purchaser of polyurethane foam products not sold by the Company. This sole remaining case is in its early stages, no trial date has been set, and the amount of the damages has not yet been specified by the plaintiff. In addition to as yet unspecified actual damages, the plaintiff also seeks attorney fees, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, court costs and injunctive relief against future violations.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

In December 2011, the Company was named as a defendant in a Canadian Class action,

Hi! Neighbor Floor Covering Co. Limited v. Hickory Springs Manufacturing Company, et al

., filed in the Superior Court of Justice of Ontario, Canada and

Options Consommateures v. Vitafoam, Inc. et.al.

, filed in the Superior Court of Justice of Quebec, Montreal, Canada, both of which alleged similar claims against the Company as raised in the U.S. actions and sought unspecified damages and punitive damages. On June 12, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement to settle all claims brought by the class of Canadian plaintiffs, as well as a separate action pending in the Supreme Court of British Columbia. The courts in Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia have all approved the settlement although certain administrative issues remain. The Company continues to deny all allegations of wrongdoing but settled the case to avoid the uncertainty, risk, expense and distraction of protracted litigation.

During the

twelve months ended

December 31, 2015

the Company recorded a

$122,480

charge within selling, general and administrative expenses for the settlement and defense of the antitrust cases.  The Company believes that adequate provisions for resolution of all of these cases have been made. The Company does not believe that the ultimate outcome of the remaining case will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition.

The Company believes that adequate provisions for resolution of all contingencies, claims and pending litigation have been made for probable losses that are reasonably estimable.  These contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and we are unable to estimate the amount or range of loss, if any, in excess of amounts accrued.  The Company does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition but could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, cash flows or liquidity in a given quarter or year.

The Company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use, storage, treatment, recycling and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and finished product, and the cleanup of contamination associated therewith. Because of the nature of the Company’s business, the Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs relating to compliance with such laws and regulations. The Company is involved in various proceedings relating to environmental matters and is currently engaged in environmental investigation, remediation and post-closure care programs at certain sites. The Company has provided accruals for such activities that it has determined to be both probable and reasonably estimable. The Company does not expect that the ultimate liability with respect to such activities will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition but could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, cash flows or liquidity in a given quarter or year.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), which have been designed to provide reasonable assurance that such controls and procedures will meet their objectives, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that such controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level for the period covered by this report.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).  The Company maintains internal control over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting determined to be effective provides only reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of



Index to Financial Statements

financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

On May 12, 2015, June 12, 2015 and December 7, 2015, the Company completed the acquisitions of the KAI Group, the IVC Group and Xtratherm, respectively. As a result, management excluded the KAI Group, the IVC Group and Xtratherm from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting. The KAI Group, the IVC Group and Xtratherm represent 12.7% of the total assets (excluding goodwill and intangible assets of 32.9%); and 4.9% of net sales of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended

December 31, 2015

, respectively.

Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Company's Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2015

.  In conducting this evaluation, the Company used the framework set forth in the report titled “Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)” published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on the results of this evaluation, management has concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2015

.

The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2015

has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report which is included herein.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls

The Company’s management recognizes that a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
