PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

Mohawk Industries, Inc., (“Mohawk” or the “Company”), a term which includes the Company and its subsidiaries, including its primary
operating subsidiaries, Mohawk Carpet, LLC, Aladdin Manufacturing Corporation, Dal-Tile International Inc. and Unilin Flooring BVBA, Unilin Holding Inc., and their subsidiaries (the Unilin Group), is a leading producer of floor covering products for
residential and commercial applications in the United States (“U.S.”) and residential applications in Europe. The Company is the second largest carpet and rug manufacturer and one of the largest manufacturers, marketers and distributors of
ceramic tile, natural stone and hardwood flooring in the U.S. as well as a leading producer of laminate flooring in the U.S. and Europe. The Company had annual net sales in 2008 of $6.8 billion. Approximately 85% of this amount was generated by
sales in North America and approximately 15% was generated by sales outside North America. The Company has three reporting segments, the Mohawk segment, the Dal-Tile segment and the Unilin segment. Selected financial information for the Mohawk,
Dal-Tile and Unilin segments, geographic net sales and the location of long-lived assets is set forth in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Mohawk segment designs, manufactures, sources, distributes and markets its floor covering
product lines, which include carpets, ceramic tile, laminate, rugs, carpet pad, hardwood and resilient, in a broad range of colors, textures and patterns for residential and commercial applications in both new construction and remodeling. The Mohawk
segment markets and distributes its carpets and rugs under its soft surface floor covering brands and ceramic tile, laminate, hardwood and resilient under its hard surface floor covering brands. The Mohawk segment positions its products in all price
ranges and emphasizes quality, style, performance and service. The Mohawk segment is widely recognized through its premier brand names, which include “Mohawk

®

,” “Aladdin

®

,” “Mohawk Home

®

,” “Bigelow

®

,” “Durkan

®

,” “Horizon

®

,” “Karastan

®

,” “Lees

®

,” “Merit

®

,” and “Ralph Lauren

®

”. The Mohawk
segment markets and distributes soft and hard surface products through over 30,000 customers, which include independent floor covering retailers, home centers, mass merchandisers, department stores, commercial dealers and commercial end users. Some
products are also marketed through private labeling programs. The Mohawk segment’s soft surface operations are vertically integrated from the extrusion of resin to the manufacture and shipment of finished carpets and rugs.

The Dal-Tile segment designs, manufactures, sources, distributes and markets a broad line of
ceramic tile, porcelain tile, natural stone and other products used in the residential and commercial markets for both new construction and remodeling. Most of the Dal-Tile segment’s ceramic tile products are marketed under the
“Dal-Tile

®

” and “American Olean

®

” brand names and sold through company-owned service centers, independent
distributors, home center retailers, tile and flooring retailers and contractors. The Dal-Tile segment operations are vertically integrated from the production of raw material for body and glaze preparation to the manufacturing and distribution of
ceramic and porcelain tile.

The Unilin segment, which is headquartered in Belgium,
is a leading manufacturer, licensor, distributor and marketer of laminate flooring in Europe and the U.S. Unilin is one of the leaders in laminate flooring technology, having commercialized direct pressure laminate, or DPL, a technology used in a
majority of laminates today, and has developed the patented UNICLIC

®

glueless installation system and a variety of other new technologies, such as beveled edges, multiple length planks and
new surface technologies. Unilin is the largest vertically-integrated laminate flooring manufacturer in the U.S. producing both laminate flooring and related high density fiberboard. Unilin sells its flooring products under the Quick-Step

®

, Columbia Flooring

®

, Century Flooring

®

, and Universal Flooring

®

brands through retailers, independent distributors’ private label and home centers. Unilin also produces roofing systems and other wood products. On August 13, 2007, the Company
acquired certain wood flooring assets and liabilities of Columbia Forest Products, Inc. for approximately $147 million (the “Wood Acquisition”), enabling the Company to expand its position in the wood flooring market. The results of the
Wood Acquisition are included in the Unilin segment and the Company’s consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition.

Industry

The U.S. floor covering industry has grown from $12.4 billion in sales in 1992 to $21.7 billion in 2007. In 2007, the primary categories of the U.S. floor covering industry were carpet and rug (62%), ceramic tile (13%), hardwood (11%),
resilient and rubber (9%), and laminate (5%). Each of these categories has been impacted by the average selling price per square foot, the residential builder and homeowner remodeling markets, housing starts and housing resales, average house size
and home ownership. In addition, the level of sales in the floor covering industry, both in the U.S. and Europe, is influenced by consumer confidence, spending for durable goods, interest rates and availability of credit, turnover in housing, the
condition of the residential and commercial construction industries and the overall strength of the economy. The U.S. floor covering industry has experienced softened demand beginning in the fourth quarter of 2006 and worsening considerably during
the later parts of 2008. The global economy continues in the most significant downturn in recent history. Overall economic conditions and consumer sentiment have continued to deteriorate, which has intensified the pressure on the demand for housing
and flooring products.

The worldwide carpet and rug sales volume of U.S. manufacturers was approximately 1.7 billion square yards in 2007.
This volume represents a market in excess of $14 billion in sales. The carpet and rugs category has two primary markets, residential and commercial. In 2007, the residential market made up approximately 72% of industry amounts shipped and the
commercial market comprised approximately 28%. Of the total residential market, 67% of the dollar values of shipments are made in response to residential replacement demand.

The U.S. ceramic tile industry shipped 2.7 billion square feet, or $2.7 billion, in 2007. The ceramic tile industry’s two primary markets,
residential applications and commercial applications, represent 60% and 40% of the 2007 industry total, respectively. Of the total residential market, 48% of the dollar values of shipments are made in response to residential replacement demand.

In 2007, the U.S. hardwood industry shipped 1.0 billion square feet, representing a market of approximately $2.3 billion. Sales of U.S.
hardwood are primarily distributed to the residential market for both new construction and residential replacement.

In 2007, the U.S.
resilient and rubber industry shipped 3.3 billion square feet, representing a market of approximately $2.0 billion. Sales of U.S. resilient are primarily distributed to the residential market for both new construction and residential replacement.

In 2007, the U.S. laminate industry shipped 0.9 billion square feet, or $1.1 billion. In 2007, the European laminate industry produced 4.4
billion square feet which accounted for approximately 12% of the European floor covering market. Sales of U.S. laminate flooring are primarily distributed through the residential replacement market. Sales to other end user markets are not
significant.

Sales and Distribution

Mohawk Segment

Through its Mohawk segment, the Company designs, manufactures, distributes and markets hundreds of styles of
carpet and rugs in a broad range of colors, textures and patterns. In addition, the Mohawk segment markets and distributes ceramic tile, laminate, hardwood, resilient floor covering, carpet pad and flooring accessories. The Mohawk segment positions
product lines in all price ranges and emphasizes quality, style, performance and service. The Mohawk segment markets and distributes its soft and hard surface product lines to over 30,000 customers, which include independent floor covering
retailers, home centers, mass merchandisers, department stores, commercial dealers and commercial end users. Some products are also marketed through private labeling programs. Sales to residential customers represent a significant portion of the
total industry and the majority of the Company’s carpet and rug sales.



Index to Financial Statements

The Company has positioned its premier residential
carpet and rug brand names across all price ranges. Mohawk, Horizon, “WundaWeve

®

,” Ralph Lauren and Karastan are positioned to sell primarily in the medium-to-high retail price
channels in the residential broadloom market. These lines have substantial brand name recognition among carpet dealers and retailers, with the Karastan and Mohawk brands having the highest consumer recognition in the industry. Karastan is the leader
in the exclusive high-end market. The Aladdin and Mohawk Home brand names compete primarily in the value retail price channel. The Portico

®

and Portico Select brand names compete primarily
in the builder market. The Company markets its hard surface product lines, which include Mohawk Ceramic, Mohawk Hardwood, Congoleum and Mohawk Laminate across all price ranges.

The Company offers marketing and advertising support through dealer programs like Mohawk
Floorscapes

®

, Mohawk ColorCenter

®

, Mohawk Floorz

®

and Karastan
Gallery. These programs offer varying degrees of support to dealers in the form of sales and management training, merchandising systems, exclusive promotions and assistance in certain administrative functions such as consumer credit, advertising and
insurance.

The commercial customer base is divided into several channels: corporate
office space, educational institutions, hospitality facilities, retail space, public finance, government and health care facilities. Different purchase decision makers and decision-making processes exist for each channel. In addition, the Company
produces and sells broadloom carpet and carpet tile under the brand names “Bigelow Commercial

®

,” Lees, Durkan, “Karastan Contract

®

,” and Merit.

The Company’s sales forces are generally organized based on product type and sales
channels in order to best serve each type of customer. Product delivery to dealers is done predominantly on Mohawk trucks operating from strategically positioned warehouses/cross-docks which receive inbound product directly from the source of
manufacture.

Dal-Tile Segment

The Dal-Tile segment designs, manufactures and markets a broad line of ceramic tile, porcelain tile and natural stone products. Products are distributed through separate distribution channels consisting of retailers, contractors, commercial
users, independent distributors and home centers. The business is organized to address the specific customer needs of each distribution channel, and dedicated sales forces support the various channels.

The Company serves as a “one-stop” source that provides customers with one of the ceramic tile industry’s broadest product lines—a
complete selection of glazed floor tile, glazed wall tile, glazed and unglazed ceramic mosaic tile, porcelain tile, quarry tile and stone products, as well as allied products. In addition to products manufactured by the Company’s ceramic tile
business, the Company also purchases products from other manufacturers to enhance its product offering.

The Company has two of the leading
brand names in the U.S. ceramic tile industry—Dal-Tile and American Olean. The Dal-Tile and American Olean brand names date back over fifty years and are well recognized in the industry. Both of these brands are supported by a fully integrated
marketing program, displays, merchandising (sample boards and chip chests), literature/catalogs and an Internet website.

A network of
approximately 250 sales service centers distributes primarily the Dal-Tile brand product with a fully integrated marketing program, emphasizing a focus on quality and fashion serving customers in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. The service centers
provide distribution points for customer pick-up, local delivery and showrooms to assist customers. The broad product offering satisfies the needs of its residential and commercial customers.

The independent distributor channel offers a distinct product line under the American Olean brand. Currently, the American Olean brand is distributed
through approximately 50 independent distributors that



Index to Financial Statements

service a variety of residential and commercial customers. The Company is focused on increasing its presence in the independent distributor channel,
particularly in tile products that are most commonly used in flooring applications.

The Company has six regional distribution centers in
the Dal-Tile operations. These centers help deliver high-quality customer service by focusing on shorter lead times, increased order fill rates and improved on-time deliveries to customers.

Unilin Segment

The Unilin segment
manufactures, licenses, distributes and markets laminate flooring in Europe and the U.S. It also produces hardwood flooring, roofing systems and other wood products. Products are distributed through separate distribution channels consisting of
retailers, independent distributors and home centers. Unilin U.S. operations also manufacture Mohawk branded laminate and hardwood flooring which sells through the Mohawk channel. The majority of Unilin’s laminate sales, both in the U.S. and
Europe, are for residential replacement. The business is organized to address the specific customer needs of each distribution channel.

In
the U.S., the Unilin operations have three regional distribution centers for laminate and wood products. These distribution centers help deliver high-quality customer service and also enhance the Company’s ability to plan and schedule
production and manage inventory requirements.

In Europe, the Unilin operations distribute products directly from manufacturing facilities.
This integration with manufacturing sites allows for quick responses to customer needs and high inventory turns.

The Unilin segment
markets and sells laminate and hardwood flooring products under the Quick-Step, Columbia Flooring, Century Flooring, and Universal Flooring brands. In addition, Unilin also sells laminate and hardwood flooring products under private label. The
Company believes Quick-Step is one of the leading brand names in the U.S. and European flooring industry.

Advertising and Promotion

The Company promotes its brands through advertising in both television and print media as well as in the form of cooperative advertising, point-of-sale
displays, advertising and sponsorship of a cycling team, and marketing literature provided to assist in marketing various flooring styles. The Company also continues to rely on the substantial brand name recognition of its product lines. The cost of
producing display samples, a significant promotional expense, is partially offset by sales of samples.

Manufacturing and Operations

Mohawk Segment

The Company’s
manufacturing operations are vertically integrated and include the extrusion of resin and post-consumer plastics into polypropylene, polyester and nylon fiber, yarn processing, backing manufacturing, tufting, weaving, dyeing, coating and finishing.
Capital expenditures are primarily focused on improving productivity and reducing costs. Over the past three years, the Mohawk Segment has incurred capital expenditures that have helped increase manufacturing efficiency and improve overall cost
competitiveness.

Dal-Tile Segment

The Company believes that its manufacturing organization offers competitive advantages due to its ability to manufacture a differentiated product line consisting of one of the industry’s broadest product
offerings of colors, textures and finishes, as well as the industry’s largest offering of trim and angle pieces and its ability to utilize



Index to Financial Statements

the industry’s newest technology. In addition, Dal-Tile also imports or sources a portion of its product to supplement its product offerings. Over the
past three years, the Dal-Tile segment has invested in capital expenditures, principally in state-of-the-art equipment, to increase manufacturing capacity, improve efficiency and develop new capabilities.

Unilin Segment

The Company’s
laminate flooring manufacturing operations are vertically integrated, both in the U.S. and in Europe, and include high-density fiberboard (“HDF”) production, paper impregnation, short-cycle pressing, cutting and milling. The European
operations also include resin production. Unilin has state-of-the-art equipment that results in competitive manufacturing in terms of cost and flexibility. Most of the equipment for the production of laminate flooring in Belgium and North Carolina
is relatively new. The Company’s laminate flooring plant in North Carolina is one of the largest in the U.S. In addition, Unilin is one of the few fully integrated laminate manufacturers in the U.S. with its own HDF production facility. The
acquisition of Columbia added manufacturing capability for both engineered and prefinished solid wood flooring for the U.S. and European markets. Over the past three years, the Unilin segment has invested in capital expenditures, principally in new
plants and state-of-the-art equipment to increase manufacturing capacity, improve efficiency and develop new capabilities.

The
manufacturing facilities for other activities in the Unilin business (roofing systems and other wood products) are all configured for cost-efficient manufacturing and production flexibility and are competitive in the European market.

Raw Materials and Suppliers

Mohawk Segment

The principal raw materials the carpet and rug business uses are nylon, polypropylene, polyester and wool resins and fibers, synthetic
backing materials, latex and various dyes and chemicals. Major raw materials used in the Company’s manufacturing process are available from independent sources and the Company obtains most of its externally purchased nylon fibers principally
from two major suppliers: Invista Inc., and Solutia, Inc. Although temporary disruptions of supply of carpet raw materials were experienced in 2005, the carpet and rug business has not experienced significant shortages of raw materials in recent
years. The Company believes that there is an adequate supply of all grades of resin and fiber, which are readily available.

Dal-Tile
Segment

In the ceramic tile business, the Company manufactures tile primarily from clay, talc, nepheline syenite and glazes. The
Company has entered into a long-term supply agreement for most of its talc requirements.

The Company has long-term clay mining rights in
Kentucky and Mississippi that satisfy nearly all of its clay requirements for producing unglazed quarry tile. The Company purchases a number of different grades of clay for the manufacture of its non-quarry tile. The Company believes that there is
an adequate supply of all grades of clay and that all are readily available from a number of independent sources.

The Company has two
suppliers for its nepheline syenite requirements. If these suppliers were unable to satisfy the requirements, the Company believes that alternative supply arrangements would be available.

Glazes are used on a significant percentage of manufactured tile. Glazes consist of frit (ground glass), zircon, stains and other materials, with frit
being the largest ingredient. The Company manufactures approximately 60% of its frit requirements.



Index to Financial Statements

Unilin Segment

The principal raw materials used in producing boards, laminate and hardwood flooring are wood, paper, resins, coatings and stains.

Wood supply is a very fragmented market in Europe. The Company has long-standing relationships with approximately 50 suppliers. These suppliers provide a wide variety of wood species, varying from fresh round wood to
several kinds of by-products of sawmills and used wood recycled specifically for chipboard production, giving the Company a cost-effective and secure supply of raw material. In the U.S., the Company has a long-term contract with a contiguously
located lumber company that supplies most of its total needs for HDF board production. Supply for hardwood flooring is both localized and global depending on the various species of hardwoods and hardwood veneers used in the production of engineered
hardwood flooring being available.

Major manufacturers supply the papers required in the laminate flooring business in both Europe and the
U.S. The Company manufactures most of the paper impregnation internally in its laminate flooring facilities in Europe and the U.S. In Europe, the resins for paper impregnation are manufactured by the Company, which permits greater control over the
laminate flooring manufacturing process, enabling the Company to produce higher-quality products.

The Company buys the balance of its
resin requirements from a number of companies. The Company believes there are ample sources of supply located within a reasonable distance of Unilin’s facilities.

Competition

The principal methods of competition within the floor covering industry generally are
service, style, quality, price and, to a certain extent, product innovation and technology. In each of the markets, price competition and market coverage are particularly important because there is limited differentiation among competing product
lines. In the Mohawk and Dal-Tile segments, the investments in advanced manufacturing, computer systems, the extensive diversity of equipment, as well as the Company’s marketing strategy and distribution system, contribute to its ability to
compete primarily on the basis of performance, quality, style and service, rather than just price. The Company is one of the largest carpet and rug manufacturers in the world. While the ceramic tile industry is more fragmented, the Company believes
it is substantially larger than the next largest competitor and that it is the only significant manufacturer with its own North American distribution system. In the laminate flooring market, the Company believes it has a competitive advantage as a
result of Unilin’s industry leading design and patented technologies, which allows the Company to distinguish its laminate and hardwood flooring products in the areas of finish, quality, installation and assembly. The Company faces competition
in the laminate and hardwood flooring market from a large number of domestic and foreign manufacturers.

Mohawk Segment

The carpet and rug industry is highly competitive. Based on industry publications, the top 5 North American carpet and rug manufacturers (including
their North American and foreign divisions) in 2007 had worldwide carpet and rug sales in excess of $9 billion of the over $14 billion market. The Company believes it is the second largest producer of carpets and rugs (in terms of sales dollars) in
the world based on its 2007 sales.

Dal-Tile Segment

The Company estimates that over 100 tile manufacturers, more than half of which are based outside the U.S., compete for sales of ceramic tile to customers located in the U.S. Although the U.S. ceramic tile industry is
highly fragmented at both the manufacturing and distribution levels, the Company believes it is one of the largest manufacturers, distributors and marketers of ceramic tile in the U.S. and the world.



Index to Financial Statements

Unilin Segment

Laminate and hardwood flooring are leading growth products in the U.S. floor covering industry. Laminate flooring is produced by more than 130 industrial manufacturers in 25 countries. The Company believes it is one
of the largest manufacturers, distributors and marketers of laminate flooring in the world, with a focus on high-end products. The Company is also one of the few vertically-integrated laminate flooring manufacturers in the U.S. producing both high
density fiberboard and laminate flooring. The Company estimates that there are over 100 wood manufacturers located in various countries. Following the Wood Acquisition, the Company believes it is one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of
hardwood in the U.S.

Patents and Trademarks

Intellectual property is important to the Company’s business, and the Company relies on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to protect its interests.

The Company uses several trademarks that it considers important in the marketing of its products,
including Aladdin, American Olean, Bigelow, Dal-Tile, Durkan, Horizon, Karastan, Lees, Mohawk, Mohawk Home, Portico, Quick-Step, Ralph Lauren, “UNILIN

®

,” UNICLIC, Columbia
Flooring, Century Flooring, Universal Flooring, and “PureBond

®

”.

Unilin owns a number of important patent families in Europe and the U.S. The most important of these patent families is the UNICLIC family, as well as the snap, pretension, clearance and beveled edge patent families, which protects
Unilin’s interlocking laminate flooring panel technology. The patents in the UNICLIC family are not expected to expire until 2017.

Sales Terms and
Major Customers

The Company’s sales terms are the same as those generally available throughout the industry. The Company generally
permits its customers to return carpet, rug, ceramic tile, wood, vinyl and laminate flooring purchased from it within specified time periods from the date of sale, if the customer is not satisfied with the quality of the product.

During 2008, no single customer accounted for more than 5% of total net sales, and the top ten customers accounted for less than 15% of the
Company’s sales. The Company believes the loss of one or a few major customers would not have a material adverse effect on its business.

Employees

As of December 31, 2008, the Company employed approximately 31,200 persons consisting of approximately 24,900 in the U.S.,
approximately 3,300 in Mexico, approximately 2,300 in Europe, approximately 600 in Malaysia and approximately 100 in Canada. The majority of the Company’s European and Mexican manufacturing employees are members of unions. Most of the
Company’s U.S. employees are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement. Additionally, the Company has not experienced any strikes or work stoppages in the U.S., Mexico or Malaysia for over 20 years. The Company believes that its
relations with its employees are good.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

Certain Factors affecting the
Company’s Performance

In addition to the other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk
factors should be considered when evaluating an investment in shares of Common Stock.

If any of the events described in these risks were
to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

The current
uncertainty in the credit markets, downturns in the global economy and the Company’s business could affect the overall availability and cost of credit.

The current uncertainty in the credit markets could also limit demand for our products, and affect the overall availability and cost of credit. At this time, it is unclear whether and to what extent the actions taken
by the U.S. government, and other measures currently being implemented or contemplated, will mitigate the effects of the situation. While we do not anticipate any immediate need to access the credit markets, the impact of the current situation on
our ability to obtain financing in the future, and the cost and terms of it, is uncertain. These and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and operating results.
Further, these generally negative economic and business conditions may factor into our periodic credit ratings assessment by either or both Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services. The rating
agency’s evaluation is based on a number of factors, which include scale and diversification, brand strength, profitability, leverage, liquidity and interest coverage. On November 7, 2008, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. announced
that it placed the Company’s Baa3 long term rating on review for possible downgrade. On February 25, 2009, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. announced that it had downgraded its ratings on the Company’s senior unsecured notes to
Ba1 from Baa3 and was maintaining a negative rating outlook, following the completion of its rating review. This downgrade will increase the Company’s interest expense by approximately $3.5 million per year and could adversely affect the cost
of and ability to obtain additional credit in the future. Additional downgrades in the Company’s credit rating could further increase the cost of its existing credit and adversely affect the cost of and ability to obtain additional credit in
the future, and the Company can provide no assurances that additional downgrades will not occur. Additionally, our credit facilities require us to meet certain financial covenants, including certain debt to capitalization ratios. Failure to comply
with these covenants could materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our operations or capital needs and to engage in other activities that may be in our best interest.

The floor covering industry is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, such as consumer confidence and income, corporate and government spending, interest rate levels, availability of credit and
demand for housing. The current downturn in the U.S. and global economies, along with the housing markets in such economies, has negatively impacted the floor covering industry and the Company’s business. These difficult economic conditions may
continue or deteriorate in the foreseeable future. Further, significant or prolonged declines in such economies or in spending for replacement floor covering products or new construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s business.

The floor covering industry in which the Company participates is highly dependent on general economic
conditions, such as consumer confidence and income, corporate and government spending, interest rate levels, availability of credit and demand for housing. The Company derives a majority of the Company’s sales from the



Index to Financial Statements

replacement segment of the market. Therefore, economic changes that result in a significant or prolonged decline in spending for remodeling and replacement
activities could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations.

The floor covering industry is
highly dependent on construction activity, including new construction, which is cyclical in nature and currently in a downturn. The current downturn in the U.S. and global economies, along with the housing markets in such economies, has negatively
impacted the floor covering industry and the Company’s business. Although the impact of a decline in new construction activity is typically accompanied by an increase in remodeling and replacement activity, these activities have also lagged
during the current downturn. The difficult economic conditions may continue or deteriorate in the foreseeable future. A significant or prolonged decline in residential or commercial construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s business and results of operations.

In periods of rising costs, the Company may be unable to pass cost increases of raw materials and
fuel-related costs on to its customers, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s profitability.

The prices
of raw materials and fuel-related costs vary with market conditions. Although the Company generally attempts to pass on increases in raw material and fuel-related costs to its customers, the Company’s ability to do so is dependent upon the rate
and magnitude of any increase, competitive pressures and market conditions for the Company’s products. There have been in the past, and may be in the future, periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be recovered. During such
periods of time, the Company’s profitability may be materially adversely affected.

The Company faces intense competition in the flooring
industry, which could decrease demand for the Company’s products or force it to lower prices, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s profitability.

The floor covering industry is highly competitive. The Company faces competition from a number of manufacturers and independent distributors. Some of the
Company’s competitors are larger and have greater resources and access to capital than the Company does. Maintaining the Company’s competitive position may require substantial investments in the Company’s product development efforts,
manufacturing facilities, distribution network and sales and marketing activities. Competitive pressures may also result in decreased demand for the Company’s products or force the Company to lower prices. Any of these factors could have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

The Company may be unable to obtain raw materials on a timely basis, which could have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

The principal raw materials used in the Company’s manufacturing
operations include nylon and polyester and polypropylene resins and fibers, which are used primarily in the Company’s carpet and rugs business; talc, clay, nepheline syenite and various glazes, including frit (ground glass), zircon and stains,
which are used exclusively in the Company’s ceramic tile business; wood, paper, and resins which are used primarily in the Company’s laminate flooring business; and other materials. For certain of such raw materials, the Company is
dependent on one or a small number of suppliers. An adverse change in the Company’s relationship with such a supplier, the financial condition of such a supplier or such supplier’s ability to manufacture or deliver such raw materials to
the Company could lead to an interruption of supply. An extended interruption in the supply of these or other raw materials used in the Company’s business or in the supply of suitable substitute materials would disrupt the Company’s
operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations
and may affect the comparability of results between the Company’s financial periods.

The results of the Company’s foreign
subsidiaries reported in the local currency are translated into U.S. dollars for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for the statement of operations accounts using, principally, the Company’s
average rates during the period. The exchange rates between some of these currencies and the U.S. dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future. The Company may not be able to manage effectively the
Company’s currency translation risks, and volatility in currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and affect comparability of the Company’s results between financial
periods.

The Company may experience certain risks associated with acquisitions.

The Company has typically grown its business through acquisitions. Growth through acquisitions involves risks, many of which may continue to affect the
Company after the acquisition. The Company cannot give assurance that an acquired company will achieve the levels of revenue, profitability and production that the Company expects. The combination of an acquired company’s business with the
Company’s existing businesses involves risks. The Company cannot be assured that reported earnings will meet expectations because of goodwill and intangible asset impairment, increased interest costs and issuance of additional securities or
incurrence of debt. The Company may also face challenges in consolidating functions, integrating the Company’s organizations, procedures, operations and product lines in a timely and efficient manner and retaining key personnel. These
challenges may result in:

•

maintaining executive offices in different locations;

•

manufacturing and selling different types of products through different distribution channels;

•

conducting business from various locations;

•

maintaining different operating systems and software on different computer hardware; and

•

providing different employment and compensation arrangements for employees.

The diversion of management attention and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could have a material adverse effect on
the Company’s revenues, level of expenses and operating results.

Failure to successfully manage and integrate an acquisition with the
Company’s existing operations could lead to the potential loss of customers of the acquired business, the potential loss of employees who may be vital to the new operations, the potential loss of business opportunities or other adverse
consequences that could affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. Even if integration occurs successfully, failure of the acquisition to achieve levels of anticipated sales growth, profitability or productivity or
otherwise perform as expected, may adversely impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.

A failure to identify suitable
acquisition candidates and to complete acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

As part of
the Company’s business strategy, the Company intends to continue to pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses. Although the Company regularly evaluates acquisition opportunities, the Company may not be able successfully to identify
suitable acquisition candidates; to obtain sufficient financing on acceptable terms to fund acquisitions; to complete acquisitions and integrate acquired businesses with the Company’s existing businesses; or to manage profitably acquired
businesses.

The Company has been, and in the future may be, subject to claims and liabilities under environmental, health and safety laws and
regulations, which could be significant.

The Company’s operations are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws
and regulations, including those governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, and the use, storage, treatment and disposal of



Index to Financial Statements

hazardous materials. The applicable requirements under these laws are subject to amendment, to the imposition of new or additional requirements and to
changing interpretations of agencies or courts. The Company could incur material expenditures to comply with new or existing regulations, including fines and penalties.

The nature of the Company’s operations, including the potential discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions, exposes it to the risk of claims under environmental, health and safety laws and
regulations. The Company could incur material costs or liabilities in connection with such claims.

Changes in international trade laws and in the
business, political and regulatory environment in Mexico and Europe could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

The Company’s manufacturing facilities in Mexico and Europe represent a significant portion of the Company’s capacity for ceramic tile and laminate flooring, respectively. Accordingly, an event that has a material adverse impact
on either of these operations could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The business, regulatory and political environments in Mexico and Europe differ from those in the U.S., and the Company’s Mexican and European operations are
exposed to legal, currency, tax, political, and economic risks specific to the countries in which they occur, particularly with respect to labor regulations, which tend to be more stringent in Europe and, to a lesser extent, Mexico. The Company
cannot assure investors that the Company will succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies to counter the foregoing factors effectively in each location where the Company does business and therefore that the foregoing factors will
not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations or upon the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.

If the
Company is unable to protect the Company’s intellectual property rights, particularly with respect to the Company’s patented laminate flooring technology and the Company’s registered trademarks, the Company’s business and
prospects could be harmed.

The future success and competitive position of certain of the Company’s businesses, particularly
the Company’s laminate flooring business, depend in part upon the Company’s ability to obtain and maintain proprietary technology used in the Company’s principal product families. The Company relies, in part, on the patent, trade
secret and trademark laws of the U.S. and countries in Europe, as well as confidentiality agreements with some of the Company’s employees, to protect that technology.

The Company has obtained a number of patents relating to the Company’s products and
associated methods and has filed applications for additional patents, including the UNICLIC

®

family of patents, which protects Unilin’s interlocking laminate flooring panel technology.
The Company cannot assure investors that any patents owned by or issued to it will provide the Company with competitive advantages, that third parties will not challenge these patents, or that the Company’s pending patent applications will be
approved. In addition, patent filings by third parties, whether made before or after the date of the Company’s filings, could render the Company’s intellectual property less valuable.

Furthermore, despite the Company’s efforts, the Company may be unable to prevent competitors and/or third parties from using the Company’s
technology without the Company’s authorization, independently developing technology that is similar to that of the Company or designing around the Company’s patents. The use of the Company’s technology or similar technology by others
could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage the Company has developed, cause the Company to lose sales or otherwise harm the Company’s business. In addition, if the Company does not obtain sufficient protection for the Company’s
intellectual property, the Company’s competitiveness in the markets it serves could be significantly impaired, which would limit the Company’s growth and future revenue.

The Company has obtained and applied for numerous U.S. and Foreign Service marks and trademark registrations and will continue to evaluate the
registration of additional service marks and trademarks, as appropriate. The Company cannot guarantee that any of the Company’s pending or future applications will be



Index to Financial Statements

approved by the applicable governmental authorities. Moreover, even if such applications are approved, third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise
challenge the registrations. A failure to obtain trademark registrations in the U.S. and in other countries could limit the Company’s ability to protect the Company’s trademarks and impede the Company’s marketing efforts in those
jurisdictions.

The Company generally requires third parties with access to the Company’s trade secrets to agree to keep such
information confidential. While such measures are intended to protect the Company’s trade secrets, there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that the Company will have adequate remedies for any breach or that the
Company’s confidential and proprietary information and technology will not be independently developed by or become otherwise known to third parties. In any of these circumstances, the Company’s competitiveness could be significantly
impaired, which would limit the Company’s growth and future revenue.

Companies may claim that the Company infringed their intellectual property
or proprietary rights, which could cause it to incur significant expenses or prevent it from selling the Company’s products.

In the past, companies have claimed that certain technologies incorporated in the Company’s products infringe their patent rights. There can be no assurance that the Company will not receive notices in the future from parties asserting
that the Company’s products infringe, or may infringe, those parties’ intellectual property rights. The Company cannot be certain that the Company’s products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property
rights of others. Historically, patent applications in the U.S. and some foreign countries have not been publicly disclosed until the patent is issued (or, in some recent cases, until 18 months following submission), and the Company may not be aware
of currently filed patent applications that relate to the Company’s products or processes. If patents are later issued on these applications, the Company may be liable for infringement.

Furthermore, the Company may initiate claims or litigation against parties for infringement of the Company’s proprietary rights or to establish the
invalidity, noninfringement, or unenforceability of the proprietary rights of others. Likewise, the Company may have similar claims brought against it by competitors. Litigation, either as plaintiff or defendant, could result in significant expense
to the Company and divert the efforts of the Company’s technical and management personnel from operations, whether or not such litigation is resolved in the Company’s favor. In the event of an adverse ruling in any such litigation, the
Company might be required to pay substantial damages (including punitive damages and attorney’s fees), discontinue the use and sale of infringing products, expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology or obtain licenses to
infringing technology. There can be no assurance that licenses to disputed technology or intellectual property rights would be available on reasonable commercial terms, if at all. In the event of a successful claim against the Company along with
failure to develop or license a substitute technology, the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.

The Company is subject to changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both costs and the risk of noncompliance.

The Company’s stock is publicly traded. As a result, the Company is subject to the rules and regulations of federal and state agencies and financial
market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. These entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC and NYSE, have in recent years
issued new requirements and regulations, most notably the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. From time to time since the adoption of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, these authorities have continued to develop additional regulations or interpretations of
existing regulations. The Company’s efforts to comply with the regulations and interpretations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative costs and diversion of management’s time and
attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities.

Declines in the Company’s business conditions may result in an impairment of the Company’s tangible and
intangible assets which could result in a material non-cash charge.

A decrease in the Company’s market capitalization,
including a short-term decline in stock price, or a negative long-term performance outlook, could result in an impairment of its tangible and intangible assets which results when the carrying value of the Company’s assets exceed their fair
value. In 2008, the Company’s goodwill and other intangible assets suffered an impairment and additional impairment charges could occur in future periods.

Forward-Looking Information

Certain of the statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly those anticipating
future performance, business prospects, growth and operating strategies, proposed acquisitions, and similar matters, and those that include the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “forecast,” “estimates” or
similar expressions constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. For those statements,
Mohawk claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. There can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements will be accurate because they are based
on many assumptions, which involve risks and uncertainties. The following important factors could cause future results to differ: changes in industry conditions; competition; raw material prices; energy costs; timing and level of capital
expenditures; integration of acquisitions; introduction of new products; rationalization of operations; litigation; and other risks identified in Mohawk’s SEC reports and public announcements.

Properties

The Company owns a 47,500 square foot
headquarters office in Calhoun, Georgia on an eight-acre site. The Company also owns a 2,089,000 square foot manufacturing facility located in Dalton, Georgia, used by the Mohawk segment, 1,744,072 and 974,900 square foot manufacturing facilities
located in Monterey, Mexico and Muskogee, Oklahoma, respectively, used by the Dal-Tile segment, and a 1,128,535 square foot manufacturing facility located in Wielsbeke, Belgium used by the Unilin segment.

The following table summarizes the Company’s facilities both owned and leased for each segment in square feet:

The Company’s properties are in good condition and adequate for its requirements. The Company
believes its principal plants are generally adequate to meet its production plans pursuant to the Company’s long-term sales goals. In the ordinary course of business, the Company monitors the condition of its facilities to ensure that they
remain adequate to meet long-term sales goals and production plans.

Legal Proceedings

The Company is involved in
litigation from time to time in the regular course of its business. Except as noted below there are no material legal proceedings pending or known by the Company to be contemplated to which the Company is a party or to which any of its property is
subject.

In Shirley Williams et al. v. Mohawk Industries, Inc., four plaintiffs filed a putative class action lawsuit in January 2004 in
the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia (Rome Division), alleging that they are former and current employees of the Company and that the actions and conduct of the Company, including the employment of persons who are
not authorized to work in the United States, have damaged them and the other members of the putative class by suppressing the wages of the Company’s hourly employees in Georgia. The plaintiffs seek a variety of relief, including (a) treble
damages; (b) return of any allegedly unlawful profits; and (c) attorney’s fees and costs of litigation. In February 2004, the Company filed a Motion to Dismiss the Complaint, which was denied by the District Court in April 2004.
Following appellate review of this decision, the case was returned to the District Court for further proceedings. On December 18, 2007, the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification. On March 3, 2008, the District Court denied the
plaintiffs motion for class certification. The plaintiffs then appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit on March 17, 2008, where the matter is currently pending. Discovery has been stayed at the District
Court while the appeal is pending. The Company will continue to vigorously defend itself against this action.

In Collins & Aikman
Floorcoverings, Inc., et. al. v. Interface, Inc., United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia (Rome Division), Mohawk Industries, Inc. joined Collins & Aikman Floorcoverings, Inc. (“CAF”) and Shaw Industries
Group, Inc. (“Shaw”) in suing Interface, Inc. (“Interface”) for declaratory judgments that United States Patent 6,908,656 (the “Patent”), assigned to Interface and relating to certain styles of carpet tiles, is not
infringed and is invalid. Also in June 2005, in Interface, Inc., et el. v. Mohawk Industries, Inc., et al. United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia (Atlanta Division), Interface sued Mohawk Industries, Inc., Mohawk Carpet
Corporation, and Mohawk Commercial, Inc. for allegedly infringing the Patent. Interface brought similar suits against entities affiliated with CAF and Shaw. Interface is seeking monetary damages as well as injunctive relief. The cases have been
consolidated in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia (Rome Division). In January 2008, the Company joined CAF and Shaw in filing summary judgment motions seeking to establish as a matter of law before trial that the
Patent was invalid, that it was not willfully infringed, and that Interface could not obtain damages for lost profits. On February 25, 2009, the District Court (i) denied the Company, CAF’s and Shaw’s motions that the patent was
invalid (ii) granted their motions that should infringement be found that any such infringement would not be willful, and (iii) granted in part and denied in part their motions that Interface could not obtain damages for lost profits. The
Company is vigorously pursuing its declaratory judgment claims of invalidity and non-infringement with respect to the Patent and defending against the claims brought by Interface for infringement of the Patent. A trial date is anticipated to be set
for later in 2009.

The Company believes that adequate provisions for resolution of all contingencies, claims and pending litigation have
been made for probable losses and that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition but could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations in a given quarter or annual
period.

Environmental Matters

The Company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use, storage, treatment and
disposal of solid and hazardous materials, and the cleanup of contamination associated therewith. Because of the nature of the Company’s business, the Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs relating to compliance with such laws
and regulations. The Company is involved in various proceedings relating to environmental matters and is currently engaged in environmental investigation, remediation and post-closure care programs at certain sites. The Company has provided accruals
for such activities that it has determined to be both probable and reasonably estimable. The Company does not expect that the ultimate liability with respect to such activities will have a material adverse effect on its operations, but may have an
effect on the results of operations for a given quarter or annual period.

Selected Financial Data

The following table sets
forth the selected financial data of the Company for the periods indicated, which information is derived from the consolidated financial statements of the Company. On October 31, 2005, the Company acquired all the outstanding shares of Unilin
Holding NV (“Unilin Acquisition”). The total purchase price of the Unilin Acquisition, net of cash, was approximately Euro 2.1 billion (approximately $2.5 billion). On August 13, 2007, the Company completed the Wood Acquisition for
approximately $147 million in cash. The consolidated financial statements include the results of all acquisitions from the date of acquisition. The selected financial data should be read in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Company’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein.

(a)

In 2005, gross margin was impacted by a non-recurring $34,300 ($22,300 net of tax) fair value adjustment to Unilin’s acquired inventory.

(b)

In 2008, the Company recorded an impairment of goodwill and other intangibles which included $276,807 for the Mohawk segment, $531,930 for the Dal-Tile segment and $734,660 for the
Unilin segment.

(c)

In 2007 and 2006, the Company received partial refunds from the U.S. government in reference to settlement of custom disputes dating back to 1982.

(d)

During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company implemented a change in residency of one of its foreign subsidiaries. This tax restructuring resulted in a step up in the
subsidiary’s taxable basis, which resulted in the recognition of a deferred tax asset of approximately $245,000 and a related income tax benefit of approximately $272,000. During the third quarter of 2008, the Company recorded a valuation
allowance of approximately $253,000 against the deferred tax asset described above.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

The Company is a leading producer of floor covering products for residential and commercial
applications in the U.S. and Europe with net sales in 2008 of $6.8 billion. The Company is the second largest carpet and rug manufacturer, a leading manufacturer, marketer and distributor of ceramic tile, natural stone and hardwood flooring in the
U.S. and a leading producer of laminate flooring in the U.S. and Europe.

The Company has three reporting segments, the Mohawk segment, the
Dal-Tile segment and the Unilin segment. The Mohawk segment manufactures, markets and distributes its product lines primarily in North America, which include carpet, rugs, pad, ceramic tile, hardwood, resilient and laminate, through its network of
regional distribution centers and satellite warehouses using company-operated trucks, common carrier or rail transportation. The segment product lines are sold through various selling channels, which include floor covering retailers, home centers,
mass merchandisers, department stores, independent distributors, commercial dealers and commercial end users. The Dal-Tile segment manufactures, markets and distributes its product lines primarily in North America, which include ceramic tile,
porcelain tile and stone products, through its network of regional distribution centers and approximately 250 company-operated sales service centers using company-operated trucks, common carriers or rail transportation. The segment product lines are
purchased by floor covering retailers, home centers, independent distributors, tile specialty dealers, tile contractors, and commercial end users. The Unilin segment manufactures, markets and distributes its product lines primarily in North America
and Europe, which include laminate flooring, wood flooring, roofing systems and other wood products through various selling channels, which include retailers, home centers and independent distributors.

In 2007, the primary categories of the U.S. floor covering industry, based on sales dollars, were carpet and rug (62%), ceramic tile (13%), hardwood
(11%), resilient and rubber (9%), and laminate (5%).

The Company reported net loss of $1,458.2 million or diluted (loss) earnings per
share (“EPS”) of ($21.32) for 2008, compared to net earnings of $706.8 million and $10.32 EPS for 2007. The change in EPS resulted primarily from a $1,543.4 million pre-tax impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill and
other intangibles, a charge of $253 million to record a tax valuation allowance against the carrying amount of a deferred tax asset recognized in the fourth quarter of 2007, lower sales volumes, rising raw material and energy costs and business
restructurings. During 2008, the Company paid down approximately $333 million in debt.

The Company believes that industry demand for the
products manufactured by the Company will continue to be impacted by the softened demand that began in the fourth quarter of 2006 and worsened considerably during the later parts of 2008. The global economy continues in the most significant downturn
in recent history. Overall economic conditions and consumer sentiment have continued to deteriorate, which has intensified the pressure on the demand for housing and, as a result, the Company’s products. As the Company slowed production and raw
materials purchases in the fourth quarter to reduce inventory in response to reduced demand, the proportion of higher cost products in inventory increased. Consequently, the Company anticipates that its margins and earnings will be negatively
impacted until demand for the Company’s products increases and the portion of higher cost products in inventory declines as higher cost inventory flows through earnings.

Although the Company cannot determine with certainty as to when the deteriorating market conditions will stabilize and begin to improve, the Company
believes it is well-positioned in the long-term as the industry improves. The Company continues to monitor expenses and manufacturing capacity based on current industry conditions and will continue to adjust as required.

Results of Operations

Following are the results of operations for the last three years:

Year Ended December 31, 2008, as Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2007

Net Sales

Net sales for the year ended
December 31, 2008, were $6,826.3 million, reflecting a decrease of $759.7 million, or 10.0%, from the $7,586.0 million reported for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was primarily driven by a decline in sales volumes of
approximately $973 million due to the continued decline in the U.S. residential markets, softening commercial demand and slowing European demand, partially offset by a benefit of approximately $131 million due to the net effect of price increases
and product mix, and a benefit of approximately $79 million due to favorable foreign exchange rates.

Mohawk Segment

—Net sales
decreased $577.5 million, or 13.7%, to $3,628.2 million in 2008, compared to $4,205.7 million in 2007. The decrease was primarily driven by a decline in sales volumes of approximately $639 million due to the continued decline in the U.S. residential
market and softening commercial demand, partially offset by a benefit of approximately $83 million due to the net effect of price increases and product mix.

Dal-Tile Segment

—Net sales decreased $122.3 million, or 6.3%, to $1,815.4 million in 2008, compared to $1,937.7 million reported in 2007. This decrease was primarily driven by a decline in sales volumes of
approximately $146 million due to the continued decline in the U.S. residential market, partially offset by a benefit of approximately $24 million due to the net effect of price increases and product mix.

Unilin Segment

—Net sales decreased $22.4 million, or 1.5%, to $1,465.2 million in 2008, compared to $1,487.6 million in 2007. The decrease in
net sales was driven by a decline in sales volume of approximately $188 million due to the continued decline in the U.S. residential market and slowing European demand, partially offset by a benefit of approximately $63 million due to the Wood
Acquisition, a benefit of approximately $79 million due to favorable foreign exchange rates and a benefit of approximately $23 million due to the net effect of price increases and product mix.



Index to Financial Statements

Quarterly net sales and the percentage changes in net sales by quarter for 2008 versus 2007 were as
follows (dollars in thousands)

Gross Profit

Gross profit was $1,737.8 million (25.5% of net sales) for 2008 and represented a decrease of $377.0 million, or 17.8%, compared to gross profit of $2,114.8 million (27.9% of net sales) for 2007. Gross profit was
unfavorably impacted by increasing costs for raw materials and energy of approximately $172 million, net of cost savings initiatives, and a decline in volumes of approximately $279 million, partially offset by the net effect of price increases and
product mix of approximately $97 million.

Selling, general and administrative expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2008 were $1,318.5 million (19.3% of net sales), reflecting a decrease of $46.2 million, or 3.4%,
compared to $1,364.7 million (18.0% of net sales) for 2007. The decrease in SG&A is attributable to various cost savings initiatives implemented by the Company, offset by approximately $25 million of unfavorable foreign exchange rates.

Impairment of goodwill and intangibles

During 2008, the Company recorded a $1,543.4 million impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount of the Company’s goodwill and intangible assets to their estimated fair value based upon the results of two interim impairment tests
conducted in the third and fourth quarters of 2008. The Company performed interim impairment tests because of a prolonged decline in the Company’s market capitalization during the third and fourth quarters of 2008, which the Company believes is
primarily a result of the weakness in the U.S. residential housing market and the slowing European economy. In both the third and fourth quarters of 2008, the Company concluded that the weakness in the U.S. residential housing market is likely to
persist based on its review of, among other things, sequential quarterly housing starts, recent turmoil surrounding the nation’s largest mortgage lenders, the potential negative impact on the availability of mortgage financing and housing start
forecasts published by national home builder associations pushing recovery in the U.S. residential housing market beyond 2009. The total impairment included $276.8 million in the Mohawk segment, $531.9 million in the Dal-Tile segment and $734.7
million in the Unilin segment. If, in the future, the Company’s market capitalization and/or the estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units were to decline further, it may be necessary to record further impairment charges.

Operating (loss) income

Operating
loss for 2008 was $1,124.1 million reflecting a decrease of $1,874.2 million compared to operating income of $750.1 million (9.9% of net sales) in 2007. The decrease was primarily driven by the recognition of impairment of goodwill and other
intangibles of $1,543.4 million, a decline in sales volumes of approximately $285 million and rising costs for raw materials and energy of approximately $116 million, net of cost savings initiatives, partially offset by a benefit of approximately
$130 million due to the net effect of price increases and product mix.



Index to Financial Statements

Mohawk Segment

—Operating loss was $216.2 million in 2008 reflecting a decrease of $471.1
million compared to operating income of $254.9 million (6.1% of segment net sales) in 2007. The decrease was primarily due to the impairment of goodwill and other intangibles of $276.8 million, a decline in sales volumes of approximately $142
million and rising costs for raw materials and energy of approximately $82 million, net of cost savings initiatives, partially offset by a benefit of approximately $82 million due to the net effect of price increases and product mix.

Dal-Tile Segment—

Operating loss was $323.4 million in 2008 reflecting a decrease of $582.1 million, compared to operating income of $258.7
million (13.4% of segment net sales) in 2007. The decrease was primarily due to the impairment of goodwill of $531.9 million, rising costs for raw materials and energy of approximately $31 million, net of cost savings initiatives, and a decline in
sales volumes of approximately $56 million, partially offset by a benefit of approximately $41 million due to the net effect of price increases and product mix.

Unilin Segment—

Operating loss was $564.9 million in 2008, reflecting a decrease of $837.2 million compared to operating income of $272.3 million (18.3% of segment net sales) in 2007. The decrease was
primarily due to the impairment of goodwill and other intangibles of $734.7 million, a decline in sales volumes of approximately $88 million and rising costs for raw materials and energy of approximately $19 million, net of cost savings initiatives,
partially offset by a benefit of approximately $7 million due to the net effect of price increases and product mix.

Interest expense

Interest expense for 2008 was $127.1 million compared to $154.5 million in 2007. The decrease in interest expense for 2008 as compared to 2007 was
attributable to lower average debt and lower average interest rates on outstanding revolving debt.

Income tax (benefit) expense

The 2008 provision for income tax was $180.1 million, as compared to an income tax benefit of $102.7 million for 2007. The effective tax rate for 2008 was
(14.1%) as compared to an effective tax rate benefit of 17.0% for 2007. The change in the tax rate was primarily due to the impact on pre-tax earnings of the impairment charge on non-deductible goodwill, the 2008 business restructurings, and
the recognition of a valuation allowance of $253 million, which is described below, against certain deferred tax assets that the Company believes is no longer more likely than not to be realized. Without the impact of these three items, the Company
would have reflected a 2008 provision for income tax of $70.5 million, as compared to a provision of $168.9 million for 2007, which excludes a tax benefit of approximately $272 million from the European restructuring described below.

In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company moved the intellectual property and treasury operations of an indirectly owned European entity to a new office
in another jurisdiction in Europe. The Company also indirectly owned a holding company in the new jurisdiction that provided certain treasury functions to Unilin, and the move allowed for the consolidation of the historical intellectual property and
treasury operations to be combined with those of the holding company’s treasury operations in a single jurisdiction in order to integrate and streamline the operations, to facilitate international acquisitions and to improve tax and cost
efficiencies. This restructuring resulted in a step up in the subsidiary’s taxable basis of its intellectual property. The step up relates primarily to intangible assets which will be amortized over 10 years for tax purposes. During the fourth
quarter of 2007, the Company evaluated the evidence for recognition of the deferred tax asset created through the restructuring and determined that, based on the available evidence, the deferred tax asset would more likely than not be realized. The
deferred tax asset recognized at December 31, 2007 was approximately $245 million and the related income tax benefit recognized in the financial statements was approximately $272 million.

During the third quarter of 2008, the Company reassessed the need for a valuation allowance against its
deferred tax assets. Actual cash flows have been less than those projected as of December 31, 2007, primarily due to the slowing worldwide economy and declining sales volume. The Company determined that, given the current and expected economic
conditions and the corresponding reductions in cash flows, its ability to realize the benefit of the deferred tax asset related to the European restructuring transaction described above, as well as tax losses generated in the same jurisdiction was
not more likely than not. Accordingly during the third quarter of 2008, the Company recorded a $253 million valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset created as a result of the European restructuring.

Year Ended December 31, 2007, as Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2006

Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007, were $7,586.0 million, reflecting a decrease of $319.8 million, or 4.0%, from the $7,905.8 million
reported for the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease primarily occurred in the Company’s U.S. residential new construction and replacement channels, which the Company believes was caused by the slowing U.S. housing industry offset
by stronger sales within the European product categories and the impact of the Wood Acquisition.

Mohawk Segment

—Net sales
decreased $536.4 million, or 11.3%, to $4,205.7 million in 2007 compared to $4,742.1 million in 2006. The decrease was due to lower demand in its residential new construction and replacement channels, which the Company believes resulted primarily
from the slowing U.S. housing industry.

Dal-Tile Segment

—Net sales decreased $4.1 million, or 0.2%, to $1,937.7 million in
2007 compared to $1,941.8 million reported in 2006. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower sales within its residential channel, which the Company believes was due to the slowing U.S. housing industry.

Unilin Segment

—Net sales increased $250.7 million, or 20.3%, to $1,487.6 million in 2007 compared to $1,236.9 million in 2006. The increase
in sales was driven by an increase in selling prices, higher demand in Europe, favorable Euro exchange rates, the Wood Acquisition and an increase in patent revenues.

Quarterly net sales and the percentage changes in net sales by quarter for 2007 versus 2006 were as follows (dollars in thousands)

Gross Profit

Gross profit was $2,114.8 million (27.9% of net sales) for 2007 and represented a decrease of $116.5 million, or 5.2%, compared to gross profit of $2,231.3 million (28.2% of net sales) for 2006. Gross profit as a
percentage of net sales for 2007 was unfavorably impacted by lower sales volume in the U.S., higher raw material costs and plant shutdowns in the U.S. offset by price increases and higher demand in Europe.

Selling, general and administrative expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2007 were $1,364.7 million (18.0% of net sales), reflecting a decrease of $27.6 million, or 2.0%, compared to $1,392.3 million (17.6% of net sales) for 2006. The increase in the selling,
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to lower sales in proportion to selling, general and administrative expenses.



Index to Financial Statements

Operating (loss) income

Operating income for 2007 was $750.1 million (9.9% of net sales) compared to $839.1 million (10.6% of net sales) in 2006. Operating income as a percentage of net sales in 2007 was unfavorably impacted by lower sales
volume, which the Company believes was primarily attributable to the slowing U.S. housing industry, and plant shutdowns partially offset by higher sales in Europe.

Mohawk Segment

—Operating income was $254.9 million (6.1% of segment net sales) in 2007 reflecting a decrease of $132.5 million compared to $387.4 million (8.2% of segment net sales) in 2006. Operating
income as a percentage of the Mohawk segment net sales was unfavorably impacted by its residential new construction and replacement channels, which the Company believes resulted from the slowing U.S. housing industry, increased manufacturing costs
resulting from lower production volume, higher raw material costs and plant shutdowns.

Dal-Tile Segment

—Operating income was
$258.7 million (13.4% of segment net sales) in 2007 reflecting a decrease of $12.2 million compared to $270.9 million (14.0% of segment net sales) in 2006. Operating income as a percentage of the Dal-Tile segment net sales was unfavorably impacted
by its residential channel, which the Company believes resulted from the slowing U.S. housing industry and a plant shutdown.

Unilin
Segment

—Operating income was $272.3 million (18.3% of segment net sales) in 2007 reflecting an increase of $58.2 million compared to $214.1 million (17.3% of segment net sales) in 2006. Operating income as a percentage of the Unilin segment
was favorably impacted by an increase in selling prices and higher demand.

Interest Expense

Interest expense for 2007 was $154.5 million compared to $173.7 million in 2006. The decrease in interest expense for 2007 as compared to 2006 was
attributable to lower average debt, partially offset by higher interest rates in 2007 when compared to 2006.

Income tax (benefit) expense

The Company had an income tax benefit of $102.7 million, or (17.0)% of earnings before income taxes for 2007, compared to an income tax
expense of $220.5 million, or 32.6% of earnings before income taxes for 2006. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company implemented a change in residency of one of its foreign subsidiaries. The Company moved the intellectual property and
treasury operations of an indirectly owned European entity to a new office in another jurisdiction in Europe. The Company also indirectly owned a holding company in the new jurisdiction that provided certain treasury functions to Unilin and the move
allowed for the consolidation of the historical intellectual property and treasury operations to be combined with those of the holding company’s treasury operations in a single jurisdiction in order to integrate and streamline the operations,
to facilitate international acquisitions and to improve tax and cost efficiencies. This restructuring resulted in a step up in the subsidiary’s taxable basis of its intellectual property. The step up relates primarily to intangible assets which
will be amortized over 10 years for tax purposes. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company evaluated the evidence for recognition of the deferred tax asset created through the restructuring and determined that, based on the available evidence,
the deferred tax asset would more likely than not be realized. The deferred tax asset recognized at December 31, 2007 was approximately $245 million and the related income tax benefit recognized in the financial statements was approximately
$272 million. The recognition of the deferred tax asset resulted in a reduction in the Company’s effective tax rate for the year. In addition the tax rate also decreased due to a greater percentage of income in lower taxed jurisdictions and
changes implemented in the third quarter of 2007, which resulted in higher interest deductions outside the U.S.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company’s primary capital requirements are for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. The Company’s capital
needs are met primarily through a combination of internally generated funds, bank credit lines, term and senior notes, the sale of trade receivables and credit terms from suppliers.



Index to Financial Statements

Cash flows generated by operations for 2008 were $570.0 million compared to $875.1 million for 2007. The
decrease in operating cash flows for 2008 as compared to 2007 is primarily attributable to lower earnings as a result of declining business conditions, the timing of receipts due to a calendar shift in the fourth quarter of 2007 as compared to 2006,
a change in customer mix and lower accounts payable and accruals due to lower volumes, partially offset by lower inventory levels.

Net
cash used in investing activities in 2008 was $226.1 million compared to $310.2 million for 2007. The decrease is due to lower acquisition investments during 2008 as compared to 2007 partially offset by higher capital spending. Capital expenditures,
including $226.3 million for acquisitions, have totaled $772.9 million over the past three years. Capital spending during 2009 for the Company, excluding acquisitions, is estimated to range from $120 million to $130 million, which will be used
primarily to purchase equipment and maintenance capital expenditures to improve efficiency and reduce costs.

Net cash used in financing
activities for 2008 was $342.9 million compared to $540.0 million in 2007. The primary reason for the change was lower repayment of certain indebtedness of approximately $333 million due to declining business conditions, and lower borrowings in 2008
as compared to repayments of approximately $534 million in 2007.

On October 28, 2005, the Company entered into a $1.5 billion
five-year, senior, unsecured, revolving credit and term loan facility (the “senior unsecured credit facilities”). The senior unsecured credit facilities replaced a then-existing credit facility and various uncommitted credit lines. The
senior unsecured credit facilities consist of (i) a multi-currency $750.0 million revolving credit facility, which matures on October 28, 2010, (ii) a $389.2 million term loan facility, which was repaid in 2006, and (iii) a Euro
300.0 million term loan facility, which was repaid in 2008. During the third quarter of 2008 the $750 million revolving credit facility was impacted by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (“Lehman”). On December 31,
2008, the Company reduced the $750 million revolving credit facility to $650 million by eliminating the credit commitment of Lehman under the defaulting lender provision of the senior unsecured credit facilities. The Company believes the remaining
banks in its revolving credit facility are stable and that the remaining availability is adequate to meet its liquidity requirements.

At
December 31, 2008, the amount used under the revolving credit facility of the senior unsecured credit facilities was $171.7 million leaving a total of approximately $478.3 million available under the revolving credit facility. The amount used
under the revolving credit facility is composed of $55.3 million borrowings, $55.6 million standby letters of credit guaranteeing the Company’s industrial revenue bonds and $60.8 million standby letters of credit related to various insurance
contracts and foreign vendor commitments.

On November 8, 2005, one of the Company’s subsidiaries entered into a Euro
130.0 million, five-year unsecured, revolving credit facility, maturing on November 8, 2010 (the “Euro revolving credit facility”). This agreement bears interest at EURIBOR plus an indexed amount based on the Company’s
senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating. The Company guaranteed the obligations of that subsidiary under the Euro revolving credit facility and any of the Company’s other subsidiaries that become borrowers under the Euro revolving credit
facility. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under this facility and a total of $183 million (USD equivalent) was available to its European operations under the Company’s €130 million Euro revolving
credit facility.

Borrowings outstanding under the senior unsecured credit facilities bears interest, at the Company’s option, at
(i) the greater of (x) prime rate or (y) the overnight federal funds rate plus 0.50%, or (ii) LIBOR plus an indexed amount based on the Company’s senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating.



Index to Financial Statements

The Company’s senior unsecured credit facilities and the Euro revolving credit facility both contain
debt to capital ratio requirements and other customary covenants. The Company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2008. Under both of these credit facilities, the Company must pay an annual facility fee ranging from 0.06% to
0.25% depending upon the Company’s senior, unsecured long-term debt rating.

The Company has an on-balance sheet trade accounts
receivable securitization agreement (“Securitization Facility”). At December 31, 2008, the Company had $47 million outstanding secured by trade receivables. The Securitization Facility allows the Company to borrow up to $250.0 million
based on available accounts receivable. On July 28, 2008, the Company amended and restated the Securitization Facility, reduced total availability from $350.0 million to $250.0 million due to its adequate liquidity position and extended the
term until July 27, 2009.

On January 17, 2006, the Company issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.750% notes due
2011 and $900.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% notes due 2016. Interest payable on each series of the notes is subject to adjustment if either Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, or
both, downgrades the rating they have assigned to the notes. Each rating agency downgrade results in a 0.25% increase in the interest rate, subject to a maximum increase of 1% per rating agency. If later the rating of these notes improves, then
the interest rates would be reduced accordingly. Each 0.25% increase in the interest rate of these notes would increase the Company’s interest expense by approximately $3.5 million per year. On November 7, 2008, Moody’s Investors
Service, Inc. announced that it placed the Company’s Baa3 long term rating on review for possible downgrade. On February 25, 2009, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. announced that it had downgraded its ratings on the Company’s
senior unsecured notes to Ba1 from Baa3 and was maintaining a negative rating outlook, following the completion of its rating review. This downgrade will increase the Company’s interest expense by approximately $3.5 million per year and could
adversely affect the cost of and ability to obtain additional credit in the future. Additional downgrades in the Company’s credit rating could further increase the cost of its existing credit and adversely affect the cost of and ability to
obtain additional credit in the future.

In 2002, the Company issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of its senior 7.2% notes due
2012.

The Company believes that cash generated from operations in 2009 and availability under its existing revolving credit facility will
be sufficient to meet its capital expenditures and working capital requirements in 2009.

The Company’s Board of Directors has
authorized the repurchase of up to 15 million shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock. Since the inception of the program in 1999, a total of approximately 11.5 million shares have been repurchased at an aggregate cost of
approximately $334.7 million. All of these repurchases have been financed through the Company’s operations and banking arrangements. The Company has not repurchased any of its shares since the third quarter of 2006.

On October 31, 2005, the Company entered into a Discounted Stock Purchase Agreement (the “DSPA”) with certain members of the Unilin
management team (the “Unilin Management”). Under the terms of the DSPA, the Company will be obligated to make cash payments to the Unilin Management in the event that certain performance goals are satisfied. In each of the years in the
five-year period ended December 31, 2010, the remaining members of Unilin Management can earn amounts, in the aggregate, equal to the average value of 30,671 shares of the Company’s common stock over the 20 trading day period ending on
December 31 of the prior year. Any failure in a given year to reach the performance goals may be rectified, and consequently the amounts payable with respect to achieving such criteria may be made, in any of the other years. The amount of the
liability is measured each period and recognized as compensation expense in the statement of operations. The Company did not recognize any expense under the DSPA for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008.

The outstanding checks in excess of cash represent trade payables checks that have not yet cleared the bank. When the checks clear the bank, they are
funded by the revolving credit facility. This policy does not impact any liquid assets on the consolidated balance sheets.



Index to Financial Statements

The following is a summary of the Company’s future minimum payments under contractual obligations as
of December 31, 2008 (in thousands):

(1)

For fixed rate debt, the Company calculated interest based on the applicable rates and payment dates. For variable rate debt, the Company estimated average outstanding balances for
the respective periods and applied interest rates in effect at December 31, 2008 to these balances.

(2)

Includes commitments for natural gas, electricity and raw material purchases.

(3)

Includes the estimated pension contributions for 2009 only, as the Company is unable to estimate the pension contributions beyond 2009. The Company’s projected benefit
obligation at December 31, 2008 was $20.1 million. These liabilities have not been presented in the table above due to uncertainty as to amounts and timing regarding future payments.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company has accrued income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $91.9 million, of which $51.9 million is
current. These liabilities have not been presented in the table above due to uncertainty as to amounts and timing regarding future payments.

Critical
Accounting Policies

In preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the U.S., the Company must make decisions which impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures. Such decisions include the selection of appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the
assumptions on which to base accounting estimates. In reaching such decisions, the Company applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances and historical experience. Actual amounts could differ from those
estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared.

The Company’s significant accounting policies are described
in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. Some of those significant accounting policies require the Company to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates. Critical accounting policies are defined as
those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect
of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.



Index to Financial Statements

The Company believes the following accounting policies require it to use judgments and estimates in
preparing its consolidated financial statements and represent critical accounting policies.

•

Accounts receivable and revenue recognition. Revenues are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred, the price has been
fixed or is determinable, and collectability can be reasonably assured. The Company provides allowances for expected cash discounts, returns, claims and doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debt and claims experience and periodic evaluation
of specific customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.

•

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (net realizable value). Cost has been determined using the first-in first-out method (“FIFO”). Costs
included in inventory include raw materials, direct and indirect labor and employee benefits, depreciation, general manufacturing overhead and various other costs of manufacturing. Market, with respect to all inventories, is replacement cost or net
realizable value. Inventories on hand are compared against anticipated future usage, which is a function of historical usage, anticipated future selling price, expected sales below cost, excessive quantities and an evaluation for obsolescence.
Actual results could differ from assumptions used to value obsolete inventory, excessive inventory or inventory expected to be sold below cost and additional reserves may be required.

•

Goodwill and other intangibles. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive
changes in circumstances. The Company considers the relationship between its market capitalization and its book value, among other factors, when reviewing for indicators of impairment. The goodwill impairment tests are based on determining the fair
value of the specified reporting units based on management judgments and assumptions using the discounted cash flows and comparable company market valuation approaches. The Company has identified Mohawk, Dal-Tile, Unilin Flooring, Unilin Chipboard
and Melamine, and Unilin Roofing as its reporting units for the purposes of allocating goodwill and intangibles as well as assessing impairments. The valuation approaches are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change such
as judgments and assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”), and comparable company market multiples. When developing these key judgments and assumptions, the Company
considers economic, operational and market conditions that could impact the fair value of the reporting unit. However, estimates are inherently uncertain and represent only management’s reasonable expectations regarding future developments.
These estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will, in all likelihood, differ in some respects from actual future results. Should a significant or prolonged deterioration in economic conditions occur, such as
continued declines in spending for new construction, remodeling and replacement activities; the inability to pass increases in the costs of raw materials and fuel on to customers; or a decline in comparable company market multiples, then key
judgments and assumptions could be impacted. Generally, a moderate decline in estimated operating income or a small increase in WACC or a decline in market capitalization could result in an additional indication of impairment.

The impairment test for intangible assets not subject to amortization involves a comparison of the estimated fair value
of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include
assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, royalty rates, WACC and the amount of expected future cash flows. These judgments and assumptions are subject to the variability discussed above. The impairment evaluation for indefinite lived
intangible assets, which for the Company are its trademarks, is conducted during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. The determination of fair value used
in the impairment evaluation is based on discounted estimates of future sales projections attributable to ownership of the trademarks. Significant



Index to Financial Statements

judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, royalty rates, WACC and the amount of expected future cash
flows. The judgments and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with past performance and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans. Such assumptions are
subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. The determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the
fair value of the trademarks. Estimated cash flows are sensitive to changes in the economy among other things.

The Company reviews
long-lived assets, including its intangible assets subject to amortization which, for the Company are its patents and customer relationships, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets
may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of long-lived assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by these assets. If such assets are
considered to be impaired, the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.

The Company conducted its annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles in the fourth quarter and no impairment was indicated. During the third and fourth quarters of 2008, the Company conducted interim impairment tests and
recorded impairment of goodwill and other intangibles of $1,418.9 million and $124.5 million, respectively.

•

The Company’s effective tax rate is based on its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which it
operates. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company’s tax expense and in evaluating the
Company’s tax positions. Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in a future period. The Company evaluates the recoverability of these future tax benefits by assessing the adequacy of
future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income inherently rely on estimates, including business
forecasts and other projections of financial results over an extended period of time. In the event that the Company does not expect to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance is provided. The Company
would recognize such amounts through a charge to income in the period in which that determination is made or when tax law changes are enacted.

In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the Company’s income tax positions. The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to
examination based upon the Company’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded
the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information, as required by the provisions of the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 48,

“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.”

For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not
that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements.

•

Environmental and legal accruals are estimates based on judgments made by the Company relating to ongoing environmental and legal proceedings, as disclosed in the
Company’s consolidated financial statements. In determining whether a liability is probable and reasonably estimable, the Company consults with its internal experts. The Company believes that the amounts recorded in the accompanying financial
statements are based on the best estimates and judgments available to it.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 157,

“Fair Value Measurements”

(“SFAS No. 157”). SFAS No. 157 defines
fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 requires companies to disclose the fair value of financial instruments according to a fair value
hierarchy. Additionally, companies are required to provide certain disclosures regarding instruments within the hierarchy, including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for each major category of assets and liabilities. SFAS
No. 157 is effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2008 for financial assets and liabilities and January 1, 2009 for non-financial assets and liabilities. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 for financial
assets and liabilities on January 1, 2008 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 157 for non-financial assets and liabilities to have a
material impact on its consolidated financial statements, but its adoption may impact future acquisitions and impairment assessments.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,

“Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Post Retirement Plans-an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)”

(“SFAS
No. 158”). The Company adopted all provisions of SFAS No. 158 as of December 31, 2006, except for the measurement date provisions, which are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. The adoption of the
measurement provisions of SFAS No. 158 on January 1, 2008 did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

“

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities-including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115”

(“SFAS
No. 159”). SFAS No. 159 expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards which require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value. The objective of SFAS No. 159 is to improve financial
reporting by providing companies with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. Under SFAS No. 159, a
company may elect to use fair value to measure eligible items at a specified election date and report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. Eligible items
include, but are not limited to, accounts and loans receivable, available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, equity method investments, accounts payable, guarantees, issued debt and firm commitments. The Company adopted SFAS No. 159
effective January 1, 2008, but did not elect to adjust any of the eligible assets or liabilities to fair value. Therefore, the adoption did not have any impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007),

“Business Combinations”

(“SFAS 141R”). SFAS 141R
establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. SFAS
141R also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS 141R is to be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after
January 1, 2009. Once adopted, SFAS 141R will impact the recognition and measurement of future business combinations and certain income tax benefits recognized from prior business combinations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

“Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an amendment of
Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51”

(“SFAS No. 160”). SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of
consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parent’s ownership interest, and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS
No. 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2008. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.



Index to Financial Statements

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,

“Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities”

(“SFAS No. 161”). SFAS No. 161 is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand
their effects on an entity’s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. The provisions of SFAS No. 161 are effective for the first quarter of 2009. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on
the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162,

“The Hierarchy of Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles”

(“SFAS No. 162”). SFAS No. 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements. SFAS
No. 162 is effective 60 days following the SEC’s approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411,

“The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles”

. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In October 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. 157-3

“Determining Fair Value of a Financial Asset in a Market That Is Not Active”

(“FSP 157-3”). FSP 157-3 clarifies the application
of SFAS No. 157 as it relates to the valuation of financial assets in a market that is not active for those financial assets. This FSP is effective immediately and includes those periods for which financial statements have not been issued. The
Company currently does not have any financial assets that are valued using inactive markets, and as such is not impacted by the issuance of FSP 157-3.

Impact of Inflation

Inflation affects the Company’s manufacturing costs, distribution costs and operating expenses.
The carpet, tile and laminate industry experienced significant inflation in the prices of raw materials and fuel-related costs beginning in the first quarter of 2004, and the prices increased dramatically during the latter part of 2008, peaking in
the late third and early fourth quarters. For the period from 1999 through the beginning of 2004 the carpet and tile industry experienced moderate inflation in the prices of raw materials and fuel-related costs. In the past, the Company has
generally been able to pass along these price increases to its customers and has been able to enhance productivity to help offset increases in costs resulting from inflation in its operations. However, the spike in these prices during 2008 was rapid
and relatively brief, which will likely limit the Company’s ability to fully recoup these added costs through price increases.

Seasonality

The Company is a calendar year-end company. With respect to its Mohawk and Dal-Tile segments, its results of operations for the first
quarter tend to be the weakest. The second, third and fourth quarters typically produce higher net sales and operating income in these segments. These results are primarily due to consumer residential spending patterns for floor covering, which
historically have decreased during the first two months of each year following the holiday season. The Unilin segment second and fourth quarters typically produce higher net sales and earnings followed by a moderate first quarter and a weaker third
quarter. The third quarter is traditionally the weakest due to the European holiday in late summer. In light of the current extraordinary economic climate, the Company believes that seasonality in 2009 may not be typical as compared to prior years
as more consumers delay purchases.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Financial exposures are managed as an integral part of the Company’s risk management program, which seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect
that the volatility of exchange rates and natural gas markets may have on its operating results. The Company does not regularly engage in speculative transactions, nor does it regularly hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.



Index to Financial Statements

Natural Gas Risk Management

The Company uses a combination of natural gas futures contracts and long-term supply agreements to manage unanticipated changes in natural gas prices. The contracts are based on forecasted usage of natural gas
measured in Million British Thermal Units (“MMBTU”).

The Company has designated the natural gas futures contracts as cash flow
hedges. The outstanding contracts are valued at market with the offset applied to other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes and any hedge ineffectiveness.

Any gain or loss is reclassified from other comprehensive income and recognized in cost of goods sold in the same period or periods during which the
hedged transaction affects earnings. At December 31, 2008, the Company had natural gas contracts that mature from January 2009 to December 2009 with an aggregate notional amount of approximately 2,650 thousand MMBTU’s. The fair value
of these contracts was a liability of $5.9 million at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2007, the Company had natural gas contracts that mature from January 2008 to March 2008 with an aggregate notional amount of approximately
310 thousand MMBTU’s. The fair value of these contracts was a liability of $0.3 million at December 31, 2007. The offset to these liabilities is recorded in other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes. The ineffective
portion of the derivative is recognized in the cost of goods sold within the consolidated statements of operations and was not significant for the periods reported. The amount that the Company anticipates will be reclassified out of accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) in the next twelve months is a loss of approximately $3.8 million, net of taxes.

The Company’s
natural gas long-term supply agreements are accounted for under the normal purchase provision within SFAS No. 133 and its amendments. At December 31, 2008, the Company had normal purchase commitments of approximately 2,026 thousand
MMBTU’s for periods maturing from January 2009 through December 2009. The contracted value of these commitments was approximately $17.2 million at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2007, the Company had normal purchase commitments of
approximately 303 thousand MMBTU’s for periods maturing from January 2008 through March 2008. The contracted value of these commitments was approximately $2.8 million at December 31, 2007.

Foreign Currency Rate Management

The Company enters
into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign denominated costs associated with its operations in Mexico. The objective of these transactions is to reduce volatility of exchange rates where these operations are located by fixing a portion
of their costs in U.S. currency. Accordingly, these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges. Gains and losses are reclassified from other comprehensive income and recognized in cost of goods sold in the same period or periods during which
the hedged transaction affects earnings. The Company had forward contracts to purchase approximately 269.1 million Mexican pesos at December 31, 2008. The aggregate U.S. dollar value of these contracts at December 31, 2008 was
approximately $23.9 million and the fair value of these contracts was a liability of approximately $5.2 million. The Company had forward contracts to purchase approximately 244.0 million Mexican pesos at December 31, 2007. The aggregate
U.S. dollar value of these contracts at December 31, 2007 was approximately $21.8 million and the fair value of these contracts was an asset of approximately $0.2 million.

Mohawk Industries, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Mohawk Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and
2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2008. These consolidated financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We did not audit the combined consolidated financial statements of Unilin Flooring BVBA
and Unilin Holding Inc. and their respective subsidiaries (Unilin Group), which financial statements reflect total revenues constituting approximately 16 percent of the consolidated total for the year ended December 31, 2006. Those financial
statements were audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for Unilin Group, is based solely on the report of the other auditors.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits and the report of the other
auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of the other auditors, the
consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Mohawk Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an
Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

, effective January 1, 2007.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Mohawk Industries, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Mohawk Industries, Inc.:

We have audited Mohawk Industries, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria
established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Mohawk Industries, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as set forth in Item 9A of Mohawk Industries, Inc.’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted
our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Mohawk Industries, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Mohawk Industries and subsidiaries as of December 31,
2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2008, and our report dated March 2, 2009
expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

(In thousands, except per share data)

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a) Basis of
Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Mohawk Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the
“Company” or “Mohawk”). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

(b) Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company
considers investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.

(c) Accounts Receivable and Revenue
Recognition

The Company is principally a carpet, rugs, ceramic tile and laminate manufacturer and sells carpet, rugs, ceramic tile,
natural stone, hardwood, resilient and laminate flooring products in the United States. In addition, the Company manufactures laminate and sells carpet, rugs and laminate flooring products in Europe principally for residential and commercial use.
The Company grants credit to customers, most of whom are retail-flooring dealers and commercial end users, under credit terms that the Company believes are customary in the industry.

The Company warrants certain qualitative attributes of its flooring products. The Company has recorded a provision for estimated warranty and related
costs, based on historical experience and periodically adjusts these provisions to reflect actual experience.

Revenues, which are recorded
net of taxes collected from customers, are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred, the price has been fixed or is determinable, and collectability can be reasonably assured. The Company provides
allowances for expected cash discounts, returns, claims and doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debt and claims experience and periodic evaluations of specific customer accounts. Licensing revenues received from third parties for patents are
recognized based on contractual agreements.

(d) Inventories

The Company accounts for all inventories on the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (net realizable value). Cost has been determined using the FIFO
method. Costs in inventory include raw materials, direct and indirect labor and employee benefits, depreciation, general manufacturing overhead and various other costs of manufacturing. Market, with respect to all inventories, is replacement cost or
net realizable value. Inventories on hand are compared against anticipated future usage, which is a function of historical usage, anticipated future selling price, expected sales below cost, excessive quantities and an evaluation for obsolescence.
Actual results could differ from assumptions used to value obsolete inventory, excessive inventory or inventory expected to be sold below cost and additional reserves may be required.



Index to Financial Statements

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

(e) Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, including capitalized interest. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated
remaining useful lives, which are 25-35 years for buildings and improvements, 5-15 years for machinery and equipment, the shorter of the estimated useful life or lease term for leasehold improvements and 3-7 years for furniture and fixtures.

(f) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

In accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,”

(“SFAS
No. 142”) the Company tests goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter (or on an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of the reporting
unit below its carrying value). The Company considers the relationship between its market capitalization and its book value, among other factors, when reviewing for indicators of impairment. The goodwill impairment tests are based on determining the
fair value of the specified reporting units based on management judgments and assumptions using the discounted cash flows and comparable company market valuation approaches. The Company has identified Mohawk, Dal-Tile, Unilin Flooring, Unilin
Chipboard and Melamine, and Unilin Roofing as its reporting units for the purposes of allocating goodwill and intangibles as well as assessing impairments. The valuation approaches are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to
change such as judgments and assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”), and comparable company market multiples.

When developing these key judgments and assumptions, the Company considers economic, operational and market conditions that could impact the fair value
of the reporting unit. However, estimates are inherently uncertain and represent only management’s reasonable expectations regarding future developments. These estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will,
in all likelihood, differ in some respects from actual future results. Should a significant or prolonged deterioration in economic conditions occur, such as continued declines in spending for new construction, remodeling and replacement activities;
the inability to pass increases in the costs of raw materials and fuel on to customers; or a decline in comparable company market multiples, then key judgments and assumptions could be impacted.

The impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets, which for the Company are its trademarks, is conducted during the fourth quarter of
each year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. The determination of fair value used in the impairment evaluation is based on discounted estimates of future sales projections attributable
to ownership of the trademarks. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, royalty rates, WACC and the amount of expected future cash flows. The judgments and assumptions used in the
estimate of fair value are generally consistent with past performance and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans. Such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and
competitive conditions. The determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the trademarks. Estimated cash flows are
sensitive to changes in the economy among other things. The impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the
intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The estimates of fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets are determined using a discounted cash flows valuation. Significant
judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, royalty rates, WACC and the amount of expected future cash flows. These judgments and assumptions are subject to the variability discussed above.



Index to Financial Statements

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives are amortized based on average lives, which range
from 7-16 years.

(g) Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

(h) Financial Instruments

The Company’s
financial instruments consist primarily of receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and long-term debt. The carrying amount of receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates its fair value because of the short-term maturity
of such instruments. The carrying amount of the Company’s floating rate debt approximates its fair value. Interest rates that are currently available to the Company for issuance of long-term debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are
used to estimate the fair value of the Company’s long-term debt. The estimated fair value of the Company’s long-term debt at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $1,628,786 and $2,314,445, compared to a carrying amount of $1,954,786 and
$2,281,834, respectively.

(i) Derivative Instruments

Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities requires the Company to recognize all derivatives on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not qualifying hedges must be
adjusted to fair value through earnings. If the derivative is a qualifying hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in their fair value are either offset against the change in fair value of assets, liabilities, or firm commitments
through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The Company engages in activities that expose it to market risks, including the effects of changes in interest rates, exchange rates and
natural gas commodity prices. Financial exposures are managed as an integral part of the Company’s risk management program, which seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect that the volatility of the interest rate, exchange rate and natural
gas commodity markets may have on operating results. The Company does not engage in speculative transactions, nor does it hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.

The Company formally documents hedging instruments and hedging items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking hedged items.
This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fair value and cash flow hedges to specific assets, liabilities or firm commitments on the consolidated balance sheet or to forecasted transactions. The Company also formally
assesses, both at inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of hedged items. Regression analysis is used to assess
effectiveness of the hedging relationship and the dollar offset method is used to measure any ineffectiveness associated with the hedges. When it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective, the derivative expires, or is sold,
terminated, or exercised, or the derivative is discontinued because it is unlikely that a forecasted transaction will occur, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively for that specific hedge instrument.



Index to Financial Statements

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

(j) Advertising Costs and Vendor Consideration

Advertising and promotion expenses are charged to earnings during the period in which they are incurred. Advertising and promotion expenses included in
selling, general, and administrative expenses were $53,643 in 2008, $56,168 in 2007 and $55,254 in 2006.

Vendor consideration, generally
cash, is classified as a reduction of net sales, unless specific criteria are met regarding goods or services that the vendor may receive in return for this consideration. The Company makes various payments to customers, including slotting fees,
advertising allowances, buy-downs and co-op advertising. All of these payments reduce gross sales with the exception of co-op advertising. Co-op advertising is classified as a selling, general and administrative expense in accordance with the FASB,
Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) 01-09,

“Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products).”

Co-op advertising expenses, a component of advertising and
promotion expenses, were $7,359 in 2008, $5,686 in 2007 and $13,352 in 2006.

(k) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company reviews long-lived assets, including its intangible assets subject to amortization which, for the Company, are its patents and customer
relationships, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of
long-lived assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by these assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value
of the assets. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs of disposal and are no longer depreciated.

(l) Foreign Currency Translation

The Company’s subsidiaries that operate outside the United States use their local
currency as the functional currency, with the exception of operations carried out in Canada and Mexico, in which case the functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Other than Canada and Mexico, the functional currency is translated into U.S. dollars
for balance sheet accounts using the month end rates in effect as of the balance sheet date and principally average exchange rate for revenue and expense accounts for each respective period. The translation adjustments are deferred as a separate
component of stockholders’ equity, within other comprehensive income. Gains or losses resulting from transactions denominated in foreign currencies are included in other income or expense, within the consolidated statements of operations. The
assets and liabilities of the Company’s Canada and Mexico operations are re-measured using a month end rate, except for non-monetary assets and liabilities, which are re-measured using the historical exchange rate. Income and expense accounts
are re-measured using principally an average monthly rate for the period, except for expenses related to those balance sheet accounts that are re-measured using historical exchange rates. The resulting re-measurement adjustment is reported in the
consolidated statements of operations when incurred.

(m) Earnings (loss) per share (“EPS”)

Basic (loss) earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated using net earnings available to common stockholders divided by the weighted-average number
of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is similar to basic EPS except that the weighted-average number of shares is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the
potentially dilutive common shares had been issued.



Index to Financial Statements

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Dilutive common stock options are included in the diluted EPS calculation using the treasury stock
method. Common stock options that were not included in the diluted EPS computation because the options’ exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common shares for the periods presented were 1,560, 775 and 1,271 for 2008,
2007 and 2006, respectively. For 2008 all outstanding common stock options to purchase common shares and unvested restricted shares (units) were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share because their effect on net loss per common
share was anti-dilutive.

Computations of basic and diluted (loss) earnings per share are presented in the following table:

(n) Stock-Based Compensation

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123(R),

“Share-Based Payment”

(“SFAS No. 123(R)”), using the
modified-prospective-transition method. Under that transition method, compensation cost for 2006 includes: (a) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of, January 1, 2006, based on the grant
date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123,

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”

, and (b) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted subsequent to January 1,
2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated lives for awards with ratable vesting provisions.

(o) Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income includes foreign currency translation of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, effects of exchange rate changes on intercompany balances of a long-term nature and transactions and derivative financial
instruments designated as cash flow hedges. The Company does not provide income taxes on currency translation adjustments, as earnings from foreign subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely reinvested.

Amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity for the years ended
December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 are as follows:

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

(p) Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

“Fair Value Measurements”

(“SFAS No. 157”). SFAS No. 157
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 requires companies to disclose the fair value of financial instruments according to a fair value
hierarchy. Additionally, companies are required to provide certain disclosures regarding instruments within the hierarchy, including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for each major category of assets and liabilities. SFAS
No. 157 is effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2008 for financial assets and liabilities and January 1, 2009 for non-financial assets and liabilities. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 for financial
assets and liabilities on January 1, 2008 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 157 for non-financial assets and liabilities to have a
material impact on its consolidated financial statements, but its adoption may impact future acquisitions and impairment assessments.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,

“Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Post Retirement Plans-an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)”

(“SFAS
No. 158”). The Company adopted all provisions of SFAS No. 158 as of December 31, 2006, except for the measurement date provisions, which are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. The adoption of the
measurement provisions of SFAS No. 158 on January 1, 2008 did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities-including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115”

(“SFAS
No. 159”). SFAS No. 159 expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards which require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value. The objective of SFAS No. 159 is to improve financial
reporting by providing companies with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. Under SFAS No. 159, a
company may elect to use fair value to measure eligible items at a specified election date and report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. Eligible items
include, but are not limited to, accounts and loans receivable, available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, equity method investments, accounts payable, guarantees, issued debt and firm commitments. The Company adopted SFAS No. 159
effective January 1, 2008, but did not elect to adjust any of the eligible assets or liabilities to fair value. Therefore, the adoption did not have any impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007),

“Business Combinations”

(“SFAS 141R”). SFAS 141R
establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. SFAS
141R also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS 141R is to be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after
January 1, 2009. Once adopted, SFAS 141R will impact the recognition and measurement of future business combinations and certain income tax benefits recognized from prior business combinations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

“Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an amendment of
Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51”

(“SFAS No. 160”). SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of
consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parent’s ownership interest, and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS No. 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the
parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,

“Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities”

(“SFAS No. 161”). SFAS No. 161 is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their
effects on an entity’s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. The provisions of SFAS No. 161 are effective for the first quarter of 2009. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162,

“The Hierarchy of Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles”

(“SFAS No. 162”). SFAS No. 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements. SFAS
No. 162 is effective 60 days following the SEC’s approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411,

“The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles”

. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In October 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. 157-3

“Determining Fair Value of a Financial Asset in a Market That Is Not Active”

(“FSP 157-3”). FSP 157-3 clarifies the application
of SFAS No. 157 as it relates to the valuation of financial assets in a market that is not active for those financial assets. This FSP is effective immediately and includes those periods for which financial statements have not been issued. The
Company currently does not have any financial assets that are valued using inactive markets, and as such is not impacted by the issuance of this FSP.

(q) Fiscal Year

The Company ends its fiscal year on December 31. Each of the first three quarters in the fiscal year
ends on the Saturday nearest the calendar quarter end.

(2) Acquisitions

During 2006, the Company acquired certain assets of a carpet backing manufacturer for approximately $73,000 which was paid for in cash.

During 2007, the Company acquired certain wood flooring assets and liabilities of Columbia Forest Products, Inc. (“Columbia”) for approximately
$147,153. The acquisition included the assets of two pre-finished solid plants and one engineered wood plant in the United States and an engineered wood plant in Malaysia. In connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded $13,069 in goodwill.
The results of operations from the date of acquisition are included in the Company’s consolidated results. Net sales were approximately $65,000 and operating income was not significant to the consolidated results for the year ending
December 31, 2007.

During 2008, the Company acquired certain stone center assets in the Dal-Tile segment for $8,276.

(5) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The Company considers the relationship between its market capitalization and its book value, among other factors, when reviewing for indicators of
impairment. The Company believes that the weakness in the U.S. residential housing market and the slowing European economy are principal factors in the prolonged decline in its market capitalization as compared to its book value. During the third
quarter and again in the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company concluded that the weakness in the U.S. residential housing market is likely to persist based on its review of, among other things, sequential quarterly housing starts, recent turmoil
surrounding the nation’s largest mortgage lenders, the potential negative impact on the availability of mortgage financing and housing start forecasts published by national home builder associations pushing recovery in the U.S. residential
housing market beyond 2009.

As a result of these impairment indicators, in the third quarter the Company performed an interim first step
of its goodwill impairment test and determined that the carrying values of certain reporting units exceeded their fair values, indicating that goodwill was impaired. During the third quarter of 2008, the Company estimated that



Index to Financial Statements

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

the implied fair value of its goodwill was less than its carrying value by approximately $1,262,255, which the Company recognized in the third quarter of
2008. The $1,262,255 impairment of goodwill was an estimate based on the results of the determination of and preliminary allocation of fair value. The Company finalized the allocation of fair value in the fourth quarter of 2008 and recorded an
additional $65,170, which the Company has recognized as an impairment of goodwill and other intangibles in the accompanying consolidated results of operations. The Company conducted its annual assessment and an additional interim test in the fourth
quarter of 2008 and determined the fair values of its reporting units exceeded their carrying values. As a result no impairment was indicated.

As a result of the impairment indicators described above, during the third quarter, and again in the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company evaluated its intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment. The Company compared the
estimated fair value of its trademarks to its carrying value and determined that there was a trademark impairment of approximately $54,455 in the Mohawk segment and a trademark impairment of approximately $102,202 in the Unilin segment, which the
Company recognized as a preliminary impairment of intangibles in the third quarter of 2008. In the fourth quarter, the Company finalized its analysis and no adjustment to the preliminary impairment of intangibles was necessary. The Company conducted
its annual assessment and determined the fair values of its trademarks exceeded their carrying values. As a result, no additional impairment was indicated.

In the fourth quarter the Company conducted an additional interim test and compared the estimated fair value of its trademarks to its carrying value and, as a result, recognized an impairment of intangibles in the
fourth quarter of 2008 of approximately $23,220 in the Mohawk segment and approximately $36,095 in the Unilin segment.

The following table
summarizes the components of intangible assets:

Goodwill:

During 2008, the Company recorded additional goodwill of $1,742 in the Dal-Tile segment for the
acquisition of certain stone center assets. In addition, during 2008 the Company reversed $842 and $40,691 of pre-acquisition tax liabilities in the Dal-Tile and Unilin segments, respectively. During 2007, the Company recorded additional goodwill of
$13,069 in the Unilin segment for the acquisition of certain wood flooring assets and liabilities of Columbia Forest Products, Inc. Additionally in 2007, changes in the Unilin reporting segment relate to adjustments to the opening balance sheet
including the reversal of pre-acquisition tax liabilities of $32,448. During 2007, changes in the Dal-Tile segment relate to adjustments to the opening balance sheet including the adjustment of pre-acquisition liabilities of $3,223.

(6) Property, Plant and Equipment

Following is a summary of property, plant and equipment:

Property, plant and equipment included capitalized interest of $6,419, $4,446 and $7,477 in 2008,
2007 and 2006, respectively. Depreciation expense was $212,281, $207,613 and $189,388 for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Included in the property, plant and equipment are capital leases with a cost of $36,208 and $33,220 and accumulated
depreciation of $5,248 and $3,402 at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

As a result of the impairment indicators described
above in Note 5, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, during the third quarter, and again in the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company tested its long-lived assets for impairment by comparing the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected
to be generated by these assets to their carrying value and determined that there was no impairment.

(7) Long-Term Debt

On October 28, 2005, the Company entered into a $1,500,000 five-year, senior, unsecured, revolving credit and term loan facility (the “senior
unsecured credit facilities”). The senior unsecured credit facilities replaced a then-existing credit facility and various uncommitted credit lines. The senior unsecured credit facilities consist of (i) a multi-currency $750,000 revolving
credit facility, which matures on October 28, 2010, (ii) a $389,200 term loan facility, which was repaid in 2006, and (iii) a Euro 300,000 term loan facility, which we repaid in 2008. During the third quarter of 2008, the $750,000
revolving credit facility was impacted by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc (“Lehman”). On December 31, 2008, the Company reduced the $750,000 revolving credit facility to $650,000 by eliminating the credit commitment of
Lehman under the defaulting lender provision of the senior unsecured credit facilities.

At December 31, 2008, the amount used under
the revolving credit facility of the senior unsecured credit facilities was $171,683 leaving a total of approximately $478,317 available under the revolving credit facility. The amount used under the revolving credit facility is composed of $55,300
borrowings, $55,599 standby letters of credit guaranteeing the Company’s industrial revenue bonds and $60,784 standby letters of credit related to various insurance contracts and foreign vendor commitments. The balance of the $389,200 term loan
facility under the senior unsecured credit facilities was repaid in 2006 and the balance of the Euro 300,000 term loan facility was repaid in 2008. At December 31, 2008, nothing was outstanding under the Euro revolving credit facility.

On November 8, 2005, one of the Company’s subsidiaries entered into a Euro 130,000 five-year unsecured, revolving credit
facility, maturing on November 8, 2010 (the “Euro revolving credit facility”). This agreement bears interest at EURIBOR plus an indexed amount based on the Company’s senior, unsecured, long-term debt

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

rating. The Company guaranteed the obligations of that subsidiary under the Euro revolving credit facility and of any of the Company’s other
subsidiaries that become borrowers under the Euro revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under this facility and a total of $182,970 was available under the Company’s Euro 130,000
revolving credit facility.

Borrowings outstanding under the senior unsecured credit facilities bear interest, at the Company’s
option, at (i) the greater of (x) prime rate or (y) the overnight federal funds rate plus 0.50%, or (ii) LIBOR plus an indexed amount based on the Company’s senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating.

The Company’s senior unsecured credit facilities and the Euro revolving credit facility both contain debt to capital ratio requirements and other
customary covenants. Under both of these credit facilities, the Company must pay an annual facility fee ranging from 0.06% to 0.25% depending upon the Company’s senior, unsecured long-term debt rating.

The Company has an on-balance sheet trade accounts receivable securitization agreement (“Securitization Facility”). The Securitization Facility
allows the Company to borrow up to $250,000 based on available accounts receivable. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $47,000 outstanding secured by trade receivables. On July 28, 2008, the Company amended and restated the
Securitization Facility, reduced total availability from $350,000 to $250,000, and extended the term until July 27, 2009.

On
January 17, 2006, the Company issued $500,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.75% notes due 2011 and $900,000 aggregate principal amount of 6.125% notes due 2016. Interest payable on each series of the notes is subject to adjustment if either
Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, or both, downgrades the rating they have assigned to the notes. Each rating agency downgrade results in a 0.25% increase in the interest rate, subject to a
maximum increase of 1% per rating agency. If later the rating of these notes improves, then the interest rates would be reduced accordingly. Each 0.25% increase in the interest rate of these notes would increase the Company’s interest
expense by approximately $3,500 per year. On November 7, 2008, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. announced that it placed the Company’s Baa3 long term rating on review for possible downgrade. On February 25, 2009, Moody’s
Investors Service, Inc. announced that it had downgraded its ratings on the Company’s senior unsecured notes to Ba1 from Baa3 and was maintaining a negative rating outlook, following the completion of its rating review. This downgrade will
increase the Company’s interest expense by approximately $3,500 per year and could adversely affect the cost of and ability to obtain additional credit in the future.

In 2002, the Company issued $400,000 aggregate principal amount of its senior 7.2% notes due 2012.

Long-term debt consists of the following:

The aggregate maturities of long-term debt as of December 31, 2008 are as follows:

(8) Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Deferred Tax Liability

Accounts payable and accrued expenses are as follows:

(9) Derivative Financial Instruments

Natural Gas Risk Management

The Company uses a combination of natural gas futures contracts and
long-term supply agreements to manage unanticipated changes in natural gas prices. The contracts are based on forecasted usage of natural gas measured in Million British Thermal Units (“MMBTU”).

The Company has designated the natural gas futures contracts as cash flow hedges. The outstanding contracts are valued at market with the offset applied
to other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes and any hedge ineffectiveness.

Any gain or loss is reclassified from other
comprehensive income and recognized in cost of goods sold in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. At December 31, 2008, the Company had natural gas contracts that mature from January 2009 to December
2009 with an aggregate notional amount of approximately 2,650 MMBTU’s. The fair value of these contracts was a liability of $5,913 at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2007, the Company had natural gas contracts that mature from
January 2008 to March 2008 with an aggregate notional amount of approximately 310 MMBTU’s. The fair value of these contracts was a liability of $279 at December 31, 2007. The offset to these liabilities is recorded in other comprehensive
income, net of applicable income taxes. The ineffective portion of the derivative is recognized in the cost of goods sold within the consolidated statements of operations and was not significant for the periods reported. The amount that the Company
anticipates that will be reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the next twelve months is a loss of approximately $3,755, net of taxes.



Index to Financial Statements

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

The Company’s natural gas long-term supply agreements are accounted for under the normal
purchase provision within SFAS No. 133 and its amendments. At December 31, 2008, the Company had normal purchase commitments of approximately 2,026 MMBTU’s for periods maturing from January 2009 through December 2009. The contracted
value of these commitments was approximately $17,151 at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2007, the Company had normal purchase commitments of approximately 303 MMBTU’s for periods maturing from January 2008 through March 2008. The
contracted value of these commitments was approximately $2,842 at December 31, 2007.

Foreign Currency Rate Management

The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign denominated costs associated with its operations in Mexico. The objective of
these transactions is to reduce volatility of exchange rates where these operations are located by fixing a portion of their costs in U.S. currency. Accordingly, these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges. Gains and losses are
reclassified from other comprehensive income and recognized in cost of goods sold in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The Company had forward contracts to purchase approximately 269,129 Mexican pesos
at December 31, 2008. The fair value of these contracts was a liability of $5,237 at December 31, 2008. The aggregate U.S. dollar value of these contracts at December 31, 2008 was approximately $23,923. The offset to these liabilities
is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable income taxes. The ineffective portion of the derivative is recognized in the cost of goods sold within the consolidated statements of operations and was not significant for the
periods reported. The amount that the Company anticipates that will be reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income in the next twelve months is a loss of approximately $3,326, net of taxes. The Company had forward contracts to
purchase approximately 244,009 Mexican pesos at December 31, 2007. The fair value of these contracts was an asset of $153 at December 31, 2007. The aggregate U.S. dollar value of these contracts at December 31, 2007 was approximately
$21,844. The offset to these assets is recorded in other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes. The ineffective portion of the derivative is recognized in the cost of goods sold within the consolidated statements of operations and was
not significant for the periods reported.

(10) Product warranties

The Company warrants certain qualitative attributes of its products for up to 33 years. The Company records a provision for estimated warranty and related costs in accrued expenses, based on historical experience and
periodically adjusts these provisions to reflect actual experience. Product warranties are as follows:

(1)

The increase in warranty expense in 2008 principally relates to increased claims on new product launches in the Mohawk segment.

(2)

Includes $2,859 in 2007 related to the Columbia acquisition. This amount was not charged to expense.

(11) Stock Options, Stock Compensation and Treasury Stock

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) using the
modified-prospective-transition method. Under that transition method, compensation cost includes: (a) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested at January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair
value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123 and (b) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with
the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R).

Under the Company’s 2007 Incentive Plan (“2007 Plan”), which was approved by the
Company’s stockholders on May 16, 2007, the Company reserved up to a maximum of 3,200 shares of common stock for issuance upon the grant or exercise of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSU’s”) and
other types of awards, to directors and key employees through 2017. Option awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant and generally vest between three and
five years with a 10-year contractual term. Restricted stock and RSU’s are generally granted with a price equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant and generally vest between three and five years.

Additional information relating to the Company’s stock option plans follows:

During 1996, the Company adopted the 1997 Non-Employee Director Stock Compensation Plan. The plan
provides for awards of common stock of the Company for non-employee directors to receive in lieu of cash for their annual retainers. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, a total of 1, 1 and 1 shares, respectively, were awarded to the non-employee directors
under the plan.

In addition, the Company maintains an employee incentive program that awards restricted stock on the attainment of certain
service criteria. The outstanding awards related to these programs and related compensation expense was not significant for any of the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

The Company’s Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 15,000 shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock. For the year
ended December 31, 2008, no shares of the Company’s common stock



Index to Financial Statements

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

were purchased. Since the inception of the program, a total of approximately 11,512 shares have been repurchased at an aggregate cost of approximately
$334,747. All of these repurchases have been financed through the Company’s operations and banking arrangements.

On October 31,
2005, the Company entered into a Discounted Stock Purchase Agreement (the “DSPA”) with certain members of the Unilin management team (the “Unilin Management”). Under the terms of the DSPA, the Company is obligated to make cash
payments to the Unilin Management in the event that certain performance goals are satisfied. In each of the years in the five-year period ended December 31, 2010, the remaining members of the Unilin Management can earn amounts, in the
aggregate, equal to the average value of 30,671 shares of the Company’s common stock over the 20 trading day period ending on December 31 of the prior year. Any failure in a given year to reach the performance goals may be rectified, and
consequently the amounts payable with respect to achieving such criteria may be made, in any of the other years. The amount of the liability is measured each period and recognized as compensation expense in the statement of operations. The Company
expensed approximately $0, $2,300 and $2,300 under the DSPA for each of the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The fair value of option awards is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the
Company’s common stock and other factors. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and forfeiture rates within the valuation model. Optionees that exhibit similar option exercise behavior are segregated into separate groups
within the valuation model. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of the grant for the
expected term of the award.

A summary of the Company’s options under the 2007 Plan at December 31, 2008, and changes
during the period then ended is presented as follows:

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of an option granted during 2008, 2007 and 2006, was
$20.26, $33.68 and $33.80, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $1,169, $22,943 and $14,032, respectively. Total compensation expense

recognized for the periods ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $6,646 ($4,210, net of tax), $8,827 ($6,359, net of tax) and $11,925 ($7,537, net
of tax), respectively, which was allocated to selling, general and administrative expenses. The remaining unamortized expense for non-vested compensation expense at December 31, 2008, was $7,320 with a weighted average remaining life of 2.1
years.

The following table summarizes information about the Company’s stock options outstanding at December 31, 2008:

A summary of the Company’s RSUs under the 2007 Plan at December 31, 2008, and changes
during the period then ended is presented as follows:

The Company recognized stock based compensation costs related to the issuance of RSU’s of
$4,977 ($3,153) net of taxes) and $4,446 ($3,203 net of taxes) for the periods ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, which has been allocated to selling, general and administrative expenses. Pre-tax unrecognized compensation expense
for unvested RSU’s granted to employees, net of estimated forfeitures, was $7,457 at December 31, 2008, and will be recognized as expense over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.4 years.

(12) Employee Benefit Plans

The Company has a 401(k)
retirement savings plan (the “Mohawk Plan”) open to substantially all of its employees within the Mohawk segment, Dal-Tile segments and at January 1, 2007, certain U.S. employees of the Unilin segment, who have completed 90 days of
eligible service. For the Mohawk segment, the Company contributes $0.50 for every $1.00 of employee contributions up to a maximum of 4% of the employee’s salary

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

and an additional $0.25 for every $1.00 of employee contributions in excess of 4% of the employee’s salary up to a maximum of 6%. For the Dal-Tile and
Unilin segments, the Company contributes $.50 for every $1.00 of employee contributions up to a maximum of 6% of the employee’s salary. Employee and employer contributions to the Mohawk Plan were $40,393 and $16,024 in 2008, $43,187 and $16,946
in 2007, and $40,369 and $15,713 in 2006, respectively. The Company also made a discretionary contribution to the Mohawk Plan of approximately $4,211, $5,500 and $5,900 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The Company also has various pension plans covering employees in Belgium, France, and The Netherlands (the “Non-U.S. Plans”) that it acquired
with the acquisition of Unilin. Benefits under the Non-U.S. Plans depend on compensation and years of service. The Non-U.S. Plans are funded in accordance with local regulations. The Company uses December 31 as the measurement date for its
Non-U.S. Plans.

Components of the net periodic benefit cost of the Company’s Non-U.S. pension benefit plans are as follows:

The discount rate assumptions used to account for pension obligations reflect the rates at which the
Company believes these obligations will be effectively settled. In developing the discount rate, the Company evaluated input from its actuaries, including estimated timing of obligation payments and yield on investments. The rate of compensation
increase for the Non-U.S. Plans is based upon the Company’s annual reviews.

Estimated future benefit payments for the Non-U.S. Plans are $644 in 2009, $1,066 in 2010, $863 in
2011, $1,093 in 2012, $1,436 in 2013 and $9,402 in total for 2014-2018.

The Company expects to make cash contributions of $1,884 to its
Non-U.S. Plans in 2009.

The percentage of each asset category of the total assets held by the plans follows:

The Company’s approach to developing its expected long-term rate of return on pension plan
assets combines an analysis of historical investment performance by asset class, the Company’s investment guidelines and current and expected economic fundamentals.

On December 31, 2006, the Company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS 158. SFAS 158 required the Company to recognize the funded status (i.e., the difference between the fair value of plan
assets and the projected benefit obligations) of its benefit plans in the December 31, 2006 Consolidated Balance Sheet, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. The Company recorded a decrease to
its pension liability of $818 and an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income of $818 which represents the net unrecognized prior service costs.

SFAS 142 and EITF Issue No. 02-13 require companies to test goodwill and indefinite-lived
assets for impairment annually, or more often if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred. As stated, the Company recorded a non-cash pretax impairment charge of $1,543,397 to reduce the carrying value of
goodwill and other intangibles. The tax effect of the non-deductible portion of the goodwill impairment was $406,577.

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax
assets and deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2008 and 2007 are presented below:

(1)

This amount includes $28 and $260,644 of non-current deferred tax assets which are in other assets and $3,030 and $11,890 current deferred tax liabilities which are included in
accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet as of 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Management
believes it is more likely than not the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, with the exception of certain deferred tax assets discussed below, based upon the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities and the level
of historical and projected taxable income over periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible.

The Company evaluates its ability
to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing its forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results, the reversal of existing temporary differences, taxable income in prior
carry-back years (if permitted) and the availability of tax planning strategies. The valuation allowance as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 is $343,572 and $75,028, respectively. The December 31, 2008 valuation allowance
relates to net operating losses and tax credits of $127,525 and deferred tax assets related to intangibles of $216,047. The December 31, 2007 valuation allowance related entirely to net operating losses and tax credits. For 2008, the total
change in the valuation allowance was an increase of $268,544, which includes a change of $(8,257) primarily related to foreign currency translation. The increase was the result of the valuation allowance of $252,751, which is described below, that
the Company recorded against its deferred tax assets during the quarter ended September 27, 2008, $18,989 for certain current year foreign net operating losses, and $5,061 of state net operating losses and tax credits.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company has state net operating loss carryforwards and state tax credits with potential tax benefits of $45,698, net of
federal income tax benefit; these carryforwards expire over various periods based on jurisdiction. A valuation allowance totaling $29,203 has been recorded against these deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2008. In addition, as of
December 31, 2008, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards in various foreign jurisdictions of $112,987. A valuation allowance totaling $98,322 has been recorded against these deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2008.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company moved the intellectual property and treasury operations of
an indirectly owned European entity to a new office in another jurisdiction in Europe. The Company also indirectly owned a holding company in the new jurisdiction that provided certain treasury functions to Unilin, and the move allowed for the
consolidation of the historical intellectual property and treasury operations to be combined with those of the holding company’s treasury operations in a single jurisdiction in order to integrate and streamline the operations, to facilitate
international acquisitions and to improve tax and cost efficiencies. This restructuring resulted in a step up in the subsidiary’s taxable basis of its intellectual property. The step up relates primarily to intangible assets which will be
amortized over 10 years for tax purposes. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company evaluated the evidence for recognition of the deferred tax asset created through the restructuring and determined that, based on the available evidence, the
deferred tax asset would more likely than not be realized. The deferred tax asset recognized at December 31, 2007 was approximately $245,000 and the related income tax benefit recognized in the financial statements was approximately $272,000.

During the third quarter of 2008, the Company reassessed the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. Actual cash
flows have been less than those projected as of December 31, 2007, primarily due to the slowing worldwide economy and declining sales volume. The Company determined that, given the current and expected economic conditions and the corresponding
reductions in cash flows, its ability to realize the benefit of the deferred tax asset related to the European restructuring transaction described above, as well as tax losses generated in the same jurisdiction was not more likely than not.
Accordingly during the third quarter of 2008, the Company recorded a $252,751 valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset created as a result of the European restructuring.

The Company does not provide for U.S. federal and state income taxes on the cumulative undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries because such
earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had not provided federal income taxes on earnings of approximately $654,000 and $630,000, respectively, from its foreign subsidiaries. Should
these earnings be distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to both U.S. income taxes and withholding taxes in various international jurisdictions. These taxes would be partially offset by U.S. foreign tax
credits. Determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred U.S. tax liability is not practical because of the complexities associated with this hypothetical calculation.

Tax Uncertainties

The Company
adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48,

“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes-an Interpretation of FASB Statement No 109,”

(“FIN 48”) on January 1, 2007. Upon adoption, the Company recognized
no change to opening retained earnings.

In the normal course of business, the Company’s tax returns are subject to examination by
various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities. Accordingly, the Company has accrued a liability when it believes that it is not more likely than not that it will realize
the benefits of tax positions that it has taken in its tax returns or for the amount of any tax benefit that exceeds the cumulative probability threshold in accordance with FIN 48. Differences between the estimated and actual amounts determined upon
ultimate resolution, individually or in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position but could possibly be material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations
or cash flow in any given quarter or annual period. The Company reversed pre-acquisition tax liabilities of $41,533 with a corresponding reduction to goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2008.

The Company’s total balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, is $91,887 and $116,857, respectively, excluding any
accruals for interest and penalties.

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Included in the balance as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, is $39,588 and $29,373,
respectively, of uncertain tax positions that, if recognized, would affect the Company’s overall effective tax rate.

The Company
recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of its income tax provision. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company has $39,641 and $43,540, respectively, accrued for the payment of interest
and penalties, which does not include the federal tax benefit of interest deductions, where applicable. During the period ending December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company accrued interest and penalties through income tax expense of $3,657 and
$1,115, respectively.

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state, local and foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2003. The Company is protesting through the IRS Appeals division the
timing and deductibility of certain contingent liabilities related to the audit of its 1999 – 2003 tax years. In connection with its protest, the Company paid a $35,844 cash bond to the IRS. Within the next twelve months, it is reasonably
possible that an additional payment of approximately $5,000 will be made. In addition, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by $31,211 (which includes accrued penalties and
interest expense) within the next twelve months for individual matters of lesser amounts due to settlements or statutory expirations in various tax jurisdictions.

The Company is also under examination for tax years 2004-2006 with the IRS and in various state and foreign jurisdictions for which the anticipated adjustments would not result in a significant change to the total
amount of unrecognized tax benefits.

(14) Commitments and Contingencies and Other

The Company is obligated under various operating leases for office and manufacturing space, machinery, and equipment. Future minimum lease payments under
non-cancelable capital and operating leases (with initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year) at December 31:

Rental expense under operating leases was $139,103, $123,095 and $118,280 in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.

The Company had approximately $73,928 and $62,402 at December 31, 2008 and 2007 in standby letters of credit for
various insurance contracts and commitments to foreign vendors that expire within two years. In addition, at December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company guaranteed approximately $85,640 and $89,546 for VAT and building leases, respectively, related
to its operating facilities in France.

The Company is involved in litigation from time to time in the regular course of its business.
Except as noted below there are no material legal proceedings pending or known by the Company to be contemplated to which the Company is a party or to which any of its property is subject.

In Shirley Williams et al. v. Mohawk Industries, Inc., four plaintiffs filed a putative class action lawsuit in January 2004 in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia (Rome Division), alleging that they are former and current employees of the Company and that the actions and conduct of the Company, including the employment of persons who are not authorized to
work in the United States, have damaged them and the other members of the putative class by suppressing the wages of the Company’s hourly employees in Georgia. The plaintiffs seek a variety of relief, including (a) treble damages;
(b) return of any allegedly unlawful profits; and (c) attorney’s fees and costs of litigation. In February 2004, the Company filed a Motion to Dismiss the Complaint, which was denied by the District Court in April 2004. Following
appellate review of this decision, the case was returned to the District Court for further proceedings. On December 18, 2007, the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification. On March 3, 2008, the District Court denied the plaintiffs
motion for class certification. The plaintiffs then appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit on March 17, 2008, where the matter is currently pending. Discovery has been stayed at the District Court while
the appeal is pending. The Company will continue to vigorously defend itself against this action.

In Collins & Aikman
Floorcoverings, Inc., et. al. v. Interface, Inc., United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia (Rome Division), Mohawk Industries, Inc. joined Collins & Aikman Floorcoverings, Inc. (“CAF”) and Shaw Industries
Group, Inc. (“Shaw”) in suing Interface, Inc. (“Interface”) for

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

declaratory judgments that United States Patent 6,908,656 (the “Patent”), assigned to Interface and relating to certain styles of carpet tiles, is
not infringed and is invalid. Also in June 2005, in Interface, Inc., et el. v. Mohawk Industries, Inc., et al. United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia (Atlanta Division), Interface sued Mohawk Industries, Inc., Mohawk
Carpet Corporation, and Mohawk Commercial, Inc. for allegedly infringing the Patent. Interface brought similar suits against entities affiliated with CAF and Shaw. Interface is seeking monetary damages as well as injunctive relief. The cases have
been consolidated in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia (Rome Division). In January 2008, the Company joined CAF and Shaw in filing summary judgement motions seeking to establish as a matter of law before trial
that the Patent was invalid, that it was not willfully infringed, and that Interface could not obtain damages for lost profits. On February 25, 2009, the District Court (i) denied the Company, CAF’s and Shaw’s motions that the
patent was invalid (ii) granted their motions that should infringement be found that any such infringement would not be willful, and (iii) granted in part and denied in part their motions that Interface could not obtain damages for lost
profits. The Company is vigorously pursuing its declaratory judgment claims of invalidity and non-infringement with respect to the Patent and defending against the claims brought by Interface for infringement of the Patent. A trial date is
anticipated to be set for later in 2009.

The Company believes that adequate provisions for resolution of all contingencies, claims and
pending litigation have been made for probable losses and that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition but could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations in a given
quarter or annual period.

The Company has received partial refunds from the United States government in reference to settling custom
disputes dating back to 1982. Accordingly, the Company recorded a net gain of $9,154 ($5,799 net of taxes) in other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2007. No refunds were received in 2008. Additional future recoveries will be
recorded as realized.

The Company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and
regulations, including those governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use, storage, treatment and disposal of solid and hazardous materials, and the cleanup of contamination associated therewith. Because of the nature of the
Company’s business, the Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs relating to compliance with such laws and regulations. The Company is involved in various proceedings relating to environmental matters and is currently engaged in
environmental investigation, remediation and post-closure care programs at certain sites. The Company has provided accruals for such activities that it has determined to be both probable and reasonably estimable. The Company does not expect that the
ultimate liability with respect to such activities will have a material adverse effect on its operations, but may have an effect on a given quarter or annual period.

In the normal course of business, the Company has entered into various European collective bargaining agreements with its workforce, either locally or within its industry sector. Historically, the Company and its
industry have maintained favorable relationships with its workforce and expect to do so in the future.

During the fourth quarter of 2008,
the Company recorded pre-tax business restructuring charges of $29,670, which included $22,239 in the Mohawk segment, $5,343 in the Dal-Tile segment and $2,088 in the Unilin segment. The charge included $13,065 for lease impairments, $12,449 for
asset write-downs, $3,340 for employee severance costs and $816 for other restructuring costs, of which $15,687 was recorded in cost of sales and $13,983 in selling, general and administrative expenses. At December 31, 2008, the Company had
accrued liabilities relating to the restructuring of $12,711 related to lease impairments that will be paid over the next six years and $2,070 for employee severance costs that will be paid during 2009.

(15) Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Information

Supplemental disclosures of cash flow information are as follows:

(16) Segment Reporting

The Company has three reporting segments, the Mohawk segment, the Dal-Tile segment and the Unilin segment. The Mohawk segment manufactures, markets and distributes its product lines primarily in North America, which
include carpet, rugs, pad, ceramic tile, hardwood, resilient and laminate, through its network of regional distribution centers and satellite warehouses using company-operated trucks, common carrier or rail transportation. The segment product lines
are sold through various selling channels, which include floor covering retailers, home centers, mass merchandisers, department stores, independent distributors, commercial dealers and commercial end users. The Dal-Tile segment manufactures, markets
and distributes its product lines primarily in North America, which include ceramic tile, porcelain tile and stone products, through its network of regional distribution centers and approximately 250 company-operated sales service centers using
company-operated trucks, common carriers or rail transportation. The segment product lines are purchased by floor covering retailers, home centers, independent distributors, tile specialty dealers, tile contractors, and commercial end users. The
Unilin segment manufactures, markets and distributes its product lines primarily in North America and Europe, which include laminate flooring, wood flooring, roofing systems and other wood products through various selling channels, which include
retailers, home centers and independent distributors.

Amounts disclosed for each segment are prior to any elimination or consolidation
entries. Corporate general and administrative expenses attributable to each segment are estimated and allocated accordingly. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating income. No single customer accounted for more than 5% of net sales for
the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. In addition, inter-segment net sales, which are accounted for on the same basis as revenues in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, were approximately $82,000, $45,000 and $15,000
between the Unilin and Mohawk segments for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

(3)

The Soft surface product category includes carpets, rugs, carpet pad and resilient. The Tile product category includes ceramic tile, porcelain tile and natural stone. The Wood
product category includes laminate, hardwood, roofing panels and wood-based panels.

(17) Fair Value of Financial Instruments

As noted above in Note 1, the Company has only adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 157 with respect to its financial assets and
liabilities that are measured at fair value within the consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, these provisions only apply to derivative contracts, which include natural gas futures contracts and foreign exchange forward contracts.
The income approach is used which consists of a discounted cash flow model that takes into account the present value of future cash flows under the terms of the contracts using observable market inputs such as natural gas and foreign exchange spot
and forward rates, interest rates, the Company’s credit risk and its counterparties’ credit risks. As of December 31, 2008, there has not been any significant impact to the fair value of the Company’s derivative liabilities due
to its own credit risk.

The following table provides a summary of the fair values of financial assets and liabilities subject to SFAS
No. 157:

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of
Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), which have been designed to provide reasonable assurance that such controls and procedures will meet their objectives, as of the end of the period
covered by this report, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that such controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level for the period covered by this report.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).
The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008. In making this assessment, the Company’s management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. The Company’s management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2008, its internal control over financial reporting is
effective based on these criteria. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting.

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls

The Company’s management recognizes that a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the
inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
