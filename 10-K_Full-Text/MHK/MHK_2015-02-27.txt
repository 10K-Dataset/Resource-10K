The Company uses regional distribution centers and direct shipping from manufacturing facilities to provide high-quality customer service and enhance the Company’s ability to plan and manage inventory requirements.

Advertising and Promotion

The Company promotes its brands through advertising in television, print, social and internet media, as well as cooperative advertising, point-of-sale displays, sponsorship of a European cycling team and marketing literature. The Company also continues to rely on the substantial brand name recognition of its product lines. The cost of point-of-sale displays and product samples, a significant promotional expense, is partially offset by sales of samples to customers.

Manufacturing and Operations

Carpet Segment

The Company’s carpet and rug manufacturing operations are vertically integrated and include the extrusion of triexta,  nylon, polyester and polypropylene resins, as well as recycled post-consumer plastics into fiber.  The Carpet segment is also vertically integrated in fiber and yarn processing, backing manufacturing, tufting, weaving, dyeing, coating and finishing. The Carpet segment continues to invest in capital expenditures, principally in state-of-the-art equipment, to transition from legacy fibers, support market growth, increase manufacturing efficiency and improve overall cost competitiveness.

Ceramic Segment

The Company’s tile manufacturing operations are vertically integrated from the production of raw material for body and glaze preparation to the manufacturing and distribution of ceramic and porcelain tile. The Company believes that its manufacturing organization offers competitive advantages due to its ability to manufacture a differentiated product line consisting of one of the industry’s broadest product offerings of colors, textures and finishes and its ability to utilize the industry’s newest technology, as well as the industry’s largest offering of trim and angle pieces. In addition, the Ceramic segment also sources a portion of its product to supplement its product offerings. The Ceramic segment continues to invest in capital expenditures, primarily in equipment utilizing the latest technologies, to increase manufacturing capacity, improve efficiency, meet the growing demand for its innovative products and develop new capabilities.



Index to Financial Statements

Laminate and Wood Segment

The Company’s laminate flooring manufacturing operations are vertically integrated including high-density fiberboard (“HDF”) production, paper impregnation, short-cycle pressing, cutting and milling. The European operations also include resin production. The Laminate and Wood segment has advanced equipment that results in competitive manufacturing in terms of cost and flexibility. In addition, the Laminate and Wood segment has significant manufacturing capability for both engineered and prefinished solid wood flooring. The Laminate and Wood segment continues to invest in capital expenditures, including new plants utilizing the latest advances in technologies to increase manufacturing capacity, improve efficiency and develop new capabilities including state-of-the-art, fully integrated LVT production which will leverage the Company's proven track record of bringing innovative and high-quality products to the market.  The manufacturing facilities for roofing elements, insulation boards, MDF, chipboards and other wood products in the Laminate and Wood segment are all configured for cost-efficient manufacturing and production flexibility and are competitive in the European market.

Raw Materials and Suppliers

Carpet Segment

The principal raw materials used in the production of carpet and rugs are nylon, triexta, polyester, polypropylene, recycled post-consumer plastics, synthetic backing materials, latex and various dyes and chemicals, all of which are petroleum based. Major raw materials used in the Company’s manufacturing process are available from independent sources and the Company obtains most of its externally purchased fibers and resins from nine major suppliers. If these suppliers were unable to satisfy the requirements, the Company believes that alternative supply arrangements would be available. Although the market for carpet raw materials is sensitive to temporary disruptions, the carpet and rug business has not experienced a significant shortage of raw materials in recent years.

Ceramic Segment

The principal raw materials used in the production of ceramic tile are clay, talc, industrial minerals and glazes.  The Company has long-term clay mining rights in the U.S. and Russia that satisfy a significant amount of its clay requirements for producing quarry tile. The Company purchases a number of different grades of clay for the manufacture of its non-quarry tile.   The Company has entered into long-term supply agreements for a portion of its talc requirements. Glazes are used on a significant percentage of manufactured tiles.  Glazes consist of frit (ground glass), zircon, stains and other materials, with frit being the largest ingredient. The Company manufactures a significant amount of its frit requirements.  The Company believes that there is an adequate supply of all grades of clay, talc and industrial minerals that are readily available from a number of independent sources.  If these suppliers were unable to satisfy the requirements, the Company believes that alternative supply arrangements would be available.

Laminate and Wood Segment

The principal raw materials used in producing boards, laminate and hardwood flooring are wood, paper, resins, coatings and stains. Wood supply is a very fragmented market in Europe. The Company has long-standing relationships with numerous suppliers. These suppliers provide a wide variety of wood species, varying from fresh round wood to several kinds of by-products of sawmills and recycled wood, giving the Company a cost-effective and secure supply of raw material. In the U.S., the Company has a long-term contract with a contiguously located lumber company that supplies most of its total needs for HDF board production. The supply of various species of hardwoods and hardwood veneers used in the production of solid wood and engineered flooring is both localized and global.

Major manufacturers supply the papers required in the laminate flooring business. The Company processes most of the paper impregnation internally in its laminate flooring facilities.  In Europe, the resins for paper impregnation are manufactured by the Company, which permits greater control over the laminate flooring manufacturing process.  The Company buys the balance of its resin requirements from a number of companies. The Company believes there are alternative sources of supply of paper and resin located within a reasonable distance of the Laminate and Wood segment’s facilities.

Industry and Competition

The Company is the largest flooring manufacturer in a fragmented industry composed of a wide variety of companies from small privately held firms to large multinationals.  In


, the U.S. floor covering industry reported $20.1 billion in sales,



Index to Financial Statements

up approximately 7% over 2012's sales of $18.8 billion.  In 2013, the primary categories of flooring in the U.S., based on sales, were carpet and rug (51%), resilient and rubber (13%), ceramic tile (13%), hardwood (12%), stone (6%) and laminate (5%).  In 2013, the primary categories of flooring in the U.S., based on square feet, were carpet and rug (57%), resilient and rubber (18%), ceramic tile (13%), hardwood (6%), laminate (5%) and stone (2%).  Each of these categories is influenced by the residential builder and homeowner remodeling markets, housing starts and housing resales, average house size and home ownership. In addition, the level of sales in the floor covering industry is influenced by consumer confidence, spending for durable goods, interest rates and availability of credit, turnover in housing, the condition of the residential and commercial construction industries and the overall strength of the economy.

The principal methods of competition within the floor covering industry generally are service, style, quality, price, product innovation and technology. In each of the markets, price and market coverage are particularly important because there is limited differentiation among competing product lines. The Company’s investments in manufacturing equipment, computer systems and distribution network, as well as the Company’s marketing strategy, contribute to its ability to compete on the basis of performance, quality, style and service, rather than just price.

Carpet Segment

The carpet and rug industry is highly competitive. Based on industry publications, the top five North American carpet and rug manufacturers (including their foreign divisions) in


had carpet and rug sales in excess of $7.1 billion of the over $11.2 billion market. The Company believes it is the second largest producer of carpets and rugs (in terms of sales dollars) in the world based on its


net sales.

Ceramic Segment

Globally, the ceramic tile industry is significantly fragmented. The Company faces competition in the ceramic tile flooring channel from a large number of foreign and domestic manufacturers who all compete for sales of ceramic tile to customers. The Company believes it is the largest manufacturer, distributor and marketer of ceramic tile in the world.

Laminate and Wood Segment

The Company faces competition in the laminate and hardwood flooring channel from a large number of domestic and

foreign manufacturers.  The Company believes it is one of the largest manufacturers, distributors and licensors of laminate flooring in the world, with a focus on high-end products. The Company believes it is one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of hardwood flooring in the U.S.  In addition, the Company believes it has a competitive advantage in the laminate flooring channel as a result of the Laminate and Wood segment’s industry leading design, patented technologies and brands, which allow the Company to distinguish its laminate and hardwood flooring products in the areas of finish, quality, installation and assembly.

Patents and Trademarks

Intellectual property is important to the Company’s business and the Company relies on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to protect its interests.

The Company uses several trademarks that it considers important in the marketing of its products, including Aladdin, American Olean, Bigelow, Century Flooring, Columbia Flooring, Dal-Tile, Duracolor

®

, Everset fibers

®

, Horizon, Karastan, Kerama Marazzi, Lees, Marazzi, Mohawk, Mohawk ColorCenter, Mohawk Floorscapes, Mohawk GreenWorks

, Quick-Step, Ragno, SmartStrand, Ultra Performance System

®

,  UNICLIC, UNILIN, Utherm

®

and Wear-Dated

®

. These trademarks represent innovations that highlight competitive advantages and provide differentiation from competing brands in the market.

The Laminate and Wood segment owns a number of patent families in Europe and the U.S. some of which the Company licenses to manufacturers and distributors throughout the world.  The most important of these patent families is the UNICLIC family, which include the snap, pretension, clearance and the beveled edge patents.  The UNICLIC family of patents is expected to expire in 2017.  The Company continues to explore additional opportunities to generate revenue from its patent portfolio.  The licensing revenue from patents included in the Laminate and Wood segment's results were approximately €109 million in 2014.  The licensing revenue from patents generated in the Laminate and Wood segment's operations is partially offset by various expenses such as amortization, developing new technologies, filing new patents, supporting existing patents, defending patent lawsuits, collection and auditing of receivables, bad debt and other administrative activities.



Index to Financial Statements

Sales Terms and Major Customers

The Company’s sales terms are substantially the same as those generally available throughout the industry. The Company generally permits its customers to return products purchased from it within specified time periods from the date of sale, if the customer is not satisfied with the quality of the product.

During


, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of total net sales and the top 10 customers accounted for less than 20% of the Company’s net sales. The Company believes the loss of one major customer would not have a material adverse effect on its business.

Employees

As of

December 31, 2014

, the Company employed approximately 32,300 persons consisting of approximately 23,100 in North America, approximately 4,700 in Europe, approximately 3,400 in Russia, approximately 1,000 in Malaysia and approximately 200 in various other countries. The majority of the Company’s European and Mexican manufacturing employees are members of unions. Most of the Company’s U.S. employees are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement. Additionally, the Company has not experienced any strikes or work stoppages in recent years. The Company believes that its relations with its employees are good.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

In addition to the other information provided in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating an investment in shares of the Company’s Common Stock.  If any of the events described in these risks were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

The floor covering industry is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, such as consumer confidence and income, corporate and government spending, interest rate levels, availability of credit and demand for housing. Significant or prolonged declines in the U.S. or global economies could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

Downturns in the U.S. and global economies, along with the residential and commercial markets in such economies, negatively impact the floor covering industry and the Company’s business. The Company derives a majority of its sales from the replacement segment of the market, followed by sales associated with new construction activities.  Although the impact of a decline in new construction activity is typically accompanied by an increase in remodeling and replacement activity, these activities lagged in the most recent downturn. Although the difficult economic conditions have improved in the U.S., European and other markets have not recovered as quickly and there may be additional downturns that could cause the industry to deteriorate in the foreseeable future. A significant or prolonged decline in residential or commercial remodeling or new construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations.



Index to Financial Statements

The Company may be unable to predict customer preferences or demand accurately, or to respond to technological developments.

The Company operates in a market sector where demand is strongly influenced by rapidly changing customer preferences as to product design and technical features.  Failure to quickly and effectively respond to changing customer demand or technological developments could have a material adverse effect on our business.

The Company faces intense competition in the flooring industry that could decrease demand for the Company’s products or force it to lower prices, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

The floor covering industry is highly competitive. The Company faces competition from a number of manufacturers and independent distributors.  Maintaining the Company’s competitive position may require substantial investments in the Company’s product development efforts, manufacturing facilities, distribution network and sales and marketing activities. Competitive pressures may also result in decreased demand for the Company’s products or force the Company to lower prices. Moreover, a strong U.S. dollar combined with lower fuel costs may contribute to more attractive pricing for imports that compete with the Company’s products, which may put pressure on the Company’s pricing.  Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

Changes in the global economy could affect the Company’s overall availability and cost of credit.

Despite recent improvement in overall economic conditions in the U.S., continued weakness elsewhere in the world or changes in market conditions could impact the Company’s ability to obtain financing in the future, including any financing necessary to refinance existing indebtedness.  The cost and availability of credit during uncertain economic times could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition.

Further, negative economic conditions may factor into the Company’s periodic credit ratings assessment by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's"), Standard & Poor’s Financial Services, LLC ("S&P") and Fitch, Inc.  Any future changes in the credit rating agencies’ methodology in assessing our credit strength and any downgrades in the Company’s credit ratings could increase the cost of its existing credit and could adversely affect the cost of and ability to obtain additional credit in the future. The Company can provide no assurances that downgrades will not occur.

If the Company were unable to meet certain covenants contained in its existing credit facilities, it may be required to repay borrowings under the credit facilities prior to their maturity and may lose access to the credit facilities for additional borrowings that may be necessary to fund its operations and growth strategy.

On

September 25, 2013

, the Company entered into a

$1,000.0 million

,


-year, senior revolving credit facility (the "2013 Senior Credit Facility").  As of

December 31, 2014

, the amount utilized under the 2013 Senior Credit Facility, including the commercial paper issuance, was

$534.6 million

resulting in a total of

$465.4 million

available. The amount utilized included

$301.6 million

of commercial paper issued,

$195.7 million

of direct borrowings, and

$37.4 million

of standby letters of credit related to various insurance contracts and foreign vendor commitments.  In addition, on December 19, 2012, the Company entered into a three-year on-balance sheet U.S. trade accounts receivable securitization agreement (the "Securitization Facility") that after an amendment on September 11, 2014 allows the Company to borrow up to $500 million based on available accounts receivable and is secured by the Company's U.S. trade accounts receivable. At

December 31, 2014

, the amount utilized under the Securitization Facility was

$500.0 million

.

During the term of the credit facilities, if the Company’s cash flow is worse than expected or the U.S. trade accounts receivables are lower than expected, the Company may need to refinance all or a portion of its indebtedness through a public and/or private debt offering or a new bank facility and may not be able to do so on terms acceptable to it, or at all. If the Company is unable to access debt markets at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts due to credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, or weakness in the Company's businesses, the Company’s ability to finance its operations or repay existing debt obligations may be materially and adversely affected.

Additionally, the credit facilities include certain affirmative and negative covenants that impose restrictions on the Company’s financial and business operations, including limitations on liens, indebtedness, investments, fundamental changes, asset dispositions, dividends and other similar restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, payments and modifications of certain existing debt, future negative pledges, and changes in the nature of the Company’s business.  In addition, the 2013 Senior Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of at least 3.0 to 1.0 and a Consolidated



Index to Financial Statements

Net Leverage Ratio of no more than 3.75 to 1.0.  A failure to comply with the obligations contained in our current or future credit facilities or indentures relating to our outstanding public debt could result in an event of default or an acceleration of debt under other instruments that may contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. We cannot be certain that we would have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments.

The 2013 Senior Credit Facility is scheduled to mature on

September 25, 2018

.  However, the maturity date will accelerate, resulting in the acceleration of any unamortized deferred financing costs, to

October 16, 2015

, if on that date any of the Company's

6.125%

notes due

January 15, 2016

remains outstanding and the Company has not delivered to the Administrative Agent a certificate demonstrating that, after giving pro forma effect to the repayment in cash in full on that date of all of the

6.125%

In periods of rising costs, the Company may be unable to pass raw materials, energy and fuel-related cost increases on to its customers, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

The prices of raw materials and fuel-related costs vary significantly with market conditions. Although the Company generally attempts to pass on increases in raw material, energy and fuel-related costs to its customers, the Company’s ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase, competitive pressures and market conditions for the Company’s products. There have been in the past, and may be in the future, periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be recovered. During such periods of time, the Company’s business may be materially adversely affected.

The Company may be unable to obtain raw materials or sourced product on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

The principal raw materials used in the Company’s manufacturing operations include triexta, nylon, polypropylene, and polyester resins and fibers, which are used primarily in the Company’s carpet and rugs business; clay, talc, nepheline syenite and glazes, including frit (ground glass), zircon and stains, which are used exclusively in the Company’s ceramic tile business; and wood, paper, and resins which are used primarily in the Company’s wood and laminate flooring business. In addition, the Company sources finished goods as well. For certain of such raw materials and sourced products, the Company is dependent on one or a small number of suppliers, and certain raw materials are sourced from unstable regions. An adverse change in the Company’s relationship with such a supplier, the financial condition of such a supplier or such supplier’s ability to manufacture or deliver such raw materials or sourced products to the Company could lead to an interruption of supply or require the Company to purchase more expensive alternatives. An extended interruption in the supply of these or other raw materials or sourced products used in the Company’s business or in the supply of suitable substitute materials or products would disrupt the Company’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and may affect the comparability of results between the Company’s financial periods.

The results of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries reported in the local currency are translated into U.S. Dollars for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date and for the statement of operations accounts using, principally, the Company’s average rates during the period. The exchange rates between some of these currencies and the U.S. Dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future. The Company may not be able to manage effectively the Company’s currency translation risks, and volatility in currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and affect comparability of the Company’s results between financial periods.

The Company relies on information systems in managing the Company’s operations and any system failure or

deficiencies of such systems may have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.

The Company’s businesses rely on sophisticated inventory systems to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data. The Company relies on these systems to, among other things:



Index to Financial Statements

•

facilitate the purchase, management and distribution of inventory items;

•

manage and monitor the daily operations of our distribution network;

•

receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis;

•

manage accurate billing to customers; and

•

control logistics and quality control for our retail operations.

In addition, we rely on information management systems to monitor the daily operation of points of sale controlled and managed by us and to maintain accurate and up-to-date operating and financial data for the compilation of management information. We rely on our computer hardware, software and network for the storage, delivery and transmission of data to our sales and distribution systems, and certain of our production processes are managed and conducted by computer.

Any damage by unforeseen events or system failure which causes interruptions to the input, retrieval and transmission of data or increase in the service time, whether caused by human error, natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses, intentional acts of vandalism, various forms of cybercrimes including and not limited to hacking, intrusions and malware or otherwise, could disrupt our normal operations. There can be no assurance that we can effectively carry out our disaster recovery plan to handle the failure of our information systems, or that we will be able to restore our operational capacity within sufficient time to avoid material disruption to our business. The occurrence of any of these events could cause unanticipated disruptions in service, decreased customer service and customer satisfaction and harm to our reputation, which could result in loss of customers, increased operating expenses and financial losses. Any such events could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.

The Company may experience certain risks associated with acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments.

The Company intends to grow its business through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. Growth through acquisitions involves risks, many of which may continue to affect the Company after the acquisition. The Company cannot give assurance that an acquired company will achieve the levels of revenue, profitability and production that the Company expects. Acquisitions may require the issuance of additional securities or the incurrence of additional indebtedness, which may dilute the ownership interests of existing security holders or impose higher interest costs on the Company.

The Company may also face challenges in consolidating functions, integrating the Company’s organizations, procedures, operations and product lines in a timely and efficient manner and retaining key personnel. These challenges include:

•

maintaining executive offices in different locations;

•

manufacturing and selling different types of products through different distribution channels;

•

conducting business from various locations;

•

maintaining different operating systems and software on different computer hardware; and

•

providing different employment and compensation arrangements for employees.

Failure to successfully manage and integrate an acquisition with the Company’s existing operations could lead to the potential loss of customers of the acquired business, the potential loss of employees who may be vital to the new operations, the potential loss of business opportunities or other adverse consequences that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. Even if integration occurs successfully, failure of the acquisition to achieve levels of anticipated sales growth, profitability or productivity, or otherwise perform as expected, may result in goodwill or other asset impairments or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

In addition, we have made certain investments, including through joint ventures, in which we have a minority equity interest and lack management and operational control. The controlling joint venture partner in a joint venture investment may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and business decisions or other actions or omissions of the controlling joint venture partner or the joint venture company may result in harm to our reputation or adversely affect the value of our investment in the joint venture.



Index to Financial Statements

A failure to identify suitable acquisition candidates or partners for strategic investments and to complete acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

As part of the Company’s business strategy, the Company intends to pursue a wide array of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of complementary businesses, as well as strategic investments and joint ventures. Although the Company regularly evaluates such opportunities, the Company may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities, to obtain sufficient financing on acceptable terms to fund such strategic transactions, to complete acquisitions and integrate acquired businesses with the Company’s existing businesses, or to manage profitably acquired businesses or strategic investments.

The Company manufactures, sources and sells many products internationally and is exposed to risks associated with doing business globally.

The Company's international activities are significant to its manufacturing capacity, revenues and profits, and the Company is further expanding internationally. The Company sells products, operates plants and invests in companies around the world.  Currently, the Company's Laminate and Wood segment has significant operations in Europe, Russia, Malaysia and Australia and the Company's Ceramic segment has significant operations in Europe, Russia and Mexico.  In addition, the Company has invested in a joint venture in Brazil related to laminate flooring and has an investment in a Chinese tile manufacturer.

The business, regulatory and political environments in these countries differ from those in the U.S.  The Company’s international sales, operations and investments are subject to risks and uncertainties, including:

•

changes in foreign country regulatory requirements;

•

differing business practices associated with foreign operations;

•

various import/export restrictions and the availability of required import/export licenses;

•

imposition of foreign tariffs and other trade barriers;

•

foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;

•

differing inflationary or deflationary market pressures;

•

foreign country tax rules, regulations and other requirements, such as changes in tax rates and statutory and judicial interpretations in tax laws;

•

differing labor laws and changes in those laws;

•

work stoppages and disruptions in the shipping of imported and exported products;

•

government price controls;

•

extended payment terms and the inability to collect accounts receivable;

•

potential difficulties repatriating cash from non-U.S. subsidiaries; and

•

compliance with laws governing international relations, including those that prohibit improper payments to government officials.

The Company cannot assure investors that it will succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies to address the foregoing risks effectively in each location where the Company does business, and, therefore that the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

The Company has significant operations in emerging markets, including Russia, Mexico and Malaysia, and, therefore, has exposure to doing business in potentially unstable areas of the world.

Operations in emerging markets are subject to greater risk than more developed markets, including in some cases significant legal, economic and political risks.  Market conditions and the political structures that support them are subject to rapid change in these economies, and the Company may not be able to react quickly enough to protect its assets and business operations.  In particular, developing markets in which the Company operates may be characterized by one or more of the following:

•

heavy state control of natural resources and energy supplies;

•

state ownership of transportation and supply chain assets;

•

high protective tariffs and inefficient customs processes;

•

complex and conflicting laws and regulations, which may be inconsistently or arbitrarily enforced;



Index to Financial Statements

•

underdeveloped infrastructure;

•

high incidences of corruption in state regulatory agencies;

•

high crime rates;

•

volatile inflation;

•

widespread poverty and resulting political instability;

•

immature legal and banking systems; and

•

uncertainty with respect to title to real and personal property.

Changes in any one or a combination of these factors could have a material adverse affect on the Company’s business.

Negative tax consequences could materially and adversely affect the Company's business.

The Company is subject to the tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which we operate.  These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to our facts is sometimes open to interpretation.  In calculating the provision for income taxes, we must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws.  Our domestic and international tax liabilities are largely dependent upon the distribution of profit before tax among these many jurisdictions.  However, it also includes estimates of additional tax which may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the Company that could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets.  Our future results of operations and tax liability could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the overall profitability of the Company, changes in tax legislation and rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns, and ongoing assessments of our tax exposures.

The Company has been, and in the future may be, subject to costs, liabilities and other obligations under existing or new laws and regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

The Company is subject to increasingly numerous and complex laws, regulations and licensing requirements in each of  the jurisdictions in which the Company conducts business. The Company faces risks and uncertainties related to compliance with such laws and regulations. In addition, new laws and regulations may be enacted in the U.S. or abroad that may require the Company to incur additional personnel-related, environmental, or other costs on an ongoing basis, such as recently enacted healthcare legislation in the United States.

In particular, the Company’s operations are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, and the use, storage, treatment, recycling and disposal of materials and finished product. The applicable requirements under these laws are subject to amendment, to the imposition of new or additional requirements and to changing interpretations of agencies or courts. The Company could incur material expenditures to comply with new or existing regulations, including fines and penalties and increased costs of its operations. For example,  our manufacturing facilities may become subject to further limitations on the emission of “greenhouse gases” due to public policy concerns regarding climate change issues or other environmental or health and safety concerns. While the form of any additional regulations cannot be predicted, a “cap-and-trade” system similar to the system that applies to our businesses in the European Union could be adopted in the United States. The Company’s manufacturing processes use a significant amount of energy, especially natural gas. Any such “cap-and-trade” system or other limitations imposed on the emission of “greenhouse gases” could require us to increase our capital expenditures, use our cash to acquire emission credits or restructure our manufacturing operations, which could have a material adverse affect on our business.

The Company’s business operations could suffer significant losses from natural disasters, catastrophes, fire or other unexpected events.

Many of the Company’s business activities involve substantial investments in manufacturing facilities and many products are produced at a limited number of locations. These facilities could be materially damaged by natural disasters, such as floods, tornados, hurricanes and earthquakes, or by fire or other unexpected events. The Company could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from such events, including damage to its reputation, and/or suffer material losses in operational capacity, which could have a material adverse impact on its business.



Index to Financial Statements

The Company may be exposed to litigation, claims and other legal proceedings in the relating to its products, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to a variety of product-related claims, lawsuits and legal proceedings, including those relating to product liability, product warranty, product recall, personal injury, and other matters. A very large claim or several similar claims asserted by a a large class of plaintiffs could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, if the Company is unable to successfully defend against or resolve these matters or if its insurance coverage is insufficient to satisfy any judgments against the Company or settlements relating to these matters. Although the Company has product liability insurance, the policies may not provide coverage for certain claims against the Company or may not be sufficient to cover all possible liabilities. Further, the Company may not be able to maintain insurance at commercially acceptable premium levels. Moreover, adverse publicity arising from claims made against the Company, even if the claims are not successful, could adversely affect the Company’s reputation or the reputation and sales of its products.

The Company’s inability to protect its intellectual property rights or collect license revenues, with respect to the Company’s patented laminate flooring technology, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

The profit margins of certain of the Company’s businesses, particularly the Company’s laminate flooring business, depend in part upon the Company’s ability to obtain, maintain and license proprietary technology used in the Company’s principal product families. The Company relies, in part, on the patent, trade secret and trademark laws of the U.S., countries in the European Union and elsewhere, as well as confidentiality agreements with some of the Company’s employees, to protect that technology.

The Company has obtained a number of patents relating to the Company’s products and associated methods and has filed applications for additional patents, including the UNICLIC and Pergo family of patents, which protects its interlocking laminate flooring technology. The Company generates license revenue from these patents, which are expected to expire in 2017 and 2021, respectively. The Company continues to develop new sources of revenue to offset the expiration of its revenue-producing patents. The failure to develop alternative revenues could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.

In addition, the Company cannot assure investors that any patents owned by or issued to it will provide the Company with competitive advantages, that third parties will not challenge these patents, or that the Company’s pending patent applications will be approved. The Company may be unable to prevent competitors and/or third parties from using the Company's technology without the Company's authorization, independently developing technology that is similar to that of the Company or designing around the Company's patents. The use of the Company's technology or similar technology by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage the Company has developed, cause the Company to lose sales or otherwise

Furthermore, despite the Company’s efforts, the Company may be unable to prevent competitors and/or third parties from using the Company’s technology without the Company’s authorization, independently developing technology that is similar to that of the Company or designing around the Company’s patents. The use of the Company’s technology or similar technology by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage the Company has developed, cause the Company to lose sales or otherwise harm the Company’s business.

The Company has obtained and applied for numerous U.S. and foreign service marks and trademark registrations and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional service marks and trademarks, as appropriate. The Company cannot guarantee that any of the Company’s pending or future applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities.  A failure to obtain trademark registrations in the U.S. and in other countries could limit the Company’s ability to protect the Company’s trademarks and impede the Company’s marketing efforts in those jurisdictions and could have a material effect on the Company’s business.

The Company generally requires third parties with access to the Company’s trade secrets to agree to keep such information confidential. While such measures are intended to protect the Company’s trade secrets, there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that the Company will have adequate remedies for any breach or that the Company’s confidential and proprietary information and technology will not be independently developed by or become otherwise known to third parties. In any of these circumstances, the Company’s competitiveness could be significantly impaired, which would limit the Company’s growth and future revenue.



Index to Financial Statements

Third parties may claim that the Company infringed their intellectual property or proprietary rights, which could cause it to incur significant expenses or prevent it from selling the Company’s products.

In the past, third parties have claimed that certain technologies incorporated in the Company’s products infringe their patent rights.  The Company cannot be certain that the Company’s products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others. Historically, patent applications in the U.S. and some foreign countries have not been publicly disclosed until the patent is issued (or, in some recent cases, until 18 months following submission), and the Company may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to the Company’s products or processes. If patents are later issued on these applications, the Company may be liable for infringement.

As a result, the Company might be required to pay substantial damages (including punitive damages and attorney’s fees), discontinue the use and sale of infringing products, expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology or obtain licenses authorizing the use of infringing technology. There can be no assurance that licenses for disputed technology or intellectual property rights would be available on reasonable commercial terms, if at all. In the event of a successful claim against the Company along with failure to develop or license a substitute technology, the Company’s business would be materially and adversely affected.

The long-term performance of the Company’s business relies on its ability to attract, develop and retain talented management.

To be successful, the Company must attract, develop and retain qualified and talented personnel in management, sales, marketing, product design and innovation and operations, and as it considers entering new international markets, skilled personnel familiar with those markets. The Company competes with multinational firms for these employees and invests resources in recruiting, developing, motivating and retaining them. The failure to attract, develop, motivate and retain key employees could negatively affect the Company’s competitive position and its operating results.

The Company is subject to changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both costs and the risk of noncompliance.

The Company’s stock is publicly traded. As a result, the Company is subject to the rules and regulations of federal and state agencies and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. These entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange, frequently issue new requirements and regulations. The Company’s efforts to comply with the regulations and interpretations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative costs and diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities.

Declines in the Company’s business conditions may result in an impairment of the Company’s tangible and intangible assets which could result in a material non-cash charge.

A significant or prolonged decrease in the Company’s market capitalization, including a decline in stock price, or a negative long-term performance outlook, could result in an impairment of its tangible and intangible assets which results when the carrying value of the Company’s assets exceed their fair value.

Forward-Looking Information

Certain of the statements in this Form 10-K, particularly those anticipating future performance, business prospects, growth and operating strategies, and similar matters, and those that include the words “could,” “should,” “believes,” “anticipates,” “expects” and “estimates” or similar expressions constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. For those statements, Mohawk claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. There can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements will be accurate because they are based on many assumptions, which involve risks and uncertainties. The following important factors could cause future results to differ: changes in economic or industry conditions; competition; inflation and deflation in raw material prices and other input costs; inflation and deflation in consumer markets; energy costs and supply; timing and level of capital expenditures; timing and implementation of price increases for the Company’s products; impairment charges; integration of acquisitions; international operations; introduction of new products; rationalization of operations; tax, product and other claims; litigation; and other risks identified in Mohawk’s SEC reports and public announcements.

Properties

The Company owns a 0.2 million square foot headquarters office in Calhoun, Georgia on an eight-acre site. The Company also owns a 2.1 million square foot manufacturing facility located in Dalton, Georgia and a 1.4 million square foot manufacturing facility in Glasgow, Virginia used by the Carpet segment; a 2.4 million square foot manufacturing facility located in Orel, Russia, a 1.7 million square foot manufacturing facility located in Monterey, Mexico, a 1.4 million square foot manufacturing facility located in Sunnyvale, Texas and a 1.5 million square foot manufacturing facility located in Sassuolo, Italy used by the Ceramic segment; and a 2.1 million square foot manufacturing property and a 1.1 million square foot manufacturing facility located in Wielsbeke, Belgium, a 1.2 million square foot manufacturing facility in Oostrozebeke, Belgium and a 0.5 million square foot manufacturing facility located in Thomasville, North Carolina used by the Laminate and Wood segment.

The following table summarizes the Company’s facilities both owned and leased for each segment in square feet (in millions):

The Company’s properties are in good condition and adequate for its requirements. The Company believes its principal plants are generally adequate to meet its production plans pursuant to the Company’s long-term sales goals. In the ordinary course of business, the Company monitors the condition of its facilities to ensure that they remain adequate to meet long-term sales goals and production plans.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

The Company is involved in litigation from time to time in the regular course of its business. Except as noted below, there are no material legal proceedings pending or known by the Company to be contemplated to which the Company is a party or to which any of its property is subject.

Beginning in August 2010, a series of civil lawsuits were initiated in several U.S. federal courts alleging that certain manufacturers of polyurethane foam products and competitors of the Company’s carpet underlay division had engaged in price fixing in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The Company has been named as a defendant in a number of the individual cases (the first filed on August 26, 2010), as well as in

two

consolidated amended class action complaints the first filed on February 28, 2011, on behalf of a class of all direct purchasers of polyurethane foam products, and the second filed on March 21, 2011, on behalf of a class of indirect purchasers. All pending cases in which the Company has been named as a defendant have been filed in or transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio for consolidated pre-trial proceedings under the name

In re: Polyurethane Foam Antitrust Litigation, Case No. 1:10-MDL-02196.

In these actions, the plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and/or a class of purchasers, seek damages allegedly suffered as a result of alleged overcharges in the price of polyurethane foam products from at least 1999 to the present. The direct purchaser class currently claims damages from all of the defendants named in the lawsuit of up to approximately $867 million which amount may be reduced further by the value of claims made by plaintiffs that opt out of the class. Any damages actually awarded at trial are subject to being tripled under US antitrust laws.  The amount of damages in the remaining cases varies or has not yet been specified by the plaintiffs.  Each plaintiff also seeks attorney fees, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, court costs and injunctive relief against future violations.

In April 2011, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the class action claims brought by the direct purchasers, and in May 2011, the Company moved to dismiss the claims brought by the indirect purchasers. On July 19, 2011, the Court denied all defendants’ motions to dismiss. On April 9, 2014, the Court certified the direct and indirect purchaser classes. The Company sought permission to appeal the certification order on April 24, 2014, and the petition was denied by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on September 29, 2014.  The Company has appealed the District Court’s certification order to the United



Index to Financial Statements

States Supreme Court; this appeal is pending.  Fact discovery in almost all cases is now complete and, in August 2014, the Company and other defendants filed motions for summary judgment against the direct purchaser class.  In February 2015, the Court denied all summary judgment motions.  The first trial (for the direct purchaser class action) is scheduled to begin on March 31, 2015.

In December 2011, the Company was named as a defendant in a Canadian Class action,

Hi! Neighbor Floor Covering Co. Limited v. Hickory Springs Manufacturing Company, et al

., filed in the Superior Court of Justice of Ontario, Canada and

Options Consommateures v. Vitafoam, Inc. et.al.

, filed in the Superior Court of Justice of Quebec, Montreal, Canada, both of which allege similar claims against the Company as raised in the U.S. actions and seek unspecified damages and punitive damages. The Company denies all of the allegations in these actions and will vigorously defend itself.  The Company has reached an agreement in principle to settle the Canadian actions, but the settlement has not yet been finalized.

In January 2012, the Company received a

€23,789

assessment from the Belgian tax authority related to its year ended December 31, 2008, asserting that the Company had understated its Belgian taxable income for that year. The Company filed a formal protest in the first quarter of 2012 refuting the Belgian tax authority's position.  The Belgian tax authority set aside the assessment in the third quarter of 2012 and refunded all related deposits, including interest income of

€1,583

earned on such deposits. However, on October 23, 2012, the Belgian tax authority notified the Company of its intent to increase the Company's taxable income for the year ended December 31, 2008 under a revised theory.

However, on December 28, 2012, the Belgian tax authority issued assessments for the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2009, in the amounts of

€46,135

and

€35,567

, respectively, including penalties, but excluding interest. The Company filed a formal protest during the first quarter of 2013 relating to the new assessments. In September 2013, the Belgian tax authority denied the Company's protests, and the Company has brought these two years before the Court of First Instance in Bruges.

In December 2013, the Belgian tax authority issued additional assessments related to the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007, and 2010, in the amounts of

€38,817

,

€39,635

, and

€43,117

, respectively, including penalties, but excluding interest.  The Company filed formal protests during the first quarter of 2014, refuting the Belgian tax authority's position for each of the years assessed.  In the quarter ended June 28, 2014, the Company received a formal assessment for the year ended December 31, 2008, totaling €30,131, against which the Company also submitted its formal protest. All 4 additional years have been brought before the Court of First Appeal in November 2014.

In January of 2015, the Company met with the Court of First Appeal in Bruges and agreed with the Belgium tax authorities to consolidate and argue the issues regarding the years 2005 and 2009, and apply the ruling to all of the open years (to the extent there are no additional facts/procedural arguments in the other years).

The Company believes that adequate provisions for resolution of all contingencies, claims and pending litigation have been made for probable losses that are reasonably estimable.  These contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and we are unable to estimate the amount or range of loss, if any, in excess of amounts accrued.  The Company does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition but could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, cash flows or liquidity in a given quarter or year.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

The Company has three reporting segments: the Carpet segment, the Ceramic segment and the Laminate and Wood segment. The Carpet segment designs, manufactures, sources and markets its floor covering product lines, including carpets,  rugs, carpet pad, ceramic tile, laminate, hardwood and resilient, which it distributes primarily in North America through its network of regional distribution centers and satellite warehouses using company-operated trucks, common carrier or rail transportation.

Commercial Paper

On

February 28, 2014

, the Company entered into definitive documentation to establish a commercial paper program for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the United States capital markets. Under the program, the Company may issue commercial paper notes from time to time in an aggregate amount not to exceed

$1,000.0 million

outstanding at any time, subject to availability under the 2013 Senior Credit Facility, which the Company uses as a liquidity backstop.

Senior Credit Facility

On

September 25, 2013

, the Company entered into a

$1,000.0 million

,


-year, senior revolving credit facility (the "2013 Senior Credit Facility").  The 2013 Senior Credit Facility provides for a maximum of

$1,000.0 million

of revolving credit, including limited amounts of credit in the form of letters of credit and swingline loans and serves as a backstop to the Company's commercial paper program. The Company paid financing costs of

$1.8 million

in connection with its 2013 Senior Credit Facility. These costs were deferred and, along with unamortized costs of

$11.4 million

related to the Company’s 2011 Credit Facility, are being amortized over the term of the 2013 Senior Credit Facility.

At the Company's election, revolving loans under the 2013 Senior Credit Facility bear interest at annual rates equal to either (a) LIBOR for 1, 2, 3 or 6 month periods, as selected by the Company, plus an applicable margin ranging between

1.00%

and

1.75%

, or (b) the higher of the Wells Fargo Bank, National Association prime rate, the Federal Funds rate plus

0.5%

, and a monthly LIBOR rate plus

1.0%

, plus an applicable margin ranging between

0.00%

and

0.75%

. The Company also pays a commitment fee to the Lenders under the 2013 Senior Credit Facility on the average amount by which the aggregate commitments of the Lenders' exceed utilization of the 2013 Senior Credit Facility ranging from

0.125%

to

0.25%

per annum.  The applicable interest rate and the commitment fee are determined based on whichever of the Company's Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio or its senior unsecured debt rating (or if not available, corporate family rating) results in the lower applicable margins and commitment fee (with applicable margins and the commitment fee increasing as that ratio increases or those ratings decline, as applicable).

The obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries in respect of the 2013 Senior Credit Facility are unsecured.

If at any time (a) both (i) the Moody's Rating is Ba2 and (ii) the S&P Rating is BB, (b) (i) the Moody's Rating is Ba3 or lower and (ii) the S&P Rating is below BBB- (with a stable outlook or better) or (c) (i) the Moody's Rating is below Baa3 (with a stable outlook or better) and (ii) the S&P Rating is BB- or lower, the obligations of the Company and the other Borrowers under the 2013 Senior Credit Facility will be required to be guaranteed by all of the Company's material domestic subsidiaries and all obligations of Borrowers that are foreign subsidiaries will be required to be guaranteed by those foreign subsidiaries of the Company which the Company designates as guarantors.

The 2013 Senior Credit Facility includes certain affirmative and negative covenants that impose restrictions on the Company's financial and business operations, including limitations on liens, indebtedness, investments, fundamental changes, asset dispositions, dividends and other similar restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, payments and modifications of certain existing debt, future negative pledges, and changes in the nature of the Company's business. Many of these limitations are subject to numerous exceptions. The Company is also required to maintain a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of at least

3.0

to 1.0 and a Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of no more than

3.75

to 1.0, each as of the last day of any fiscal quarter.



Index to Financial Statements

The 2013 Senior Credit Facility also contains customary representations and warranties and events of default, subject to customary grace periods.

The 2013 Senior Credit Facility is scheduled to mature on

September 25, 2018

.  However, the maturity date will accelerate, resulting in the acceleration of any unamortized deferred financing costs, to

October 16, 2015

, if on that date any of the Company's

6.125%

notes due

January 15, 2016

remains outstanding and the Company has not delivered to the Administrative Agent a certificate demonstrating that, after giving pro forma effect to the repayment in cash in full on that date of all of the

6.125%

notes that remain outstanding, the amount the Company would be permitted to draw under the 2013 Senior Credit Facility, together with the aggregate consolidated amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of the Company, would exceed

$200.0 million

.  While there can be no assurance, the Company currently believes that if any of the

6.125%

notes remains outstanding on

October 16, 2015

, the amount the Company would be permitted to draw under the 2013 Senior Credit Facility, together with the aggregate consolidated amount of the Company’s unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, will exceed

$200.0 million

on

October 16, 2015

.

As of

December 31, 2014

, amounts utilized under the facility included

$195.7 million

of borrowings and

$37.4 million

of standby letters of credit related to various insurance contracts and foreign vendor commitments.  The Company also considers the outstanding borrowings of

$301.6 million

as of

December 31, 2014

under its commercial paper program to be a reduction of the available capacity.  Taking the commercial paper borrowings into consideration, the Company has utilized

$534.6 million

under the 2013 Senior Credit Facility resulting in a total of

$465.4 million

available under the 2013 Senior Credit Facility.

Senior Notes

On January 31, 2013, the Company issued

$600.0 million

aggregate principal amount of

3.85%

Senior Notes due

February 1, 2023

.  The Company paid financing costs of

$6.0 million

in connection with the

3.85%

Senior Notes. These costs were deferred and are being amortized over the term of the

3.85%

Senior Notes.

On January 17, 2006, the Company issued

$900.0 million

aggregate principal amount of

6.125%

notes due

January 15, 2016

. Interest payable on these notes is subject to adjustment if either Moody’s or S&P, or both, upgrades or downgrades the rating assigned to the Company. Each rating agency downgrade results in a

0.25%

increase in the interest rate, subject to a maximum increase of

1%

per rating agency. If later the rating of these notes improves, then the interest rates would be reduced accordingly. Each

0.25%

increase in the interest rate of these notes would increase the Company’s interest expense by approximately

$0.1 million

per quarter per

$100.0 million

of outstanding notes. The current rate in effect is

6.125%

.  Any future downgrades in the Company’s credit ratings could increase the cost of its existing credit and adversely affect the cost of and ability to obtain additional credit in the future.

On

August 15, 2014

, the Company purchased for cash approximately

$200.0 million

aggregate principal amount of its outstanding

6.125%

senior notes due

January 15, 2016

at a price equal to

of the principal amount, resulting in a premium to redeeming noteholders of approximately

$15.5 million

. The premium as well as the fees of

$1.1 million

associated with the redemption are included in interest expense on the condensed consolidated statement of operations as at

December 31, 2014

Accounts Receivable Securitization

On December 19, 2012, the Company entered into a

three

-year on-balance sheet trade accounts receivable securitization agreement (the "Securitization Facility"). On September 11, 2014, the Company made certain modifications to its Securitization Facility, which modifications, among other things, increased the aggregate borrowings available under the facility from

$300.0 million

to

$500.0 million

and decreased the interest margins on certain borrowings.  Under the terms of the Securitization Facility, certain subsidiaries of the Company sell at a discount certain of their trade accounts receivable (the “Receivables”) to Mohawk Factoring, LLC (“Factoring”) on a revolving basis.  Factoring is a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary of the Company, meaning that Factoring is a separate legal entity whose assets are available to satisfy the claims of the creditors of Factoring only, not the creditors of the Company or the Company’s other subsidiaries.  To fund such purchases, Factoring may borrow up to

$500.0 million

based on the amount of eligible Receivables owned by Factoring, and Factoring has granted a security interest in all of such Receivables to the third-party lending group as collateral for such borrowings.  Amounts loaned to Factoring under the Securitization Facility bear interest at commercial paper interest rates, in the case of lenders that are commercial paper conduits,



Index to Financial Statements

or LIBOR, in the case of lenders that are not commercial paper conduits, in each case, plus an applicable margin of

0.70%

per annum. Factoring also pays a commitment fee at a per annum rate of

0.35%

on the unused amount of each lender’s commitment.

At

December 31, 2014

, the amount utilized under the Securitization Facility was

$500.0 million

.

The Company may continue, from time to time, to retire its outstanding debt through cash purchases in the open market, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, the Company’s liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amount involved may be material.

As of

December 31, 2014

, the Company had cash of

$97.9 million

, of which

$76.8 million

was held outside the United States.  While the Company’s plans are to permanently reinvest the cash held outside the United States, the estimated cost of repatriation for the cash as of

December 31, 2014

was approximately

$26.9 million

. The Company believes that its cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash generated from operations and availability under its 2013 Senior Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet its capital expenditure, working capital and debt servicing requirements over the next twelve months.

The Company’s Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to

15 million

shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock. Since the inception of the program in 1999, a total of approximately

11.5 million

shares have been repurchased at an aggregate cost of approximately

$335.5 million

. All of these repurchases have been financed through the Company’s operations and banking arrangements.  For the year ended

December 31, 2014

, the Company repurchased approximately

2 thousand

shares at an average price of

$139.92

per share in connection with the exercise of stock options under the Company's 2012 Incentive Plan. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company repurchased approximately 1 thousand shares at an average price of $123.16 per share in connection with the exercise of stock options under the Company's 2012 Incentive Plan.

Contractual obligations

The following is a summary of the Company’s future minimum payments under contractual obligations as of

December 31, 2014

(in millions):

(1)

For fixed rate debt, the Company calculated interest based on the applicable rates and payment dates. For variable rate debt, the Company estimated average outstanding balances for the respective periods and applied interest rates in effect as of

December 31, 2014

to these balances.

(2)

Includes commitments for natural gas, electricity and raw material purchases.

(3)

Includes the estimated pension contributions for

Critical Accounting Policies

In preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the Company must make decisions which impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures. Such decisions include the selection of appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates. In reaching such decisions, the Company applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances and historical experience. Actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared.

The Company’s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. Some of those significant accounting policies require the Company to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.

The Company believes the following accounting policies require it to use judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and represent critical accounting policies.

•

Accounts receivable and revenue recognition.

Revenues are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred, the price has been fixed or is determinable, and collectability can be reasonably assured. The Company provides allowances for expected cash discounts, sales allowances, returns, claims and doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debt and claims experience and periodic evaluation of specific customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. A 10% change in the Company’s allowance for discounts, returns, claims and doubtful accounts would have affected net earnings by approximately

$4 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2014

.

•

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (net realizable value).

Cost has been determined using the first-in first-out method (“FIFO”). Costs included in inventory include raw materials, direct and indirect labor and employee benefits, depreciation, general manufacturing overhead and various other costs of manufacturing. Market, with respect to all inventories, is replacement cost or net realizable value. Inventories on hand are compared against anticipated future usage, which is a function of historical usage, anticipated future selling price, expected sales below cost, excessive quantities and an evaluation for obsolescence. Actual results could differ from assumptions used to value obsolete inventory, excessive inventory or inventory expected to be sold below cost and additional reserves may be required. A 10% change in the Company’s reserve for excess or obsolete inventory would have affected net earnings by approximately

$6 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2014

.

•

Goodwill and other intangibles.

Goodwill is tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances. The Company considers the relationship between its market capitalization and its book value, among other factors, when reviewing for indicators of impairment. The goodwill impairment tests are based on determining the fair value of the specified reporting units based on management judgments and assumptions using the discounted cash flows and comparable company market valuation approaches. The Company has identified Carpet, Ceramic, Laminate and Wood Flooring, Laminate and Wood Chipboard and Melamine, and Laminate and Wood Roofing as its reporting units for the purposes of allocating goodwill and intangibles as well as assessing impairments. The valuation approaches are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change such as judgments and assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”), and comparable company market multiples. When developing these key judgments and assumptions, the Company considers economic, operational and market conditions that could impact the fair value of the reporting unit. However, estimates are inherently uncertain and represent only management’s reasonable expectations regarding future developments. These estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will, in all likelihood, differ in some respects from actual future results. Should a significant or prolonged deterioration



Index to Financial Statements

in economic conditions occur, such as declines in spending for new construction, remodeling and replacement activities; the inability to pass increases in the costs of raw materials and fuel on to customers; or a decline in comparable company market multiples, then key judgments and assumptions could be impacted. Generally, a decline in estimated after tax cash flows of more than

23%

or a more than

15%

increase in WACC or a significant or prolonged decline in market capitalization could result in an additional indication of impairment.

The impairment test for intangible assets not subject to amortization involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, royalty rates, WACC and the amount of expected future cash flows. These judgments and assumptions are subject to the variability discussed above.

The impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets, which for the Company are its trademarks, is conducted during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. The determination of fair value used in the impairment evaluation is based on discounted estimates of future sales projections attributable to ownership of the trademarks. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, royalty rates, WACC and the amount of expected future cash flows. The judgments and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with past performance and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in operating plans. Such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. The determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the trademarks. Estimated cash flows are sensitive to changes in the economy among other things.

The Company reviews its long-lived asset groups, which include intangible assets subject to amortization, which for the Company are its patents and customer relationships, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset groups may not be recoverable. Recoverability of asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of long-lived assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by these asset groups. If such asset groups are considered to be impaired, the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs of disposal and are no longer depreciated.

The Company conducted its annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles in the fourth quarter and no impairment was indicated for


.

•

Income taxes.

The Company’s effective tax rate is based on its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company’s tax expense and in evaluating the Company’s tax positions. Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in a future period. The Company evaluates the recoverability of these future tax benefits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income inherently rely on estimates, including business forecasts and other projections of financial results over an extended period of time. In the event that the Company is not able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance is provided. The Company would recognize such amounts through a charge to income in the period in which that determination is made or when tax law changes are enacted. The Company had valuation allowances of

$300.5 million

in


,

$375.9 million

in


and

$321.6 million

in


. For further information regarding the Company’s valuation allowances, see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.

In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the Company’s income tax positions. The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the Company’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available as of the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information, as required by the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic ("ASC") 740-10. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. As of

December 31, 2014

, the Company has

$49.6 million

accrued for uncertain tax positions. For further information regarding the Company’s uncertain tax positions, see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.

Environmental and legal accruals.

Environmental and legal accruals are estimates based on judgments made by the Company relating to ongoing environmental and legal proceedings, as disclosed in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In determining whether a liability is probable and reasonably estimable, the Company consults with its internal experts. The Company believes that the amounts recorded in the accompanying financial statements are based on the best estimates and judgments available to it.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 1(s), “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies", of our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent accounting pronouncements including the dates, or expected dates of adoption, and effects, or expected effects, on our disclosures, results of operations, and financial condition.

Impact of Inflation

Inflation affects the Company’s manufacturing costs, distribution costs and operating expenses. The Company expects raw material prices, many of which are petroleum based, to fluctuate based upon worldwide supply and demand of commodities utilized in the Company’s production processes. Although the Company attempts to pass on increases in raw material, energy and fuel-related costs to its customers, the Company’s ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase, competitive pressures and market conditions for the Company’s products. There have been in the past, and may be in the future, periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be fully recovered. In the past, the Company has often been able to enhance productivity and develop new product innovations to help offset increases in costs resulting from inflation in its operations.

Seasonality

The Company is a calendar year-end company. With respect to its Carpet and Ceramic segments, its results of operations for the first quarter tend to be the weakest followed by the fourth quarter. The second and third quarters typically produce higher net sales and operating income in these segments. These results are primarily due to consumer residential spending patterns which have historically decreased during the holiday season and the first two months following. The Laminate and Wood segment’s second quarter typically produces the highest net sales and earnings followed by a moderate first and third quarter and a weaker forth quarter.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

The Company’s market risk is impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and certain commodity prices. Financial exposures to these risks are monitored as an integral part of the Company’s risk management program, which seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect that the volatility of these markets may have on its operating results. The Company does not regularly engage in speculative transactions, nor does it regularly hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The Company did not have any derivative contracts outstanding as of

December 31, 2014

and


.

Interest Rate Risk

As of

December 31, 2014

, approximately

55%

of the Company’s debt portfolio was comprised of fixed-rate debt and

45%

was floating-rate debt.  The Company believes that probable near-term changes in interest rates would not materially affect financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The annual impact on interest expense of a one-percentage point interest rate change on the outstanding balance of our variable rate debt as of December 31, 2014 would be approximately $10,000 or $.08 to diluted EPS.

Foreign Exchange Risk

As a result of being a global enterprise, there is exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect the operating results and financial condition of the Company.  Principal foreign currency exposures relate primarily to the euro and to a lesser extent the Russian ruble, the Mexican peso, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the British pound and the Malaysian ringgit.

The Company’s objective is to balance, where possible, non-functional currency denominated assets to non-functional currency denominated liabilities to have a natural hedge and minimize foreign exchange impacts. The Company enters into cross border transactions through importing and exporting goods to and from different countries and locations. These transactions


generate foreign exchange risk as they create assets, liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than their functional currency. This also applies to services provided and other cross border agreements among subsidiaries.

The Company takes steps to minimize risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through normal operating and financing activities.  The Company does not enter into any speculative positions with regard to derivative instruments.

Based on 2014 financial results for the year ended December 31, 2014, a hypothetical overall 10 percent change in the U.S. dollar against the euro and Russian ruble would have resulted in a translational adjustment of approximately $30 million.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Mohawk Industries, Inc.:

We have audited Mohawk Industries, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2014

, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Mohawk Industries, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as set forth in Item 9A. of Mohawk Industries, Inc.’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended

December 31, 2014

. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Mohawk Industries, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2014

, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Mohawk Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries as of

(In thousands, except per share data)

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a) Basis of Presentation

Mohawk Industries, Inc. (“Mohawk” or the “Company”), a term which includes the Company and its subsidiaries, is a leading global flooring manufacturer that creates products to enhance residential and commercial spaces around the world.  The Company's vertically integrated manufacturing and distribution processes provide competitive advantages in the production of carpet, rugs, ceramic tile, laminate, wood, stone and vinyl flooring.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

(b) Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.  As of

December 31, 2014

, the Company had cash of

$97,877

of which

$76,771

was held outside the United States.  As of

December 31, 2013

, the Company had cash of

$54,066

of which

$31,278

was held outside the United States.

(c) Accounts Receivable and Revenue Recognition

The Company is principally a carpet, rugs, ceramic tile, laminate and hardwood flooring manufacturer and sells carpet, rugs, ceramic tile, natural stone, hardwood, resilient and laminate flooring products in the U.S. and to a lesser extent, Europe and Russia principally for residential and commercial use.  The Company grants credit to customers, most of whom are retail-flooring dealers, home centers and commercial end users, under credit terms that the Company believes are customary in the industry.

Revenues, which are recorded net of taxes collected from customers, are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred, the price has been fixed or is determinable, and collectability can be reasonably assured. The Company provides allowances for expected cash discounts, returns, claims, sales allowances and doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debt and claims experience and periodic evaluations of specific customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable. Licensing revenues received from third parties for patents are recognized based on contractual agreements.

(d) Inventories

The Company accounts for all inventories on the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (net realizable value). Cost has been determined using the FIFO method. Costs included in inventory include raw materials, direct and indirect labor and employee benefits, depreciation, general manufacturing overhead and various other costs of manufacturing. Market, with respect to all inventories, is replacement cost or net realizable value. Inventories on hand are compared against anticipated future usage, which is a function of historical usage, anticipated future selling price, expected sales below cost, excessive quantities and an evaluation for obsolescence. Actual results could differ from assumptions used to value obsolete inventory, excessive inventory or inventory expected to be sold below cost and additional reserves may be required.

(e) Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, including capitalized interest. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated remaining useful lives, which are


-


years for buildings and improvements,


-


years for machinery and equipment, the shorter of the estimated useful life or lease term for leasehold improvements and


-


years for furniture and fixtures.

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

(f) Accounting for Business Combinations

The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting which requires it to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. While the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, the estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company records adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the Company's consolidated statements of operations.

(g) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

In accordance with the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification Topic ("ASC") 350,

“Intangibles-Goodwill and Other,”

the Company tests goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter (or on an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value). The Company considers the relationship between its market capitalization and its book value, among other factors, when reviewing for indicators of impairment. The goodwill impairment tests are based on determining the fair value of the specified reporting units based on management’s judgments and assumptions using the discounted cash flows and comparable company market valuation approaches. The Company has identified Carpet, Ceramic, Laminate and Wood Flooring, Laminate and Wood Chipboard and Melamine, and Laminate and Wood Roofing as its reporting units for the purposes of allocating goodwill and intangibles as well as assessing impairments. The valuation approaches are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change such as judgments and assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”), and comparable company market multiples.

When developing these key judgments and assumptions, the Company considers economic, operational and market conditions that could impact the fair value of the reporting unit. However, estimates are inherently uncertain and represent only management’s reasonable expectations regarding future developments. These estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will, in all likelihood, differ in some respects from actual future results. Should a significant or prolonged deterioration in economic conditions occur, such as continued declines in spending for new construction, remodeling and replacement activities; the inability to pass increases in the costs of raw materials and fuel on to customers; or a decline in comparable company market multiples, then key judgments and assumptions could be impacted.

The impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets, which for the Company are its trademarks, is conducted during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. During 2012, the Company adopted Accounting Standard Update No. 2011-08,

"Testing Goodwill for Impairment,"

and early adopted Accounting Standard Update No. 2012-02,

"Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment."

As a result, beginning in 2012, the first step of the impairment tests for our indefinite lived intangible assets is a thorough assessment of qualitative factors to determine the existence of events or circumstances that would indicate that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of these assets is less than their carrying amounts.  If the qualitative test indicates it is not more likely than not that the fair value of these assets is less than their carrying amounts, a quantitative assessment is not required.  If a quantitative test is necessary, the second step of our impairment test involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount.  The determination of fair value used in the impairment evaluation is based on discounted estimates of future sales projections attributable to ownership of the trademarks. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, royalty rates, WACC and the amount of expected future cash flows. The judgments and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with past performance and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans. Such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. The determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the trademarks. Estimated cash flows are sensitive to changes in the economy among other things.  If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

Intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives are amortized based on average lives, which range from


-


years.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

(h) Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized.  Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.  The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

(i) Financial Instruments

The Company’s financial instruments consist primarily of receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and long-term debt. The carrying amounts of receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair value because of the short-term maturity of such instruments. The carrying amount of the Company’s floating rate debt approximates its fair value based upon level two fair value hierarchy. Interest rates that are currently available to the Company for issuance of long-term debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate the fair value of the Company’s long-term debt.

(j) Advertising Costs and Vendor Consideration

Advertising and promotion expenses are charged to earnings during the period in which they are incurred. Advertising and promotion expenses included in selling, general, and administrative expenses were

$45,487

in


,

$42,627

in


and

$29,175

in


.

Vendor consideration, generally cash, is classified as a reduction of net sales, unless specific criteria are met regarding goods or services that the vendor may receive in return for this consideration. The Company makes various payments to customers, including slotting fees, advertising allowances, buy-downs and co-op advertising. All of these payments reduce gross sales with the exception of co-op advertising. Co-op advertising is classified as a selling, general and administrative expense in accordance with ASC 605-50. Co-op advertising expenses, a component of advertising and promotion expenses, were

$4,826

in


,

$4,307

in


and

$6,424

in


.

(k) Product Warranties

The Company warrants certain qualitative attributes of its flooring products. The Company has recorded a provision for estimated warranty and related costs, based on historical experience and periodically adjusts these provisions to reflect actual experience.

(l) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company reviews its long-lived asset groups, which include intangible assets subject to amortization, which for the Company are its patents and customer relationships, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset groups may not be recoverable. Recoverability of asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of long-lived assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by these asset groups. If such asset groups are considered to be impaired, the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs of disposal and are no longer depreciated.

(m) Foreign Currency Translation

Prior to the second quarter of 2012, operations carried out in Mexico used the U.S. Dollar as the functional currency. Effective April 1, 2012, the Company changed the functional currency of its Mexico operations to the Mexican Peso. The Company believes that the completion of a second plant in Mexico and growth in sales to the local Mexican market indicated a significant change in the economic facts and circumstances that justified the change in the functional currency.  The effects of the change in functional currency were not significant to the Company's consolidated financial statements.

The Company’s subsidiaries that operate outside the United States use their local currency as the functional currency. The functional currency is translated into U.S. Dollars for balance sheet accounts using the month end rates in effect as of the

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

balance sheet date and average exchange rate for revenue and expense accounts for each respective period. The translation adjustments are deferred as a separate component of stockholders’ equity, within accumulated other comprehensive income (deficit). Gains or losses resulting from transactions denominated in foreign currencies are included in other income or expense, within the consolidated statements of operations.

(n) Earnings per Share (“EPS”)

Basic net earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated using net earnings available to common stockholders divided by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is similar to basic EPS except that the weighted-average number of shares is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive common shares had been issued.

Dilutive common stock options are included in the diluted EPS calculation using the treasury stock method. Common stock options and unvested  restricted shares (units) that were not included in the diluted EPS computation because the price was greater than the average market price of the common shares for the periods presented were

and


for


,


and


, respectively.

Computations of basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations are presented in the following table:

(o) Stock-Based Compensation

The Company recognizes compensation expense for all share-based payments granted based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with ASC 718-10, “

Stock Compensation

”. Compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the awards' estimated lives for fixed awards with ratable vesting provisions.

(p) Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) includes foreign currency translation of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, effects of exchange rate changes on intercompany balances of a long-term nature and pensions. The Company does not provide income taxes on currency translation adjustments, as earnings from foreign subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely reinvested.

Effective January 1, 2013, the Company adopted recently issued accounting guidance that requires the Company to separately disclose, on a prospective basis, the change in each component of other comprehensive income (loss) relating to reclassification adjustments and current period other comprehensive income (loss).  As the guidance relates to presentation only, the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

The changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by component, net of tax, for years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


are as follows:

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

(1)  This accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component is included in the computation of net periodic pension cost (refer to Note 13).

(q) Self-Insurance Reserves

The Company is self-insured in the U.S. for various levels of general liability, auto liability, workers’ compensation and employee medical coverage. Insurance reserves, excluding workers' compensation, are calculated on an undiscounted basis based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed utilizing historical claim trends. Projected settlements and incurred but not reported claims are estimated based on pending claims and historical trends and data. Though the Company does not expect them to do so, actual settlements and claims could differ materially from those estimated. Material differences in actual settlements and claims could have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.

(r) Fiscal Year

The Company ends its fiscal year on December 31. Each of the first three quarters in the fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the calendar quarter end with a thirteen week fiscal quarter.

(s) Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity. Under ASU 2014-08, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations should be presented as discontinued operations. Those strategic shifts should have a major effect on the organization's operations and financial results. Additionally, ASU 2014-08 requires expanded disclosures about discontinued operations that will provide financial statement users with more information about the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of discontinued operations. ASU 2014-08 is effective for fiscal and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014. Accordingly, the Company plans to adopt the provisions of this new accounting standard at the beginning of fiscal year 2015, and is currently assessing the impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In  May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This topic converges the guidance within U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and international financial reporting standards and supersedes ASC 605, Revenue Recognition

.

The new standard requires companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard will also result in enhanced disclosures about revenue, provide guidance for transactions that were not previously addressed comprehensively, and improve guidance for multiple-element arrangements. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period and early application is not permitted. Accordingly, the Company plans to adopt the provisions of this new accounting standard at the beginning of fiscal year 2017, and is currently assessing the impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern" (Subtopic 205-40). This is intended to define management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organization's



Index to Financial Statements

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. For each reporting period, management will be required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about a company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date financial statements are issued. The amendments are effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted for annual or interim reporting periods for which the financial statements have not previously been issued.  The Company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on its financial statements.

(2) Acquisitions

Marazzi Acquisition

On

December 20, 2012

, the Company entered into a share purchase agreement (the “Share Purchase Agreement”) with LuxELIT S.á r.l., a Luxembourg limited liability company, and Finceramica S.p.A., an Italian corporation (collectively, “Sellers”), to acquire the shares of Fintiles S.p.A., an Italian corporation ("Marazzi").  On

April 3, 2013

, pursuant to the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, the Company completed the acquisition of Marazzi for an enterprise value of

$1,522,731

, including acquired indebtedness.  The Marazzi results are reflected in the Ceramic segment.

The equity value of Marazzi was paid to the Sellers in cash and in the Company's common stock (the “Shares”).  The number of Shares transferred as part of the consideration was calculated using the average closing price for the Company's common stock over a 30-day trading period ending March 19, 2013.

Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, the Company (i) acquired the entire issued share capital of Marazzi and (ii) acquired

$901,773

of indebtedness of Marazzi, in exchange for the following consideration:

•

A cash payment of

$307,052

; and

•

2,874

newly issued Shares for a value of

$313,906

.

The Company funded the cash portion of the Marazzi acquisition through a combination of proceeds from the

3.85%

Senior Notes, cash on hand and borrowings under the 2011 Senior Credit Facility.  The Company incurred

$15,660

of direct transaction costs, of which

$14,199

were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and

$1,461

were recorded in other expense for the year ended December 31, 2013.

The Marazzi acquisition positioned the Company as a global leader in ceramic tile.  The addition of Marazzi allowed the Company to expand its U.S. distribution, source ceramic tile from Europe, and provide industry leading innovation and design to all of its global ceramic customers.  The acquisition provides opportunities to improve performance by leveraging best practices, operational expertise, product innovation and manufacturing assets across the enterprise.

The following table summarizes the allocation of the aggregate purchase price of the Marazzi acquisition to the estimated fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed (in thousands):

Intangible assets subject to amortization of

$21,792

related to customer relationships have an estimated average life of

10 years

.  In addition to the amortizable intangible assets, there is an additional

$215,357

in indefinite-lived trademark intangible assets.  The goodwill of

$276,586

was allocated to the Ceramic segment.  The factors contributing to the recognition of the amount of goodwill are based on several strategic and synergistic benefits that are expected to be realized from the Marazzi acquisition.  These benefits include opportunities to improve the Company's ceramic performance by leveraging best practices, operational expertise, product innovation and manufacturing assets across the segment.  The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.  The fair value of inventories acquired included a step-up in the value of inventories of approximately

$31,041

which was charged to cost of sales during the year ended December 31, 2013.

The acquisition's results and a purchase price allocation have been included in the condensed consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition. The Company's acquisition of Spano resulted in a goodwill allocation of

$37,739

.  The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.  The factors contributing to the recognition of the amount of goodwill include the extension of the Company's customer base into new channels of distribution and the opportunity for synergies in manufacturing assets and processes, raw materials and operational efficiencies.  The Spano results are reflected in the Laminate and Wood segment.

Senior Credit Facility

On

September 25, 2013

, the Company entered into a

$1,000,000

,


-year, senior revolving credit facility (the "2013 Senior Credit Facility").  The 2013 Senior Credit Facility provides for a maximum of

$1,000,000

of revolving credit, including limited amounts of credit in the form of letters of credit and swingline loans. The Company paid financing costs of

$1,836

in connection with its 2013 Senior Credit Facility. These costs were deferred and, along with unamortized costs of

$11,440

related to the Company’s 2011 Credit Facility, are being amortized over the term of the 2013 Senior Credit Facility.

At the Company's election, revolving loans under the 2013 Senior Credit Facility bear interest at annual rates equal to either (a) LIBOR for 1, 2, 3 or 6 month periods, as selected by the Company, plus an applicable margin ranging between

1.00%

and

1.75%

, or (b) the higher of the Wells Fargo Bank, National Association prime rate, the Federal Funds rate plus

0.5%

, and a monthly LIBOR rate plus

1.0%

, plus an applicable margin ranging between

0.00%

and

0.75%

. The Company also pays a commitment fee to the Lenders under the 2013 Senior Credit Facility on the average amount by which the aggregate commitments of the Lenders' exceed utilization of the 2013 Senior Credit Facility ranging from

0.125%

to

0.25%

per annum.  The applicable interest rate and the commitment fee are determined based on whichever of the Company's Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio or its senior unsecured debt rating (or if not available, corporate family rating) results in the lower applicable margins and commitment fee (with applicable margins and the commitment fee increasing as that ratio increases or those ratings decline, as applicable).

The obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries in respect of the 2013 Senior Credit Facility are unsecured.

If at any time (a) both (i) the Moody's Rating is Ba2 and (ii) the S&P Rating is BB, (b) (i) the Moody's Rating is Ba3 or lower and (ii) the S&P Rating is below BBB- (with a stable outlook or better) or (c) (i) the Moody's Rating is below Baa3 (with a stable outlook or better) and (ii) the S&P Rating is BB- or lower, the obligations of the Company and the other Borrowers under the 2013 Senior Credit Facility will be required to be guaranteed by all of the Company's material domestic subsidiaries and all obligations of Borrowers that are foreign subsidiaries will be required to be guaranteed by those foreign subsidiaries of the Company which the Company designates as guarantors.

The 2013 Senior Credit Facility includes certain affirmative and negative covenants that impose restrictions on the Company's financial and business operations, including limitations on liens, indebtedness, investments, fundamental changes, asset dispositions, dividends and other similar restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, payments and modifications of certain existing debt, future negative pledges, and changes in the nature of the Company's business. Many of these limitations are subject to numerous exceptions. The Company is also required to maintain a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of at least

3.0

to 1.0 and a Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of no more than

3.75

to 1.0, each as of the last day of any fiscal quarter.

The 2013 Senior Credit Facility also contains customary representations and warranties and events of default, subject to customary grace periods.

The 2013 Senior Credit Facility is scheduled to mature on

September 25, 2018

.  However, the maturity date will accelerate, resulting in the acceleration of any unamortized deferred financing costs, to

October 16, 2015

, if on that date any of the Company's

6.125%

notes due

January 15, 2016

remains outstanding and the Company has not delivered to the Administrative Agent a certificate demonstrating that, after giving pro forma effect to the repayment in cash in full on that date of all of the

6.125%

notes that remain outstanding, the amount the Company would be permitted to draw under the 2013 Senior Credit Facility, together with the aggregate consolidated amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of the Company, would exceed

$200,000

.  While there can be no assurance, the Company currently believes that if any of the

6.125%

notes remains outstanding on

October 16, 2015

, the amount the Company would be permitted to draw under the 2013 Senior Credit Facility, together with the aggregate consolidated amount of the Company’s unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, would exceed

$200,000

on

October 16, 2015

.

As of

December 31, 2014

, amounts utilized under the facility included

$195,665

of borrowings and

$37,381

of standby letters of credit related to various insurance contracts and foreign vendor commitments.  The Company also considers the outstanding borrowings of

$301,600

as of

December 31, 2014

under its commercial paper program to be a reduction of the available capacity.  Taking the commercial paper borrowings into consideration, the Company has utilized

$534,646

under the 2013 Senior Credit Facility resulting in a total of

$465,354

available under the 2013 Senior Credit Facility.

Senior Notes

On January 31, 2013, the Company issued

$600,000

aggregate principal amount of

3.85%

Senior Notes due

February 1, 2023

.  The Company paid financing costs of

$6,000

in connection with the

3.85%

Senior Notes. These costs were deferred and are being amortized over the term of the

3.85%

Senior Notes.

On January 17, 2006, the Company issued

$900,000

aggregate principal amount of

6.125%

notes due

January 15, 2016

. Interest payable on these notes is subject to adjustment if either Moody’s or S&P, or both, upgrades or downgrades the rating assigned to the Company. Each rating agency downgrade results in a

0.25%

increase in the interest rate, subject to a maximum increase of

1%

per rating agency. If later the rating of these notes improves, then the interest rates would be reduced accordingly. Each

0.25%

increase in the interest rate of these notes would increase the Company’s interest expense by approximately

$63

per quarter per

$100,000

of outstanding notes. The current rate in effect is

6.125%

.  Any future downgrades in the Company’s credit ratings could increase the cost of its existing credit and adversely affect the cost of and ability to obtain additional credit in the future.

On

August 15, 2014

, the Company purchased for cash approximately

$200,000

aggregate principal amount of its outstanding

6.125%

senior notes due

January 15, 2016

at a price equal to

107.73%

of the principal amount, resulting in a premium to redeeming noteholders of approximately

$15,450

and fees of

$1,080

associated with the redemption.  The premium as well as the fees are included in interest expense on the condensed consolidated statement of operations as at

December 31, 2014

.

On November 3, 2014, the Company purchased for cash approximately

$54,400

aggregate principal amount of its outstanding

6.125%

senior notes due January 15, 2016 at a price equal to

106.38%

. The premium is included in interest expense on the condensed consolidated statement of operations as at

December 31, 2014

.

Accounts Receivable Securitization

On December 19, 2012, the Company entered into a

three

-year on-balance sheet trade accounts receivable securitization agreement (the "Securitization Facility"). On September 11, 2014, the Company made certain modifications to its Securitization Facility, which modifications, among other things, increased the aggregate borrowings available under the facility from

$300,000

to

$500,000

and decreased the interest margins on certain borrowings.  Under the terms of the Securitization Facility, certain subsidiaries of the Company sell at a discount certain of their trade accounts receivable (the “Receivables”) to Mohawk Factoring, LLC (“Factoring”) on a revolving basis.  The Company has determined that Factoring is a bankruptcy remote subsidiary, meaning that Factoring is a separate legal entity whose assets are available to satisfy the claims of the creditors of Factoring only, not the creditors of the Company or the Company’s other subsidiaries.  Factoring may borrow up to

$500,000

based on the amount of eligible Receivables owned by Factoring, and Factoring has granted a security interest in all of such Receivables to the third-party lending group as collateral for such borrowings.  Amounts loaned to Factoring under the Securitization Facility bear interest at commercial paper interest rates, in the case of lenders that are commercial paper conduits, or LIBOR, in the case of lenders that are not commercial paper conduits, in each case, plus an applicable margin of

0.70%

per annum. Factoring also pays a commitment fee at a per annum rate of

0.35%

on the unused amount of each lender’s commitment.  At

December 31, 2014

, the amount utilized under the Securitization Facility was

$500,000

Under the Company’s 2012 Incentive Plan (“2012 Plan”), the Company's principal stock compensation plan as of May 9, 2012, the Company reserved up to a maximum of

3,200

shares of common stock for issuance upon the grant or exercise of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and other types of awards, to directors and key employees through

December 31, 2022

. Option awards are granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant and generally vest between

three

and

five

years with a


-year contractual term. Restricted stock and RSUs are granted with a price equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant and generally vest between

three

and

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

The fair value of option awards is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock and other factors. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and forfeiture rates within the valuation model. Optionees that exhibit similar option exercise behavior are segregated into separate groups within the valuation model. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of the grant for the expected term of the award.

(13) Employee Benefit Plans

The Company has a 401(k) retirement savings plan (the “Mohawk Plan”) open to substantially all U.S. and Puerto Rico based employees who have completed


days of eligible service. The Company contributes

$.50

for every

$1.00

of employee contributions up to a maximum of

6%

of the employee’s salary based upon each individual participants election. Employee and employer contributions to the Mohawk Plan were

The Company also has various pension plans covering employees in Belgium, France, and the Netherlands (the “Non-U.S. Plans”) within the Laminate and Wood segment. Benefits under the Non-U.S. Plans depend on compensation and years of service.  The Non-U.S. Plans are funded in accordance with local regulations.  For 2014, the Company determined that the Belgian pension plan no longer qualified as a defined benefit plan.  As a result, the activity for the Belgian pension plan has not been included in the following reported results for the year ended December 31, 2014. The Company uses December 31 as the measurement date for its Non-U.S. Plans.

Components of the net periodic benefit cost of the Non-U.S. Plans are as follows:

The discount rate assumptions used to account for pension obligations reflect the rates at which the Company believes these obligations will be effectively settled. In developing the discount rate, the Company evaluated input from its actuaries, including estimated timing of obligation payments and yield on investments. The rate of compensation increase for the Non-U.S. Plans is based upon the Company’s annual reviews.

The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of

December 31, 2014

and


are presented below:

(1)

This amount includes

$6,027

and

$9,183

of non-current deferred tax assets which are in deferred income taxes and other non-current assets and

$9,090

and

$11,235

current deferred tax liabilities which are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets as of

December 31, 2014

and


, respectively.

The Company evaluates its ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing its forecasted taxable income using both historic and projected future operating results, the reversal of existing temporary differences, taxable income in prior carry-back years (if permitted) and the availability of tax planning strategies. The valuation allowance as of

December 31, 2014

, and


is

$300,472

and

$375,859

, respectively. The valuation allowance as of

December 31, 2014

relates to the net deferred tax assets of certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries as well as certain state net operating losses and tax credits. The total change in the


valuation allowance was a decrease of

$75,387

which includes (

$39,243

) related to foreign currency translation and

($61,148)

related to the disposal of a subsidiary.  The total change in the


valuation allowance was an increase of

$54,274

, which includes

$12,471

related to foreign currency translation.

Management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, based upon the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities and the level of historic and forecasted taxable income over periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible.

As of

December 31, 2014

, the Company has state net operating loss carry forwards and state tax credits with potential tax benefits of

$65,041

, net of federal income tax benefit; these carry forwards expire over various periods based on taxing jurisdiction. A valuation allowance totaling

$51,987

has been recorded against these state deferred tax assets as of

December 31, 2014

. In addition, as of

December 31, 2014

, the Company has net operating loss carry forwards in various foreign jurisdictions with potential tax benefits of

$367,864

. A valuation allowance totaling

$189,883

has been recorded against these deferred tax assets as of

December 31, 2014

.

The Company does not provide for U.S. federal and state income taxes on the cumulative undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are deemed to be permanently reinvested. As of

December 31, 2014

, the Company had not provided federal income taxes on earnings of approximately

$1,385,000

from its foreign subsidiaries. Should these earnings be distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to both U.S. income taxes and withholding taxes in various foreign jurisdictions. These taxes may be partially offset by U.S. foreign tax credits. Determination of the amount

of the unrecognized deferred U.S. tax liability is not practical because of the complexities associated with this hypothetical calculation.

Tax Uncertainties

In the normal course of business, the Company’s tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing jurisdictions. Accordingly, the Company accrues liabilities when it believes that it is not more likely than not that it will realize the benefits of tax positions that it has taken in its tax returns or for the amount of any tax benefit that exceeds the cumulative probability threshold in accordance with ASC 740-10. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest and penalties in income tax expense (benefit). Differences between the estimated and actual amounts determined upon ultimate resolution, individually or in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position but could possibly be material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations or cash flow in any given quarter or annual period.

As of

December 31, 2014

, the Company’s gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits is

$49,599

, excluding interest and penalties. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions,

$22,490

of the unrecognized tax benefits would affect the Company’s effective tax rate, exclusive of any benefits related to interest and penalties.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

The Company will continue to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of its income tax provision. As of

December 31, 2014

and


, the Company has

$9,409

and

$13,890

, respectively, accrued for the payment of interest and penalties, excluding the federal tax benefit of interest deductions where applicable. During the years ending

December 31, 2014

,


and


, the Company accrued interest and penalties through the consolidated statements of operations of

$(3,579)

,

$74

and

$(1,585)

, respectively.

The Company believes that its unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by

$14,746

within the next twelve months.  The Company has effectively settled all Federal income tax matters related to years prior to 2010.  Various other state and foreign income tax returns are open to examination for various years.

In January 2012, the Company received a

€23,789

assessment from the Belgian tax authority related to its year ended December 31, 2008, asserting that the Company had understated its Belgian taxable income for that year. The Company filed a formal protest in the first quarter of 2012 refuting the Belgian tax authority's position.  The Belgian tax authority set aside the assessment in the third quarter of 2012 and refunded all related deposits, including interest income of

€1,583

earned on such deposits. However, on October 23, 2012, the Belgian tax authority notified the Company of its intent to increase the Company's taxable income for the year ended December 31, 2008 under a revised theory.

However, on December 28, 2012, the Belgian tax authority issued assessments for the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2009, in the amounts of

€46,135

and

€35,567

, respectively, including penalties, but excluding interest. The Company filed a formal protest during the first quarter of 2013 relating to the new assessments. In September 2013, the Belgian tax authority denied the Company's protests, and the Company has brought these two years before the Court of First Instance in Bruges.



Index to Financial Statements

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

In December 2013, the Belgian tax authority issued additional assessments related to the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007, and 2010, in the amounts of

€38,817

,

€39,635

, and

€43,117

, respectively, including penalties, but excluding interest.  The Company filed formal protests during the first quarter of 2014, refuting the Belgian tax authority's position for each of the years assessed.  In the quarter ended June 28, 2014, the Company received a formal assessment for the year ended December 31, 2008, totaling

€30,131

, against which the Company also submitted its formal protest. All 4 additional years have been brought before the Court of First Appeal in November 2014.

In January of 2015, the Company met with the Court of First Appeal in Bruges and agreed with the Belgium tax authorities to consolidate and argue the issues regarding the years 2005 and 2009, and apply the ruling to all of the open years (to the extent there are no additional facts/procedural arguments in the other years).

The Company continues to disagree with the views of the Belgian tax authority on this matter and will persist in its vigorous defense. Although there can be no assurances, the Company believes the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition but could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, liquidity or cash flows in a given quarter or year.

(16) Commitments and Contingencies

The Company is obligated under various operating leases for office and manufacturing space, machinery, and equipment. Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable capital and operating leases (with initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year) as of December 31:

Rental expense under operating leases was

December 31, 2014

and


, respectively that expire within

years.

The Company is involved in litigation from time to time in the regular course of its business. Except as noted below, there are no material legal proceedings pending or known by the Company to be contemplated to which the Company is a party or to which any of its property is subject.

Beginning in August 2010, a series of civil lawsuits were initiated in several U.S. federal courts alleging that certain manufacturers of polyurethane foam products and competitors of the Company’s carpet underlay division had engaged in price fixing in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The Company has been named as a defendant in a number of the individual cases (the first filed on August 26, 2010), as well as in

two

consolidated amended class action complaints the first filed on February 28, 2011, on behalf of a class of all direct purchasers of polyurethane foam products, and the second filed on March 21, 2011, on behalf of a class of indirect purchasers. All pending cases in which the Company has been named as a defendant have been filed in or transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio for consolidated pre-trial proceedings under the name

In re: Polyurethane Foam Antitrust Litigation, Case No. 1:10-MDL-02196.



Index to Financial Statements

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

In these actions, the plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and/or a class of purchasers, seek damages allegedly suffered as a result of alleged overcharges in the price of polyurethane foam products from at least 1999 to the present. The direct purchaser class currently claims damages from all of the defendants named in the lawsuit of up to approximately

$867,400

which amount will be reduced by the value of claims made by plaintiffs that opt out of the class. Any damages actually awarded at trial are subject to being tripled under US antitrust laws.  The amount of damages in the remaining cases varies or has not yet been specified by the plaintiffs.  Each plaintiff also seeks attorney fees, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, court costs and injunctive relief against future violations.

In April 2011, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the class action claims brought by the direct purchasers, and in May 2011, the Company moved to dismiss the claims brought by the indirect purchasers. On July 19, 2011, the Court denied all defendants’ motions to dismiss. On April 9, 2014, the Court certified the direct and indirect purchaser classes. The Company sought permission to appeal the certification order on April 24, 2014, and the petition was denied by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on September 29, 2014.  The Company has appealed the District Court’s certification order to the United States Supreme Court; this appeal is pending.  Fact discovery in almost all cases is now complete and, in August 2014, the Company and other defendants filed motions for summary judgment against the direct purchaser class.  In February 2015, the Court denied all summary judgment motions.  The first trial (for the direct purchaser class action) is scheduled to begin on March 31, 2015.

In December 2011, the Company was named as a defendant in a Canadian Class action,

Hi! Neighbor Floor Covering Co. Limited v. Hickory Springs Manufacturing Company, et al

., filed in the Superior Court of Justice of Ontario, Canada and

Options Consommateures v. Vitafoam, Inc. et.al.

, filed in the Superior Court of Justice of Quebec, Montreal, Canada, both of which allege similar claims against the Company as raised in the U.S. actions and seek unspecified damages and punitive damages. The Company denies all of the allegations in these actions and will vigorously defend itself.  The Company has reached an agreement in principle to settle the Canadian actions, but the settlement has not yet been finalized.

The Company believes that adequate provisions for resolution of all contingencies, claims and pending litigation have been made for probable losses that are reasonably estimable.  These contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and we are unable to estimate the amount or range of loss, if any, in excess of amounts accrued.  The Company does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition but could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, cash flows or liquidity in a given quarter or year.

The Company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use, storage, treatment, recycling and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and finished product, and the cleanup of contamination associated therewith. Because of the nature of the Company’s business, the Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs relating to compliance with such laws and regulations. The Company is involved in various proceedings relating to environmental matters and is currently engaged in environmental investigation, remediation and post-closure care programs at certain sites. The Company has provided accruals for such activities that it has determined to be both probable and reasonably estimable. The Company does not expect that the ultimate liability with respect to such activities will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition but could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, cash flows or liquidity in a given quarter or year.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), which have been designed to provide reasonable assurance that such controls and procedures will meet their objectives, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that such controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level for the period covered by this report.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).  The Company maintains internal control over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting determined to be effective provides only reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

The Company's management assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. This evaluation included an assessment of the design of the Company’s internal control over financial



Index to Financial Statements

reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2014

.  The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2014

has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report which is included herein.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls

The Company’s management recognizes that a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
