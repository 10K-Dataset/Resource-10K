Item 1.

Business

General

Mohawk
Industries, Inc. ("Mohawk" or the "Company", a term which
includes the Company and its subsidiaries, including its primary operating
subsidiaries, Mohawk Carpet Corporation, Aladdin Manufacturing Corporation and
Dal-Tile International Inc. ("Dal-Tile")) is the leading producer of
floorcovering products for residential and commercial applications in the
United States. The Company is the second largest carpet and rug manufacturer,
and a leading manufacturer, marketer and distributor of ceramic tile and
natural stone, in the United States. The Company had annual net sales in 2003
in excess of $5.0 billion.

The
Company has two operating segments, the Mohawk segment and the Dal-Tile
segment. The Mohawk segment sells and distributes its product lines, which
include broadloom carpet, rugs, pad, ceramic tile, hardwood, vinyl and laminate
through independent floor covering retailers, home centers, mass merchandisers,
department stores, commercial dealers and commercial end users. The Dal-Tile
segment product lines include ceramic tile, porcelain tile and stone products
sold through company-operated sales service centers, independent distributors
and home center retailers. Selected financial information for the Mohawk and
Dal-Tile segments is set forth in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Through
the Company's Mohawk segment, the Company designs, manufactures and markets
carpet and rugs in a broad range of colors, textures and patterns and is a
leading producer of woven and tufted broadloom carpet and rugs for residential
and commercial applications. The Company also markets and distributes hardwood,
laminate, vinyl and ceramic tile under its hardsurface line. The Company
positions its products in all price ranges and emphasizes quality, style,
performance and service. The Company is widely recognized through its premier
brand names, which include "Mohawk," "Aladdin,"
"Mohawk Home," "Bigelow," "Custom Weave,"
"Durkan," "Goodwin Weavers," "Helios,"
"Horizon," "Karastan," "Lees," "Newmark
Rug," "World" and "WundaWeve." The Company markets and
distributes its carpet and rug products through over 34,000 customers, which
include primarily independent carpet retailers, home centers, mass
merchandisers, department stores, commercial dealers and commercial end users.
Some products are also marketed through private labeling programs. The
Company's carpet and rug operations are vertically integrated from the
extrusion of resin and post-consumer plastics into fiber, to the conversion of
fiber into yarn and to the manufacture and shipment of finished carpet and
rugs.

Through
the Company's Dal-Tile segment, the Company designs, manufactures and markets a
broad line of wall and floor tile products used in the residential and
commercial markets for both new construction and remodeling. Most of the
Company's ceramic tile products are marketed under the "Dal-Tile" and
"American Olean" brand names. The Company's ceramic tile business is
organized into three strategic business channels: company-operated sales service
centers,
independent distributors and home centers. The Company maintains over
240 sales service centers in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. The
Company's independent distributor unit distributes the American Olean brand
through approximately 200 independent distributor locations serving a variety
of residential and commercial customers. The Company's home center retailer
unit supplies products to more than 2,000 home center retail outlets operating
in the do-it-yourself and buy-it-yourself markets. Each business unit has a
dedicated sales force supporting that unit.

On
November 10, 2003, the Company acquired the assets and assumed certain
liabilities of the commercial carpet division of Burlington Industries, Inc.
known as Lees Carpet, from W.L. Ross & Company for approximately $350 million
in cash. The results of operations of Lees Carpet have been included with the
Mohawk segment results and in the Company's consolidated financial statements
since that date. The primary reason for the acquisition was to expand the
Company's presence in the commercial carpet market.


On
March 20, 2002, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of
Dal-Tile, a leading manufacturer and distributor of ceramic tile in the United
States for approximately $1,469 million, consisting of approximately 12.9
million shares of the Company's common stock, options to purchase approximately
2.1 million shares of the Company's common stock and $718 million in cash. The
Company's common stock and options were valued at $751 million based on the
measurement date stock price of $55.04 per share ($710.4 million) and the
estimated fair value of options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
($40.3 million). The transaction has been accounted for using the purchase
method of accounting and, accordingly, the results of operations of Dal-Tile
have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from
March 20, 2002. The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based upon estimated fair values at the date of
acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net
identifiable assets acquired of approximately $1,168.3 million was recorded as
goodwill. The primary reason for the acquisition was to expand the Company's
presence in the ceramic tile and stone markets.

Industry

The
floorcovering industry has grown from $12.4 billion in sales in 1992 to $20.3
billion in 2002. In 2002, the primary categories of the United States
floorcovering industry were carpet and rugs (65%), ceramic tile (12%), vinyl
and rubber (10%), hardwood (9%) and laminate (4%). Each of these categories has
been positively impacted by:

U.S.
     population growth, requiring new and renovated housing and commercial
     space;

increasing average house size; and

growth in housing starts and housing resales.

Compound
average growth rates for units sold (measured by square yards) for each of the
floorcovering categories above for the period from 1992 through 2002, with the
exception of the vinyl and rubber category, have met or exceeded the growth
rate for both the gross domestic product of the United States and housing
starts over the same period. During this period, the compound average growth
rate was 3.6% for carpet and rugs, 10.3% for ceramic tile, 1.3% for vinyl and
rubber and 8.0% for hardwood. Laminate, which is a relatively new product,
experienced a compound average growth rate of 41.5% from 1996 through 2002.

According
to the most recent figures available from the United States Department of
Commerce, worldwide carpet and rug sales volume of American manufacturers and
their domestic divisions was 1.9 billion square yards in 2002. This volume
represents a market in excess of approximately $12 billion. The overall level
of sales in the carpet industry is influenced by a number of factors, including
consumer confidence, spending for durable goods, interest rates, turnover in
housing, the condition of the residential and commercial construction
industries and the overall strength of the economy.

Broadloom
carpet, defined as carpet over six feet by nine feet in size, represented 73%
of the amounts shipped by the industry in 2002. Tufted broadloom carpet, a
category that refers to the manner of construction in addition to size,
represented 86.0% of the broadloom industry volume shipped in 2002. The
broadloom carpet industry has two primary markets, residential and commercial,
with the residential market making up approximately 75% of industry amounts
shipped in 2002 and the commercial market comprising approximately 25%. An
estimated 50% of industry shipments are made in response to replacement demand,
which usually involves exact yardage, or "cut order," shipments that
typically provide higher profit margins than sales of carpet sold in full
rolls. Because the replacement business generally involves higher quality
carpet cut to order by the manufacturer, rather than the dealer, this business
tends to be more profitable for manufacturers than the new construction
business.

The
United States ceramic tile industry shipped 2.6 billion square feet, or $2.3
billion, in 2002. The compound average growth rate of dollar shipments was 8.0%
from 1992 through 2002 for ceramic tile. Sales in the ceramic tile industry are
influenced by the same factors that influence the carpet industry, including
consumer confidence, spending for durable goods, interest rates, turnover in
housing, the condition of the residential and commercial construction
industries and the overall strength of the economy.

The
ceramic tile industry's two primary markets, residential applications and
commercial applications, represent 62.0% and 36.0% of the industry total,
respectively. Of the total residential market, 67% of the dollar shipments are
for new construction.


Sales and Distribution

Mohawk Segment

.

Through
the Company's Mohawk segment, the Company designs, manufactures and markets
hundreds of styles of carpet and rugs in a broad range of colors, textures and
patterns. In addition, the Mohawk segment markets and distributes ceramic tile,
laminate, hardwood and vinyl floor covering. The Mohawk segment positions its
products in all price ranges and emphasizes quality, style, performance and
service. The Company markets and distributes carpet and rugs through over
34,000 customers, which include independent floor covering retailers, home
centers, mass merchandisers, department stores, commercial dealers, and
commercial end users. Some products are also marketed through private labeling
programs. Sales to residential customers represent a significant portion of the
total industry and the majority of the Company's carpet and rug sales.

The
Company has positioned its premier residential carpet and rug brand names
across all price ranges. "Mohawk," "Custom Weave,"
"WundaWeve," "Galaxy," "Horizon,"
"Helios" and "Karastan" are positioned to sell primarily in
the medium-to-high retail price range in the residential broadloom market, and
these lines are also sold under private labels. These lines have substantial
brand name recognition among carpet dealers and retailers with the
"Karastan," and "Mohawk" brands having the highest consumer
recognition in the industry. "Karastan" is the leader in the
exclusive high-end market. The "Aladdin" and "World" brand
names compete primarily in the low-to-medium retail price range.

The
Company offers marketing and advertising support through dealer programs like
Karastan Gallery, ColorCenter and Floorscapes. These programs offer varying
degrees of support to dealers in the form of sales and management training,
merchandising systems, exclusive promotions and assistance in certain
administrative functions such as consumer credit, advertising and insurance.

The
Company's sales forces are generally organized based on product type and sales
channels in order to best serve each type of customer. A hub-and-spoke
distribution network accomplishes the product distribution on a regional level.
In this system, the Company's trucks generally deliver product from
manufacturing and central distribution sites to regional warehouses. From
there, it is shipped to retailers or to local distribution warehouses, then to
retailers.

The
commercial customer base is divided into several channels: educational
institutions, corporate office space, hospitality facilities, retail space and
health care facilities. In addition, the Company produces and sells carpet for
the export market, the federal government and other niche businesses. Different
purchase decision makers and decision-making processes exist for each channel.

The
Company's "Aladdin" commercial brand is sold primarily through retail
dealers to customers in the retail space, corporate office and other channels.
This sales channel is also commonly referred to as "Main Street."
These customers are more price conscious in their purchase decisions. The
"Bigelow Commercial" brand is sold primarily to commercial office and
retail channels through commercial flooring contractors. The "Mohawk
Commercial" brand is marketed to customers in the educational
institutional and health care facility channels that are performance oriented.
The "Lees" brand is positioned at the higher price points within each
sales channel. The "Dura-Color" stain resistant technology and "Unibond"
performance backing system enables the "Lees" brand to provide a
differentiated product within each sales channel. Additionally, the Company
markets its modular (carpet tile) product lines under the "Lees"
brand. The "Karastan Contract" and "Durkan Commercial"
brands are positioned primarily to service the medium to high-end fashion
conscious customer in both the retail and corporate office channels. The
"Durkan Hospitality" brand specializes in carpet sold through the
hospitality channel to hotels, resorts and casinos.

The
Company believes its ability to make woven carpet under the "Mohawk
Commercial" and "Karastan Contract" brand names in large volume
for commercial applications differentiates it from other manufacturers, most of
which produce tufted carpet almost exclusively. Woven carpet, and specifically
the Company's woven interlock products, provides unique characteristics that
delivers a better value to the customer and the Company. The Company believes
that it is one of the largest producers of woven carpet in the United States
and that it has several carpet weaving machines and processes that no other
manufacturer has, thereby allowing it to create carpet to meet specifications
that its competitors cannot duplicate.


The
Mohawk Home Division, markets its product lines under two major brand names,
"Mohawk Home" and "Karastan." Mohawk Home's affordable
price points strategy for the mainstream retailers and home centers is directed
at the mid and lower retail price ranges, while the "Karastan" brand
is directed at upscale retail and flooring stores. Product categories are
diverse, including woven wool rugs, polypropylene woven and tufted rugs,
printed and woven nylon rugs, doormats, washable bath rugs, decorative throws
and pillows, woven bedspreads, textile wall hangings and blankets.

Dal-Tile Segment

.

The
Dal-Tile segment's ceramic tile and natural stone products are distributed
through three separate distribution channels consisting of company-operated
sales service centers, independent distributors and home centers. The business
is organized to address the specific customer needs of each distribution
channel. A dedicated sales force supports each channel.

The
Company has four regional distribution centers strategically located in
California, Maryland, Texas and Florida. These centers help the Company create
high-quality customer service by focusing on shorter lead times, increased
order fill rates and improved on-time deliveries to its customers. These
distribution centers also enhance the Company's ability to plan and schedule
production and manage inventory requirements.

The
Company's network of over 240 sales service centers located in the United
States, Canada and Puerto Rico distributes primarily the Daltile brand product,
serving customers in all 50 states and portions of Canada and Puerto Rico.

The
Company serves as a "one-stop" source that provides customers with
one of the ceramic tile industry's broadest product lines-a complete selection
of glazed floor tile, glazed wall tile, glazed and unglazed ceramic mosaic
tile, porcelain tile, quarry tile and stone products, as well as allied
products. In addition to products manufactured by the Company's ceramic tile
business, the Company carries a selection of products purchased from other
manufacturers to provide customers with a broader product line.

The
independent distributor channel offers a unique product line under the
"American Olean" brand. Currently, the "American Olean"
brand is distributed through approximately 200 independent distributor
locations that service a variety of residential and commercial customers. The
Company is focused on increasing its presence in the independent distributor
channel, particularly in tile products that are most commonly used in flooring
applications.

The
Company believes its Dal-Tile segment is one of the U.S. ceramic tile
industry's largest suppliers to the do-it-yourself and buy-it-yourself markets
through home center retailers, such as The Home Depot and Lowe's. The home
center channel is expected to continue presenting important growth
opportunities.

The
Company believes that it has two of the leading brand names in the U.S. ceramic
tile industry-"Daltile" and "American Olean." The roots of
the "Daltile" and "American Olean" brand names date back
approximately fifty and seventy-five years, respectively.

The
Company's sales service centers primarily distribute the "Daltile"
brand, with a fully integrated marketing program, emphasizing a focus on quality
and fashion.
The broad product offering satisfies the needs of its residential, commercial
and builder customers. The "American Olean" brand consists of a full
product offering and is distributed primarily through independent distributors.
Both these brands are supported by a fully integrated marketing program,
including public relations efforts, displays, merchandising (sample boards,
chip chests), literature/catalogs and an Internet website.

Advertising and Promotion

The
Company promotes its brands through national advertising in both television and
print media as well as in the form of cooperative advertising, point-of-sale
displays and marketing literature provided to assist in marketing various
carpet and ceramic tile styles. The Company also continues to rely on the
substantial brand name recognition of its product lines. The cost of producing
display samples, a significant promotional expense, is partially offset by
sales of samples and support from suppliers in the carpet and rug business.


Manufacturing and Operations

Carpet
and Rugs Business.

The Company's manufacturing operations are vertically
integrated and include the extrusion of resin and post-consumer plastics into
polypropylene, polyester and nylon fiber, yarn processing, tufting, weaving,
dyeing, coating and finishing. Capital expenditures are primarily focused on
increasing capacity, improving productivity and reducing costs. Over the past
three years, the Company has incurred capital expenditures that have helped
increase manufacturing efficiency and capacity, and improve overall cost
competitiveness.

Ceramic
Tile Business.

Over the past three years, the Dal-Tile segment has invested
in capital expenditures, principally for new plants and state-of-the-art
fast-fire equipment to increase manufacturing capacity, improve efficiency and
develop new capabilities. In addition, the Company has added a porcelain tile
manufacturing plant, which will significantly expand its production capacity in
2004.

The
ceramic tile business commenced operations in Mexico at the Company's Monterrey
facility in 1955 and currently manufactures products at this facility primarily
for U.S. consumption. The Monterrey location produces ceramic tile, frit
(ground glass) and refractories.

The
Company believes that its manufacturing organization offers competitive
advantages due to its ability to manufacture a differentiated product line
consisting of one of the industry's broadest product offerings of colors,
textures and finishes, as well as the industry's largest offering of trim and
angle pieces and its ability to utilize the industry's newest technology.

Raw Materials and Suppliers

Carpet
and Rugs Business.

The principal raw materials the carpet and rug business
uses are nylon, polypropylene, polyester and wool, resins and fibers, synthetic
backing materials, polyurethane latex and various dyes and chemicals. The
Company obtains all of its major raw materials from independent sources and all
of its externally purchased nylon fibers from three major suppliers: Koch
Industries, Inc., Solutia, Inc., and Honeywell, Inc. The carpet and rug
business has not experienced significant shortages of raw materials in recent
years. The Company believes that there is an adequate supply of all grades of
resin and fiber and that all are readily available from a number of independent
sources.

Ceramic
Tile Business.

In the Company's ceramic tile business, the Company
manufactures tile primarily from talc, clay and nepheline syenite. The Company
has entered into a long-term supply agreement for most of its talc requirements
with one supplier.

The
Company owns long-term clay mining rights in Alabama, Kentucky and Mississippi
that satisfy nearly all of its clay requirements for producing unglazed quarry
tile. The Company purchases a number of different grades of clay for the
manufacture of its non-quarry tile. The Company believes that there is an
adequate supply of all grades of clay and that all are readily available from a
number of independent sources.

The
Company has a single source supplier for its nepheline syenite requirements. If
this supplier were unable to satisfy the Company's requirements, the Company
believes that alternative supply arrangements would be available.

Glazes
are used on a significant percentage of the Company's manufactured tile. Glazes
consist of frit (ground glass), zircon, stains and other materials, with frit
being the largest ingredient. The Company manufactures approximately 57% of its
frit requirements.

Competition

Carpet
and Rugs Business.

The carpet and rugs industry is
highly competitive. Based on industry publications, the top 20 North American
carpet and rug manufacturers (including their American and foreign divisions)
in 2002 had worldwide sales in excess of $13.0 billion, and the top 20
manufacturers in 1990 had sales in excess of $6 billion. In 2002, the top five
manufacturers had worldwide sales in excess of $10.2 billion. The Company
believes it is the second largest producer of carpet and rugs (in terms of
sales volume) in the world.


Ceramic
Tile Business.

The Company estimates that over 100
tile manufacturers, more than half of which are based outside the United
States, compete for sales of ceramic tile to customers located in the United
States. Although the U.S. ceramic tile industry is highly fragmented at both
the manufacturing and distribution levels, the Company believes it is the
largest manufacturer, distributor and marketer of ceramic tile in the United States
and one of the largest in the world.

The
principal methods of competition within the carpet and rugs and ceramic tile
industries are price, style, quality and service. In each of the Company's
markets, price competition and market coverage are particularly important
because there is limited differentiation among competing product lines. The
Company's recent investments in modernized, advanced manufacturing and data
processing equipment, the extensive diversity of equipment in which the Company
has invested, its marketing strategy and its distribution system contribute to
its ability to compete primarily on the basis of performance, quality, style
and service, rather than just price.

In
each of the Company's carpet and rug and ceramic tile businesses, the Company
faces competition from a large number of domestic and foreign manufacturers and
independent distributors of floorcovering products. Some of the Company's
existing and potential competitors may be larger and have greater resources and
access to capital than the Company does. Maintaining the Company's competitive
position may require it to make substantial investments in its product
development efforts, manufacturing facilities, distribution network and sales
and marketing activities. Competitive pressures may also result in decreased
demand for the Company's products and in the loss of market share. In addition,
the Company faces, and will continue to face, pressure on sales prices of its
products from competitors, as well as from large customers. As a result of any
of these factors, there could be a material adverse effect on the Company's
sales and profitability.

Trademarks

The
Company uses several trademarks that it considers important in the marketing of
its products, including "Aladdin," "American Olean

"Bigelow," "Custom Weave" "Dal-Tile

Sales Terms and Major
Customers

The
Company's sales terms are the same as those generally available throughout the
industry. The Company generally permits its customers to return broadloom
carpet and ceramic tile purchased from it within 30 days from the date of sale,
if the customer is not satisfied with the quality of the product. This return
policy is consistent with the Company's emphasis on quality, style and
performance and promotes customer satisfaction without generating enough
returns to affect materially its operating results or financial position.

During
2003, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of Mohawk's total net
sales. The Company believes the loss of one or a few major customers would not
have a material adverse effect on its business.

Employees

As
of March 2, 2004, the Company employed approximately 33,300 persons, of
which approximately 635 of its employees in the United States and approximately
3,100 of its employees in Mexico are members of unions. Other than with respect
to these employees, the Company is not a party to any collective bargaining
agreements. Additionally, the Company has not experienced any strikes or work
stoppages for over 20 years. The Company believes that its relations with its
employees are good.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

The
Company is involved in routine litigation from time to time in the regular
course of its business. Except as noted below, there are no material legal
proceedings pending or known to be contemplated to which the Company is a party
or to which any of its property is subject.

Environmental Matters

The
Company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental
health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing air
emissions, wastewater discharges, the use, storage, treatment and disposal of
solid and hazardous materials, and the cleanup of contamination associated
therewith. Because of the nature of the Company's business, the Company has
incurred, and will continue to incur, costs relating to compliance with such
laws and regulations. The Company is involved in various proceedings relating
to environmental matters and is currently engaged in environmental
investigation, remediation and post-closure care programs at certain sites. The
Company has provided reserves for such activities that it has determined to be
both probable and reasonably estimable. The Company does not expect that the ultimate
liability with respect to such activities will have a material adverse effect
on it.

Three
sites near Mohawk's Dallas facility in its Dal-Tile segment are involved in
environmental cleanup projects relating principally to the disposal or alleged
disposal by Dal-Tile of waste materials containing lead compounds. Dal-Tile's
approved closure plans have been implemented and each site is now undergoing
post-closure care.  Dal-Tile has been
named as a potentially responsible party under the federal Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA") and
similar state statutes for the disposal of certain hazardous substances at
various other sites in the United States. 
The Company does not believe that any future costs for these sites will
have a material adverse effect on it.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

Overview

The
Company is the leading producer of floorcovering products for residential and
commercial applications in the United States. The Company is the second largest
carpet and rug manufacturer, and a leading manufacturer, marketer and
distributor of ceramic tile and natural stone, in the United States. Annual
floorcovering sales within the United States in 2002 were approximately $20.3
billion. The Company had annual net sales in 2003 in excess of $5.0 billion.

The
primary categories
of the floorcovering industry include carpet and rugs (65%), ceramic tile
(12%), vinyl and rubber (10%), hardwood (9%) and laminate (4%).  Compound average growth rates in units sold
(measured in square yards) for all categories, except the vinyl and rubber
category, for the period from 1992 through 2002 have met or exceeded the growth
rate for both the gross domestic product of the United States and housing
starts over the same period.  During
this period, the compound average growth rate was 3.6% for carpet and rugs,
10.3% for ceramic tile, 1.3% for vinyl and rubber and 8.0% for hardwood.  Laminate, which is a relatively new product,
experienced a compound average growth rate of 41.5% from 1996 through
2002.  Although beginning from a smaller
base, the growth rates for hard floorcoverings may indicate increasing consumer
preference for these products for certain applications.  In response to this increasing demand, the
Company has increased its distribution of hard surface products, including
ceramic tile, vinyl, hardwood and laminate. The acquisition of Dal-Tile
provided a unique opportunity to help the Company achieve its strategic goal of
becoming one of the world's leading floorcovering manufacturers and
distributors.

The
Company continues to experience growth both internally and through
acquisitions.

On
March 20, 2002, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of
Dal-Tile, a leading manufacturer and distributor of ceramic tile in the United
States, for approximately $1,469 million in stock and cash. The transaction was
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the
results of operations of Dal-Tile have been included in the Company's
consolidated financial statements from March 20, 2002. The primary reason for
the acquisition was to expand the Company's presence in the ceramic tile and
stone markets.

On
November 10, 2003, the Company acquired the assets and assumed certain
liabilities of the commercial carpet division of Burlington Industries, Inc.,
known as Lees Carpet, from W.L. Ross & Company for approximately $350 million
in cash. The results of operations for Lees Carpet have been included with the
Mohawk segment results and in the Company's consolidated financial statements
since that date. The primary reason for the acquisition was to expand the
Company's presence in the commercial carpet market.

The
Company has two operating segments, the Mohawk segment and the Dal-Tile
segment. The Mohawk segment sells and distributes its product lines, which
include broadloom carpet, rugs, pad, ceramic tile, hardwood, vinyl and laminate
through independent floor covering retailers, home centers, mass merchandisers,
department stores, commercial dealers and commercial end users. The Dal-Tile
segment product lines include ceramic tile, porcelain tile and stone products
sold through company-operated sales service centers, independent distributors
and home centers.

Critical Accounting Policies

The
Company's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations are based on its consolidated financial statements that were
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.

The
Company makes estimates and assumptions when preparing financial statements.
These estimates and assumptions affect various matters, including:

reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the
     Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets at the dates of the financial
     statements,

disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
     the dates of the financial statements, and


reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the
     Company's Consolidated Statements of Earnings during the reporting
     periods. These estimates involve judgments with respect to, among other
     things, future economic factors that are difficult to predict and are
     beyond management's control. As a result, actual amounts could differ from
     these estimates.

The
SEC issued disclosure guidance for accounting policies that management believes
are most "critical." The SEC defines these critical accounting
policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company's
financial condition and results and require management's most difficult,
subjective, or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make
estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may
change in subsequent periods.

The
Company believes the following accounting policies require it to use judgments
and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and could
represent critical accounting policies as defined by the SEC. The Company
discusses its significant accounting policies, including those that do not
require management to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments or
estimates, in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Accounts receivable and revenue recognition. Revenues
     are recognized when goods are shipped and legal title passes to the
     customer. The Company provides allowances for expected cash discounts,
     returns, claims and doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debt and
     claims experience and periodic evaluation of specific customer accounts
     and the aging of accounts receivable. If the financial condition of the
     Company's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of
     their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market
     (net realizable value). Cost is determined using the last-in, first-out
     method (LIFO) predominantly within the Mohawk segment, which matches
     current costs with current revenues, and the first-in, first-out method
     (FIFO), which is used to value inventory within the Dal-Tile segment.
     Inventories on hand are compared against anticipated future usage, which
     is a function of historical usage and anticipated future selling price, in
     order to evaluate obsolescence, excessive quantities, and expected sales
     below cost. Actual results could differ from assumptions used to value
     obsolete, excessive inventory or inventory expected to be sold below cost
     and additional reserves may be required.

Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are
     subject to annual impairment testing. The impairment tests are based on
     determining the fair value of the specified reporting units and indefinite
     life intangible assets based on management judgments and assumptions using
     estimated future cash flows. These judgments and assumptions could
     materially change the value of the specified reporting units and
     indefinite life intangible assets and, therefore, could materially impact
     the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
     for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
     financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
     and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
     measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in
     the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered
     or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change
     in the tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the
     enactment date. Additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively
     disagree with the Company's tax treatment of certain items, and some
     historical transactions have income tax effects going forward. Accounting
     rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws,
     rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an
     unpredictable manner.

During
2003, specifically the first half of 2003, the Company and industry performance
as a whole was impacted negatively by the overall weak conditions in the U.S.
economy and cautious consumer and commercial spending. The Company believes
that the residential replacement business is recovering in response to improved
economic conditions. The Company believes that the commercial business is also
beginning to show signs of improvement at certain price points and anticipates
the higher end business will improve later in 2004. The Company is implementing
a price increase in both the Mohawk and Dal-Tile segment during the first
quarter of 2004 to compensate for increased raw material prices resulting from
higher oil and natural gas prices and higher import prices.

Year Ended December 31, 2003, as Compared with Year
Ended December 31, 2002

Net
sales for the year ended December 31, 2003, were $5,005.1 million, reflecting
an increase of $482.7 million, or approximately 10.7%, over the $4,522.3
million reported in the year ended December 31, 2002. The increased net sales
were attributable to the acquisition of Dal-Tile and Lees Carpet and internal
growth. The Mohawk segment recorded net sales of $3,736.5 million in 2003
compared to $3,624.2 million in 2002, representing an increase of $112.4
million or approximately 3.1%. The growth was attributable to the Lees Carpet
acquisition and internal growth of product lines. The Dal-Tile segment recorded
net sales of $1,268.5 million in 2003, reflecting an increase of $370.4 million
or 41.2%, over the $898.2 million reported in the year ended December 31, 2002.
The Dal-Tile results are not included in the Company's consolidated financial
statements prior to the March 20, 2002, acquisition. However, when the Dal-Tile
net sales for the year ended December 31, 2003, are compared to the Dal-Tile
pro forma net sales of $1,134.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002
(derived by combining Dal-Tile net sales of $236.0 million prior to the March
20, 2002, acquisition date, after reclassifications to conform to Mohawk's
presentation, with reported Dal-Tile net sales of $898.2 million for the period
ending December 31, 2002), an increase of approximately 11.8% for the period
was realized. The growth was primarily attributable to growth within
residential products. The Company believes this pro forma net sales information
will be useful to investors because it allows investors to compare the results
of the two periods.

%

Gross
profit was $1,359.4 million (27.2% of net sales) for 2003 and $1,240.1 million
(27.4% of net sales) for 2002. The reduction in percentage was primarily
attributable to a change in the selling mix, increased raw material prices
resulting from higher oil and natural gas prices, higher import prices and
start up costs related to the new Dal-Tile manufacturing facility.

Selling,
general and administrative expenses for 2003 were $817.3 million (16.3% of net
sales) compared to $718.0 million (15.9% of net sales) for 2002. The increased
percentage was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Dal-Tile, which has
higher selling, general and administrative expenses.

Operating
income for 2003 was $542.0 million (10.9% of net sales) compared to $522.1
million (11.5% of net sales) in 2002. Operating income attributable to the
Mohawk segment was $364.0 million (9.7% of segment net sales) in 2003 compared
to $390.9 million (10.8% of segment net sales) in 2002. The percentage decrease
in operating income was attributable to the higher costs associated with oil
and natural gas prices and a change in the selling mix. Operating income
attributable to the Dal-Tile segment was $187.2 million (14.8% of segment net
sales) in 2003, compared to $139.9 million (15.6% of segment net sales) in
2002. The decrease in operating income as a percentage of net sales is
primarily attributable to a change in product mix, higher import prices and
start up costs of a new manufacturing facility. On a pro forma combined basis,
the Dal-Tile segment operating income was $171.7 million (15.1% of pro forma
segment net sales) for 2002 (derived by combining Dal-Tile operating income of
$31.8 million prior to the March 20, 2002 acquisition, after reclassifications
to conform to Mohawk's presentation, with reported Dal-Tile operating income of
$139.9 million for the period ended December 31, 2002). The Company believes
that presentation of this pro forma combined operating income information will
be useful to investors because it allows investors to compare the results
between the two periods.

Interest
expense for 2003 was $55.6 million compared to $69.0 million in 2002.  The decrease in interest expense was
attributable to lower average debt levels during 2003 when compared to 2002,
offset by an increase in the average borrowing rate due to a change in the mix
of fixed and variable rate debt in 2003 when compared to 2002. Additionally,
interest expense for 2002 included $10.7 million related to the write-off of an
interest rate swap previously accounted for as a cash flow hedge.

Income
tax expense was $178.3 million, or 36.5% of earnings before income taxes for
2003 compared to $159.1 million, or 35.9% of earnings before income taxes for
2002. The change in tax rate resulted from the use of fewer available tax
credits in 2003 when compared to 2002.

Year
Ended December 31, 2002, as Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2001

Net
sales for the year ended December 31, 2002, were $4,522.3 million, reflecting
an increase of $1,076.4 million, or approximately 31.2%, over the $3,445.9
million reported in the year ended December 31, 2001. The increased net sales
were attributable to the Dal-Tile acquisition and internal growth of the Mohawk
segment product lines. The Mohawk segment recorded net sales of $3,624.2
million in 2002 compared to $3,445.9 million in 2001, representing an increase
of $178.2 million or approximately 5.2%. The growth was attributable to all
segment product lines. Since the completion of the Dal-Tile acquisition, the
Dal-Tile segment recorded net sales of $898.2 million in 2002. On a pro forma
combined basis, the Dal-Tile segment net sales were $1,134.2 million (derived
by combining Dal-Tile net sales of $236.0 million prior to the March 20, 2002
acquisition date, after reclassifications to conform to Mohawk's presentation,
with reported Dal-Tile net sales of $898.2 million for the period ending December
31, 2002) for 2002. This compares to Dal-Tile net sales of $1,036.8 million


(derived from net sales prior to the March 20, 2002 acquisition) for 2001,
resulting in an increase of approximately 9.4% for the period. The growth was
primarily attributable to growth within residential products. The Company
believes this pro forma net sales information will be useful to investors
because it allows investors to compare the results of the two periods.

Quarterly
net sales and the percentage changes in net sales by quarter for 2002 versus
2001 were as follows (dollars in thousands):

Gross
profit was $1,240.1 million (27.4% of net sales) for 2002 and $832.9 million
(24.2% of net sales) for 2001. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales in
2002 was favorably impacted when compared to 2001 by Dal-Tile's higher gross
profit percentage and improved manufacturing efficiencies within the Mohawk
segment.

Selling,
general and administrative expenses for 2002 were $718.0 million (15.9% of net
sales) compared to $505.7 million (14.7% of net sales) for 2001. The increased
percentage was attributable to the Dal-Tile segment which has higher selling,
general and administrative expenses but also has higher gross profit as a
percentage of net sales. The Mohawk and Dal-Tile (including selling, general
and administrative costs prior to the acquisition of Dal-Tile) segments
selling, general and administrative expenses reflected improvements over 2001,
when compared to 2002. The improvements were due to better control of operating
costs as net sales increased.

Operating
income for 2002 was $522.1 million (11.5% of net sales) compared to $327.2
million (9.5% of net sales) in 2001. Operating income attributable to the
Mohawk segment was $390.9 million (10.8% of segment net sales) in 2002 compared
to $336.7 million (9.8% of segment net sales) in 2001. Operating income
attributable to the Dal-Tile segment was $139.9 million (15.6% of segment net
sales) in 2002. On a pro forma combined basis, the Dal-Tile segment operating
income was $171.7 million (15.1% of pro forma segment net sales) for 2002
(derived by combining Dal-Tile operating income of $31.8 million prior to the
March 20, 2002 acquisition, after reclassifications to conform to Mohawk's
presentation, with reported Dal-Tile operating income of $139.9 million for the
period ended December 31, 2002). This compares to Dal-Tile operating income of
$154.6 million (14.9% of Dal-Tile net sales) for 2001. The Company believes
that presentation of this pro forma combined operating income information will
be useful to investors because it allows investors to compare the results
between the two periods.

Interest
expense for 2002 was $69.0 million compared to $29.8 million in 2001.  The increase in interest expense was
attributable to additional debt incurred in March 2002 to finance the
acquisition of Dal-Tile, the write-off of approximately $10.7 million relating
to an interest rate swap previously accounted for as a cash flow hedge and an
increase in the average borrowing rate due to a change in the mix of fixed rate
and variable rate debt, when compared to 2001.

Income
tax expense was $159.1 million, or 35.9% of earnings before income taxes for
2002 compared to $102.8 million, or 35.3% of earnings before income taxes for
2001.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

The
Company's primary capital requirements are for working capital, capital
expenditures and acquisitions.  The
Company's capital needs are met primarily through a combination of internally
generated funds, bank credit lines, term and senior notes, the sale of
receivables and credit terms from suppliers.

The
level of accounts receivable increased from $501.1 million at the beginning of
2003 to $573.5 million at December 31, 2003. 
The $72.4 million increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition
of Lees Carpet and internal sales growth. 
Inventories increased from $678.0 million at the beginning of 2003 to
$832.4 million at December 31, 2003, due primarily to building inventory for
hard surface product categories within the Mohawk and Dal-Tile segments and the
acquisition of Lees Carpet.


The
outstanding checks in excess of cash represent trade payables checks that have
not yet cleared the bank. When the checks clear the bank, they are funded by
the revolving credit facility. This policy does not impact any liquid assets on
the consolidated balance sheets.

Excluding
acquisitions, capital expenditures totaled $114.6 million during 2003. The
capital expenditures made during 2003 were incurred primarily to modernize and
expand manufacturing facilities and equipment.  The Company's capital projects are primarily focused on increasing
capacity, improving productivity and reducing costs.  Capital expenditures, including $1,101.8 million for acquisitions,
have totaled $1,381.2 million over the past three years. The Company's capital
spending during 2004, excluding acquisitions, is expected to range from $140
million to $160 million, and will be used primarily to purchase equipment to
increase production capacity and productivity.

On
September 30, 2003, the Company entered into a new revolving line of credit
agreement providing up to $300 million with interest rates of either (i) LIBOR
plus 0.4% to 1.5%, depending upon the Company's performance measured against
certain financial ratios, or (ii) the base rate plus 0-0.6% depending upon the
Company's performance measured against certain financial ratios. The new
facility replaces a $450 million facility that was due to expire in January
2004. The facility is comprised of two tranches, a $200 million tranche
expiring in September 2008 and a $100 million tranche expiring in September
2004. The  $100 million tranche of the
facility is renewable annually. The credit agreement contains customary
financial and other covenants.  The
Company must pay an annual facility fee ranging from .15% to .50% of the total
credit commitment, depending upon the Company's performance measured against
specific coverage ratios, under the revolving credit line. Additionally, at
December 31, 2003, the Company had credit facilities of $300 million under its
revolving credit facility and $50 million under various short-term uncommitted
credit lines. At December 31, 2003, a total of $237.3 million was unused under
the combined revolving credit facility and uncommitted credit lines. The
revolving credit facility and uncommitted lines of credit are unsecured.

In
connection with the Dal-Tile acquisition during 2002, the Company entered into
a 364-day term loan facility (the "Bridge Facility") to finance a portion of
the acquisition. On April 2, 2002, the Company sold $300 million of its 6.50%
senior notes due 2007, Series A and $400 million of its 7.20% senior notes due
2012, Series B through institutional private placements and used the proceeds
to repay outstanding indebtedness of approximately $601 million under the
Bridge Facility and approximately $90 million under the Company's revolving
credit facility. On June 13, 2002, the Company exchanged $295 million of its
registered 6.50% senior notes due 2007, Series C for an equal amount of its
Series A senior notes and $397.8 million of its registered 7.20% senior notes
due 2012, Series D for an equal amount of its Series B senior notes. Interest
on each series is payable semiannually.

On
August 4, 2003, the Company entered into an on-balance sheet trade accounts
receivable securitization agreement ("Securitization Facility")
replacing two previous facilities that were due to expire in October 2003. The
Securitization Facility allows the Company to borrow up to $350 million based
on available accounts receivable. The Company sells, on a non-recourse
revolving basis, its accounts receivable to a special purpose entity, which in
turn obtains loan advances that are secured by the receivable pool from a
third-party commercial paper conduit sponsored by financial institutions. The
Securitization Facility is subject to annual renewal. At December 31, 2003, the
Company had approximately $182 million outstanding secured by approximately
$649.0 million of trade receivables.

The
Company's Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 15 million
shares of its outstanding common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2003, a
total of approximately 593,000 shares of the Company's common stock were
purchased at an aggregate cost of approximately $27.8 million. Since the
inception of the program, a total of approximately 11 million shares have been
repurchased at an aggregate cost of approximately $293.1 million. All of these
repurchases have been financed through the Company's operations and banking
arrangements.

The
Company believes that the combined total of the revolving credit facility,
short-term uncommitted credit lines and the Securitization Facility of $700
million is adequate to support its capital and working capital requirements.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In
January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")
issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN 46"), "Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51," which
addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities
("VIEs") either: (1) that do not have sufficient equity investment at
risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional
subordinated financial support, or (2) in which the equity investors lack an
essential characteristic of a controlling financial interest. In December 2003,
the FASB issued modifications to FIN 46 ("Revised Interpretations")
resulting in multiple effective dates based on the nature as well as the
creation date of the VIE. VIEs created after January 31, 2003, but prior to
January 1, 2004, may be accounted for either based on the original
interpretation or the Revised Interpretations. However, the Revised
Interpretations must be applied no later than the first quarter of 2004. VIEs
created after January 1, 2004 must be accounted for under the Revised
Interpretations. Non-Special Purpose Entities created prior to February 1,
2003, should be accounted for under the revised interpretation's provisions no
later than the first quarter of fiscal 2004. The Company has adopted FIN 46,
which did not have, and the Company does not expect the Revised Interpretations
to have, a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Impact
of Inflation

Inflation
affects the Company's manufacturing costs and operating expenses. The carpet
and tile industry has experienced inflation in the prices of raw materials and
fuel-related costs. In the past, the Company has generally passed along these
price increases to its customers and has been able to enhance productivity to
offset increases in costs resulting from inflation in both the United States
and Mexico.

Seasonality

The Company is a
calendar year-end company and its
results of operations for the first quarter tend to be the weakest.  The second, third and fourth quarters
typically produce higher net sales and operating income.  These results are primarily due to consumer
residential spending patterns for floorcovering, which historically have decreased
during the first two months of each year following the holiday season.

Certain Factors affecting the Company's Performance

In
addition to the other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K,
the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating an investment
in shares of Common Stock.

If any of the events described in these risks
were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's
business, financial condition and results of operations.


The
floorcovering industry is cyclical and prolonged declines in residential or
commercial construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's business.

The
U.S. floorcovering industry is highly dependent on residential and commercial
construction activity, including new construction as well as remodeling which
are cyclical in nature. A prolonged decline in residential or commercial
construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the Company's
business.

The
U.S. construction industry has experienced significant downturns in the past,
which have adversely affected suppliers to the industry. The industry could
experience similar downturns in the future, which could have a negative impact
on the Company's business.

The Company faces intense
competition in its industry, which could decrease demand for its products and
could have a material adverse effect on its profitability.

The industry is highly competitive. The Company
faces competition from a large number of manufacturers and independent
distributors. Some of its competitors may be larger and have greater resources
and access to capital.  Maintaining the
Company's competitive position may require: substantial investments in its
product development efforts, manufacturing facilities, distribution network and
sales and marketing activities. Competitive pressures may also result in
decreased demand for its products.  Any
of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company.

A failure to identify suitable acquisition candidates, to complete
acquisitions and to integrate successfully the acquired operations could have a
material adverse effect on the Company's business.

As
part of its business strategy, the Company intends to pursue acquisitions of
complementary businesses.  Although it
regularly evaluates acquisition opportunities, it may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition
candidates; obtain sufficient
financing on acceptable terms to fund acquisitions; complete acquisitions; or profitably
manage acquired businesses.

Acquired operations may not achieve expected performance levels and may
involve a number of special risks, including among others an inability to
successfully integrate acquired operations and the diversion of management
resources.

The Company may be unable to obtain raw materials on a
timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on its business.

The principal raw materials used in the Company's
manufacturing operations include: nylon fiber and polypropylene resin, which
are used exclusively in its carpet and rug business; talc, clay, nepheline
syenite and various glazes, including frit (ground glass), zircon and stains,
which are used exclusively in its ceramic tile business and other materials. The Company has a single source
supplier for all of its nepheline syenite requirements.  An extended interruption in the supply of
these or other raw materials used in the Company's business or in the supply of
suitable substitute materials would disrupt the Company's operations, which
could have a material adverse effect on its business.

The Company may be unable to pass on to its customers
increases in the costs of raw materials and energy, which could have a material
adverse effect on its profitability.

The prices of raw materials and natural gas vary
with market conditions. Although the Company generally attempts to pass on
increases in the costs of raw materials and natural gas to its customers, the
Company's ability to do so is, dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any
increase, competitive pressures and market conditions for its products.  There have been in the past, and may be in
the future, periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be
recovered.  During such periods of time,
there could be a material adverse effect on the Company's profitability.


The Company has been, and
in the future may be subject to claims and liabilities under environmental,
health and safety laws and regulations, which could be significant.

The Company's operations are subject to various
environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those
governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, and the use, storage, treatment
and disposal of hazardous materials. 
The applicable requirements under these laws are subject to amendment,
to the imposition of new or additional requirements and to changing
interpretations of agencies or courts. The Company could incur material
expenditures to comply with new or existing regulations, including fines and
penalties.

The nature of the Company's operations, including
the potential discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions, exposes
the Company to the risk of claims under environmental, health and safety laws
and regulations. The Company could incur material costs or liabilities in
connection with such claims.

Changes in international
trade laws and in the business, political and regulatory environment in Mexico
could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.

The Company's Monterrey, Mexico manufacturing
facility represents a significant portion of the Company's total manufacturing
capacity for ceramic tile. Accordingly, an event that has a material adverse
impact on the Company's Mexican operations could have a material adverse effect
on the tile operations as a whole. The business, regulatory and political
environments in Mexico differ from those in the United States, and the
Company's Mexican operations are exposed to legal, currency, tax, political,
and economic risks, specific to Mexico.

The Company could face
increased competition as a result of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
("GATT") and the North American Free Trade Agreement
("NAFTA").

The
Company is uncertain what effect reduced import duties under GATT may have on
its operations, although these reduced rates may stimulate additional
competition from manufacturers that export ceramic tile to the United States.

Although
NAFTA lowers the tariffs imposed on the Company's ceramic tile manufactured in
Mexico and sold in the United States and will eliminate such tariffs entirely
on January 1, 2008, it may also stimulate competition in the United States and
Canada from manufacturers located in Mexico.

Forward-Looking Information

Certain
of the statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly anticipating
of future performance, business prospects, growth and operating strategies,
proposed acquisitions, and similar matters, and those that include the words
"believes," "anticipates," "forecast,"
"estimates" or similar expressions constitute "forward-looking
statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended.  For those statements, Mohawk
claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements
contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. There can be
no assurance that the forward-looking statements will be accurate because they
are based on many assumptions, which involve risks and uncertainties. The
following important factors could cause future results to differ: changes in
industry conditions; competition; raw material prices; timing and level of
capital expenditures; integration of acquisitions; introduction of new
products; rationalization of operations; and other risks identified in Mohawk's
SEC reports and public announcements.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk

Financial
exposures are managed as an integral part of the Company's risk management
program, which seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect that the
volatility of the interest rate, exchange rate and natural gas markets may have
on its operating results. The Company does not regularly engage in speculative
transactions, nor does it regularly hold or issue financial instruments for
trading purposes.


Natural
Gas Risk Management

The
Company uses a combination of natural gas futures contracts and long-term
supply agreements to manage unanticipated changes in natural gas prices. The
contracts are based on forecasted usage of natural gas measured in Million
British Thermal Units ("MMBTU").

The
Company has designated the natural gas futures contracts as cash flow hedges.
The outstanding contracts are valued at market with the offset going to other
comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes and any hedge
ineffectiveness. Any gain or loss is recognized in cost of goods sold in the
same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects
earnings.  At December 31, 2003, the
Company had natural gas contracts that mature from January 2004 to December
2004 with an aggregate notional amount of approximately 3.9 million MMBTU's.
The fair value of these contracts was an asset of $3.6 million. At December 31,
2002, the Company had natural gas contracts outstanding with a notional amount
of approximately 1.4 million MMBTU's. The fair value of these contracts was an
asset of $1.9 million. The offset to these assets is recorded in other
comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes.

The
Company's natural gas long-term supply agreements are accounted for under the
normal purchases provision within SFAS No. 133 and its amendments. At December
31, 2003, the Company has normal purchase commitments of approximately 3.1
million MMBTU's for periods maturing from January 2004 through September 2005.
The contracted value of these commitments was approximately $13.8 million and
the fair value of these commitments was approximately $17.0 million, at
December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2002, the Company had normal purchase
commitments of approximately 4.6 million MMBTU's. The contracted value of these
commitments was approximately $17.4 million and the fair value of these
commitments was approximately $19.7 million.

Foreign Currency
Rate Management

The
Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge costs
associated with its operations in Mexico. The objective of these transactions
is to reduce volatility of exchange rates where these operations are located by
fixing a portion of their costs in U.S. currency. Gains and losses are
recognized in cost of goods sold in the same period or periods during which the
hedged transaction affects earnings. Accordingly, these contracts have been
designated as cash flow hedges. The Company had forward contracts to purchase
approximately 145.3 million and 357.5 million Mexican pesos at December 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively. The aggregate U.S. Dollar value of these contracts
at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was approximately $12.7 million and $34,581,
respectively. The contracts are marked to market in other current liabilities
with the offset to other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes.
Unrealized losses at December 31, 2003 and 2002 respectively, were not
significant.

Interest Rate Management

In
2002, the Company determined that its $100 million interest rate swap was
ineffective. Consequently, the $10.7 million unrealized loss associated with
the swap was recorded as a realized loss in interest expense during the fourth
quarter of 2002. The Company continues to carry the liability on its
consolidated balance sheets and the interest rate swap is marked to market at
the end of each reporting period. The change in fair value for the year ended
December 31, 2003 was not significant.

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC.  AND
SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2003,  2002 and 2001

(In thousands, except per share data)

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a) Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Mohawk Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company" or
"Mohawk").  All significant intercompany balances and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

(b) Accounts Receivable and Revenue Recognition

The Company is principally a broadloom carpet, rug and
ceramic tile manufacturer and sells carpet, rugs, ceramic tile and other
floorcovering materials throughout the United States principally for residential
and commercial use.  The Company grants credit to customers, most of whom
are retail-flooring dealers and commercial end users, under credit terms that
are customary in the industry.

Revenues are recognized when goods are shipped, which is
when the legal title passes to the customer. The Company provides allowances for
expected cash discounts, returns, claims and doubtful accounts based upon
historical bad debt and claims experience and periodic evaluations of specific
customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable.

(c) Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market
(net realizable value).  Cost is determined using the last-in, first-out
(LIFO) method, which matches current costs with current revenues, for
substantially all inventories within the Mohawk segment and the first-in,
first-out (FIFO) method for the Dal-Tile segment inventories.

(d) Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost,
including capitalized interest.  Depreciation is calculated on a
straight-line basis over the estimated remaining useful lives, which are 35
years for buildings and improvements, 15 years for extrusion equipment, 10 years
for tufting equipment, the shorter of the estimated useful life or life of the
lease for leasehold improvements, five years for vehicles and seven years for
other equipment and furniture and fixtures.

(e) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

In accordance with the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets" the Company tests goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite
lives for impairment on an annual basis (or on an interim basis if an event
occurs that might reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying
value). The Company conducts testing for impairment during the fourth quarter of
its fiscal year. Intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives are
amortized based on weighted average lives.


MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC.  AND
SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Continued)

(f) Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and
liability method.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on
deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that includes the enactment date.

(g) Financial Instruments

The Company's financial instruments consist primarily of
receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and long-term debt.  The
carrying amount of receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses
approximates their fair value because of the short-term maturity of such
instruments.  Interest rates that are currently available to the Company
for issuance of long-term debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are
used to estimate the fair value of the Company's long-term debt.  The
estimated fair value of the Company's long-term debt at December 31, 2003 and
2002 was $1,095,590 and $894,462, compared to a carrying amount of $1,012,413
and $820,427, respectively.

(h) Derivative Instruments

Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No.
133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS No.
133") and its amendments which require the Company to recognize all derivatives
on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges
must be adjusted to fair value through earnings. If the derivative is a hedge,
depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in its fair value are either
offset against the change in fair value of assets, liabilities, or firm
commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until
the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The Company engages in activities
that expose it to market risks, including the effects of changes in interest
rates, exchange rates and changes in natural gas prices. Financial exposures are
managed as an integral part of the Company's risk management program, which
seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect that the volatility of the
interest rate, exchange rate and natural gas markets may have on operating
results. The Company does not regularly engage in speculative transactions, nor
does it regularly hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.
There was no impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption of
SFAS No. 133.

The Company formally documents all hedging instruments
and hedging items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for
undertaking hedged items. This process includes linking all derivatives that are
designated as fair value and cash flow hedges to specific assets or liabilities
on the consolidated balance sheet or to forecasted transactions. The Company
also formally assesses, both at inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the
derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in
offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of hedged items. When it is
determined that a derivative is not highly effective, the derivative expires, or
is sold, terminated, or exercised, or the derivative is discontinued because it
is unlikely that a forecasted transaction will occur, the Company discontinues
hedge accounting for that specific hedge instrument.

(

i) Shipping and Handling

Costs related to shipping and handling are included in
cost of sales for all periods presented.

SUBSIDIARIES

(

j) Advertising Costs and Vendor
Consideration

Advertising and promotion expenses are charged to
earnings during the period in which they are incurred.  Advertising and
promotion expenses included in selling, administrative and general expenses were
$26,990 in 2003, $31,829 in 2002 and $28,845 in 2001.

In 2001, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 01-09 "

Accounting
for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer

" ("EITF 01-09"). This
issuance provides guidance primarily on income statement classification of
consideration from a vendor to a purchaser of the vendor's products. Generally,
cash consideration is to be classified as a reduction of net sales, unless
specific criteria are met regarding goods or services that the vendor may
receive in return for this consideration. The Company makes various payments to
customers, including slotting fees, advertising allowances, buy-downs and co-op
advertising. All of these payments reduce gross sales with the exception of
co-op advertising. Co-op advertising is classified as a selling, general and
administrative expense. Co-op advertising expenses, a component of advertising
and promotion expenses, were $9,355 in 2003, $14,090 in 2002 and $11,803 in
2001.

(k) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

In 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 144, "Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." The adoption of SFAS No.
144 did not affect the Company's financial statements. SFAS No. 144 replaced
SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets to be disposed
of." SFAS No. 144 establishes a single accounting model for the impairment or
disposal of long-lived assets including discontinued operations.  In
accordance with SFAS No. 144, long-lived assets and intangibles subject to
amortization are reviewed for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying
amount of the asset exceeds the expected undiscounted cash flows of the asset,
an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying
amount exceeds the expected undiscounted cash flows. Assets to be disposed of
are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated
costs of disposal and are no longer depreciated.

(l) Foreign Currency Translation

The Company's subsidiaries that operate outside the
United States use their local currency as the functional currency, with the
exception of operations carried out in Mexico, in which case the functional
currency is the U.S. dollar. Other than Mexico, the functional currency is
translated into U.S. dollars for balance sheet accounts using the month end
rates in effect as of the balance sheet date and average exchange rate for
revenue and expense accounts for each respective period. The translation
adjustments are deferred as a separate component of shareholders' equity, within
other comprehensive income. Gains or losses resulting from transactions
denominated in foreign currencies are included in other income or expense,
within the consolidated statements of earnings. The assets and liabilities of
the Company's Mexico operations are re-measured using a month end rate, except
for non-monetary assets and liabilities, which are re-measured using the
historical exchange rate. Income and expense accounts are re-measured using an
average monthly rate for the period, except for expenses related to those
balance sheet accounts that are re-measured using historical exchange rates. The
resulting re-measurement adjustment is reported in the consolidated statements
of operations when incurred.

(m) Earnings per Share ("EPS")

The Company applies the provisions of Financial
Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share, which
requires companies to present basic EPS and diluted EPS.  Basic EPS
excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common
stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the
period.  Diluted EPS reflects the dilution that could occur if securities
or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common
stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the
earnings of the Company.


MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC.  AND
SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Continued)

Dilutive common stock options are included in the
diluted EPS calculation using the treasury stock method.  Common stock
options that were not included in the diluted EPS computation because the
options' exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common
shares for the periods presented are not significant.

Computations of basic and diluted earnings per share are
presented in the following table:

(n) Stock Based Compensation

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the
disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation-Transition and Disclosure." This statement amends SFAS No. 123,
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," to provide alternative methods of
transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting
for stock-based compensation and requires prominent disclosure in both the
annual and interim financial statements of the method of accounting used and the
financial impact of stock-based compensation. As permitted by SFAS No. 123, the
Company accounts for stock options granted as prescribed under Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,"
which recognizes compensation cost based upon the intrinsic value of the award.

If the Company had elected to recognize compensation
expense based upon the fair value at the grant dates for awards under its plans,
the Company's net earnings per share would have been reduced as follows:

(o) Effect of New Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No.
46 ("FIN 46"), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation
of ARB No. 51," which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of
variable interest entities ("VIEs") either: (1) that do not have sufficient
equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without
additional subordinated financial support, or (2) in which the equity investors
lack an essential characteristic of a controlling financial interest. In
December 2003, the FASB issued modifications to FIN 46 ("Revised
Interpretations") resulting in multiple effective dates based on the nature as
well as the creation date of the VIE. VIEs created after January 31, 2003, but
prior to January 1, 2004, may be accounted for either based on the original
interpretation or the Revised Interpretations. However, the Revised
Interpretations must be applied no later than the first quarter of 2004. VIEs
created after January 1, 2004 must be accounted for under the Revised
Interpretations. Non-Special Purpose Entities created prior to February 1, 2003,
should be accounted for under the revised interpretation's provisions no later
than the first quarter of fiscal 2004. The Company has adopted FIN 46, which did
not have, and the Company does not expect the Revised Interpretations to have, a
material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, "Amendment
of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." This
standard amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities
under SFAS No. 133. The standard is effective for contracts entered into or
modified after June 30, 2003. The Company has adopted SFAS No. 133 and it did
not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.


MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC.  AND
SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Continued)

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, "Accounting
for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity." SFAS 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and
measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities
and equity, and imposes certain additional disclosure requirements. The
provisions of SFAS No. 150 are generally effective for all financial instruments
entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the
beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The Company
has adopted SFAS No. 150 and it did not have a material impact on the Company's
consolidated financial statements.

(p) Fiscal Year

The Company ends its fiscal year on December 31. 
Each of the first three quarters in the fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest
the calendar quarter end.

(q) Reclassifications

Certain prior period financial statement balances have
been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation.

(2) Acquisitions

On March 20, 2002, the Company acquired all of the
outstanding capital stock of Dal-Tile International Inc. ("Dal-Tile"), a leading
manufacturer and distributor of ceramic tile in the United States, for
approximately $1,468,325, consisting of approximately 12,900 shares of the
Company's common stock, options to purchase approximately 2,100 shares of the
Company's common stock and approximately $717,638 in cash, including direct
acquisition costs. The Company's common stock and options were valued at
approximately $750,687 based on the measurement date stock price of $55.04 per
share ($710,420) and the estimated fair value of the options using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model ($40,267). The acquisition was accounted for
by the purchase method and, accordingly, the results of operations of Dal-Tile
have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from March
20, 2002. The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair values at the date of
acquisition. The trademark value was established based upon an independent
appraisal. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net
identifiable assets acquired of approximately $1,168,286 was recorded as
goodwill. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax
purposes. The primary reason for the acquisition was to expand the Company's
presence in the ceramic tile and stone markets.

Mohawk considered whether identifiable intangible
assets, such as customer relationships, patents, covenants not to compete,
software, production backlog, marketing agreements, unpatented technology and
trade secrets, might exist and none were identified other than trademarks,
during the purchase price negotiations and during the subsequent purchase price
allocation evaluation. Accordingly, the valuation resulted in the recognition of
goodwill and trademarks.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets" ("SFAS No. 142"), goodwill recorded in the Dal-Tile
acquisition will not be amortized. Additionally, the Company determined that the
trademark intangible assets have indefinite useful lives because they are
expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. Goodwill and the trademark
intangible assets are subject to annual impairment testing.

The following table summarizes the preliminary estimated
fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of
acquisition.

On May 5, 2003, the Company acquired certain assets of
International Marble and Granite of Colorado, Inc., a distributor of natural
stone slabs and tile. The primary reason for the acquisition was to expand the
Company's presence in the stone flooring and countertop slab market. The
acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method and, accordingly, the
results of operations are included within the Dal-Tile segment from May 5, 2003.
The purchase price was not significant.

On June 30, 2003, the Company acquired certain assets of
a manufacturer and distributor of washable bath rugs. The primary reason for the
acquisition was to expand the Company's presence in the bath mat market. The
acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method and, accordingly, the
results of operations are included within the Mohawk segment from June 30, 2003.
The purchase price was not significant.

On November 10, 2003, the Company acquired the assets
and assumed certain liabilities of the carpet division of Burlington Industries,
Inc. ("Lees Carpet") from W.L. Ross & Company for approximately $349,839 in
cash. The results of Lees Carpet have been included with the Mohawk segment
results in the Company's consolidated financial statements since that date. The
primary reason for the acquisition was to expand the Company's presence in the
commercial carpet market.

(5) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No.
142,which requires the Company to evaluate its goodwill and indefinite life
intangibles on an annual basis for impairment. Furthermore, any goodwill and
indefinite life intangibles that was acquired in a purchase business combination
completed after June 30, 2001 will not be amortized. Goodwill and indefinite
life intangibles that was acquired in business combinations completed before
July 1, 2001 is no longer being amortized. The Company has two operating
segments, the Mohawk unit and the Dal-Tile unit and, accordingly, has assigned
the acquired goodwill and indefinite life intangibles to the respective
operating segments. During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company evaluated the
goodwill and indefinite life intangibles using the discounted cash flow approach
and determined that there was no impairment.

(7) Long-Term Debt

On September 30, 2003, the Company entered into a new
revolving line of credit agreement providing up to $300,000 with interest rates
of either (i) LIBOR plus 0.4% to 1.5%, depending upon the Company's performance
measured against certain financial ratios, or (ii) the base rate plus 0-0.6%
depending upon the Company's performance measured against certain financial
ratios. The new facility replaces a $450,000 facility that was due to expire in
January 2004. The facility is comprised of two tranches, a $200,000 tranche
expiring in September 2008 and a $100,000 tranche expiring in September 2004.
The $100,000 tranche of the facility is renewable annually. The credit agreement
contains customary financial and other covenants.  The Company must pay an
annual facility fee ranging from .15% to .50% of the total credit commitment,
depending upon the Company's performance measured against specific coverage
ratios, under the revolving credit line. Additionally, at December 31, 2003, the
Company had credit facilities of $300,000 under its revolving credit facility
and $50,000 under various short-term uncommitted credit lines. At December 31,
2003, a total of $237,344 was unused under the combined revolving credit
facility and uncommitted credit lines. The revolving credit facility and
uncommitted lines of credit are unsecured.

In connection with the Dal-Tile acquisition during 2002,
the Company entered into a 364-day term loan facility (the "Bridge Facility") to
finance a portion of the acquisition. On April 2, 2002, the Company sold
$300,000 of its 6.50% senior notes due 2007, Series A and $400,000 of its 7.20%
senior notes due 2012, Series B through institutional private placements and
used the proceeds to repay outstanding indebtedness of approximately $601,000
under the Bridge Facility and approximately $90,000 under the Company's
revolving credit facility. On June 13, 2002, the Company exchanged $294,965 of
its registered 6.50% senior notes due 2007, Series C for an equal amount of its
Series A senior notes and $397,800 of its registered 7.20% senior notes due
2012, Series D for an equal amount of its Series B senior notes. Interest on
each series is payable semiannually.

On August 4, 2003, the Company entered into an
on-balance sheet trade accounts receivable securitization agreement
("Securitization Facility") replacing two previous facilities were due to expire
in October 2003. The Securitization Facility allows the Company to borrow up to
$350,000 based on available accounts receivable. The Company sells, on a
non-recourse revolving basis, its accounts receivable to a special purpose
entity, which in turn obtains loan advances that are secured by the receivable
pool from a third-party commercial paper conduit sponsored by financial
institutions. The Securitization Facility is subject to annual renewal. At
December 31, 2003, the Company had approximately $182,000 outstanding secured by
approximately $649,018 of trade receivables.

The Company guarantees its industrial revenue bonds with
various standby letters of credit, which were in aggregate $55,599 at December

(9) Derivative Financial Instruments

Natural Gas Risk Management

The Company uses a combination of natural gas futures
contracts and long-term supply agreements to manage unanticipated changes in
natural gas prices. The contracts are based on forecasted usage of natural gas
measured in Million British Thermal Units ("MMBTU").

The Company has designated the natural gas futures
contracts as cash flow hedges. The outstanding contracts are valued at market
with the offset going to other comprehensive income, net of applicable income
taxes and any hedge ineffectiveness. Any gain or loss is recognized in cost of
goods sold in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction
affects earnings.  At December 31, 2003, the Company had natural gas
contracts that mature from January 2004 to December 2004 with an aggregate
notional amount of approximately 3,950 MMBTU's. The fair value of these
contracts was an asset of  $3,565. At December 31, 2002, the Company had
natural gas contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of
approximately 1,450 MMBTU's. The fair value of these contracts was an asset of
$1,911. The offset to these assets is recorded in other comprehensive income,
net of applicable income taxes, respectively.

The Company's long-term natural gas supply agreements
are accounted for under the normal purchases provision within SFAS No. 133 and
its amendments. At December 31, 2003, the Company has normal purchase
commitments of approximately 3,095 MMBTU's for periods maturing from January
2004 through September 2005. The contracted value of these commitments was
approximately $13,774 and the fair value of these commitments was approximately
$17,018, at December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2002, the Company had normal
purchase commitments of approximately 4,560 MMBTU's. The contracted value of
these commitments was approximately $17,441 and the fair value of these
commitments was approximately $19,694.

Foreign Currency Rate Management

The Company enters into foreign exchange forward
contracts to hedge costs associated with its operations in Mexico. The objective
of these transactions is to reduce volatility of exchange rates where these
operations are located by fixing a portion of their costs in U.S. currency.
Gains and losses are recognized in cost of goods sold in the same period or
periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Accordingly, these
contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges. The Company had forward
contracts to purchase approximately 145,284 and 357,522 Mexican pesos at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The aggregate U.S. Dollar value of
these contracts at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was approximately $12,665 and
$34,581, respectively. The contracts are marked to market in other current
liabilities with the offset to other comprehensive income, net of applicable
income taxes. Unrealized losses at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively,
were not significant.


MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC.  AND
SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Continued)

Interest Rate Management

In 2002, the Company determined that its $100,000
interest rate swap was ineffective. Consequently, the $10,700 unrealized loss
associated with the swap was recorded as a realized loss in interest expense
during the fourth quarter of 2002. The Company continues to carry the liability
on its consolidated balance sheets and the interest rate swap is marked to
market at the end of each reporting period. The change in fair value for the
year ended December 31, 2003 was not significant.

(10) Product warranties

The Company warrants certain qualitative attributes of
its products for up to 20 years. The Company records a provision for estimated
warranty and related costs, based on historical experience and periodically
adjusts these provisions to reflect actual experience.

Product warranties are as follows:

(11) Stock Options, Stock Compensation and Treasury Stock

Under the 2002 Long-Term Incentive Plan, options may be
granted to directors and key employees through 2012 to purchase a maximum of
3,200 shares of common stock. Under the 2002 plan, options that were not issued
from the 1992, 1993 and 1997 plans were cancelled.  During 2003, 2002, and
2001 options to purchase 565, 731, and 704 shares, respectively, were granted
under the 1992, 1993, 1997 and 2002 plans. Options granted under each of these
plans expire 10 years from the date of grant and become exercisable at such
dates and at prices as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Company's
Board of Directors. In connection with the acquisition of Dal-Tile in 2002, the
Company issued 2,096 options to employees of Dal-Tile in exchange for their
respective options.

During 1996, the Company adopted the 1997 Non-Employee
Director Stock Compensation Plan.  The plan provides for awards of common
stock of the Company for non-employee directors to receive in lieu of cash for
their annual retainers.  During 2003, 2002, and 2001 a total of one, two,
and two shares, respectively, were awarded to the non-employee directors under
the plan.

The Company has a 401(k) retirement savings plan (the
"Mohawk Plan") open to substantially all of its employees who have completed 90
days of eligible service. Effective January 1, 2003, the Dal-Tile International
Inc. Employees' Retirement Savings Plan was merged into the Mohawk Plan. For the
Mohawk segment, the Company contributes $0.50 for every $1.00 of employee
contributions up to a maximum of 4% of the employee's salary and an additional
$0.25 for every $1.00 of employee contribution in excess of 4% of the employee's

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC.  AND
SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Continued)

The Company is subject to various federal, state, local
and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations, including
those governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use, storage,
treatment and disposal of solid and hazardous materials, and the cleanup of
contamination associated therewith. Because of the nature of the Company's
business, the Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs relating
to compliance with such laws and regulations. The Company is involved in various
proceedings relating to environmental matters and is currently engaged in
environmental investigation, remediation and post-closure care programs at
certain sites. The Company has provided reserves for such activities that it has
determined to be both probable and reasonably estimable. The Company does not
expect that the ultimate liability with respect to such activities will have a
material adverse effect on it.

Three sites near Mohawk's Dallas facility in its
Dal-Tile segment are involved in environmental cleanup projects relating
principally to the disposal or alleged disposal by Dal-Tile of waste materials
containing lead compounds. Dal-Tile's approved closure plans have been
implemented and each site is now undergoing post-closure care.  Dal-Tile
has been named as a potentially responsible party under the federal
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA")
and similar state statutes for the disposal of certain hazardous substances at
various other sites in the United States.  The Company does not believe
that any future costs for these sites will have a material adverse effect on it.
