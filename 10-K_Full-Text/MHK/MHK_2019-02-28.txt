Index to Financial Statements

The Mohawk Business Strategy provides continuity for the Company’s operating principles and ensures a focus on exceeding customer expectations.

Strengths

Market Position

Mohawk’s fashionable and innovative products, successful participation in all sales channels, creative marketing programs and extensive sales resources have enabled the Company to build market leadership positions in multiple geographies, primarily North America,  Brazil,  Europe, Russia and Australasia, as well as export products to more than 170 countries. In North America, Mohawk’s largest marketplace, the Company has leveraged its brands, breadth of offering and award-winning merchandising to build strong positions across all product categories. In Europe and Russia, similar advantages have supported market leadership in ceramic, premium laminate and sheet vinyl. The 2018 acquisition of Godfrey Hirst provided the Company with the largest position in carpet to complement the leading hard surface presence in Australasia that had grown through the earlier acquisition of national distributors in both Australia and New Zealand. In 2018, the Company acquired Eliane, a leading ceramic tile manufacturer in Brazil, the world’s third largest ceramic market.  The Eliane brand is highly regarded for innovative design and strength in high-end porcelain floor and wall tile.  Eliane is Brazil’s largest ceramic tile exporter. The Company also has established a strong position in the fast-growing LVT market on both sides of the Atlantic following the 2015 acquisition of IVC and subsequent investments to expand production in both North America and Europe.

Product Innovation

Mohawk drives performance through product innovation and improvements across all categories. In ceramic, this includes proprietary Reveal Imaging

®

printing that replicates the appearance of other surfaces, such as long planks with the visuals and texture of natural wood as well as tiles that mimic natural stone, cement, textiles and other alternatives. In Italy, the Company has recently begun manufacturing porcelain large scale slabs that replicate the look of stone but are harder and more durable. The slabs are being sold in the European and North American markets and are used for floors, walls and countertops. In the U.S., the Company has begun to manufacture quartz countertops that, along with its stone and porcelain slabs, represent a comprehensive array of surface options. In carpet, exclusive fiber technologies include the unique bio-based SmartStrand

®

and its brand extensions that represented the first super soft stain resistant products on the market and the patented Continuum

TM

process that adds bulk and softness to polyester fiber, differentiating the Company’s products in this fast growing component of the carpet market. These fiber advantages have been extended into the Company’s rug production, as well, adding luxurious feel and performance enhancements to the Company’s design leadership. In laminate, the Company’s installation technology revolutionized the category, and the Company continues to deliver new innovations with more realistic visuals and surface embossing in register that precisely recreates the appearance of wood and water resistance that has extended the category into kitchens and baths. In wood flooring, the Company is introducing longer and wider planks in increasingly popular engineered collections, as well as introducing more fashion-forward stains, finishes and surface protection. The Company’s vinyl offerings reflect significant investments in leading-edge technology that yield incredibly realistic reproductions of stone, wood and other materials with embossed finishes that accentuate the beauty of the products.

Operational Excellence

Mohawk’s highly efficient manufacturing and distribution assets serve as the foundation for successful growth. By leveraging continuous process improvement and automation, the Company’s operations drive innovation, quality and value. Through its commitment to sustainability practices, the Company has also optimized natural resources and raw materials. Since 2013, the Company has invested approximately $4 billion to expand capacity, introduce differentiated new products and improve efficiencies. In particular, the Company’s capital investments have improved recently acquired businesses by upgrading their product offerings, expanding their distribution and improving their productivity. For more than a decade, Mohawk’s training and development programs have been ranked among the best by

Training

magazine, and

Forbes

designated Mohawk as one of the Best Large U.S. Employers from 2016 through 2018.

Sustainability

The Company believes that it is the industry leader in sustainable products and processes. The Company’s extensive use of recycled content in its products includes the annual use of over 6.2 billion plastic bottles to create polyester carpet fiber and more than 42 million pounds of tires to produce decorative crumb rubber mats. In all, the Company diverts more than 6.5 billion pounds of waste from landfills each year, with 47 of the Company’s manufacturing sites internally certified as Zero Process Waste to Landfill facilities. The Company’s commitment to sustainability extends beyond its products to resource utilization, including a 442-million gallon reduction in water use since 2015, lower greenhouse gas emissions and increased energy efficiency. The

Company also produces energy through solar panels, windmills and a waste to energy program using scrap material. The Company’s commitment to safety and wellness helps to retain a talented workforce. The Company currently operates 19 on-site, near-site or virtual Healthy Life Centers to assist employees with management of chronic conditions as well as the treatment of acute illness. The Company’s annual sustainability report details these and other initiatives and may be accessed at http://www.mohawksustainability.com.

Inputs and Suppliers

Global Ceramic Segment

The principal raw materials used in the production of ceramic tile are clay, talc, industrial minerals and glazes.  The Company has long-term clay mining rights in North America, Russia, Bulgaria and Brazil that satisfy a portion of its clay requirements for producing tile. The Company also purchases a number of different grades of clay for the manufacture of its tile.  Glazes are used on a significant percentage of manufactured tiles.  Glazes consist of frit (ground glass), zircon, stains and other materials, with frit being the largest ingredient. The Company manufactures a significant amount of its frit requirements.  The Company believes that there is an adequate supply of all grades of clay, talc and industrial minerals that are readily available from a number of independent sources.  If these suppliers were unable to satisfy the Company’s requirements, the Company believes that alternative supply arrangements would be available.

Flooring NA Segment

The principal raw materials used in the production of carpet and rugs are polypropelene, polyester, triexta, nylon, caprolactam, recycled post-consumer plastics, synthetic backing materials, latex and various dyes and chemicals, the majority of which are petroleum based.

Industry and Competition

The Company is the largest flooring manufacturer in a fragmented industry composed of a wide variety of companies ranging from small, privately-held firms to large multinationals.  In


, the U.S. floor covering industry reported $25.4 billion in sales, up approximately 4.8% over 2016’s sales of $24.5 billion.  In


, the primary categories of flooring in the U.S., based on sales, were carpet and rugs (45.4%), resilient (includes sheet vinyl and LVT) and rubber (17.0%), ceramic tile (14.3%), wood (13.7%), stone (5.7%) and laminate (3.9%).  In


, the primary categories of flooring in the U.S., based on square feet, were carpet and rugs (51.2%), resilient (includes sheet vinyl and LVT) and rubber (21.2%), ceramic tile (14.3%), wood (7.2%), laminate (4.6%) and stone (1.5%).  Each of these categories is influenced by the residential and commercial construction, and residential and commercial remodeling end-use markets. These markets are influenced by many factors including changing consumer preferences, consumer confidence, spending for durable goods, interest rates, inflation, availability of credit, turnover in housing and the overall strength of the economy.

The principal methods of competition within the floor covering industry generally are product innovation, style, quality, price, performance technology and service. In each of the markets, price and market coverage are particularly important when competing among product lines. The Company actively seeks to differentiate its products in the marketplace by introducing innovative products with premium features that provide a superior value proposition.  The Company’s investments in manufacturing technology, computer systems and distribution network, as well as the Company’s marketing strategies and resources, contribute to its ability to compete on the basis of performance, quality, style and service, rather than price.

Global Ceramic Segment

Globally, the ceramic tile industry is significantly fragmented. Certain regions around the world have established sufficient capacity to allow them to meet domestic needs in addition to exporting product to other markets where their design and/or technical advantages may drive consumer preferences. Some mature markets have seen industry consolidation driven by mergers and acquisitions, however most markets are comprised of many relatively small manufacturers all working with similar technologies, raw materials and designs. During


, the estimated global capacity for ceramic tile was 146 billion square feet, with selling prices varying widely based on a variety of factors, including supply within the market, materials used, size, shape and design. While the Company operates ceramic manufacturing facilities in eight countries, the Company has leveraged advantages in technology, design, brand recognition and marketing to extend exports of its products to approximately 160 countries. As a result of this global sales strategy, the Company faces competition in the ceramic tile market from a large number of foreign and domestic manufacturers, all of which compete for sales of ceramic tile to customers through multiple residential and commercial channels. The Company believes it is the largest manufacturer, distributor and marketer of ceramic tile in the world. The Company also believes it is the largest manufacturer, distributor and marketer of ceramic tile in specific markets, including the U.S., Europe and Russia, as well as maintaining leading positions in the Mexican and Brazilian markets. The Company has leveraged the advantages of its scale, product innovation and unique designs in these markets to solidify its leadership position, however the Company continues to face pressures in these markets from imported ceramic products as well as alternate flooring categories.

Flooring NA Segment

The North American flooring industry is highly competitive, with an increasing variety of product categories, shifting consumer preferences and pressures from imported products, particularly in the rug and hard surface categories. Based on industry publications, in 2017, the U.S. flooring industry had carpet and rug sales in excess of $11.5 billion out of the overall $25.4 billion market. The Company believes it is the largest producer of rugs and the second largest producer of carpet in the world based on its


net sales. The Company differentiates its carpet and rug products in the market place through proprietary fiber systems, state-of-the-art manufacturing technologies and unique styling as well as leveraging the strength of some of the oldest and best known brands in the industry. The Company also believes it is the largest manufacturer and distributor of laminate flooring in the U.S. as well as one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of solid and engineered wood flooring.  The Company’s leading position in laminate flooring is driven by the strength of its premium brands as well as technical innovations such as water resistance, realistic visuals, beveled edges, deeply embossed in register surfaces and patented installation technologies. The U.S. resilient industry is highly competitive, and according to industry publications, grew over 17% in


. Based on industry publications, the U.S. flooring industry for LVT and sheet vinyl in


had market sales of $4.5 billion of the overall flooring market. The Company believes that it is one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of LVT and sheet vinyl in the U.S. The Company’s sheet vinyl operations produce fiberglass backed products, which have proven more popular with consumers in the past several years.



Index to Financial Statements

Flooring ROW Segment

The Company faces competition in the non-U.S. laminate, wood, LVT and sheet vinyl flooring business from a large number of domestic manufacturers as well as pressures from imports. The Company believes it is one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of laminate flooring in the world, with a focus on high-end products, which the Company supplies under some of the best known and most widely marketed brands in its regions. In addition, the Company believes it has a competitive advantage in its laminate flooring markets as a result of the Company’s industry-leading water resistance, realistic visuals and embossed in register surfaces as well as patented installation technologies, all of which allow the Company to distinguish its products in the areas of design, performance, installation and assembly. In wood flooring, the Company has extended the strength of its well-known laminate brands and its installation technologies to add value to its wood collections. The Company faces competition in the non-U.S. vinyl flooring channel from a large number of domestic and foreign manufacturers, but believes it has a competitive advantage in its LVT and sheet vinyl markets due to industry-leading design, patented technologies, brand recognition and vertical integration. The Company has elevated the performance of its sheet vinyl collections and is now aggressively placing the product in commercial applications. After initially extending its geographic footprint by acquiring national hard surface distributors in Australia and New Zealand, the Company acquired Godfrey Hirst in 2018, making the Company the largest manufacturer of carpet in both countries. The Company is integrating its soft and hard surface businesses to provide a comprehensive offering to residential and commercial customers in the region. In Australia and New Zealand, the Company faces competition from a large number of domestic and foreign manufacturers, but believes it has a competitive advantage in its carpet and hard surface offering due to industry-leading design, patented technologies, brand recognition and vertical integration. Through a 2015 acquisition, the Company has extended its insulation panel business to the U.K. and Ireland while expanding sales in its core Benelux Region.

The Flooring ROW Segment owns a number of patent families in Europe and the U.S., some of which the Company licenses to manufacturers throughout the world.  The Company continues to explore additional opportunities to generate revenue from its patent portfolio, including in applications for LVT.

Sales Terms and Major Customers

The Company’s sales terms are substantially the same as those generally available throughout the industry. The Company generally permits its customers to return products purchased from it within specified time periods from the date of sale, if the customer is not satisfied with the quality of the product.

During


, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of total net sales and the top 10 customers accounted for less than 20% of the Company’s net sales. The Company believes the loss of one major customer would not have a material adverse effect on its business.

Employees

As of

December 31, 2018

, the Company employed approximately 42,100 persons, consisting of approximately 21,000 in the United States, approximately 9,800 in Europe, approximately 3,900 in Mexico, approximately 3,900 in Russia and approximately 3,500 in other countries.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

In addition to the other information provided in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating an investment in shares of the Company’s Common Stock.  If any of the events described in these risks were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

The floor covering industry is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, such as consumer confidence, income and spending, corporate and government spending, interest rate levels, availability of credit and demand for housing. Significant or prolonged declines in the U.S. or global economies could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

Downturns in the U.S. and global economies negatively impact the floor covering industry and the Company’s business.  During times of economic uncertainty or decline, end consumers tend to spend less on remodeling their homes, which is how the Company derives a majority of its sales. Likewise, new home construction - and the corresponding need for new flooring materials - tends to slow down during recessionary periods. There may be downturns in the foreseeable future that could cause the industry to deteriorate globally or in the local markets in which the Company operates. A significant or prolonged decline in residential or commercial remodeling or new construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations.

The Company may be unable to predict customer preferences or demand accurately, or to respond to technological developments.

The Company operates in a market sector where demand is strongly influenced by rapidly changing customer preferences as to product design, product category and technical features.  Failure to quickly and effectively respond to changing customer demand or technological developments could have a material adverse effect on the business.

The Company faces intense competition in the flooring industry that could decrease demand for the Company’s products or force it to lower prices, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

The floor covering industry is highly competitive. The Company faces competition from a number of manufacturers and independent distributors.  Maintaining the Company’s competitive position may require substantial investments in the Company’s product development efforts, manufacturing facilities, distribution network and sales and marketing activities. Competitive pressures may also result in decreased demand for the Company’s products, force the Company to lower prices or prevent the Company from raising prices to keep up with inflation. Moreover, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and input costs may contribute to more attractive pricing for imports that compete with the Company’s products, which may put pressure on the Company’s pricing.  Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

Changes in the global economy could affect the Company’s overall availability and cost of credit.

A downturn in the U.S. or global economies could impact the Company’s ability to obtain financing in the future, including any financing necessary to refinance existing indebtedness.

Further, negative economic conditions may factor into the Company’s periodic credit ratings assessment by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”), Standard & Poor’s Financial Services, LLC (“S&P”) and Fitch, Inc.  Any future changes in the credit rating agencies’ methodology in assessing the Company’s credit strength and any downgrades in the Company’s credit ratings could increase the cost of its existing credit and could adversely affect the cost of and ability to obtain additional credit in the future. The Company can provide no assurances that downgrades will not occur. The cost and availability of credit during uncertain economic times could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition.



Index to Financial Statements

If the Company were unable to meet certain covenants contained in its existing credit facilities, it may be required to repay borrowings under the credit facilities prior to their maturity and may lose access to the credit facilities for additional borrowings that may be necessary to fund its operations and growth strategy.

On March 26, 2015, the Company entered into a

$1,800 million

, senior revolving credit facility (the “2015 Senior Credit Facility”).  As of

December 31, 2018

, the amount utilized under the 2015 Senior Credit Facility was

$1,452.3 million

resulting in a total of

$347.7 million

available. The amount utilized included

$1,339.8 million

of commercial paper issued,

$57.9 million

of direct borrowings, and

$54.6 million

of standby letters of credit related to various insurance contracts and foreign vendor commitments.

If the Company’s cash flow is worse than expected, the Company may need to refinance all or a portion of its indebtedness through a public and/or private debt offering or a new bank facility and may not be able to do so on terms acceptable to it, or at all. If the Company is unable to access debt markets at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts due to credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, or weakness in the Company’s businesses, the Company’s ability to finance its operations or repay existing debt obligations may be materially and adversely affected.

Additionally, the Company’s credit facilities include certain affirmative and negative covenants that impose restrictions on the Company’s financial and business operations, including limitations on liens, indebtedness, fundamental changes, asset dispositions, dividends and other similar restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, payments and modifications of certain existing debt, future negative pledges, and changes in the nature of the Company’s business.  In addition, the 2015 Senior Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of at least 3.0 to 1.0 and a Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of no more than 3.75 to 1.0.  A failure to comply with the obligations contained in our current or future credit facilities or indentures relating to our outstanding public debt could result in an event of default or an acceleration of debt under other instruments that may contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. We cannot be certain that we would have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments.

Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and may affect the comparability of results between the Company’s financial periods.

The results of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars from the local currency for consolidated reporting. The exchange rates between some of these currencies and the U.S. dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future. The Company may not be able to manage effectively the Company’s currency translation risks, and volatility in currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and affect comparability of the Company’s results between financial periods.

The Company has significant operations in emerging markets, including Brazil, eastern Europe, Malaysia, Mexico and Russia, and therefore has exposure to doing business in potentially unstable areas of the world.

Operations in emerging markets are subject to greater risk than more developed markets, including in some cases significant legal, economic and political risks.  Market conditions and the political structures that support them are subject to rapid change in these economies, and the Company may not be able to react quickly enough to protect its assets and business operations.  In particular, developing markets in which the Company operates may be characterized by one or more of the following:

•

complex and conflicting laws and regulations, which may be inconsistently or arbitrarily enforced;

•

high incidences of corruption in state regulatory agencies;

•

volatile inflation;

•

widespread poverty and resulting political instability;

•

compliance with laws governing international relations, including U.S. laws that relate to sanctions and corruption;

•

immature legal and banking systems;

•

uncertainty with respect to title to real and personal property;

•

underdeveloped infrastructure;

•

heavy state control of natural resources and energy supplies;

•

state ownership of transportation and supply chain assets;



Index to Financial Statements

•

high protective tariffs and inefficient customs processes; and

•

high crime rates.

Changes in any one or a combination of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

In periods of rising costs, the Company may be unable to pass raw materials, labor, energy and fuel-related cost increases on to its customers, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company

’

s business.

The prices of raw materials, labor, energy and fuel-related costs vary significantly with market conditions. Although the Company generally attempts to pass on increases in raw material, labor, energy and fuel-related costs to its customers, the Company’s ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase, competitive pressures and market conditions for the Company’s products. There have been in the past, and may be in the future, periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be recovered. During such periods of time, the Company’s business may be materially adversely affected.

The Company may be unable to obtain raw materials or sourced product on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

The principal raw materials used in the Company’s manufacturing operations include triexta, nylon, polypropylene, and polyester resins and fibers, which are used in the Company’s carpet and rug business; clay, talc, nepheline syenite and glazes, including frit (ground glass), zircon and stains, which are used in the Company’s ceramic tile business; wood, paper and resins, which are used in the Company’s wood and laminate flooring business; and glass fiber, plasticizers, and pvc resins, which are used in the Company’s vinyl and luxury vinyl tile business. In addition to raw materials, the Company sources finished goods. For certain raw materials and sourced products, the Company is dependent on one or a small number of suppliers. An adverse change in the Company’s relationship with such a supplier, the financial condition of such a supplier or such supplier’s ability to manufacture or deliver such raw materials or sourced products to the Company could lead to an interruption of supply or require the Company to purchase more expensive alternatives. An extended interruption in the supply of these or other raw materials or sourced products used in the Company’s business or in the supply of suitable substitute materials or products would disrupt the Company’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

The Company makes significant capital investments in its business and such capital investments may not be successful or achieve their intended results.

The Company’s business requires significant capital investment to expand capacity to support its growth, introduce new products and improve operating efficiencies.  Since 2013, the Company has invested approximately $4 billion in capital projects and intends to make similar capital investments in future periods, including between $550-$580 million of capital investments in 2019.  While the Company believes that many of its past capital investments have been successful, there is no guarantee that the return on investment from the Company’s recent or future capital projects will be sufficient to recover the expenses and opportunity costs associated with these projects.  Furthermore, a meaningful portion of the Company’s capital investment is based on forecasted growth in its business, which is subject to uncertainty such as general economic trends, increased competition and consumer preferences.  If the Company does not accurately forecast its future capital investment needs, the Company could have excess capacity or insufficient capacity, either of which would negatively affect its revenues and profitability.

The Company relies on information systems in managing the Company’s operations and any system failure or

deficiencies of such systems may have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.

The Company’s businesses rely on sophisticated software applications to obtain, process, analyze and manage data. The Company relies on these systems to, among other things:

•

facilitate the purchase, management, distribution, and payment for inventory items;

•

manage and monitor the daily operations of the Company’s distribution network;

•

receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis;

•

manage accurate billing to and collections from customers;

•

control logistics and quality control for the Company’s retail operations;



Index to Financial Statements

•

manage financial reporting; and

•

monitor point of sale activity.

The Company also relies on its computer hardware, software and network for the storage, delivery and transmission of data to the Company’s sales and distribution systems, and certain of the Company’s production processes are managed and conducted by computer.

Any event that causes interruptions to the input, retrieval and transmission of data or increase in the service time, whether caused by human error, natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses, system conversion, cyber attacks including and not limited to hacking, intrusions, malware or otherwise, could disrupt our normal operations. There can be no assurance that the Company can effectively carry out our disaster recovery plan to handle the failure of our information systems, or that we will be able to restore our operational capacity within sufficient time to avoid material disruption to our business. The occurrence of any of these events could cause unanticipated disruptions in service, decreased customer service and customer satisfaction, harm to the Company’s reputation and loss or misappropriation of sensitive information, which could result in loss of customers, increased operating expenses and financial losses. Any such events could in turn have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.

The Company’s inability to maintain its patent licensing revenues could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

The profit margins of certain of the Company’s businesses, particularly the Company’s Flooring Rest of the World Segment, depend in part upon the Company’s ability to obtain, maintain and license proprietary technology used in the Company’s principal product families. The Company has obtained a number of patents relating to the Company’s products and associated methods and has filed applications for additional patents, including the UNICLIC and Pergo family of patents, which protect its interlocking flooring technology. The majority of the UNICLIC patents expired in 2017. The Company continues to develop new sources of revenue that may partially offset the expiration of its revenue-producing patents. The failure to develop alternative revenues could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

The Company may experience certain risks associated with acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments.

The Company intends to grow its business through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. Growth through acquisitions involves risks, many of which may continue to affect the Company after the acquisition. The Company cannot give assurance that an acquired company will achieve the levels of revenue, profitability and production that the Company expects. Acquisitions may require the issuance of additional securities or the incurrence of additional indebtedness, which may dilute the ownership interests of existing security holders or impose higher interest costs on the Company. Additional challenges related to the Company’s acquisition strategy include:

•

maintaining executive offices in different locations;

•

manufacturing and selling different types of products through different distribution channels;

•

conducting business from various locations;

•

maintaining different operating systems and software on different computer hardware; and

•

retaining key employees.

Failure to successfully manage and integrate an acquisition with the Company’s existing operations could lead to the potential loss of customers of the acquired business, the potential loss of employees who may be vital to the new operations, the potential loss of business opportunities or other adverse consequences that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. Even if integration occurs successfully, failure of the acquisition to achieve levels of anticipated sales growth, profitability, or otherwise perform as expected, may result in goodwill or other asset impairments or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. Finally, acquisition targets may be subject to material liabilities that are not properly identified in due diligence and that are not covered by seller indemnification obligation or third party insurance. The unknown liabilities of the Company’s acquisition targets may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

In addition, the Company has made certain investments, including through joint ventures, in which the Company has a minority equity interest and lack management and operational control. The controlling joint venture partner may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with those of the Company. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of



Index to Financial Statements

the controlling joint venture partner, or the joint venture company, may result in harm to the Company’s reputation or adversely affect the value of the Company’s investment in the joint venture.

A failure to identify suitable acquisition candidates or partners for strategic investments and to complete acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

As part of the Company’s business strategy, the Company intends to pursue a wide array of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of complementary businesses, as well as strategic investments and joint ventures. Although the Company regularly evaluates such opportunities, the Company may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates or to obtain sufficient financing on acceptable terms to fund such strategic transactions, which may slow the Company’s growth and have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

The Company manufactures, sources and sells many products internationally and is exposed to risks associated with doing business globally.

The Company’s international activities are significant to its manufacturing capacity, revenues and profits; and the Company is further expanding internationally. The Company sells products, operates plants and invests in companies around the world.  Currently, the Company’s Flooring ROW segment has significant operations in Europe, Russia, Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand, and the Company’s Global Ceramic segment has significant operations in Brazil, Europe, Russia and Mexico.  In addition, the Company has invested in joint ventures in Brazil and India related to laminate flooring.

The business, regulatory and political environments in these countries differ from those in the U.S.  The Company’s international sales, operations and investments are subject to risks and uncertainties, including:

•

changes in foreign country regulatory requirements;

•

differing business practices associated with foreign operations;

•

various import/export restrictions and the availability of required import/export licenses;

•

imposition of foreign or domestic tariffs and other trade barriers;

•

foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;

•

differing inflationary or deflationary market pressures;

•

foreign country tax rules, regulations and other requirements, such as changes in tax rates and statutory and judicial interpretations in tax laws;

•

differing labor laws and changes in those laws;

•

work stoppages and disruptions in the shipping of imported and exported products;

•

government price controls;

•

extended payment terms and the inability to collect accounts receivable;

•

potential difficulties repatriating cash from non-U.S. subsidiaries; and

•

compliance with laws governing international relations, including those U.S. laws that relate to sanctions and corruption.

Specifically, in Europe, the uncertainty surrounding the U.K.’s participation in the European Union and European Single Market following Britain’s notice to the European Union of its decision to exit the EU (“Brexit”) may result in greater restrictions on trade between the UK and EU, which could negatively impact the Company’s results. Additionally, Brexit has caused significant volatility in currency exchange rates. Sales generated by the Company’s U.K. businesses may be negatively impacted when they are translated from the British pound to the U.S. dollar.

The Company cannot assure investors that it will succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies to address the foregoing risks effectively in each location where the Company does business, and, therefore that the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

Negative tax consequences could materially and adversely affect the Company

’

s business.

The Company is subject to the tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which it operates.  These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to our facts is sometimes open to interpretation.  In calculating the provision for income taxes,  the Company must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws.  Our domestic and international tax liabilities are largely dependent upon the distribution of profit before tax among these many jurisdictions.  However, it also includes estimates of additional tax which may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the Company that could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets. The Company’s future results of operations and tax liability could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the overall profitability of the Company, changes in tax legislation and rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns, and ongoing assessments of the Company’s tax exposures.

The Company has been, and in the future may be, subject to costs, liabilities and other obligations under existing or new laws and regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

The Company is subject to increasingly numerous and complex laws, regulations and licensing requirements in each of the jurisdictions in which the Company conducts business. The Company faces risks and uncertainties related to compliance with such laws and regulations. In addition, new laws and regulations may be enacted in the U.S. or abroad that may require the Company to incur additional personnel-related, environmental, or other costs on an ongoing basis, such as recently enacted healthcare legislation in the United States.

In particular, the Company’s operations are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, and the use, storage, treatment, recycling and disposal of materials and finished product. The applicable requirements under these laws are subject to amendment, to the imposition of new or additional requirements and to changing interpretations of agencies or courts. The Company could incur material expenditures to comply with new or existing regulations, including fines and penalties and increased costs of its operations. For example, the Company’s manufacturing facilities may become subject to further limitations on the emission of “greenhouse gases” due to public policy concerns regarding climate change issues or other environmental or health and safety concerns. While the form of any additional regulations cannot be predicted, a “cap-and-trade” system similar to the system that applies to the Company’s businesses in the European Union could be adopted in the United States. The Company’s manufacturing processes use a significant amount of energy, especially natural gas. Any such “cap-and-trade” system or other limitations imposed on the emission of “greenhouse gases” could require the Company to increase our capital expenditures, use its cash to acquire emission credits or restructure our manufacturing operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

The Company’s business operations could suffer significant losses from natural disasters, catastrophes, fire or other unexpected events.

Many of the Company’s business activities involve substantial investments in manufacturing facilities and many products are produced at a limited number of locations. These facilities could be materially damaged by natural disasters, such as floods, tornados, hurricanes and earthquakes, or by fire or other unexpected events. The Company could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from such events, including damage to its reputation, and/or suffer material losses in operational capacity, which could have a material adverse impact on its business.

The Company may be exposed to litigation, claims and other legal proceedings relating to its products, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to a variety of product-related claims, lawsuits and legal proceedings, including those relating to product liability, product warranty, product recall, personal injury, and other matters. A very large claim or several similar claims asserted by a large class of plaintiffs could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, if the Company is unable to successfully defend against or resolve these matters or if its insurance coverage is insufficient to satisfy any judgments against the Company or settlements relating to these matters. Although the Company has product liability insurance, the policies may not provide coverage for certain claims against the Company or may not be sufficient to cover all possible liabilities. Further, the Company may not be able to maintain insurance at commercially acceptable premium levels.



Index to Financial Statements

Moreover, adverse publicity arising from claims made against the Company, even if the claims are not successful, could adversely affect the Company’s reputation or the reputation and sales of its products.

The Company’s inability to protect its intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business

The Company relies, in part, on the patent, trade secret and trademark laws of the U.S., countries in the European Union and elsewhere, as well as confidentiality agreements with some of the Company’s employees, to protect that technology.  The Company cannot assure investors that any patents owned by or issued to it will provide the Company with competitive advantages, that third parties will not challenge these patents, or that the Company’s pending patent applications will be approved. The Company may be unable to prevent competitors and/or third parties from using the Company’s technology without the Company’s authorization, independently developing technology that is similar to that of the Company or designing around the Company’s patents.

Furthermore, despite the Company’s efforts, the Company may be unable to prevent competitors and/or third parties from using the Company’s technology without the Company’s authorization, independently developing technology that is similar to that of the Company or designing around the Company’s patents. The use of the Company’s technology or similar technology by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage the Company has developed, cause the Company to lose sales or otherwise harm the Company’s business.

The Company has obtained and applied for numerous U.S. and foreign service marks and trademark registrations and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional service marks and trademarks, as appropriate. The Company cannot guarantee that any of the Company’s pending or future applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities.  A failure to obtain trademark registrations in the U.S. and in other countries could limit the Company’s ability to protect the Company’s trademarks and impede the Company’s marketing efforts in those jurisdictions and could have a material effect on the Company’s business.

The Company generally requires third parties with access to the Company’s trade secrets to agree to keep such information confidential. While such measures are intended to protect the Company’s trade secrets, there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that the Company will have adequate remedies for any breach or that the Company’s confidential and proprietary information and technology will not be independently developed by or become otherwise known to third parties. In any of these circumstances, the Company’s competitiveness could be significantly impaired, which would limit the Company’s growth and future revenue.

Third parties may claim that the Company infringed their intellectual property or proprietary rights, which could cause it to incur significant expenses or prevent it from selling the Company’s products.

In the past, third parties have claimed that certain technologies incorporated in the Company’s products infringe their patent rights.  The Company cannot be certain that the Company’s products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others.

The Company might be required to pay substantial damages (including punitive damages and attorney’s fees), discontinue the use and sale of infringing products, expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology or obtain licenses authorizing the use of infringing technology. There can be no assurance that licenses for disputed technology or intellectual property rights would be available on reasonable commercial terms, if at all. In the event of a successful claim against the Company along with failure to develop or license a substitute technology, the Company’s business would be materially and adversely affected.

The long-term performance of the Company’s business relies on its ability to attract, develop and retain talented management.

To be successful, the Company must attract, develop and retain qualified and talented personnel in management, sales, marketing, product design, and operations, and as it considers entering new international markets, skilled personnel familiar with those markets. The Company competes with multinational firms for these employees and invests resources in recruiting, developing, motivating and retaining them. The failure to attract, develop, motivate and retain key employees could negatively affect the Company’s competitive position and its operating results.



Index to Financial Statements

The Company is subject to changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both costs and the risk of noncompliance.

The Company’s stock is publicly traded. As a result, the Company is subject to the rules and regulations of federal and state agencies and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. These entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange, frequently issue new requirements and regulations. The Company’s efforts to comply with the regulations and interpretations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative costs and diversion of management’s time and attention from profit generating activities to compliance activities.

The Company

’

s stock price is subject to volatility.

The Company’s stock price has experienced price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. The Company, the flooring industry and the stock market have experienced stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. Additionally, price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time.

Declines in the Company’s business conditions may result in an impairment of the Company’s assets which could result in a material non-cash charge.

A significant or prolonged decrease in the Company’s market capitalization, including a decline in stock price, or a negative long-term performance outlook, could result in an impairment of its assets which results when the carrying value of the Company’s assets exceed their fair value.

Forward-Looking Information

Certain of the statements in this Form 10-K, particularly those anticipating future performance, business prospects, growth and operating strategies, and similar matters, and those that include the words “could,” “should,” “believes,” “anticipates,” “expects” and “estimates” or similar expressions constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. For those statements, Mohawk claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. There can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements will be accurate because they are based on many assumptions, which involve risks and uncertainties. The following important factors could cause future results to differ: changes in economic or industry conditions; competition; inflation and deflation in freight, raw material prices and other input costs; inflation and deflation in consumer markets; currency fluctuations; energy costs and supply; timing and level of capital expenditures; timing and implementation of price increases for the Company’s products; impairment charges; integration of acquisitions; international operations; introduction of new products; rationalization of operations; tax and tax reform, product and other claims; litigation; regulatory and political changes in the jurisdictions in which the Company does business; and other risks identified in Mohawk’s SEC reports and public announcements.

Legal Proceedings

The Company is involved in litigation from time to time in the regular course of its business. Except as noted below, there are no material legal proceedings pending or known by the Company to be contemplated to which the Company is a party or to which any of its property is subject.

Alabama Municipal Litigation

In September 2016, the Water Works and Sewer Board of the City of Gadsden, Alabama (the “Gadsden Water Board”) filed an individual complaint in the Circuit Court of Etowah County, Alabama against certain manufacturers, suppliers, and users of chemicals containing specific perfluorinated compounds, including the Company. On October 26, 2016, the defendants removed the case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, Middle Division, alleging diversity of citizenship and fraudulent joinder. The Gadsden Water Board filed a motion to remand the case back to the state court, and the defendants opposed the Gadsden Water Board’s motion. The federal court granted Gadsden Water Board’s motion for remand.

In May 2017, the Water Works and Sewer Board of the Town of Centre, Alabama (the “Centre Water Board“) filed a very similar complaint to the Gadsden Water Board complaint in the Circuit Court of Cherokee County. On June 19, 2017, the defendants removed this case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, Middle Division, again alleging diversity of citizenship and fraudulent joinder. The Centre Water Board filed a motion to remand the case back to state court, and the defendants opposed the Centre Water Board’s motion. The federal court granted Centre Water Board's motion for remand.

Certain defendants, including the Company, filed dispositive motions in each case arguing that the state court lacks personal jurisdiction over them. Both state courts denied those motions. In June and September 2018, certain defendants, including the Company, petitioned the Alabama Supreme Court for Writs of Mandamus directing each lower court to enter an order granting the defendants’ dispositive motions on personal jurisdiction grounds. Those petitions have been fully briefed and the Company awaits a decision from the Alabama Supreme Court.

The Company has never manufactured the perfluorinated compounds at issue but purchased them for use in the manufacture of its carpets prior to 2007. The Gadsden and Centre Water Boards are not alleging that chemical levels in the Company’s wastewater discharge exceeded legal limits. Instead, the Gadsden and Centre Water Boards are seeking lost profits based on allegations that their customers decreased water purchases, as well as reimbursement for the cost of a filter and punitive damages.

respectively, including penalties, but excluding interest. The Belgian tax authority denied the Company’s formal protests against these assessments and the Company brought all six years before the Court of First Appeal in Bruges. The Court of First Appeal in Bruges ruled in favor of the Company on January 27, 2016, with respect to the calendar years ending December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2009; and on June 13, 2018, the Court of First Appeal in Bruges, ruled in favor of the Company with respect to the calendar years ending December 31, 2006, December 31, 2007, December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2010. The Belgian tax authority has lodged its Notification of Appeal for all six years with the Ghent Court of Appeal. In December 2018, the Belgian tax authority issued an assessment for the year ended December 31, 2011, in the amount of €37,991 including penalties, but excluding interest. In January of 2019, the Company received a “Notice of Change” from the Belgian tax authority for tax years 2012 through 2017 in the amount of €

, €

23,522

, €

, €

and €

78,174

respectively, including penalties, but excluding interest. The Company intends to respond to these notices in a timely manner and will file formal protests should the tax authority issue assessments for these years. The Notices of Change are based on largely the same facts underlying the positive rulings, which the Belgian tax authority is appealing.

The Company continues to disagree with the views of the Belgian tax authority on this matter and will persist in its vigorous defense. Nevertheless, on May 24, 2016, the tax collector representing the Belgian tax authorities imposed a lien on the Company’s properties in Wielsbeke (Ooigemstraat and Breestraat), Oostrozebeke (Ingelmunstersteenweg) and Desselgem (Waregemstraat) included in the Flooring ROW segment. The purpose of the lien is to provide security for payment should the Belgian tax authority prevail on its appeal. The lien does not interfere with the Company’s operations at these properties.

General

The Company believes that adequate provisions for resolution of all contingencies, claims and pending litigation have been made for probable losses that are reasonably estimable. These contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and the Company is unable to estimate the amount or range of loss, if any, in excess of amounts accrued. The Company does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition but could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, cash flows or liquidity in a given quarter or year.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

Mohawk is a significant supplier of every major flooring category with manufacturing operations in 19 nations and sales in more than 170 countries. Based on its annual sales, the Company believes it is the world’s largest flooring manufacturer. A majority of the Company’s long-lived assets are located in the United States and Europe, which are also the Company’s primary markets. The Company expects continued growth in the United States market consistent with residential housing starts and remodeling investments and has invested significantly in state-of-the-art manufacturing to create aspirational products to delight consumers with beauty and performance. The Company also is a leading provider of flooring for the U.S. commercial market and has earned significant recognition for its innovation in design and performance and sustainable practices. Additionally, the Company maintains significant operations in Europe, Russia, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil and other parts of the world. The Company is growing share in many markets through its differentiated products, especially its ceramic tile collections.

During the past two decades, the Company has grown significantly. Its current geographic breadth and diverse product offering are reflected in three reporting segments: Global Ceramic; Flooring North America (“Flooring NA”); and Flooring Rest of the World (“Flooring ROW”). The Global Ceramic Segment designs, manufactures, sources and markets a broad line of ceramic tile, porcelain tile, natural stone tile and other products including natural stone, quartz and porcelain slab countertops, which it distributes primarily in North America, Europe, Brazil and Russia through various selling channels, which include company-owned stores, independent distributors and home centers. The Flooring NA Segment designs, manufactures, sources and markets its floor covering product lines, including carpets, rugs, carpet cushion, wood, laminate and vinyl products, including luxury vinyl tile (LVT), which it distributes through its network of regional distribution centers and satellite warehouses using Company-operated trucks, common carrier or rail transportation. The Segment’s product lines are sold through various selling channels, including independent floor covering retailers, distributors, home centers, mass merchandisers, department stores, shop at home, online retailers, buying groups, commercial contractors and commercial end users. The Flooring ROW Segment designs, manufactures, sources, licenses and markets laminate, wood flooring, carpets, roofing elements, insulation boards, medium-density fiberboard (“MDF”), chipboards, other wood products and vinyl products, including LVT, which it distributes primarily in Europe, Russia, Australia and New Zealand through various selling channels, which include independent floor covering retailers, independent distributors, company-owned distributors, home centers, commercial contractors and commercial end users.

The Company expects sales growth to continue on a local basis in 2019, even with some softening in the European and Australian markets, offset by projected growth in Russia, Brazil and Mexico. The Company has also implemented multiple product price increases in most product categories due to escalating material, transportation and energy costs in most markets. The Company is managing through current macroeconomic headwinds including significant inflation, a strong U.S. dollar that is impacting currency translation as well as strengthening the competiveness of imports in the U.S. and slowing housing markets in a number of countries. While focused on addressing current conditions, the Company also established a long-term growth strategy, which includes strategic acquisitions in key growth markets and targeted internal investments that are expanding the Company’s geographic reach and product portfolio.

In 2018, the Company completed five acquisitions: two that expanded the Company’s global footprint with leadership positions in major markets and three that expanded the Company’s product offering and distribution in Europe. The Godfrey Hirst acquisition established the Company as the largest flooring manufacturer in Australia and New Zealand, with leading carpet and hard surface positions in both countries when combined with the Company’s existing regional flooring distribution business.  Godfrey Hirst’s prestigious wool carpet collections are exported to numerous international markets and have been integrated into the U.S. soft surface product portfolio to expand sales. The acquisition of Brazil-based Eliane provided the Company with a leading ceramic tile position and the most appealing brand in one of the world’s largest ceramic markets and created a gateway into the overall South American market as Eliane is Brazil’s largest ceramic exporter.  The acquisition of Berghoef, a leading European mezzanine flooring company, created a leading position in a category that is rapidly expanding due to increased construction of e-commerce warehousing across the continent. The acquisition of Swiss and Italian hard surface distributors expanded the Company’s direct distribution of flooring sales in Europe.

In 2018, the Company invested over

$794.1 million

in capital projects to, introduce new product categories, enter new markets, expand capacity of constrained premium products and improve productivity.  In 2019, the Company plans to invest an additional $550-$580 million in its existing businesses to complete projects that were begun in 2018 and to commence new initiatives. The largest investments during this two-year period are the expansion of LVT in the U.S. and Europe, including the launch of manufactured rigid LVT collections; ceramic capacity increases in the U.S., Mexico, Italy, Poland, Bulgaria and Russia as well as in the Company’s newly acquired ceramic business in Brazil, where the Company is investing in new assets to dramatically improve profitability as it did with the Marazzi acquisition; new porcelain slab production in Europe and Russia; premium water-resistant laminate in the U.S., Europe and Russia; carpet tile in Europe; sheet vinyl and premium sanitary ware in Russia; quartz

countertops in the U.S., where the Company now produces and distributes materials for all kitchen and bath surfaces; and residential and commercial carpet in the U.S. and Australia, where the Company is investing in assets to expand its commercial carpet presence in the recent Godfrey Hirst acquisition.

Net earnings attributable to the Company were

$861.7 million

, or diluted EPS of

$11.47

for


compared to net earnings attributable to the Company of

$971.6 million

, or diluted EPS of

$12.98

for


. The

decrease

in EPS was primarily attributable

to higher inflation, higher start-up costs, and costs due to temporarily reducing production to align with softer market conditions,

partially offset by the favorable net impact of price and product mix, increased sales volume, productivity gained from capital investments, cost reduction initiatives and decreased income tax expense. The Company benefited from a lower effective tax rate as a result of the recent reforms in the U.S. and Belgium.

For the year ended

December 31, 2018

, the Company generated

$1,181.3 million

of cash from operating activities.  As of

December 31, 2018

$1,049.2 million

for an effective tax rate of

17.6%

, as compared to an income tax expense of

on earnings before income taxes of

$1,317.9 million

, resulting in an effective tax rate of

26.0%

for


. The decrease in the year-over-year tax expense of $158.9 million was primarily driven by the geographic dispersion of the Company’s earnings for 2018, subject to tax at the reduced rates in effect in the U.S. and Belgium, of $181.6 million, and the reduction to the transition tax and related tax planning initiatives of $163.4 million, partially offset by the one-time 2017 restatement of the Company’s deferred tax liabilities of $139.9 million, the one-time Italian tax planning election of $10.3 million, the restatement of certain state deferred tax assets of $20.4 million, and various other items of $15.5 million.

In December of 2017, the U.S. and Belgium enacted tax reform legislation.  The U.S. legislation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”), is the most significant and complex change to the U.S. tax law in more than 30 years and requires the combined effort of the Company’s finance, tax, and treasury departments to ensure the proper accounting of its comprehensive changes.  The most significant provisions of the TCJA, were the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, implementation of a territorial income tax regime, and imposition of a transition tax on the deemed repatriation of the accumulated earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries.  The most significant provisions of the Belgium legislation were the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 33.99% to 29.58% for 2018 and 2019, with a further reduction to 25% effective January 1, 2020, an annual limitation on the utilization of net operating losses, and creation of a consolidated corporate income tax regime.

As a result of the tax reform legislation, for the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a net tax expense of $0.8 million related primarily to the non-cash tax benefit of the revaluation of its Belgian deferred tax liabilities, the non-cash tax benefit of the provisional revaluation of its U.S. deferred tax liabilities, and the tax expense of the provisional accrual associated with the Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax.  This represented a reasonable estimate of the impact of all tax law changes on the Company’s financial statements in accordance with SAB 118.  In accordance with the SAB 118 measurement period, the Company has completed its accounting for the income tax effects of all elements of the TCJA. See Note 13-Income Taxes.

The decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to higher input costs of approximately $80 million, including increased material costs of approximately $76 million, costs associated with investments in expansion of production capacity of approximately $7 million, approximately $6 million of costs associated with investments in new product development, sales personnel, and marketing, the unfavorable net impact of exchange rates of approximately $5 million, and approximately $22 million in decreased sales volumes, primarily attributable to lower patent revenue. These decreases in operating income were partially offset by savings from capital investments and cost reduction initiatives of approximately $37 million, and the favorable net impact of price and product mix of approximately $80 million.

Interest expense

Interest expense was $31.1 million for 2017, reflecting a decrease of $9.4 million compared to interest expense of $40.5 million for 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to a shift in the Company’s borrowings to lower interest rate instruments.

Other expense (income)

Other expense was $5.2 million for 2017, reflecting an unfavorable change of $6.9 million compared to other income of $1.7 million for 2016. The change was primarily due to the increased unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates on transactions in the current year.

Income tax expense

For 2017, the Company recorded income tax expense of $343.2 million on earnings before income taxes of $1,317.9 million for an effective tax rate of 26.0%, as compared to an income tax expense of $307.6 million on earnings before income taxes of $1,241.1 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 24.8% for 2016. The increase in the year-over-year effective tax rate was the direct result of the geographic dispersion of the Company’s earnings for 2017, decreased by $44.4 million caused by the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities triggered by the Belgium corporate income tax reform, and increased by a one-time provisional net tax expense of $45.2 million resulting from the U.S. corporate income tax reform.

In December of 2017, the U.S. and Belgium enacted tax reform legislation.  The U.S. legislation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”), is the most significant and complex change to the U.S. tax law in more than 30 years.  The most significant provisions of the TCJA, were the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, implementation of a territorial income tax regime, and imposition of a transition tax on the deemed repatriation of the accumulated earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries.  The most significant provisions of the Belgium legislation were the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 33.99% to 29.58% for January 1, 2018 and January 1, 2019, respectively, with a further reduction to 25% effective January 1, 2020, an annual limitation on the utilization of net operating losses, and creation of a consolidated corporate income tax regime.

Accordingly, for the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a net tax expense of $0.8 million related primarily to the non-cash tax benefit of the revaluation of its Belgian deferred tax liabilities, the non-cash tax benefit of the provisional revaluation of its U.S. deferred tax liabilities, and the tax expense of the provisional accrual associated with the Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax. See Note 13-Income Taxes.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company’s primary liquidity requirements are for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. The Company’s liquidity needs are met primarily through a combination of internally generated funds, commercial paper, bank credit lines, term and senior notes and credit terms from suppliers.  As of

December 31, 2018

, the Company had a total of

$347.7 million

available under its 2015 Senior Credit Facility. The Company also maintains local currency revolving lines of credit and other credit facilities to provide liquidity to its businesses around the world.  None of such local facilities are material in amount.

Senior Credit Facility

On March 26, 2015, the Company amended and restated its 2013 senior credit facility increasing its size from

$1,000.0 million

to

$1,800.0 million

and extending the maturity from

September 25, 2018

to

March 26, 2020

(as amended and restated, the “2015 Senior Credit Facility”).  The 2015 Senior Credit Facility eliminated certain provisions in the 2013 Senior Credit Facility, including those that: (a) accelerated the maturity date to 90 days prior to the maturity of senior notes due in January 2016 if certain specified liquidity levels were not met; and (b) required that certain subsidiaries guarantee the Company’s obligations if the Company’s credit ratings fell below investment grade.  The 2015 Senior Credit Facility also modified certain negative covenants to provide the Company with additional flexibility, including flexibility to make acquisitions and incur additional indebtedness.

On March 1, 2016, the Company amended the 2015 Senior Credit Facility to, among other things, carve out from the general limitation on subsidiary indebtedness the issuance of Euro-denominated commercial paper notes by subsidiaries. Additionally, at several points in 2016, the Company extended the maturity date of the 2015 Senior Credit Facility from March 26, 2020 to March 26, 2021. In the first half of 2017, the Company amended the 2015 Senior Credit Facility to extend the maturity date from March 26, 2021 to March 26, 2022.

At the Company’s election, revolving loans under the 2015 Senior Credit Facility bear interest at annual rates equal to either (a) LIBOR for 1, 2, 3 or 6 month periods, as selected by the Company, plus an applicable margin ranging between 1.00% and 1.75% (

1.125%

as of

December 31, 2018

), or (b) the higher of the Wells Fargo Bank, National Association prime rate, the Federal Funds rate plus 0.5%, or the Eurocurrency Rate (as defined in the 2015 Senior Credit Facility) rate plus 1.0%, plus an applicable margin ranging between 0.00% and 0.75% (

0.125%

as of

December 31, 2018

).  The Company also pays a commitment fee to the lenders under the 2015 Senior Credit Facility on the average amount by which the aggregate commitments of the lenders exceed utilization of the 2015 Senior Credit Facility ranging from 0.10% to 0.225% per annum (

0.125%

as of

December 31, 2018

). The applicable margins and the commitment fee are determined based on whichever of the Company’s Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio or its senior unsecured debt rating (or if not available, corporate family rating) results in the lower applicable margins and commitment fee (with applicable margins and the commitment fee increasing as that ratio increases or those ratings decline, as applicable).

The obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries in respect of the 2015 Senior Credit Facility are unsecured.

The 2015 Senior Credit Facility includes certain affirmative and negative covenants that impose restrictions on the Company’s financial and business operations, including limitations on liens, subsidiary indebtedness, fundamental changes, asset dispositions, dividends and other similar restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, future negative pledges, and changes in the nature of the Company’s business. The Company is also required to maintain a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of at least 3.0 to 1.0 and a Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of no more than 3.75 to 1.0, each as of the last day of any fiscal quarter.  The limitations contain customary exceptions or, in certain cases, do not apply as long as the Company is in compliance with the financial ratio requirements and is not otherwise in default.



Index to Financial Statements

The 2015 Senior Credit Facility also contains customary representations and warranties and events of default, subject to customary grace periods.

In 2017, the Company paid financing costs of

$0.6 million

in connection with the extension of its 2015 Senior Credit Facility from March 26, 2021 to March 26, 2022.  These costs were deferred and, along with unamortized costs of

$6.9 million

are being amortized over the term of the 2015 Senior Credit Facility.

As of

December 31, 2018

, amounts utilized under the 2015 Senior Credit Facility included

$57.9 million

of borrowings and

$54.6 million

of standby letters of credit related to various insurance contracts and foreign vendor commitments.  The outstanding borrowings of

$1,339.8 million

under the Company’s U.S. and European commercial paper programs as of

December 31, 2018

reduce the availability of the 2015 Senior Credit Facility.  Including commercial paper borrowings, the Company has utilized

$1,452.3 million

under the 2015 Senior Credit Facility resulting in a total of

$347.7 million

available as of

December 31, 2018

.

Commercial Paper

On

February 28, 2014

and

July 31, 2015

, the Company established programs for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the United States and Eurozone capital markets, respectively. Commercial paper issued under the U.S. and European programs will have maturities ranging up to


and


days, respectively. None of the commercial paper notes may be voluntarily prepaid or redeemed by the Company and all rank pari passu with all of the Company’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. To the extent that the Company issues European commercial paper notes through a subsidiary of the Company, the notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company.

The Company uses its 2015 Senior Credit Facility as a liquidity backstop for its commercial paper programs. Accordingly, the total amount outstanding under all of the Company's commercial paper programs may not exceed

$1,800.0 million

(less any amounts drawn on the 2015 Senior Credit Facility) at any time.

The proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes will be available for general corporate purposes. As of

December 31, 2018

there was

$632.7 million

outstanding under the U.S. commercial paper program, and the euro equivalent of

$707.2 million

under the European program. The weighted-average interest rate and maturity period for the U.S. program were

2.98%

and 27.64 days, respectively. The weighted-average interest rate and maturity period for the European program were

(0.21)%

and 28.61 days, respectively.

Accounts Receivable Securitization

On December 19, 2012, the Company entered into a

three

-year on-balance sheet trade accounts receivable securitization agreement (the “Securitization Facility”). On September 11, 2014, the Company made certain modifications to its Securitization Facility, which modifications, among other things, increased the aggregate borrowings available under the facility from

Other

The Company may continue, from time to time, to retire its outstanding debt through cash purchases in the open market, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, the Company’s liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amount involved may be material.

As of

December 31, 2018

, the Company had cash of

$119.1 million

, of which

$88.1 million

was held outside the United States.  The Company plans to permanently reinvest the cash held outside the United States. The Company believes that its cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash generated from operations and availability under its 2015 Senior Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet its capital expenditure, working capital and debt servicing requirements over the next twelve months.

As of December 31, 2018, the Company has repurchased

$274.1 million

of its shares of common stock pursuant to the $500 million program announced in October. All of these repurchases have been financed through the Company’s operations and existing finance arrangements. See Item 5 - Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.

Critical Accounting Policies

In preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the Company must make decisions which impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures. Such decisions include the selection of appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates. In reaching such decisions, the Company applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances and historical experience. Actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared.

The Company’s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. Some of those significant accounting policies require the Company to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates. Critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.

The Company believes the following accounting policies require it to use judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and represent critical accounting policies.



Index to Financial Statements

•

Accounts receivable and revenue recognition.

The Company recognizes revenues when it satisfies performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control of the promised goods to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods. The nature of the promised goods are ceramic, stone, carpet, resilient, laminate, wood and other flooring products. Payment is typically received 90 days or less from the invoice date.  The Company adjusts the amounts of revenue for expected cash discounts, sales allowances, returns, and claims, based upon historical experience.  The Company adjusts accounts receivable for doubtful account allowances based upon historical bad debt, claims experience, periodic evaluation of specific customer accounts, and the aging of accounts receivable. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. A 10% change in the Company’s allowance for discounts, returns, claims and doubtful accounts would have affected net earnings by approximately

$5 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2018

.

•

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (net realizable value).

Cost has been determined using the first-in first-out method (“FIFO”). Costs included in inventory include raw materials, direct and indirect labor and employee benefits, depreciation, general manufacturing overhead and various other costs of manufacturing. Market, with respect to all inventories, is replacement cost or net realizable value. Inventories on hand are compared against anticipated future usage, which is a function of historical usage, anticipated future selling price, expected sales below cost, excessive quantities and an evaluation for obsolescence. Actual results could differ from assumptions used to value obsolete inventory, excessive inventory or inventory expected to be sold below cost, and a 10% change in the Company’s assumptions for excess or obsolete inventory would have affected net earnings by approximately

$8 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2018

.

•

Acquisition Accounting.

The fair value of the consideration the Company pay for each new acquisition is allocated to tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets, liabilities assumed, any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity and goodwill.  The accounting for acquisitions involves a considerable amount of judgment and estimate, including the fair value of certain forms of consideration; fair value of acquired intangible assets involving projections of future revenues and cash flows that are then either discounted at an estimated discount rate or measured at an estimated royalty rate; fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including potential contingencies; and the useful lives of the acquired assets. The assumptions used are determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation models.  Projections are developed using internal forecasts, available industry and market data and estimates of long-term rates of growth for the business. The impact of prior or future acquisitions on the Company’s financial position or results of operations may be materially impacted by the change in or initial selection of assumptions and estimates.  See Note 2-Acquisitions for further discussion of business combination accounting valuation methodology and assumptions.

•

Goodwill and other intangibles.

Goodwill is tested annually for impairment on the first day of the fourth quarter or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances. The Company considers the relationship between its market capitalization and its book value, among other factors, when reviewing for indicators of impairment. The goodwill impairment tests are based on determining the fair value of the specified reporting units based on management judgments and assumptions using the discounted cash flows and comparable company market valuation approaches. The Company has identified Global Ceramic, Flooring NA and Flooring ROW as its reporting units for the purposes of allocating goodwill and intangibles as well as assessing impairments. The valuation approaches are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change such as judgments and assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”), and comparable company market multiples. When developing these key judgments and assumptions, the Company considers economic, operational and market conditions that could impact the fair value of the reporting unit. However, estimates are inherently uncertain and represent only management’s reasonable expectations regarding future developments. These estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will, in all likelihood, differ in some respects from actual future results. Should a significant or prolonged deterioration in economic conditions occur, such as declines in spending for new construction, remodeling and replacement activities; the inability to pass increases in the costs of raw materials and fuel on to customers; or a decline in comparable company market multiples, then key judgments and assumptions could be impacted. Generally, a decline in estimated after tax cash flows of more than

35%

or a more than

26%

increase in WACC or a significant or prolonged decline in market capitalization could result in an additional indication of impairment.

The impairment test for intangible assets not subject to amortization involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, royalty rates, WACC and the amount of expected future cash flows. These judgments and assumptions are subject to the variability discussed above.



Index to Financial Statements

The impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets, which for the Company are its trademarks, is conducted on the first day of the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. The determination of fair value used in the impairment evaluation is based on discounted estimates of future sales projections attributable to ownership of the trademarks. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, royalty rates, WACC and the amount of expected future cash flows. The judgments and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with past performance and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in operating plans. Such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. The determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the trademarks. Estimated cash flows are sensitive to changes in the economy among other things.

The Company reviews its long-lived asset groups, which include intangible assets subject to amortization, which for the Company are its patents and customer relationships, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset groups may not be recoverable. Recoverability of asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of long-lived assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by these asset groups. If such asset groups are considered to be impaired, the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs of disposal and are no longer depreciated.

The Company conducted its annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles on the first day of the fourth quarter and no impairment was indicated for

•

Income taxes.

The Company’s effective tax rate is based on its income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company’s tax expense and in evaluating the Company’s tax positions. Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in a future period. The Company evaluates the recoverability of these future tax benefits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income inherently rely on estimates, including business forecasts and other projections of financial results over an extended period of time. In the event that the Company is not able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance is provided. The Company would recognize such amounts through a charge to income in the period in which that determination is made or when tax law changes are enacted. For further information regarding the Company’s valuation allowances, see Note 13-Income Taxes.

In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the Company’s income tax positions. The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the Company’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available as of the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information, as required by the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic (“ASC”) 740-10. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. For further information regarding the Company’s uncertain tax positions, see Note 13-Income Taxes.

•

Environmental and legal accruals.

Environmental and legal accruals are estimates based on judgments made by the Company relating to ongoing environmental and legal proceedings, as disclosed in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In determining whether a liability is probable and reasonably estimable, the Company consults with its internal experts. The Company believes that the amounts recorded in the accompanying financial statements are based on the best estimates and judgments available to it.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 1(u), “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”, of the Company’s accompanying audited consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent accounting pronouncements including the dates, or expected dates of adoption, and effects, or expected effects, on the Company’s disclosures, results of operations, and financial condition.



Index to Financial Statements

Impact of Inflation

Inflation affects the Company’s manufacturing costs, distribution costs and operating expenses. The Company expects raw material prices, many of which are petroleum based, to fluctuate based upon worldwide supply and demand of commodities utilized in the Company’s production processes. Although the Company attempts to pass on increases in raw material, energy and fuel-related costs to its customers, the Company’s ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase, competitive pressures and market conditions for the Company’s products. There have been in the past, and may be in the future, periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be fully recovered. In the past, the Company has often been able to enhance productivity and develop new product innovations to help offset increases in costs resulting from inflation in its operations.

Seasonality

The Company is a calendar year-end company. With respect to its Flooring NA and Global Ceramic segments, the second quarter typically sees the higher net sales and operating income, followed by the first and third quarters. The results of operations for the fourth quarter tends to be the weakest. These results are primarily due to consumer residential spending patterns which have historically decreased during the holiday season and the first two months following. The Flooring ROW segment’s second quarter typically produces the highest net earnings followed by moderate first and third quarters and a weaker fourth quarter.


Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

The Company’s market risk is impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and certain commodity prices. Financial exposures to these risks are monitored as an integral part of the Company’s risk management program, which seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect that the volatility of these markets may have on its operating results. The Company does not regularly engage in speculative transactions, nor does it regularly hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Excluding the hedge of net investment discussed in Note 1(n) “Hedges of Net Investments in Non-U.S. Operations”, of the Company’s accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company did not have any derivative contracts outstanding as of

December 31, 2018

and


.

Interest Rate Risk

As of

December 31, 2018

, approximately

36%

of the Company’s debt portfolio was comprised of fixed-rate debt and

64%

was floating-rate debt.  The Company believes that probable near-term changes in interest rates would not materially affect its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The annual impact on interest expense of a one-percentage point interest rate change on the outstanding balance of the Company’s variable rate debt as of

December 31, 2018

would be approximately $21 million or $0.18 to diluted EPS.

Foreign Exchange Risk

As a result of being a global enterprise, there is exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect the operating results and financial condition of the Company.  Principal foreign currency exposures relate primarily to the euro and to a lesser extent the Russian ruble, the Mexican peso, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the British pound and the Brazilian real.

The Company’s objective is to balance, where possible, non-functional currency denominated assets to non-functional currency denominated liabilities to have a natural hedge and minimize foreign exchange impacts. The Company enters into cross border transactions through importing and exporting goods to and from different countries and locations. These transactions generate foreign exchange risk as they create assets, liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than their functional currency. This also applies to services provided and other cross border agreements among subsidiaries.

The Company takes steps to minimize risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through normal operating and financing activities.  The Company does not enter into any speculative positions with regard to derivative instruments.

Based on financial results for the year ended

December 31, 2018

, a hypothetical overall 10 percent change in the U.S. dollar against the euro would have resulted in a translational adjustment of approximately $43 million.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.



Index to Financial Statements

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

(In thousands, except per share data)

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a) Basis of Presentation

Mohawk Industries, Inc. (“Mohawk” or the “Company”), a term which includes the Company and its subsidiaries, is a leading global flooring manufacturer that creates products to enhance residential and commercial spaces around the world.  The Company's vertically integrated manufacturing and distribution processes provide competitive advantages in the production of carpet, rugs, ceramic tile, laminate, wood, stone, luxury vinyl tile (“LVT”) and vinyl flooring.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

(b) Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.  As of

December 31, 2018

, the Company had cash of

$119,050

of which

$88,100

was held outside the United States. As of

December 31, 2017

, the Company had cash of

$84,884

of which

$70,520

was held outside the United States.

(c) Accounts Receivable and Revenue Recognition

On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the new accounting standard, ASC 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

and all the related amendments (“ASC 606”) and applied the provisions of the standard to all contracts using the modified retrospective method. The cumulative effect of adopting the new revenue standard was immaterial and no adjustment has been recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings. Prior year information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.

The Company recognizes revenues when it satisfies performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control of the promised goods to customers, when the product is either shipped or received from the Company’s facilities, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods. The Company reviewed all of its revenue product categories under ASC 606 and the only changes identified were that an immaterial amount of revenue from intellectual property (“IP”) contracts results in earlier recognition of revenue, new controls and processes designed to meet the requirements of the standard were implemented, and the required new disclosures are presented in Note 3, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The adoption of ASC 606 did not have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

(d) Inventories

The Company accounts for all inventories on the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost has been determined using the FIFO method. Costs included in inventory include raw materials, direct and indirect labor and employee benefits, depreciation, general manufacturing overhead and various other costs of manufacturing. Inventories on hand are compared against anticipated future usage, which is a function of historical usage, anticipated future selling price, expected sales below cost, excessive quantities and an evaluation for obsolescence.

(e) Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, including capitalized interest. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated remaining useful lives, which are


-


years for buildings and improvements,


-


years for machinery and equipment, the shorter of the estimated useful life or lease term for leasehold improvements and


-


years for furniture and fixtures.

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

(f) Accounting for Business Combinations

The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting which requires it to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. While the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, the estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company records adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.

(g) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

In accordance with the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification Topic (“ASC”) 350,

Intangibles-Goodwill and Other,

the Company tests goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis on the first day of the fourth quarter (or on an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value). The Company considers the relationship between its market capitalization and its book value, among other factors, when reviewing for indicators of impairment. The goodwill impairment tests are based on determining the fair value of the specified reporting units based on management’s judgments and assumptions using the discounted cash flows and comparable company market valuation approaches. The Company has identified Global Ceramic, Flooring NA, and Flooring ROW as its reporting units for the purposes of allocating goodwill and intangibles as well as assessing impairments. The valuation approaches are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change such as judgments and assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”), and comparable company market multiples.

When developing these key judgments and assumptions, the Company considers economic, operational and market conditions that could impact the fair value of the reporting unit. However, estimates are inherently uncertain and represent only management’s reasonable expectations regarding future developments. These estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will, in all likelihood, differ in some respects from actual future results. Should a significant or prolonged deterioration in economic conditions occur, such as continued declines in spending for new construction, remodeling and replacement activities; the inability to pass increases in the costs of raw materials and fuel on to customers; or a decline in comparable company market multiples, then key judgments and assumptions could be impacted.

The impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets, which for the Company are its trademarks, is conducted on the first day of the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. The first step of the impairment tests for our indefinite lived intangible assets is a thorough assessment of qualitative factors to determine the existence of events or circumstances that would indicate that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of these assets is less than their carrying amounts.  If the qualitative test indicates it is not more likely than not that the fair value of these assets is less than their carrying amounts, a quantitative assessment is not required.  If a quantitative test is necessary, the second step of our impairment test involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount.  The determination of fair value used in the impairment evaluation is based on discounted estimates of future sales projections attributable to ownership of the trademarks. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, royalty rates, WACC and the amount of expected future cash flows. The judgments and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with past performance and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans. Such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. The determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the trademarks. Estimated cash flows are sensitive to changes in the economy among other things.  If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

Intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives are amortized based on average lives, which range from


-


years.

(h) Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected



Index to Financial Statements

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized.  Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.  The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

(i) Financial Instruments

The Company’s financial instruments consist primarily of receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and long-term debt. The carrying amounts of receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair value because of the short-term maturity of such instruments. The Company formed a wholly-owned captive insurance company during 2017 that invests in the Company’s commercial paper. These short-term commercial paper investments are classified as trading securities and carried at fair value based upon level two fair value hierarchy. The carrying amount of the Company’s floating rate debt approximates its fair value based upon level two fair value hierarchy. Interest rates that are currently available to the Company for issuance of long-term debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate the fair value of the Company’s long-term debt.

(j) Advertising Costs and Vendor Consideration

Advertising and promotion expenses are charged to earnings during the period in which they are incurred. Advertising and promotion expenses included in selling, general, and administrative expenses were

$116,854

in


,

$119,560

in


and

$122,148

in


.

Vendor consideration, generally cash, is classified as a reduction of net sales, unless specific criteria are met regarding goods or services that the Company may receive in return for this consideration. The Company makes various payments to customers, including rebates, slotting fees, advertising allowances, buy-downs and co-op advertising. All of these payments reduce gross sales with the exception of co-op advertising. Co-op advertising is classified as a selling, general and administrative expense. Co-op advertising expenses, a component of advertising and promotion expenses, were

$13,332

in


,

$10,891

in


and

$11,132

in


.

(k) Product Warranties

The Company warrants certain qualitative attributes of its flooring products. The Company has recorded a provision for estimated warranty and related costs, based on historical experience and periodically adjusts these provisions to reflect actual experience.

(l) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company reviews its long-lived asset groups, which include intangible assets subject to amortization, which for the Company are its patents and customer relationships, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset groups may not be recoverable. Recoverability of asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of long-lived assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by these asset groups. If such asset groups are considered to be impaired, the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs of disposal and are no longer depreciated.

(m) Foreign Currency Translation

The Company’s subsidiaries that operate outside the United States use their local currency as the functional currency. The functional currency is translated into U.S. Dollars for balance sheet accounts using the month end rates in effect as of the balance sheet date and average exchange rate for revenue and expense accounts for each respective period. The translation adjustments are deferred as a separate component of stockholders’ equity, within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains or losses resulting from transactions denominated in foreign currencies are included in other income or expense, within the consolidated statements of operations.



Index to Financial Statements

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

(n) Hedges of Net Investments in Non-U.S. Operations

The Company has numerous investments outside the United States. The net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to changes and volatility in currency exchange rates. The Company uses foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its non-U.S. net investments against adverse movements in exchange rates. The gains and losses on the Company's net investments in its non-U.S. operations are economically offset by losses and gains on its foreign currency borrowings.  The Company designated its

€500,000

2.00%

Senior Notes borrowing as a net investment hedge of a portion of its European operations.  For the years ended

December 31, 2018

,

December 31, 2017

and

December 31, 2016

the change in the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s euro denominated debt was a decrease of

$27,948

(

$20,376

net of taxes), an increase of

$74,112

(

$46,320

net of taxes) and a decrease of

$20,644

(

$12,902

net of taxes), respectively, which is recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The increase in the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s debt partially offsets the euro-to-dollar translation of the Company’s net investment in its European operations.

(o) Earnings per Share (“EPS”)

Basic net earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated using net earnings available to common stockholders divided by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is similar to basic EPS except that the weighted-average number of shares is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive common shares had been issued.

Dilutive common stock options are included in the diluted EPS calculation using the treasury stock method. There were no common stock options and unvested restricted shares (units) that were excluded from the diluted EPS computation because the price was greater than the average market price of the common shares for the periods presented for


,


and


.

Computations of basic and diluted earnings per share are presented in the following table:

(a)

Represents the accretion of the Company’s redeemable noncontrolling interest to redemption value. The holder put this option to the Company on December 20, 2018 for

$33,884

.

(p) Stock-Based Compensation

The Company recognizes compensation expense for all share-based payments granted based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with ASC 718-10, “

Stock Compensation

”. Compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the awards’ estimated lives for fixed awards with ratable vesting provisions.

(q) Employee Benefit Plans

The Company has a 401(k) retirement savings plan (the “Mohawk Plan”) open to substantially all U.S. and Puerto Rico based employees who have completed


days of eligible service. The Company contributes

$.50

for every

$1.00

of employee contributions up to a maximum of

6%

of the employee’s salary based upon each individual participants election. Employee and

employer contributions to the Mohawk Plan were

$55,796

and

in


,

$53,544

and

$22,039

in


and

$50,542

and

$21,002

in


, respectively.

The Company also has various pension plans covering employees in Belgium, France, and the Netherlands (the “Non-U.S. Plans”) within the Flooring ROW segment. Benefits under the Non-U.S. Plans depend on compensation and years of service.  The Non-U.S. Plans are funded in accordance with local regulations. The Company uses December 31 as the measurement date for its Non-U.S. Plans. The Company’s projected benefit obligation and plan assets as of

December 31, 2018

were

$63,569

and

$54,315

, respectively. The Company’s projected benefit obligation and plan assets as of

December 31, 2017

were

$65,439

and

$53,404

, respectively. As of

December 31, 2018

, the funded status of the Non-U.S. Plans was a liability of

$9,254

of which

$5,092

was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, for a net liability of

$4,162

recorded in other long-term liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets. As of

December 31, 2017

, the funded status of the Non-U.S. Plans was a liability of

$12,035

of which

$6,187

was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, for a net liability of

$5,848

recorded in other long-term liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets.

(r) Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) includes foreign currency translation of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, effects of exchange rate changes on intercompany balances of a long-term nature and pensions. The Company does not provide income taxes on currency translation adjustments, as earnings from foreign subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company presents currency translation adjustments on non-controlling interests separately from currency translation adjustments on controlling interests in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders’ equity.

The changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by component, net of tax, for years ended

December 31, 2018

,


and


are as follows:

(s) Self-Insurance Reserves

The Company is self-insured in the U.S. for various levels of general liability, auto liability, workers’ compensation and employee medical coverage. Insurance reserves are calculated on an undiscounted basis based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed utilizing historical claim trends. Projected settlements and incurred but not reported claims are estimated based on pending claims and historical trends and data. Though the Company does not expect them to do so, actual settlements and claims could differ materially from those estimated. Material differences in actual settlements and claims could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.

In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company formed a wholly-owned captive insurance company, Mohawk Assurance Services, Inc. (“MAS”). MAS insures the retained portion of the Company’s U.S. workers’ compensation, automobile liability and general liability exposures. The Company funded MAS with an initial cash contribution of

$16,876

as a contribution to equity and

$67,391

as the net present value of premiums owed by the Company for the insurance provided by MAS. MAS began providing coverage to the Company as of December 22, 2017. MAS had investments of $

53,000

and $

83,904

in the Company’s commercial paper as of

December 31, 2018

and


, respectively.

(t) Fiscal Year

The Company ends its fiscal year on December 31. Each of the first three quarters in the fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the calendar quarter end with a thirteen week fiscal quarter.

(u) Recent Accounting Pronouncements

- Effective in Future Years

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,

Leases

. The amendments create Topic 842, Leases, and supersede the requirements in Topic 840, Leases. Topic 842 specifies the accounting for leases. The objective of Topic 842 is to establish the principles that lessees and lessors shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from a lease. The guidance in this update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted.

In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11,

Targeted Improvements

, which allows for a new, optional transition method where the effective date also acts as the date of initial application on transition. Under this option, the comparative periods would continue to apply the legacy guidance in ASC 840, including the disclosure requirements, and a cumulative effect adjustment would be recognized in the period of adoption rather than the earliest period presented. Under this transition option, comparative reporting would not be required and the provisions of the standard would be applied prospectively to leases in effect at the date of adoption.

The Company plans to adopt the provisions of this Topic 842 at the beginning of fiscal year 2019 using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative effect adjustment to “Retained earnings” as of the beginning of the period of adoption in line with the new transition method allowed under ASU 2018-11. Topic 842 provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition. The Company expects to elect the “package of practical expedients” which permits the Company not to reassess under the new standard its prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. The Company does not expect to elect the use-of-hindsight and will elect the practical expedient pertaining to land easements. The new standard also provides practical expedients for an entity’s ongoing accounting for leases. The Company currently expects to elect the short-term lease exemption for all leases that qualify, meaning the Company will not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities for leases with terms shorter than twelve months. The Company also currently expects to elect the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for a majority of its asset classes, including real estate and equipment.

The Company expects the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its Consolidated Balance Sheet due to the recognition of lease liabilities and related right-of-use assets in excess of

$300,000

to

$350,000

.  The Company does not expect adoption to materially affect its Consolidated Statement of Operations nor its Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Company is working to complete the design of new controls and processes to meet both the quantitative and disclosure requirements of Topic 842 upon adoption. The Company may identify additional impacts this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures. The Company does not expect material changes in its leasing activities in conjunction with the adoption of Topic 842.

In January 2017, the FASB also issued ASU 2017-04,

Intangibles - Goodwill and other (Topic 350): Simplifying the test for goodwill impairment.

The amendments remove the second step of the current goodwill impairment test. An entity will apply a one-step quantitative test and record the amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The new guidance does not amend the optional qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment. This guidance is effective for impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.

- Recently Adopted

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,

Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory

.  This update changes the measurement principle for inventory for entities using FIFO or average cost from the lower of cost or market to lower of cost and net realizable value. Entities that measure inventory using LIFO or the retail inventory method are not affected. This update will more closely align the accounting for inventory under U.S. GAAP with IFRS. The Company currently accounts for inventory

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

using the FIFO method. The Company adopted the provisions of this update at the beginning of fiscal year 2017. This update did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,

Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.

This update simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions for both public and nonpublic entities, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The Company adopted the provisions of this update at the beginning of fiscal year 2017, with the statement of cash flows classifications applied retrospectively. Accordingly, cash paid for shares redeemed for taxes of

$13,039

and

$11,589

was reclassed to financing activities from operating activities for the year ended

December 31, 2016

and 2015, respectively. Additionally, excess tax benefits are now classified with other tax flows as an operating activity with

$4,697

and

$5,690

reclassified from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company has also elected to continue to estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest when accounting for forfeitures.

On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the new accounting standard, ASC 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

and all the related amendments (“ASC 606”) and applied the provisions of the standard to all contracts using the modified retrospective method. The cumulative effect of adopting the new revenue standard was immaterial and no adjustment has been recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings. Prior year information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.

Substantially all of the Company’s revenue continues to be recognized at a point in time when the product is either shipped or received from the Company’s facilities and control of the product is transferred to the customer. The Company reviewed all of its revenue product categories under ASC 606 and the only changes identified were that an immaterial amount of revenue from intellectual property (“IP”) contracts results in earlier recognition of revenue, new controls and processes designed to meet the requirements of the standard were implemented, and the required new disclosures are presented in

Note 3, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The adoption of ASC 606 did not have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the new accounting standard, ASU 2016-15,

Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230).

The effect of adopting the new standard was not material.

On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the new accounting standard, ASU 2017-01,

Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the definition of a business.

The effect of adopting the new standard was not material.

(3) Revenue from Contracts with Customers

Revenue recognition and accounts receivable

The Company recognizes revenues when it satisfies performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control of the promised goods to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods. The nature of the promised goods are ceramic, stone, carpet, resilient, laminate, wood and other flooring products. Payment is typically received 90 days or less from the invoice date.  The Company adjusts the amounts of revenue for expected cash discounts, sales allowances, returns, and claims, based upon historical experience.  The Company adjusts accounts receivable for doubtful account allowances based upon historical bad debt, claims experience, periodic evaluation of specific customer accounts, and the aging of accounts receivable. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.

Contract liabilities

The Company historically records contract liabilities when it receives payment prior to fulfilling a performance obligation. Contract liabilities related to revenues are recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the accompanying condensed consolidating balance sheets. The Company had contract liabilities of

$34,486

and

$29,124

as of

December 31, 2018

and

$1,800,000

and extending the maturity from

September 25, 2018

to

March 26, 2020

(as amended and restated, the “2015 Senior Credit Facility”).  The 2015 Senior Credit Facility eliminated certain provisions in the 2013 Senior Credit Facility, including those that: (a) accelerated the maturity date to 90 days prior to the maturity of senior notes due in January 2016 if certain specified liquidity levels were not met; and (b) required that certain subsidiaries guarantee the Company’s obligations if the Company’s credit ratings fell below investment grade.

1.00%

and

1.75%

(

1.125%

0.10%

to

0.225%

per annum (

0.125%

The obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries in respect of the 2015 Senior Credit Facility are unsecured.

The 2015 Senior Credit Facility also contains customary representations and warranties and events of default, subject to customary grace periods.

In 2017, the Company paid financing costs of

$567

To the extent that the Company issues European commercial paper notes through a subsidiary of the Company, the notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company.

The Company uses its 2015 Senior Credit Facility as a liquidity backstop for its commercial paper programs. Accordingly, the total amount outstanding under all of the Company's commercial paper programs may not exceed

$1,800,000

(less any amounts drawn on the 2015 Senior Credit Facility) at any time.

The proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes will be available for general corporate purposes. As of

December 31, 2018

consists of the following:

The geographic dispersion of earnings and losses contributes to the annual changes in the Company’s effective tax rates. Approximately

37%

of the Company’s current year earnings before income taxes was generated in the United States at a combined federal and state effective tax rate that is higher than the Company’s overall effective tax rate. The Company is also subject to taxation in other jurisdictions where it has operations, including Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Russia, Spain, the U.K. and the Ukraine. The effective tax rates that the Company accrues in these jurisdictions vary widely, but they are generally lower than the Company’s overall

effective tax rate. The Company’s domestic effective tax rates for the years ended

were

28.7%

,

, and

, respectively, and its non-U.S. effective tax rates for the years ended

December 31, 2018

,


and


were

11.0%

,

3.2%

, and

10.8%

, respectively. The difference in rates applicable in foreign jurisdictions results from a number of factors, including lower statutory rates, historical loss carry-forwards, financing arrangements, and other factors. The Company’s effective tax rate has been and will continue to be impacted by the geographical dispersion of the Company’s earnings and losses. To the extent that domestic earnings increase while the foreign earnings remain flat or decrease, or increase at a lower rate, the Company’s effective tax rate will increase.

Income tax expense (benefit) attributable to earnings before income taxes differs from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to earnings before income taxes as follows:

(a) Foreign income taxes includes statutory rate differences, financing arrangements, withholding taxes, local income taxes, notional deductions, and other miscellaneous items. The significant decrease in foreign income taxes for 2018 is primarily due to the impact of the U.S. statutory rate reduction from 35% to 21% as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) discussed below.

(b) 2017 revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities includes

$106,107

related to the TCJA and

$44,439

related to Belgium tax reform.

The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of

December 31, 2018

and


are presented below:

The Company evaluates its ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing its forecasted taxable income using both historic and projected future operating results, the reversal of existing temporary differences, taxable income in prior carry-back years (if permitted) and the availability of tax planning strategies. The valuation allowance as of

December 31, 2018

, and


is

$347,786

and

$362,963

, respectively. The valuation allowance as of

December 31, 2018

relates to the net deferred tax assets of certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries as well as certain state net operating losses and tax credits. The total change in the


valuation allowance was a decrease of

$15,177

which includes

$15,357

related to foreign currency translation. The total change in the


valuation allowance was an increase of

$73,885

, which includes

$36,792

related to foreign currency translation.

Management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, based upon the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities and the level of historic and forecasted taxable income over periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible.

As of

December 31, 2018

, the Company has state net operating loss carry forwards and state tax credits with potential tax benefits of

$68,714

, net of federal income tax benefit; these carry forwards expire over various periods based on taxing jurisdiction. A valuation allowance totaling

$37,870

has been recorded against these state deferred tax assets as of

December 31, 2018

. In addition, as of

December 31, 2018

, the Company has net operating loss carry forwards in various foreign jurisdictions with potential tax benefits of

$1,805,648

. A valuation allowance totaling

$309,916

has been recorded against these deferred tax assets as of

December 31, 2018

. The large increase in the foreign losses is predominantly from the Company’s redemptions of Luxembourg hybrid instruments which resulted in a tax effected loss of

$1,298,737

. The Company redeemed these hybrid instruments in response to changes in global tax regimes. The changes were triggered by the EU’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting “BEPS” and Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives “ATAD” I and II initiatives, recently adopted by various member states.  The Company has recorded a ASC 740-10 liability for the full tax effected loss, as reflected in the

Tax Uncertainties

section below. This ASC 740-10-45 liability is recorded as a reduction to the related deferred tax asset in the financial statements as a result of management’s determination that it is not more likely than not that the benefit will be realized.

Historically, the Company has not provided for U.S. federal and state income taxes on the undistributed accumulated earnings of its foreign subsidiaries because such earnings were deemed to be permanently reinvested. Due to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) on December 22, 2017, the Company was required to recognize U.S. federal and state taxes on



Index to Financial Statements

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

the higher of its accumulated earnings as of November 2, 2017, or December 31, 2017. Accordingly, as of

December 31, 2018

, the Company

recognized

$133,366

of income tax expense on its foreign earnings

.

As of

December 31, 2018

, the Company has recognized net income tax expense on earnings of approximately

$1,936,000

as discussed further below. Should these earnings be distributed in the form of dividends in the future, the Company might be subject to withholding taxes (possibly offset by U.S. foreign tax credits) in various foreign jurisdictions, but the Company would not expect incremental U.S. federal or state taxes to be accrued on these previously taxed earnings. Despite the new territorial tax regime created by the TCJA, the Company continues to assert that earnings of its foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested.

The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”), which provides guidance on accounting for the income tax effects of the TCJA. SAB 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the enactment date of the TCJA for companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740,

Income Taxes

(“ASC 740”). In accordance with SAB 118, a company must (1) reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of TCJA for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete, (2) record a provisional estimate for those aspects of TCJA for which the accounting is incomplete but a reasonable estimate can be made, and/or (3) continue to apply ASC 740 on the basis of the provisions of tax laws in effect immediately before the enactment of the TCJA if no reasonable estimate can be made.

At December 31, 2017, the Company has recorded a net provisional tax expense of

$45,249

based on the initial impact of the TCJA and related transactions for the year ended December 31, 2017. This provisional expense primarily consisted of a tax expense of

$105,165

for the Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax and

$46,191

for related transactions, offset by a tax benefit of

$106,107

for the corporate tax rate reduction, and the associated revaluation of the Company’s net deferred tax liability. In accordance with the SAB 118 measurement period, the Company has completed its accounting for the income tax effects of all elements of the TCJA and reduced the net provisional tax expense to $

25,564

.

The Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax (“Transition Tax”) is a tax on previously untaxed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries.  To determine the amount of the Transition Tax, the Company must determine, in addition to other factors, the amount of post-1986 earnings of the relevant foreign subsidiaries, as well as the amount of non-U.S. income and withholding taxes paid on such earnings. The Company has finalized its determination of the Transition Tax obligation and will elect to pay the transition tax liability of

$132,236

over the 8-year deferral period, with 8% due in each of the first five years, 15% in the sixth year, 20% in the seventh year, and 25% in the eighth year. This total liability, except for the first installment, is recorded in other long-term liabilities within the consolidated balance sheet. In addition, the Company will pay $

1,130

of state tax resulting from the transition tax with its 2018 state tax returns.

Due to the fiscal year end of the company’s foreign subsidiaries, the new Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) rules, are only applicable for one-twelfth of the Company’s earnings for the calendar year ending December 31, 2018. The Company’s accounting for the effects of GILTI have been completed and an accrual for the current year has been included in current tax expense. In accordance with U.S. GAAP guidance, the Company will elect to treat tax due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred (the “period cost method”).

Tax Uncertainties

In the normal course of business, the Company’s tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing jurisdictions. Accordingly, the Company accrues liabilities when it believes that it is not more likely than not that it will realize the benefits of tax positions that it has taken in its tax returns or for the amount of any tax benefit that exceeds the cumulative probability threshold in accordance with ASC 740-10. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense (benefit). Differences between the estimated and actual amounts determined upon ultimate resolution, individually or in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position but could possibly be material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations or cash flow in any given quarter or annual period.

As of

December 31, 2018

, the Company’s gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits is

$1,330,713

, excluding interest and penalties. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions,

$23,477

of the unrecognized tax benefits would affect the Company’s effective tax rate, exclusive of any benefits related to interest and penalties.

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

(a) Includes tax effected loss of

$1,298,737

on Luxembourg hybrid instruments redemptions. This

$1,298,737

of unrecognized benefit is presented as a reduction to the related deferred tax asset in the balance sheet.

The Company will continue to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of its income tax provision. As of

December 31, 2018

and


, the Company has

$7,184

and

$8,252

, respectively, accrued for the payment of interest and penalties, excluding the federal tax benefit of interest deductions where applicable. During the years ended

December 31, 2018

,


and


, the Company accrued interest and penalties through the consolidated statements of operations of

$(1,085)

,

$165

and

$2,170

, respectively.

The Company believes that its unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by

$9,166

within the next twelve months. The Company is currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for tax years 2014 and 2015 but has effectively settled all Federal income tax matters related to years prior to 2014. Various other state and foreign income tax returns are open to examination for various years.

Belgian Tax Matter

Between 2012 and 2014, the Company received assessments from the Belgian tax authority for the calendar years 2005 through 2010 in the amount of €

46,135

, €

38,817

, €

39,635

, €

30,131

, €

35,567

and €

43,117

respectively, including penalties, but excluding interest. The Belgian tax authority denied the Company’s formal protests against these assessments and the Company brought all six years before the Court of First Appeal in Bruges. The Court of First Appeal in Bruges, ruled in favor of the Company on January 27, 2016, with respect to the calendar years ending December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2009; and on June 13, 2018, the Court of First Appeal in Bruges, ruled in favor of the Company with respect to the calendar years ending December 31, 2006, December 31, 2007, December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2010.  The Belgian tax authority has lodged its Notification of Appeal for all six years with the Ghent Court of Appeal.  In December 2018, the Belgian tax authority issued an assessment for the year ended December 31, 2011, in the amount of €

37,991

including penalties, but excluding interest.  In January of 2019, the Company received a “Notice of Change” from the Belgian tax authority for tax years 2012 through 2017 in the amount of €

38,858

, €

11,108

, €

23,522

, €

30,610

, €

92,109

and €

78,174

respectively, including penalties, but excluding interest. The Company intends to respond to these notices in a timely manner and will file formal protests should the tax authority issue assessments for these years. The Notices of Change are based on largely the same facts underlying the positive rulings, which the Belgian tax authority is appealing.

The Company continues to disagree with the views of the Belgian tax authority on this matter and will persist in its vigorous defense. Nevertheless, on May 24, 2016, the tax collector representing the Belgian tax authorities imposed a lien on the Company’s properties in Wielsbeke (Ooigemstraat and Breestraat), Oostrozebeke (Ingelmunstersteenweg) and Desselgem (Waregemstraat) included in the Flooring ROW segment. The purpose of the lien is to provide security for payment should the Belgian tax authority prevail on its appeal. The lien does not interfere with the Company’s operations at these properties.

, there are no material legal proceedings pending or known by the Company to be contemplated to which the Company is a party or to which any of its property is subject.

Alabama Municipal Litigation

In September 2016, the Water Works and Sewer Board of the City of Gadsden, Alabama (the “Gadsden Water Board”) filed an individual complaint in the Circuit Court of Etowah County, Alabama against certain manufacturers, suppliers, and users of chemicals containing specific perfluorinated compounds, including the Company. On October 26, 2016, the defendants removed the case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, Middle Division, alleging diversity of citizenship and fraudulent joinder. The Gadsden Water Board filed a motion to remand the case back to the state court, and the defendants opposed the Gadsden Water Board’s motion. The federal court granted Gadsden Water Board’s motion for remand.

In May, 2017, the Water Works and Sewer Board of the Town of Centre, Alabama (the “Centre Water Board”) filed a very similar complaint to the Gadsden Water Board complaint in the Circuit Court of Cherokee County. On June 19, 2017, the defendants removed this case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, Middle Division, again alleging diversity of citizenship and fraudulent joinder. The Centre Water Board filed a motion to remand the case back to state court, and the defendants opposed the Centre Water Board’s motion. The federal court granted Centre Water Board's motion for remand.

Certain defendants, including the Company, filed dispositive motions in each case arguing that the state court lacks personal jurisdiction over them. Both state courts denied those motions. In June and September 2018, certain defendants, including the Company, petitioned the Alabama Supreme Court for Writs of Mandamus directing each lower court to enter an order granting the defendants’ dispositive motions on personal jurisdiction grounds. Those petitions have been fully briefed and the Company awaits a decision from the Alabama Supreme Court.

The Company has never manufactured  the perfluorinated compounds at issue but purchased them for use in the manufacture of its carpets prior to 2007. The Gadsden and Centre Water Boards are not alleging that chemical levels in the Company’s wastewater discharge exceeded legal limits. Instead, the Gadsden and Centre Water Boards are seeking lost profits

based on allegations that their customers decreased water purchases, as well as reimbursement for the cost of a filter and punitive damages.

General

The Company believes that adequate provisions for resolution of all contingencies, claims and pending litigation have been made for probable losses that are reasonably estimable.  These contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and we are unable to estimate the amount or range of loss, if any, in excess of amounts accrued.  The Company does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition but could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, cash flows or liquidity in a given quarter or year.

The Company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use, storage, treatment, recycling and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and finished product, and the cleanup of contamination associated therewith. Because of the nature of the Company’s business, the Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs relating to compliance with such laws and regulations. The Company is involved in various proceedings relating to environmental matters and is currently engaged in environmental investigation, remediation and post-closure care programs at certain sites. The Company has provided accruals for such activities that it has determined to be both probable and reasonably estimable. The Company does not expect that the ultimate liability with respect to such activities will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition but could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, cash flows or liquidity in a given quarter or year.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), which have been designed to provide reasonable assurance that such controls and procedures will meet their objectives, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that such controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level for the period covered by this report.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).  The Company maintains internal control over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Therefore,



Index to Financial Statements

internal control over financial reporting determined to be effective provides only reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

The Company acquired Godfrey Hirst Group during 2018, and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Company's Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2018

.  In conducting this evaluation, the Company used the framework set forth in the report titled “Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)” published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on the results of this evaluation, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2018

.

The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2018

has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their audit report which is included herein.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2018 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls

The Company’s management recognizes that a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
