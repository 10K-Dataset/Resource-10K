PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

Mohawk Industries, Inc. (“Mohawk” or the
    “Company”), a term which includes the Company and its
    subsidiaries, including its primary operating subsidiaries,
    Mohawk Carpet, LLC, Dal-Tile Corporation and Unilin BVBA,
    is a leading producer of floor covering products for residential
    and commercial applications in the United States
    (“U.S.”) and residential applications in Europe. The
    Company is the second largest carpet and rug manufacturer and
    one of the largest manufacturers, marketers and distributors of
    ceramic tile, natural stone and hardwood flooring in the U.S.,
    as well as a leading producer of laminate flooring in the
    U.S. and Europe. The Company had annual net sales in 2010
    of $5.3 billion. Approximately 84% of this amount was
    generated by sales in North America and approximately 16% was
    generated by sales outside North America. The Company has three
    reporting segments: the Mohawk segment, the Dal-Tile segment and
    the Unilin segment. Selected financial information for the
    Mohawk, Dal-Tile and Unilin segments, geographic net sales and
    the location of long-lived assets is set forth in note 15
    to the consolidated financial statements.

The Mohawk segment designs, manufactures, sources, distributes
    and markets its floor covering product lines, which include
    carpets, ceramic tile, laminate, rugs, carpet pad, hardwood and
    resilient, in a broad range of colors, textures and patterns for
    residential and commercial applications in both new construction
    and remodeling. The Mohawk segment markets and distributes its
    carpets and rugs under its soft surface floor covering brands
    and ceramic tile, laminate, hardwood and resilient under its
    hard surface floor covering brands. The Mohawk segment positions
    its products in all price ranges and emphasizes quality, style,
    performance and service. The Mohawk segment is widely recognized
    through its premier brand names, which include
    “Mohawk

    The Mohawk segment markets and distributes soft and hard surface
    products through over 24,000 customers, which include
    independent floor covering retailers, home centers, mass
    merchandisers, department stores, commercial dealers and
    commercial end users. Some products are also marketed through
    private labeling programs. The Mohawk segment’s soft
    surface operations are vertically integrated from the extrusion
    of resin to the manufacturing and distribution of finished
    carpets and rugs.

The Dal-Tile segment designs, manufactures, sources, distributes
    and markets a broad line of ceramic tile, porcelain tile,
    natural stone and other products used in the residential and
    commercial markets for both new construction and remodeling.
    Most of the Dal-Tile segment’s ceramic tile products are
    marketed under the

“Dal-Tile

®

”

    and “American
    Olean

®

”

    brand names and sold through Company-owned sales service
    centers, independent distributors, home center retailers, tile
    and flooring retailers and contractors. The Dal-Tile segment
    operations are vertically integrated from the production of raw
    material for body and glaze preparation to the manufacturing and
    distribution of ceramic and porcelain tile.

The Unilin segment designs, manufactures, sources, licenses,
    distributes and markets laminate and hardwood flooring used
    primarily in the residential market for both new construction
    and remodeling in Europe and the U.S. Unilin is one of the
    leaders in laminate flooring technology, having commercialized
    direct pressure laminate, or DPL, a technology used in a
    majority of laminates today, and has developed the patented
    UNICLIC

®

glueless installation system and a variety of other new
    technologies, such as beveled edges, multiple length planks and
    new surface and finish features. Unilin sells its flooring
    products under the
    Quick-Step

,

    Columbia
    Flooring

®

,

    Century
    Flooring

®

,

    and Universal
    Flooring

®

brands through retailers, independent distributors and home
    centers. Unilin is one of the largest vertically-integrated
    laminate flooring manufacturers in the U.S. producing both
    laminate flooring and related high density fiberboard. Unilin
    also produces roofing systems, insulation panels and other wood
    products.

Industry

The U.S. floor covering industry has declined from
    $18.8 billion in sales in 1999 to $17.1 billion in
    2009. In 2009, the primary categories of the U.S. floor
    covering industry, based on sales dollars, were carpet and rug



(55%), resilient and rubber (12%), ceramic tile (11%), hardwood
    (11%), stone (6%) and laminate (5%). Each of these categories
    are influenced by the average selling price per square foot, the
    residential builder and homeowner remodeling markets, housing
    starts and housing resales, average house size and home
    ownership. In addition, the level of sales in the floor covering
    industry, both in the U.S. and Europe, is influenced by
    consumer confidence, spending for durable goods, interest rates
    and availability of credit, turnover in housing, the condition
    of the residential and commercial construction industries and
    the overall strength of the economy. The U.S. floor
    covering industry experienced declining demand beginning in the
    fourth quarter of 2006 that worsened during the latter parts of
    2008, and continued to decline in 2009. In the first half of
    2010 demand showed signs of recovering, but first half gains
    were lost in the second half of the year. Overall industry
    conditions in the U.S. are expected to improve during 2011,
    although the timing and size of a sustained recovery within the
    market remains uncertain.

Domestic carpet and rug sales volume of U.S. manufacturers
    was approximately 1.2 billion square yards, or
    $9.3 billion, in 2009. The carpet and rugs category has two
    primary markets, residential and commercial. In 2009, the
    residential market made up approximately 69% of industry amounts
    shipped and the commercial market comprised approximately 31%.
    Of the total residential market, 73% of the dollar values of
    shipments are made in response to residential replacement demand.

The U.S. ceramic tile industry shipped 1.8 billion
    square feet, or $1.9 billion, in 2009. The ceramic tile
    industry’s two primary markets, residential applications
    and commercial applications, represent 58% and 42% of the 2009
    industry total, respectively. Of the total residential market,
    55% of the dollar values of shipments are made in response to
    residential replacement demand.

In 2009, the U.S. laminate industry shipped
    0.9 billion square feet, or $0.9 billion. The laminate
    industry’s two primary markets, residential applications
    and commercial applications, represent 88% and 12% of the 2009
    industry total, respectively. Sales of U.S. laminate
    flooring are primarily distributed through the residential
    replacement market. In 2009, the European laminate industry
    produced approximately 5.0 billion square feet which
    accounted for approximately 15% of the European floor covering
    market.

In 2009, the U.S. stone flooring industry shipped
    0.3 billion square feet, representing a market of
    approximately $1.1 billion. The stone flooring
    industry’s two primary markets, residential applications
    and commercial applications, represent 53% and 47% of the 2009
    industry total, respectively. Sales of U.S. stone flooring
    are primarily distributed to the residential market for both new
    construction and residential replacement.

In 2009, the U.S. hardwood industry shipped
    0.8 billion square feet, representing a market of
    approximately $1.8 billion. The hardwood industry’s
    two primary markets, residential applications and commercial
    applications, represent 80% and 20% of the 2009 industry total,
    respectively. Sales of U.S. hardwood are primarily
    distributed to the residential market for both new construction
    and residential replacement.

In 2009, the U.S. resilient and rubber industry shipped
    3.3 billion square feet, representing a market of
    approximately $2.1 billion. The resilient and rubber
    industry’s two primary markets, residential applications
    and commercial applications, represent 46% and 54% of the 2009
    industry total, respectively. Sales of U.S. resilient are
    distributed to the residential market for both new construction
    and residential replacement.

Sales and
    Distribution

Mohawk
    Segment

Through its Mohawk segment, the Company designs, manufactures,
    distributes and markets thousands of styles of carpet and rugs
    in a broad range of colors, textures and patterns. In addition,
    the Mohawk segment markets and distributes ceramic tile,
    laminate, hardwood, resilient floor covering, carpet pad and
    flooring accessories. The Mohawk segment positions product lines
    in all price ranges and emphasizes quality, style, performance
    and service. The Mohawk segment markets and distributes its soft
    and hard surface product lines to over 24,000 customers, which
    include independent floor covering retailers, home centers, mass
    merchandisers, department stores, commercial dealers and
    commercial end users. Some products are also marketed



through private labeling programs. Sales to residential
    customers represent a significant portion of the total industry
    and the majority of the Company’s carpet and rug sales.

The Company has positioned its premier residential carpet and
    rug brand names across all price ranges. Mohawk, Horizon,
    “WundaWeve

®

,”

    and Karastan are positioned to sell primarily in the

medium-to-high

retail price channels in the residential broadloom and rug
    markets. These lines have substantial brand name recognition
    among carpet dealers and retailers, with the Karastan and Mohawk
    brands having among the highest consumer recognition in the
    industry. Karastan is a leader in the high-end market. The
    Aladdin and Mohawk Home brand names compete primarily in the
    value retail price channel. The Portico and
    “Properties

®

”

    brand names compete primarily in the builder and multi-family
    markets, respectively. The Company markets its hard surface
    product lines, which include Mohawk Ceramic, Mohawk Hardwood,
    Mohawk Laminate and Congoleum across all price ranges.

The Company offers marketing and advertising support through
    dealer programs like Mohawk Floorscapes, Mohawk ColorCenter, and
    Karastan. These programs offer varying degrees of support to
    dealers in the form of sales and management training, in-store
    merchandising systems, exclusive promotions and assistance in
    certain administrative functions, such as consumer credit,
    advertising and website technology.

The commercial customer base is divided into several channels:
    corporate office space, education institutions, healthcare
    facilities, retail space, public space and institutional and
    government facilities. Different purchase decision makers and
    decision-making processes exist for each channel. The Company
    produces and markets its commercial broadloom and modular carpet
    tile under The Mohawk Group brand which includes these brand
    collections: Bigelow, Lees, and “Karastan
    Contract

®

.”

    It markets its hospitality carpet under the Durkan brand which
    includes the Merit collection of hospitality carpet.

The Company’s sales forces are generally organized by
    product type and sales channels in order to best serve each type
    of customer. Product delivery to dealers is done predominantly
    on Mohawk trucks operating from strategically positioned
    warehouses/cross-docks that receive inbound product directly
    from the source of manufacture.

Dal-Tile
    Segment

The Dal-Tile segment designs, manufactures, distributes and
    markets a broad line of ceramic tile, porcelain tile and natural
    stone products. Products are distributed through separate
    distribution channels consisting of retailers, contractors,
    commercial users, independent distributors and home centers. The
    business is organized to address the specific customer needs of
    each distribution channel, and dedicated sales forces support
    the various channels.

The Company serves as a “one-stop” source that
    provides customers with one of the ceramic tile industry’s
    broadest product lines — a complete selection of
    glazed floor tile, glazed wall tile, glazed and unglazed ceramic
    mosaic tile, porcelain tile, quarry tile and stone products, as
    well as installation products. In addition to products
    manufactured by the Company’s ceramic tile business, the
    Company also sources products from other manufacturers to
    enhance its product offering.

The Company has two of the leading brand names in the
    U.S. ceramic tile industry— Dal-Tile and American
    Olean. The Dal-Tile and American Olean brand names date back
    over 50 years and are well recognized in the industry. Both
    of these brands are supported by a fully integrated marketing
    program, displays, merchandising boards, literature/catalogs and
    internet websites.

A network of Company-owned sales service centers distributes
    primarily the Dal-Tile brand product with a fully integrated
    marketing program, emphasizing a focus on quality and fashion
    serving customers in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. The sales
    service centers provide distribution points for customer

pick-up,

local delivery and showrooms to assist customers. In addition,
    the Dal-Tile brand is distributed through independent
    distributors in Mexico. The American Olean brand is primarily
    distributed through independent distributors and Company-owned
    sales service centers that service a variety of residential and
    commercial customers. The Company is focused on sales growth
    opportunities through innovative products and programs in both
    the residential and commercial channels.



The Company uses regional distribution centers to help deliver
    high-quality customer service by focusing on shorter lead times,
    increased order fill rates and improved on-time deliveries to
    customers.

Unilin
    Segment

The Unilin segment designs, manufactures, sources, licenses,
    distributes and markets laminate and hardwood flooring. It also
    designs and manufactures roofing systems, insulation panels and
    other wood products in Europe. Products are distributed through
    separate distribution channels consisting of retailers,
    independent distributors and home centers. Unilin
    U.S. operations also manufacture Mohawk branded laminate
    and hardwood flooring, which sells through the Mohawk channel.
    The majority of Unilin’s laminate sales, both in the
    U.S. and Europe, are for residential replacement. The
    business is organized to address the specific customer needs of
    each distribution channel.

The Unilin segment markets and sells laminate and hardwood
    flooring products under the Quick-Step, Columbia Flooring,
    Century Flooring, and Universal Flooring brands. In addition,
    Unilin also sells laminate and hardwood flooring products under
    private label. The Company believes Quick-Step is one of the
    leading brand names in the U.S. and European flooring
    industry.

In the U.S., Europe and Asia the Company uses regional
    distribution centers and direct shipping from manufacturing
    facilities to help deliver high-quality customer service and
    also enhance the Company’s ability to plan and schedule
    production and manage inventory requirements.

Advertising
    and Promotion

The Company promotes its brands through advertising in
    television, print, social and internet media as well as in the
    form of cooperative advertising,

point-of-sale

displays, advertising and sponsorship of a cycling team, and
    marketing literature provided to assist in marketing various
    flooring styles. The Company also continues to rely on the
    substantial brand name recognition of its product lines. The
    cost of producing display samples, a significant promotional
    expense, is partially offset by sales of samples to customers.

Manufacturing
    and Operations

Mohawk
    Segment

The Company’s carpet and rug manufacturing operations are
    vertically integrated and include the extrusion of resin and
    post-consumer plastics into polypropylene, polyester, nylon and
    triexta fiber, yarn processing, backing manufacturing, tufting,
    weaving, dyeing, coating and finishing. Over the past three
    years, the Mohawk Segment has invested in capital expenditures,
    principally in

state-of-the-art

equipment, to increase manufacturing efficiency, improve overall
    cost competitiveness and develop new capabilities.

Dal-Tile
    Segment

The Company’s tile manufacturing operations are vertically
    integrated from the production of raw material for body and
    glaze preparation to the manufacturing and distribution of
    ceramic and porcelain tile. The Company believes that its
    manufacturing organization offers competitive advantages due to
    its ability to manufacture a differentiated product line
    consisting of one of the industry’s broadest product
    offerings of colors, textures and finishes, as well as the
    industry’s largest offering of trim and angle pieces and
    its ability to utilize the industry’s newest technology. In
    addition, Dal-Tile also imports or sources a portion of its
    product to supplement its product offerings. Over the past three
    years, the Dal-Tile segment has invested in capital
    expenditures, principally in

state-of-the-art

equipment, to increase manufacturing capacity, improve
    efficiency and develop new capabilities.

Unilin
    Segment

The Company’s laminate flooring manufacturing operations
    are vertically integrated, both in the U.S. and in Europe,
    and include high-density fiberboard (“HDF”)
    production, paper impregnation, short-cycle pressing, cutting
    and milling. The European operations also include resin
    production. Unilin has

state-of-the-art



equipment that results in competitive manufacturing in terms of
    cost and flexibility. Most of the equipment for the production
    of laminate flooring in Belgium and North Carolina is relatively
    new. In addition, Unilin has significant manufacturing
    capability for both engineered and prefinished solid wood
    flooring for the U.S. and European markets. Over the past
    three years, the Unilin segment has invested in capital
    expenditures, principally in new plants and

state-of-the-art

equipment, to increase manufacturing capacity, improve
    efficiency and develop new capabilities.

The manufacturing facilities for other activities in the Unilin
    business (roofing systems, insulation panels and other wood
    products) are all configured for cost-efficient manufacturing
    and production flexibility and are competitive in the European
    market.

Raw
    Materials and Suppliers

Mohawk
    Segment

The principal raw materials used in the production of carpet and
    rugs are nylon, polypropylene, triexta, polyester, wool,
    synthetic backing materials, latex and various dyes and
    chemicals, many of which are petroleum based. Major raw
    materials used in the Company’s manufacturing process are
    available from independent sources, and the Company obtains most
    of its externally purchased fibers and resins principally from
    four major suppliers. Although temporary disruptions of supply
    of carpet raw materials were experienced in 2005 as a result of
    hurricane Katrina, the carpet and rug business has not
    experienced significant shortages of raw materials in recent
    years.

Dal-Tile
    Segment

The principal raw materials used in the production of ceramic
    tile are clay, talc, nepheline syenite and glazes. The Company
    has entered into a long-term supply agreement for most of its
    talc requirements. In addition, the Company has long-term clay
    mining rights in Kentucky and Mississippi that satisfy nearly
    all of its clay requirements for producing unglazed quarry tile.
    The Company purchases a number of different grades of clay for
    the manufacture of its non-quarry tile. The Company believes
    that there is an adequate supply of all grades of clay and that
    all are readily available from a number of independent sources.
    The Company has two suppliers for its nepheline syenite
    requirements. If these suppliers were unable to satisfy the
    requirements, the Company believes that alternative supply
    arrangements would be available. Glazes are used on a
    significant percentage of manufactured tiles. Glazes consist of
    frit (ground glass), zircon, stains and other materials, with
    frit being the largest ingredient. The Company manufactures
    approximately 74% of its frit requirements.

Unilin
    Segment

The principal raw materials used in producing boards, laminate
    and hardwood flooring are wood, paper, resins, coatings and
    stains. Wood supply is a very fragmented market in Europe. The
    Company has long-standing relationships with numerous suppliers.
    These suppliers provide a wide variety of wood species, varying
    from fresh round wood to several kinds of by-products of
    sawmills and used wood recycled specifically for chipboard
    production, giving the Company a cost-effective and secure
    supply of raw material. In the U.S., the Company has a long-term
    contract with a contiguously located lumber company that
    supplies most of its total needs for HDF board production. The
    supply of various species of hardwoods and hardwood veneers used
    in the production of solid wood and engineered flooring is both
    localized and global.

Major manufacturers supply the papers required in the laminate
    flooring business in both Europe and the U.S. The Company
    processes most of the paper impregnation internally in its
    laminate flooring facilities in Europe and the U.S. In
    Europe, the resins for paper impregnation are manufactured by
    the Company, which permits greater control over the laminate
    flooring manufacturing process, enabling the Company to produce
    higher-quality products. The Company buys the balance of its
    resin requirements from a number of companies. The Company
    believes there are ample sources of supply located within a
    reasonable distance of Unilin’s facilities.



Competition

The principal methods of competition within the floor covering
    industry generally are service, style, quality, price, product
    innovation and technology. In each of the markets, price
    competition and market coverage are particularly important
    because there is limited differentiation among competing product
    lines. The Company’s investments in manufacturing
    equipment, computer systems and distribution network, as well as
    the Company’s marketing strategy, contribute to its ability
    to compete primarily on the basis of performance, quality, style
    and service, rather than just price.

Mohawk
    Segment

The carpet and rug industry is highly competitive. Based on
    industry publications, the top 5 North American carpet and rug
    manufacturers (including their North American and foreign
    divisions) in 2009 had carpet and rug sales in excess of
    $7 billion of the over $9 billion market. The Company
    believes it is the second largest producer of carpets and rugs
    (in terms of sales dollars) in the world based on its 2009 sales.

Dal-Tile
    Segment

The ceramic tile industry is significantly more fragmented than
    the carpet industry. The Company estimates that over 100 tile
    manufacturers, more than half of which are based outside the
    U.S., compete for sales of ceramic tile to customers located in
    the U.S. Although the U.S. ceramic tile industry is
    highly fragmented at both the manufacturing and distribution
    levels, the Company believes it is one of the largest
    manufacturers, distributors and marketers of ceramic tile in the
    U.S. and the world. The Company believes it is
    substantially larger than the next largest competitor and that
    it is the only significant manufacturer with its own North
    American distribution system.

Unilin
    Segment

The Company faces competition in the laminate and hardwood
    flooring channel from a large number of domestic and foreign
    manufacturers. The Company estimates that there are over 100
    wood flooring manufacturers located in various countries. The
    Company believes it is one of the largest manufacturers,
    distributors and marketers of laminate flooring in the world,
    with a focus on high-end products. The Company believes it is
    one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of hardwood
    flooring in the U.S. In addition, the Company believes it
    has a competitive advantage in the laminate flooring channel as
    a result of Unilin’s industry leading design and patented
    technologies, which allows the Company to distinguish its
    laminate and hardwood flooring products in the areas of finish,
    quality, installation and assembly.

Patents
    and Trademarks

Intellectual property is important to the Company’s
    business, and the Company relies on a combination of patent,
    copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to protect its
    interests.

The Company uses several trademarks that it considers important
    in the marketing of its products, including Aladdin, American
    Olean, Bigelow, Columbia Flooring, Century Flooring, Dal-Tile,
    “Duracolor

    UNICLIC family, as well as the snap, pretension, clearance and
    beveled edge patent families, which protects Unilin’s
    interlocking laminate flooring panel technology. The patents in
    the UNICLIC family are not expected to expire until 2017.



Sales
    Terms and Major Customers

The Company’s sales terms are substantially the same as
    those generally available throughout the industry. The Company
    generally permits its customers to return products purchased
    from it within specified time periods from the date of sale, if
    the customer is not satisfied with the quality of the product.

During 2010, no single customer accounted for more than 5% of
    total net sales, and the top ten customers accounted for less
    than 20% of the Company’s net sales. The Company believes
    the loss of one major customer would not have a material adverse
    effect on its business.

Employees

As of December 31, 2010, the Company employed approximately
    26,900 persons consisting of approximately 20,500 in the
    U.S., approximately 3,500 in Mexico, approximately 2,100 in
    Europe, approximately 700 in Malaysia and approximately 100 in
    Canada. The majority of the Company’s European and Mexican
    manufacturing employees are members of unions. Most of the
    Company’s U.S. employees are not a party to any
    collective bargaining agreement. Additionally, the Company has
    not experienced any strikes or work stoppages in the U.S.,
    Mexico or Malaysia for over 20 years. The Company believes
    that its relations with its employees are good.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Certain
    Factors affecting the Company’s Performance

In addition to the other information provided in this

Form 10-K,

the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating
    an investment in shares of the Company’s Common Stock.

If any of the events described in these risks were to occur, it
    could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    business, financial condition and results of operations.

The
    floor covering industry is sensitive to changes in general
    economic conditions, such as consumer confidence and income,
    corporate and government spending, interest rate levels,
    availability of credit and demand for housing. The downturn in
    the U.S. and global economies beginning in 2006, along with the
    residential and commercial markets in such economies, negatively
    impacted the floor covering industry and the Company’s
    business. While overall economic conditions and the housing and
    flooring industries have begun to show signs of recovering, this
    improvement may be temporary and economic conditions may
    deteriorate in the foreseeable future. Further, significant or
    prolonged declines in such economies or in spending for
    replacement floor covering products or new construction activity
    could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    business.

The floor covering industry in which the Company participates is
    highly dependent on general economic conditions, such as
    consumer confidence and income, corporate and government
    spending, interest rate levels, availability of credit and
    demand for housing. The Company derives a majority of its sales
    from the



replacement segment of the market. Therefore, economic changes
    that result in a significant or prolonged decline in spending
    for remodeling and replacement activities could have a material
    adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of
    operations.

The floor covering industry is highly dependent on residential
    and commercial construction activity, including new
    construction, which is cyclical in nature and currently in a
    downturn. The downturn in the U.S. and global economies,
    along with the housing markets in such economies, negatively
    impacted the floor covering industry and the Company’s
    business. Although the impact of a decline in new construction
    activity is typically accompanied by an increase in remodeling
    and replacement activity, these activities have also lagged
    during the downturn. While overall economic conditions and the
    housing and flooring industries have begun to show signs of
    recovering, this improvement may be temporary and economic
    conditions may deteriorate in the foreseeable future. A
    significant or prolonged decline in residential or commercial
    construction activity could have a material adverse effect on
    the Company’s business and results of operations.

In
    periods of rising costs, the Company may be unable to pass raw
    materials, energy and fuel-related cost increases on to its
    customers, which could have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s profitability.

The prices of raw materials and fuel-related costs could vary
    significantly with market conditions. Although the Company
    generally attempts to pass on increases in raw material, energy
    and fuel-related costs to its customers, the Company’s
    ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any
    increase, competitive pressures and market conditions for the
    Company’s products. There have been in the past, and may be
    in the future, periods of time during which increases in these
    costs cannot be recovered. During such periods of time, the
    Company’s profitability may be materially adversely
    affected.

Uncertainty
    in the credit market or downturns in the global economy and the
    Company’s business could affect the Company’s overall
    availability and cost of credit.

Uncertainty in the credit markets could affect the overall
    availability and cost of credit. Despite recent improvement in
    overall economic conditions, the impact of the economic downturn
    on the Company’s ability to obtain financing, including any
    financing necessary to refinance its existing senior unsecured
    notes, in the future, and the cost and terms of it, remains
    uncertain. These and other economic factors could have a
    material adverse effect on demand for the Company’s
    products and on its financial condition and operating results.
    Further, these generally negative economic and business
    conditions may factor into the Company’s periodic credit
    ratings assessment by either or both Moody’s Investors
    Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Ratings
    Services. A rating agency’s evaluation is based on a number
    of factors, which include scale and diversification, brand
    strength, profitability, leverage, liquidity and interest
    coverage. During 2009, the Company’s senior unsecured notes
    were downgraded by the rating agencies, which increased the
    Company’s interest expense by approximately
    $0.2 million per quarter per $100 million of
    outstanding notes and could adversely affect the cost of and
    ability to obtain additional credit in the future. Additional
    downgrades in the Company’s credit ratings could further
    increase the cost of its existing credit and adversely affect
    the cost of and ability to obtain additional credit in the
    future, and the Company can provide no assurances that
    additional downgrades will not occur.

The
    Company has a significant level of indebtedness that must be
    repaid or refinanced. In addition, if the Company were unable to
    meet certain covenants contained in the ABL Facility, it may be
    required to repay borrowings under the ABL Facility prior to
    their maturity and may lose access to the ABL Facility for
    additional borrowings that may be necessary to fund its
    operations.

The Company’s outstanding 7.20% senior notes in the
    aggregate amount of $400.0 million are due April 15,
    2012. The Company’s $600.0 million four-year, senior,
    secured revolving credit facility (the “ABL Facility”)
    is scheduled to mature on September 2, 2013, but the
    maturity date will accelerate, including the acceleration of any
    unamortized deferred financing costs, to January 15, 2012,
    if the Company’s outstanding 7.20% senior notes due
    April 15, 2012 have not been repaid, refinanced, defeased
    or adequately reserved for by the Company, as reasonably
    determined by the Administrative Agent, prior to
    January 15, 2012. The Company believes it will be able to
    make adequate reserves for such senior notes with cash and cash



equivalents, unutilized borrowing availability under the ABL
    Facility and other financing sources, including public debt
    markets or new bank facilities. As of December 31, 2010,
    the amount utilized under the ABL Facility was
    $387.1 million resulting in a total of $169.6 million
    available under the ABL Facility. The amount utilized included
    the reserved amount of $280.0 million related to the
    repayment of the Company’s outstanding 5.75% senior
    notes due January 15, 2011, $53.5 million of standby
    letters of credit guaranteeing the Company’s industrial
    revenue bonds and $53.5 million of standby letters of
    credit related to various insurance contracts and foreign vendor
    commitments. Immediately following the repayment of the
    5.75% senior notes due January 15, 2011 at maturity, a
    total of $289.6 million was available under the ABL
    Facility. While the Company currently believes it has access to
    other uncommitted financing sources, including public debt
    markets, to satisfy the January 15, 2012 requirements under
    the ABL Facility and the subsequent repayment of the
    7.20% senior notes due April 15, 2012, there can be no
    assurances that the Company will be able to complete any
    necessary financing transactions prior to the relevant date
    under the ABL Facility or the April 15, 2012 maturity date.

If the Company’s cash flow is worse than expected or the
    borrowing base on its ABL Facility declines, the Company may
    need to refinance all or a portion of its indebtedness in the
    public debt markets and may not be able to do so on terms
    acceptable to it, or at all. If the Company is unable to access
    debt markets at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts due
    to credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market
    disruption, or other factors, it could materially adversely
    affect the Company’s ability to repay its indebtedness and
    otherwise have a substantial adverse effect on the
    Company’s financial condition and results of operations.

Additionally, the Company’s credit facilities require it to
    meet certain affirmative and negative covenants that impose
    restrictions on its financial and business operations, including
    limitations relating to debt, investments, asset dispositions
    and changes in the nature of its business. The Company is also
    required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.1 to 1.0
    during any period that the unutilized amount available under the
    ABL Facility is less than 15% of the amount available under the
    ABL Facility. Failure to comply with these covenants could
    materially and adversely affect the Company’s ability to
    finance its operations or capital needs and to engage in other
    activities that may be in the Company’s best interest.

The
    Company faces intense competition in the flooring industry,
    which could decrease demand for the Company’s products or
    force it to lower prices, which could have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s profitability.

The floor covering industry is highly competitive. The Company
    faces competition from a number of manufacturers and independent
    distributors. Some of the Company’s competitors are larger
    and have greater resources and access to capital than the
    Company does. Maintaining the Company’s competitive
    position may require substantial investments in the
    Company’s product development efforts, manufacturing
    facilities, distribution network and sales and marketing
    activities. Competitive pressures may also result in decreased
    demand for the Company’s products or force the Company to
    lower prices. Any of these factors or others may impact demand
    which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    business.

The
    Company may be unable to obtain raw materials on a timely basis,
    which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    business.

The principal raw materials used in the Company’s
    manufacturing operations include nylon, polypropylene, triexta
    and polyester resins and fibers, which are used primarily in the
    Company’s carpet and rugs business; clay, talc, nepheline
    syenite and glazes, including frit (ground glass), zircon and
    stains, which are used exclusively in the Company’s ceramic
    tile business; wood, paper, and resins which are used primarily
    in the Company’s laminate flooring business. For certain of
    such raw materials, the Company is dependent on one or a small
    number of suppliers. An adverse change in the Company’s
    relationship with such a supplier, the financial condition of
    such a supplier or such supplier’s ability to manufacture
    or deliver such raw materials to the Company could lead to an
    interruption of supply or require the Company to purchase more
    expensive alternatives. An extended interruption in the supply
    of these or other raw materials used in the Company’s
    business or in the supply of suitable substitute materials would
    disrupt the Company’s operations, which could have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s business.



Fluctuations
    in currency exchange rates may impact the Company’s
    financial condition and results of operations and may affect the
    comparability of results between the Company’s financial
    periods.

The results of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries reported
    in the local currency are translated into U.S. dollars for
    balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect as of the
    balance sheet date and for the statement of operations accounts
    using, principally, the Company’s average rates during the
    period. The exchange rates between some of these currencies and
    the U.S. dollar in recent years have fluctuated
    significantly and may continue to do so in the future. The
    Company may not be able to manage effectively the Company’s
    currency translation risks and volatility in currency exchange
    rates may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements and affect comparability of
    the Company’s results between financial periods.

The
    Company may experience certain risks associated with
    acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic
    investments.

The Company has typically grown its business through
    acquisitions. Growth through acquisitions involves risks, many
    of which may continue to affect the Company after the
    acquisition. The Company cannot give assurance that an acquired
    company will achieve the levels of revenue, profitability and
    production that the Company expects. The combination of an
    acquired company’s business with the Company’s
    existing businesses involves risks. The Company cannot be
    assured that reported earnings will meet expectations because of
    goodwill and intangible asset impairment, increased interest
    costs and issuance of additional securities or incurrence of
    debt. The Company may also face challenges in consolidating
    functions, integrating the Company’s organizations,
    procedures, operations and product lines in a timely and
    efficient manner and retaining key personnel. These challenges
    may result in:

•

maintaining executive offices in different locations;

•

manufacturing and selling different types of products through
    different distribution channels;

•

conducting business from various locations;

•

maintaining different operating systems and software on
    different computer hardware; and

•

providing different employment and compensation arrangements for
    employees.

The diversion of management attention and any difficulties
    encountered in the transition and integration process could have
    a material adverse effect on the Company’s revenues, level
    of expenses and operating results.

Failure to successfully manage and integrate an acquisition with
    the Company’s existing operations could lead to the
    potential loss of customers of the acquired business, the
    potential loss of employees who may be vital to the new
    operations, the potential loss of business opportunities or
    other adverse consequences that could affect the Company’s
    financial condition and results of operations. Even if
    integration occurs successfully, failure of the acquisition to
    achieve levels of anticipated sales growth, profitability or
    productivity or otherwise perform as expected, may adversely
    impact the Company’s financial condition and results of
    operations.

In addition, we have made certain investments, including through
    joint ventures, in which we have a minority equity interest and
    lack management and operational control. The controlling joint
    venture partner in a joint venture investment may have business
    interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours,
    and business decisions or other actions or omissions of the
    controlling joint venture partner or the joint venture company
    may result in harm to our reputation or adversely affect the
    value of our investment in the joint venture.



A
    failure to identify suitable acquisition candidates or partners
    for strategic investments and to complete acquisitions could
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    business.

As part of the Company’s business strategy, the Company
    intends to continue to pursue a wide array of potential
    strategic transactions, including acquisitions of complementary
    businesses, as well as strategic investments and joint ventures.
    Although the Company regularly evaluates such opportunities, the
    Company may not be able successfully to identify suitable
    acquisition candidates or investment opportunities, to obtain
    sufficient financing on acceptable terms to fund such strategic
    transactions, to complete acquisitions and integrate acquired
    businesses with the Company’s existing businesses, or to
    manage profitably acquired businesses or strategic investments.

The
    Company has been, and in the future may be, subject to costs,
    liabilities and other obligations under existing or new laws and
    regulations, which could be significant.

The Company and its customers and suppliers are subject to
    various federal, state and local laws, regulations and licensing
    requirements. The Company faces risks and uncertainties related
    to compliance with and enforcement of increasingly numerous and
    complex federal, state and local laws and regulations. In
    addition, new laws and regulations may be enacted in the
    U.S. or abroad that may require the Company to incur
    additional personnel-related, environmental, or other costs on
    an ongoing basis, such as recently enacted healthcare
    legislation in the United States.

Further, the Company’s operations are subject to various
    environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including
    those governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, and the
    use, storage, treatment, recycling and disposal of materials and
    finished product. The applicable requirements under these laws
    are subject to amendment, to the imposition of new or additional
    requirements and to changing interpretations of agencies or
    courts. The Company could incur material expenditures to comply
    with new or existing regulations, including fines and penalties
    and increased costs of its operations. For example, enactment of
    climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by
    the U.S. Congress or various states, or the adoption of
    regulations by the EPA and analogous state or foreign
    governmental agencies that restrict emissions of greenhouse
    gases in areas in which the Company conducts business could have
    an adverse effect on its operations and demand for its products.
    The Company’s manufacturing processes use a significant
    amount of energy, especially natural gas. Increased regulation
    of energy use to address the possible emission of greenhouse
    gases and climate change could materially increase the
    Company’s manufacturing costs.

The nature of the Company’s business and operations,
    including the potential discovery of presently unknown
    environmental conditions, exposes it to the risk of claims under
    environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. The
    Company could incur material costs or liabilities in connection
    with such claims.

The
    Company’s business operations could suffer significant
    losses from natural disasters, catastrophes, fire or other
    unexpected events.

Many of the Company’s business activities involve
    substantial investments in manufacturing facilities and many
    products are produced at a limited number of locations. These
    facilities could be materially damaged by natural disasters,
    such as floods, tornados, hurricanes and earthquakes, or by fire
    or other unexpected events. The Company could incur uninsured
    losses and liabilities arising from such events, including
    damage to its reputation,

and/or

suffer material losses in operational capacity, which could have
    a material adverse impact on its business, financial condition
    and results of operations.

The
    Company may be exposed to litigation, claims and other legal
    proceedings in the ordinary course of business relating to its
    products, which could affect its results of operations and
    financial condition.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to a
    variety of product-related claims, lawsuits and legal
    proceedings, including those relating to product liability,
    product warranty, product recall, personal injury, and other
    matters that are inherently subject to many uncertainties
    regarding the possibility of a loss to the Company. Such matters
    could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of
    operations and financial condition if the Company is unable to
    successfully defend against or resolve these matters or if its



insurance coverage is insufficient to satisfy any judgments
    against the Company or settlements relating to these matters.
    Although the Company has product liability insurance, the
    policies may not provide coverage for certain claims against the
    Company or may not be sufficient to cover all possible
    liabilities. Further, the Company may not be able to maintain
    insurance at commercially acceptable premium levels. Moreover,
    adverse publicity arising from claims made against the Company,
    even if the claims were not successful, could adversely affect
    the Company’s reputation or the reputation and sales of its
    products.

The
    Company manufactures, sources and sells many products
    internationally and is exposed to risks associated with doing
    business globally.

The Company’s manufacturing facilities in Mexico and Europe
    represent a significant portion of the Company’s capacity
    for ceramic tile and laminate flooring, respectively, and the
    Company’s European operations represent a significant
    source of the Company’s revenues and profits. The business,
    regulatory and political environments in these countries differ
    from those in the U.S. In addition, the Company
    increasingly sells products, operates plants and invests in
    companies in other parts of the world. The Company’s
    international sales, operations and investments are subject to
    risks and uncertainties, including:

•

changes in foreign country regulatory requirements;

•

differing business practices associated with foreign operations;

•

various import/export restrictions and the availability of
    required import/export licenses;

•

imposition of foreign tariffs and other trade barriers;

•

political, legal and economic instability;

•

foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;

•

changes in foreign country tax rules, regulations and other
    requirements, such as changes in tax rates and statutory and
    judicial interpretations in tax laws;

•

inflation;

•

differing labor laws and changes in those laws;

•

work stoppages and disruptions in the shipping of imported and
    exported products;

•

government price controls;

•

extended payment terms and the inability to collect accounts
    receivable; and

•

tax inefficiencies and currency exchange controls that may
    adversely impact its ability to repatriate cash from

non-U.S. subsidiaries.

The Company cannot assure investors that it will succeed in
    developing and implementing policies and strategies to counter
    the foregoing factors effectively in each location where the
    Company does business and therefore that the foregoing factors
    will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    operations or upon its financial condition and results of
    operations.

If the
    Company is unable to protect its intellectual property rights,
    particularly with respect to the Company’s patented
    laminate flooring technology and its registered trademarks, the
    Company’s business and prospects could be
    harmed.

The future success and competitive position of certain of the
    Company’s businesses, particularly the Company’s
    laminate flooring business, depend in part upon the
    Company’s ability to obtain and maintain proprietary
    technology used in the Company’s principal product
    families. The Company relies, in part, on the patent, trade
    secret and trademark laws of the U.S. and countries in
    Europe, as well as confidentiality agreements with some of the
    Company’s employees, to protect that technology.



The Company has obtained a number of patents relating to the
    Company’s products and associated methods and has filed
    applications for additional patents, including the UNICLIC

®

family of patents, which protects Unilin’s interlocking
    laminate flooring panel technology. The Company cannot assure
    investors that any patents owned by or issued to it will provide
    the Company with competitive advantages, that third parties will
    not challenge these patents, or that the Company’s pending
    patent applications will be approved. In addition, patent
    filings by third parties, whether made before or after the date
    of the Company’s filings, could render the Company’s
    intellectual property less valuable.

Furthermore, despite the Company’s efforts, the Company may
    be unable to prevent competitors

and/or

third
    parties from using the Company’s technology without the
    Company’s authorization, independently developing
    technology that is similar to that of the Company or designing
    around the Company’s patents. The use of the Company’s
    technology or similar technology by others could reduce or
    eliminate any competitive advantage the Company has developed,
    cause the Company to lose sales or otherwise harm the
    Company’s business. In addition, if the Company does not
    obtain sufficient protection for the Company’s intellectual
    property, the Company’s competitiveness in the markets it
    serves could be significantly impaired, which would limit the
    Company’s growth and future revenue.

The Company has obtained and applied for numerous U.S. and
    Foreign Service marks and trademark registrations and will
    continue to evaluate the registration of additional service
    marks and trademarks, as appropriate. The Company cannot
    guarantee that any of the Company’s pending or future
    applications will be approved by the applicable governmental
    authorities. Moreover, even if such applications are approved,
    third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge the
    registrations. A failure to obtain trademark registrations in
    the U.S. and in other countries could limit the
    Company’s ability to protect the Company’s trademarks
    and impede the Company’s marketing efforts in those
    jurisdictions.

The Company generally requires third parties with access to the
    Company’s trade secrets to agree to keep such information
    confidential. While such measures are intended to protect the
    Company’s trade secrets, there can be no assurance that
    these agreements will not be breached, that the Company will
    have adequate remedies for any breach or that the Company’s
    confidential and proprietary information and technology will not
    be independently developed by or become otherwise known to third
    parties. In any of these circumstances, the Company’s
    competitiveness could be significantly impaired, which would
    limit the Company’s growth and future revenue.

Companies
    may claim that the Company infringed their intellectual property
    or proprietary rights, which could cause it to incur significant
    expenses or prevent it from selling the Company’s
    products.

In the past, companies have claimed that certain technologies
    incorporated in the Company’s products infringe their
    patent rights. There can be no assurance that the Company will
    not receive notices in the future from parties asserting that
    the Company’s products infringe, or may infringe, those
    parties’ intellectual property rights. The Company cannot
    be certain that the Company’s products do not and will not
    infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of
    others. Historically, patent applications in the U.S. and
    some foreign countries have not been publicly disclosed until
    the patent is issued (or, in some recent cases, until
    18 months following submission), and the Company may not be
    aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to the
    Company’s products or processes. If patents are later
    issued on these applications, the Company may be liable for
    infringement.

Furthermore, the Company may initiate claims or litigation
    against parties for infringement of the Company’s
    proprietary rights or to establish the invalidity,
    noninfringement, or unenforceability of the proprietary rights
    of others. Likewise, the Company may have similar claims brought
    against it by competitors. Litigation, either as plaintiff or
    defendant, could result in significant expense to the Company
    and divert the efforts of the Company’s technical and
    management personnel from operations, whether or not such
    litigation is resolved in the Company’s favor. In the event
    of an adverse ruling in any such litigation, the Company might
    be required to pay substantial damages (including punitive
    damages and attorney’s fees), discontinue the use and sale
    of infringing products, expend significant resources to develop
    non-infringing technology or obtain licenses to infringing
    technology. There can be no assurance that licenses to disputed
    technology or



intellectual property rights would be available on reasonable
    commercial terms, if at all. In the event of a successful claim
    against the Company along with failure to develop or license a
    substitute technology, the Company’s business, financial
    condition and results of operations would be materially and
    adversely affected.

The
    Company is subject to changing regulation of corporate
    governance and public disclosure that have increased both costs
    and the risk of noncompliance.

The Company’s stock is publicly traded. As a result, the
    Company is subject to the rules and regulations of federal and
    state agencies and financial market exchange entities charged
    with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies
    whose securities are publicly traded. These entities, including
    the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Securities
    and Exchange Commission and New York Stock Exchange, frequently
    issue new requirements and regulations. The Company’s
    efforts to comply with the regulations and interpretations have
    resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased
    general and administrative costs and diversion of
    management’s time and attention from revenue generating
    activities to compliance activities.

Declines
    in the Company’s business conditions may result in an
    impairment of the Company’s tangible and intangible assets
    which could result in a material non-cash charge.

A decrease in the Company’s market capitalization,
    including a short-term decline in stock price, or a negative
    long-term performance outlook, could result in an impairment of
    its tangible and intangible assets which results when the
    carrying value of the Company’s assets exceed their fair
    value. In 2008, the Company’s goodwill and other intangible
    assets suffered an impairment and additional impairment charges
    could occur in future periods.

The
    long-term performance of the Company’s business relies on
    its ability to attract, develop and retain talented
    management.

To be successful, the Company must attract, develop and retain
    highly qualified and talented personnel in management, sales,
    marketing, product design and innovation and operations, and as
    it considers entering new international markets, skilled
    personnel familiar with those markets. The Company competes with
    multinational firms for these employees and invests significant
    resources in recruiting, developing, motivating and retaining
    them. The failure to attract, develop, motivate and retain key
    employees could negatively affect the Company’s competitive
    position and its operating results.

The Company’s properties are in good condition and adequate
    for its requirements. The Company believes its principal plants
    are generally adequate to meet its production plans pursuant to
    the Company’s long-term sales goals. In the ordinary course
    of business, the Company monitors the condition of its
    facilities to ensure that they remain adequate to meet long-term
    sales goals and production plans.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

The Company is involved in litigation from time to time in the
    regular course of its business. Currently there are no material
    legal proceedings pending or known by the Company to be
    contemplated to which the Company is a party or to which any of
    its property is subject.

The Company believes that adequate provisions for resolution of
    all contingencies, claims and pending litigation have been made
    for probable losses and that the ultimate outcome of these
    actions will not have a material adverse effect on its financial
    condition but could have a material adverse effect on its
    results of operations in a given quarter or year.

Environmental
    Matters

The Company is subject to various federal, state, local and
    foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations,
    including those governing air emissions, wastewater discharges,
    the use, storage, treatment, recycling and disposal of solid and
    hazardous materials and finished product, and the cleanup of
    contamination associated therewith. Because of the nature of the
    Company’s business, the Company has incurred, and will
    continue to incur, costs relating to compliance with such laws
    and regulations. The Company is involved in various proceedings
    relating to environmental matters and is currently engaged in
    environmental investigation, remediation and post-closure care
    programs at certain sites. The Company has provided accruals for
    such activities that it has determined to be both probable and
    reasonably estimable. The Company does not expect that the
    ultimate liability with respect to such activities will have a
    material adverse effect on its operations, but may have an
    effect on the results of operations for a given quarter or
    annual period.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Overview

The Company is a leading producer of floor covering products for
    residential and commercial applications in the U.S. and
    residential applications in Europe with net sales in 2010 of
    $5.3 billion. The Company is the second largest carpet and
    rug manufacturer and one of the largest manufacturers, marketers
    and distributors of ceramic tile, natural stone and hardwood
    flooring in the U.S., as well as a leading producer of laminate
    flooring in the U.S. and Europe. In 2009, the primary
    categories of the U.S. floor covering industry were carpet
    and rug (55%), resilient and rubber (12%), ceramic tile (11%),
    hardwood (11%), stone (6%) and laminate (5%).

The U.S. floor covering industry experienced declining
    demand beginning in the fourth quarter of 2006 that worsened
    during the latter parts of 2008, and continued to decline in
    2009. In the first half of 2010 demand showed signs of
    recovering, but first half gains were lost in the second half of
    the year. Overall industry conditions in the U.S. are
    expected to improve during 2011, although the timing and size of
    a sustained recovery within the market remains uncertain.

The Company has three reporting segments: the Mohawk segment,
    the Dal-Tile segment and the Unilin segment. The Mohawk
    segment designs, manufactures, sources, distributes and markets
    its floor covering product lines, which include carpets, ceramic
    tile, laminate, rugs, carpet pad, hardwood and resilient,
    primarily in North America through its network of regional
    distribution centers and satellite warehouses using
    company-operated trucks, common carrier or rail transportation.
    The segment’s product lines are sold through various
    selling channels, which include independent floor covering
    retailers, home centers, mass merchandisers, department stores,
    commercial dealers and commercial end users. The Dal-Tile
    segment designs, manufactures, sources, distributes and markets
    a broad line of ceramic tile, porcelain tile, natural stone and
    other products, primarily in North America through its network
    of regional distribution centers and Company-operated sales
    service centers using company-operated trucks, common carriers
    or rail transportation. The segment’s product lines are
    sold through Company-owned sales service centers, independent
    distributors, home center retailers, tile and flooring retailers
    and contractors. The Unilin segment designs, manufactures,
    sources, licenses, distributes and markets laminate, hardwood
    flooring, roofing systems, insulation panels and other wood
    products, primarily in North America and Europe through various
    selling channels, which include retailers, independent
    distributors and home centers.

The Company reported net earnings attributable to the Company of
    $185.5 million or diluted earnings per share
    (“EPS”) of $2.65 for 2010, compared to net loss
    attributable to the Company of $5.5 million or loss per
    share of $0.08 for 2009. The change in EPS is primarily the
    result of lower restructuring charges, tax benefits related to
    the settlement of certain tax contingencies in 2010 and the
    impact of geographic dispersion of profits and losses on income
    taxes. During 2009, the Company recognized an increased number
    of warranty claims related to the performance of commercial
    carpet tiles that used a newer carpet backing technology. The
    Company discontinued sales of carpet tiles using this backing
    technology in 2009. Therefore, 2009 EPS included the pre-tax
    $121.2 million carpet sales allowance and a
    $12.3 million inventory write-off related to the warranty
    claims, as well as the unfavorable impact of higher raw material
    costs flowing through cost of sales of approximately
    $62 million. The amounts recorded for the carpet sales
    allowance reflected the Company’s best estimate, but the
    actual amount of total claims and related costs could vary from
    such estimate. The Company now manufactures these types of
    commercial carpet tiles with a different backing technology that
    has been used for many years by the Company.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company generated
    $319.7 million of operating cash flow which it used to
    repay debt and fund working capital. As of December 31,
    2010, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of
    $354.2 million. Subsequent to the balance sheet date, the
    Company repaid the 5.75% senior notes due January 15,
    2011 at maturity, including accrued interest, using
    approximately $170 million of available cash and borrowings
    of approximately $138 million under its $600.0 million
    four-year, senior, secured revolving credit facility (the
    “ABL Facility”).



On February 25, 2011, subsequent to the balance sheet date, the
    Company announced a plan to exit a manufacturing facility in the
    Mohawk segment. The Company is finalizing its estimates and
    expects to record a restructuring charge in the first quarter of
    2011.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2010, as Compared with Year Ended

Net
    sales

Net sales for 2010 were $5,319.1 million, reflecting a
    decrease of $25.0 million, or 0.5%, from the
    $5,344.0 million reported for 2009. Included in net sales
    for 2009 is a carpet sales allowance of $121.2 million. For
    2010, net sales decreased primarily due to lower sales volume of
    approximately $81 million, primarily related to continued
    weakness in the residential, commercial and new construction
    markets, unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately
    $37 million and the net effect of price and product mix of
    approximately $28 million, driven by customers trading down
    to lower priced products and distribution channel mix.

Mohawk Segment

— Net sales decreased
    $11.9 million, or 0.4%, to $2,844.9 million in 2010
    compared to $2,856.7 million in 2009. Included in net sales
    for 2009 is a carpet sales allowance of $121.2 million. For
    2010, net sales decreased primarily due to lower sales volume of
    approximately $183 million, primarily related to continued
    weakness in the soft surface product category, partially offset
    by approximately $50 million due to the net effect of price
    and product mix as a result of price increases to offset higher
    raw material costs.

Dal-Tile Segment

— Net sales decreased
    $59.3 million, or 4.2%, to $1,367.4 million in 2010
    compared to $1,426.8 million in 2009. The decrease in net
    sales was primarily driven by the net effect of price and
    product mix of approximately $51 million, primarily driven
    by customer mix, and lower sales volume of approximately
    $17 million, primarily related to continued weakness in the
    commercial, residential and new construction markets, partially
    offset by the impact of favorable foreign exchange rates of
    approximately $9 million.

Unilin Segment

— Net sales increased
    $60.0 million, or 5.3%, to $1,188.3 million in 2010
    compared to $1,128.3 million in 2009. The increase in net
    sales was primarily driven by higher sales volume of



approximately $132 million as a result of growth in
    developing markets, partially offset by the impact of
    unfavorable foreign exchange rates of approximately
    $46 million and the net effect of price and product mix of
    approximately $27 million, as customers traded down to
    lower priced products.

Quarterly net sales and the percentage changes in net sales by

Gross
    profit

Gross profit for 2010 was $1,402.6 million (26.4% of net
    sales) and represented an increase of $170.4 million, or
    13.8%, compared to gross profit of $1,232.2 million (23.1%
    of net sales) for 2009. Gross profit for 2009 includes a carpet
    sales allowance of $121.2 million and inventory write-off
    of $12.4 million. For 2010, gross profit was favorably
    impacted by approximately $50 million as a result of
    various restructuring actions and cost savings initiatives
    implemented by the Company, including facility consolidations,
    workforce reductions and productivity improvements, lower
    restructuring charges of approximately $32 million and the
    net effect of price and product mix of approximately
    $27 million. These increases were partially offset by
    higher manufacturing costs, primarily raw materials, of
    approximately $58 million, lower sales volume of
    approximately $13 million and the impact of unfavorable
    foreign exchange rates of approximately $11 million.

Selling,
    general and administrative expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2010 were
    $1,088.4 million (20.5% of net sales), reflecting a
    decrease of $100.1 million, or 8.4%, compared to
    $1,188.5 million (22.2% of net sales) for 2009. The
    decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses is
    primarily driven by various restructuring actions and cost
    savings initiatives implemented by the Company, including
    distribution facility consolidations, workforce reductions and
    productivity improvements, to align such expenses with the
    Company’s sales volumes.

Operating
    income

Operating income for 2010 was $314.2 million (5.9% of net
    sales) reflecting a $270.4 million increase compared to an
    operating income of $43.7 million (0.8% of net sales) in
    2009. Operating income for 2009 includes a carpet sales
    allowance and inventory write-off of $133.5 million. For
    2010, operating income was favorably impacted by approximately
    $128 million as a result of lower selling, general and
    administrative expenses and various restructuring actions and
    cost savings initiatives implemented by the Company, lower
    restructuring charges of approximately $49 million and the
    net effect of price and product mix of approximately
    $27 million, partially offset by higher manufacturing
    costs, primarily raw materials, of approximately
    $58 million and lower sales volume of approximately
    $13 million.

Mohawk Segment

— Operating income was
    $122.9 million (4.3% of segment net sales) in 2010
    reflecting an increase of $248.9 million compared to
    operating loss of $126.0 million in 2009. Operating loss
    for 2009 includes a carpet sales allowance and inventory
    write-off of $133.5 million. For 2010, operating income was
    favorably impacted by approximately $101 million as a
    result of lower selling, general and administrative expenses and
    various restructuring actions and cost savings initiatives
    implemented by the Company, the net effect of price and product
    mix of approximately $66 million and lower restructuring
    charges of approximately $19 million, partially offset by
    higher manufacturing costs, primarily raw materials, of
    approximately $25 million and lower sales volume of
    approximately $45 million.



Dal-Tile Segment

— Operating income was
    $97.3 million (7.1% of segment net sales) in 2010
    reflecting an increase of $13.2 million, or 15.7%, compared
    to operating income of $84.2 million (5.9% of segment net
    sales) for 2009. The increase was primarily driven by the
    favorable impact of approximately $20 million as a result
    of lower selling, general and administrative expenses and
    various restructuring actions and cost savings initiatives
    implemented by the Company, lower restructuring charges of
    approximately $16 million and lower manufacturing expenses
    of approximately $4 million, partially offset by the net
    effect of price and product mix of approximately
    $28 million.

Unilin Segment

— Operating income was
    $114.3 million (9.6% of segment net sales) in 2010
    reflecting an increase of $8.3 million, or 7.9%, compared
    to operating income of $106.0 million (9.4% of segment net
    sales) for 2009. The increase was primarily driven by higher
    sales volume of approximately $42 million, lower
    restructuring charges of approximately $14 million and
    lower selling, general and administrative expenses of
    approximately $5 million, offset by higher manufacturing
    costs, primarily raw materials, of approximately
    $36 million, the net effect of price and product mix of
    approximately $10 million and unfavorable foreign exchange
    rates of approximately $6 million.

Interest
    expense

Interest expense for 2010 was $133.2 million compared to
    $127.0 million in 2009. The increase in interest expense
    resulted from the $7.5 million premium and fees related to
    the extinguishment of approximately $200 million aggregate
    principal amount of the Company’s 5.75% senior notes
    due January 15, 2011, higher costs on the Company’s
    revolving credit facility and higher interest rates on the
    Company’s notes, partially offset by the impact of lower
    debt levels.

U.S.
    customs refund

The Company has received partial refunds from the
    U.S. government in reference to settling customs disputes
    dating back to 1986. Accordingly, the Company realized a gain of
    $7.7 million in other expense (income) for 2010. The
    Company is pursuing additional recoveries for years subsequent
    to 1986 but there can be no assurances such recoveries will
    occur. Additional future recoveries, if any, will be recorded as
    realized.

Income
    tax expense (benefit)

For 2010, the Company recorded an income tax expense of
    $2.7 million on earnings before income taxes of
    $192.6 million compared to a benefit of $76.7 million
    on loss before income taxes of $77.7 million for 2009. The
    2010 effective tax rate of 1.4% is primarily due to a tax
    benefit of approximately $30 million related to the
    settlement of certain income tax contingencies in Europe, the
    favorable geographic dispersion of profits and losses resulting
    in a tax benefit of approximately $21 million and a
    decrease in valuation allowance of approximately
    $17 million related to European deferred tax assets. The
    2009 effective tax rate of 98.7% was the result of the
    geographic dispersion of profits and losses resulting in a tax
    benefit of approximately $13 million, a permanent tax
    benefit in Europe on notional interest of approximately
    $56 million, offset by an increase to the Company’s
    valuation allowance and tax contingencies of approximately
    $19 million.

Net
    sales

Net sales for 2009 were $5,344.0 million, reflecting a
    decrease of $1,482.3 million, or 21.7%, from the
    $6,826.3 million reported for 2008. The decrease was
    primarily driven by a decline in sales volumes of approximately
    $1,047 million due to the continued weakness in the
    U.S. residential remodeling and new construction markets,
    commercial real estate market and European demand, a decline of
    approximately $298 million due to unfavorable price and
    product mix as customers trade down to lower priced products, a
    decrease of approximately $81 million due to a net increase
    in warranty requirements described in the overview and a decline
    of approximately $56 million due to unfavorable foreign
    exchange rates and other.



Mohawk Segment

— Net sales decreased
    $771.4 million, or 21.3%, to $2,856.7 million in 2009
    compared to $3,628.2 million in 2008. The decrease was
    primarily driven by a decline in sales volumes of approximately
    $531 million due to the continued weakness in the
    U.S. residential remodeling and new construction markets
    and the declining commercial real estate market, a decline of
    approximately $151 million due to unfavorable price and
    product mix as customers trade down to lower priced products and
    a decrease of approximately $81 million due to a net
    increase in warranty requirements described above in the
    overview.

Dal-Tile Segment

— Net sales decreased
    $388.6 million, or 21.4%, to $1,426.8 million in 2009
    compared to $1,815.4 million in 2008. The decrease was
    primarily driven by a decline in sales volumes of approximately
    $301 million due to the continued weakness in the
    U.S. residential remodeling and new construction markets
    and the declining commercial real estate market, a decline of
    approximately $73 million due to unfavorable price and
    product mix as customers trade down to lower priced products and
    a decline of approximately $15 million due to unfavorable
    foreign exchange rates.

Unilin Segment

— Net sales decreased
    $336.9 million, or 23.0%, to $1,128.3 million in 2009
    compared to $1,465.2 million in 2008. The decrease was
    driven by a decline in sales volumes of approximately
    $215 million due to the continued weakness in the
    U.S. residential remodeling and new construction markets
    and slowing European demand, a decline of approximately
    $74 million due to the net effect of price and product mix
    as customers trade down to lower priced products and a decline
    of approximately $48 million due to unfavorable foreign
    exchange rates.

Gross
    profit

Gross profit for 2009 was $1,232.2 million (23.1% of net
    sales) and represented a decrease of $505.5 million
    compared to gross profit of $1,737.8 million (25.5% of net
    sales) for 2008. Gross profit in 2009 was unfavorably impacted
    by approximately $315 million resulting from lower sales
    volume, a decline of approximately $185 million due to the
    net effect of price and product mix, a decline of approximately
    $89 million due to a net increase in warranty requirements
    described above in the overview, restructuring charges of
    approximately $28 million and the impact of unfavorable
    foreign exchange rates of approximately $9 million,
    partially offset by lower manufacturing costs of approximately
    $120 million. The decrease in gross profit percentage is
    primarily attributable to unfavorable price and product mix,
    increased warranty requirements and restructuring costs,
    partially offset by lower raw material and manufacturing costs

Selling,
    general and administrative expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2009 were
    $1,188.5 million (22.2% of net sales), reflecting a
    decrease of $130.0 million, or 9.9%, compared to
    $1,318.5 million (19.3% of net sales) for the prior year.
    The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses is
    primarily driven by lower sales and various cost savings
    initiatives implemented by the Company, including distribution
    facility consolidations, workforce reductions and productivity
    improvements, to align such expenses with the Company’s
    sales volumes, partially offset by approximately $8 million
    of unfavorable foreign exchange rates and approximately
    $4 million for restructuring charges. The increase in
    selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of
    net sales is primarily a result of a higher mix of fixed costs
    on lower net sales, and restructuring costs.



Operating
    income (loss)

Operating income for 2009 was $43.7 million (0.8% of net
    sales) reflecting an increase of $1,167.9 million compared
    to an operating loss of $1,124.1 million in 2008. The
    change was primarily driven by the recognition of an impairment
    of goodwill and other intangibles of $1,543.4 million in
    2008. In addition, operating income in 2009 was impacted by a
    decline of approximately $315 million due to lower sales
    volumes, a decline of approximately $185 million due to
    unfavorable price and product mix, a decrease of approximately
    $89 million due to a net increase in warranty requirements
    described above in the overview and restructuring charges of
    approximately $32 million, partially offset by lower
    manufacturing and selling, general and administrative costs of
    approximately $244 million.

Mohawk Segment

— Operating loss was
    $126.0 million in 2009 reflecting a decrease of
    $90.2 million compared to operating loss of
    $216.2 million in 2008. The increase was primarily driven
    by the recognition of an impairment of goodwill and other
    intangibles of $276.8 million in 2008. In addition,
    operating income in 2009 was impacted by a decline of
    approximately $133 million due to lower sales volumes, a
    decrease of approximately $89 million due to a net increase
    in warranty requirements and a decline of approximately
    $74 million due to unfavorable price and product mix and
    restructuring charges of approximately $7 million,
    partially offset by lower manufacturing and selling, general and
    administrative costs of approximately $116 million.

Dal-Tile Segment

— Operating income was
    $84.2 million (5.9% of segment net sales) in 2009
    reflecting an increase of $407.5 million compared to
    operating loss of $323.4 million for 2008. The change was
    primarily driven by the recognition of an impairment of goodwill
    and other intangibles of $531.9 million in 2008. In
    addition, operating income in 2009 was impacted by a decline of
    approximately $108 million due to lower sales volumes, a
    decline of approximately $35 million due to unfavorable
    price and product mix and restructuring charges of approximately
    $12 million, partially offset by lower manufacturing and
    selling, general and administrative costs of approximately
    $23 million.

Unilin Segment

— Operating income was
    $106.0 million (9.4% of segment net sales) in 2009
    reflecting an increase of $670.9 million compared to
    operating loss of $564.9 million for 2008. The increase was
    primarily driven by the recognition of an impairment of goodwill
    and other intangibles of $734.7 million in 2008. In
    addition, operating income in 2009 was impacted by a decline of
    approximately $76 million due to the net effect of price
    and product mix, a decline in sales volumes of approximately
    $74 million, restructuring charges of approximately
    $13 million and the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange
    rates of approximately $8 million, partially offset by
    lower raw material, manufacturing and selling, general and
    administrative costs of approximately $107 million.

Interest
    expense

Interest expense for 2009 was $127.0 million compared to
    $127.1 million in 2008. Interest expense in 2009 was
    directly impacted by higher interest rates on the Company’s
    notes and revolving credit facilities due to three credit rating
    downgrades in 2009, partially offset by lower average debt
    levels in the current year compared to 2008.

Income
    tax (benefit) expense

For 2009, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of
    $76.7 million on loss before taxes of $77.7 million as
    compared to income tax expense of $180.1 million on loss
    before taxes of $1,272.5 million for 2008. The change is
    principally due to the non-deductible 2008 goodwill impairment
    charge, the recognition of a valuation allowance against a
    deferred asset of approximately $253 million, and the
    geographic distribution of income (loss).

In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company moved the
    intellectual property and treasury operations of an indirectly
    owned European entity to a new office in another jurisdiction in
    Europe. The Company also indirectly owned a holding company in
    the new jurisdiction that provided certain treasury functions to
    Unilin, and the move allowed for the consolidation of the
    historical intellectual property and treasury operations to be



combined with those of the holding company’s treasury
    operations in a single jurisdiction in order to integrate and
    streamline the operations, to facilitate international
    acquisitions and to improve tax and cost efficiencies. This
    restructuring resulted in a step up in the subsidiary’s
    taxable basis of its intellectual property. The step up relates
    primarily to intangible assets which will be amortized over
    10 years for tax purposes. During the fourth quarter of
    2007, the Company evaluated the evidence for recognition of the
    deferred tax asset created through the restructuring and
    determined that, based on the available evidence at the time,
    the deferred tax asset would more likely than not be realized.
    The deferred tax asset recognized as of December 31, 2007
    was approximately $245 million and the related income tax
    benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements was
    approximately $272 million.

During the third quarter of 2008, the Company reassessed the
    need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.
    Cash flows had decreased from that projected as of
    December 31, 2007, primarily due to the slowing worldwide
    economy and declining sales volume. The Company determined that,
    given the current and expected economic conditions and the
    corresponding reductions in cash flows, its ability to realize
    the benefit of the deferred tax asset related to the transaction
    described above as well as tax losses generated in the same
    jurisdiction was not more likely than not. Accordingly the
    Company recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred tax
    asset in the amount of $253 million during the quarter
    ended September 27, 2008.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

The Company’s primary capital requirements are for working
    capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. The
    Company’s capital needs are met primarily through a
    combination of internally generated funds, bank credit lines and
    credit terms from suppliers.

Cash flows provided by operations for 2010 were
    $319.7 million compared to cash flows provided by
    operations of $672.2 million in 2009. The decrease in
    operating cash flows for 2010 as compared to 2009 is primarily
    attributable to higher working capital requirements as the
    Company’s inventory levels stabilize to meet current market
    conditions and the impact of higher raw material costs,
    partially offset by higher earnings.

Cash flows provided by operations for 2009 were
    $672.2 million compared to cash flows provided by
    operations of $576.1 million in 2008. The increase in
    operating cash flows for 2009 as compared to 2008 is primarily
    attributable to lower working capital requirements due to lower
    sales demand.

Net cash used in investing activities for 2010 was
    $231.5 million compared to $114.8 million in 2009. The
    increase is due to the investment of $79.9 million in a
    Chinese tile manufacturer and higher capital spending during
    2010 as compared to 2009. Capital expenditures, including
    $94.1 million for acquisitions, have totaled
    $577.0 million over the past three years. Capital spending
    during 2011, excluding acquisitions, is expected to range from
    $270 million to $300 million, and is intended to be
    used primarily to purchase equipment and to streamline
    manufacturing capacity.

Net cash used in investing activities for 2009 was
    $114.8 million compared to $226.1 million in 2008. The
    decrease is due to lower capital spending as a result of lower
    sales and tighter management of expenditures during 2009 as
    compared to 2008.

Net cash used in financing activities for 2010 was
    $255.2 million compared to net cash used by financing
    activities of $125.8 million in 2009. The change in cash
    used in financing activities as compared to 2009 is primarily
    attributable to the higher debt repayments in 2010, principally
    the repayment of $200.0 million aggregate principal amount
    of the Company’s outstanding 5.75% senior notes due
    January 15, 2011, and the establishment of a
    $27.9 million restricted cash account to repay the
    remaining outstanding 5.75% senior notes due
    January 15, 2011, compared to 2009.

Net cash used in financing activities for 2009 was
    $125.8 million compared to net cash used by financing
    activities of $348.9 million in 2008. The change in cash
    used in financing activities as compared to 2008 is primarily
    attributable to lower debt levels as the Company manages its
    working capital requirements to align with its current sales.



On September 2, 2009, the Company entered the ABL Facility
    in connection with the replacement of the Company’s
    then-existing senior, unsecured, revolving credit facility (the
    “Senior Unsecured Facility”). At the time of its
    termination, the Senior Unsecured Facility consisted of a
    $650.0 million revolving credit facility, which was to
    mature on October 28, 2010. The ABL Facility provides for a
    maximum of $600.0 million of revolving credit, subject to
    borrowing base availability, including limited amounts of credit
    in the form of letters of credit and swingline loans. The
    borrowing base is equal to specified percentages of eligible
    accounts receivable and inventories of the borrowers under the
    ABL Facility, which are subject to seasonal variations, less
    reserves established in good faith by the Administrative Agent
    under the ABL Facility. All obligations under the ABL Facility,
    and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured by a
    security interest in certain accounts receivable, inventories,
    certain deposit and securities accounts, tax refunds and other
    personal property (excluding intellectual property) directly
    relating to, or arising from, and proceeds of any of the
    foregoing. On June 1, 2010, the Company amended the ABL
    Facility to, among other things, reduce the applicable interest
    rate margins on loans and reduce the commitment fees.

At the Company’s election, revolving loans under the ABL
    Facility bear interest at annual rates equal to either
    (a) LIBOR for 1, 2, 3 or 6 month periods, as selected
    by the Company, plus an applicable margin ranging between 2.75%
    and 3.25%, or (b) the higher of the prime rate, the Federal
    Funds rate plus 0.5%, or a one-month LIBOR rate, plus an
    applicable margin ranging between 1.25% and 1.75%. The Company
    also pays a commitment fee to the lenders under the ABL Facility
    on the average amount by which the aggregate commitments of the
    lenders’ exceed utilization of the ABL Facility equal to
    0.65% per annum during any quarter that this excess is 50% or
    more and 0.50% per annum during any quarter that this excess is
    less than 50%.

The ABL Facility includes certain affirmative and negative
    covenants that impose restrictions on the Company’s
    financial and business operations, including limitations on
    debt, liens, investments, fundamental changes, asset
    dispositions, dividends and other similar restricted payments,
    transactions with affiliates, payments and modifications of
    certain existing debt, future negative pledges, and changes in
    the nature of the Company’s business. Many of these
    limitations are subject to numerous exceptions. The Company is
    also required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.1
    to 1.0 during any period that the unutilized amount available
    under the ABL Facility is less than 15% of the
    lenders’ aggregated commitments.

The ABL Facility is scheduled to mature on September 2,
    2013 but the maturity date will accelerate, including the
    acceleration of any unamortized deferred financing costs, to
    January 15, 2012, if the Company’s outstanding
    7.20% senior notes due April 15, 2012 have not been
    repaid, refinanced, defeased or adequately reserved for by the
    Company, as reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent,
    prior to January 15, 2012. The Company believes it will be
    able to make adequate reserves for such senior notes with cash
    and cash equivalents, unutilized borrowings under the ABL and
    other uncommitted financing sources, including new public debt
    offerings or bank facilities, although there can be no
    assurances that the Company will be able to complete any
    necessary financing transactions prior to the relevant date
    under the ABL Facility or the April 15, 2012 maturity date.

As of December 31, 2010, the amount utilized under the ABL
    Facility was $387.1 million resulting in a total of
    $169.6 million available under the ABL Facility. The amount
    utilized included the reserved amount of $280.0 million
    related to the repayment of the Company’s outstanding
    5.75% senior notes due January 15, 2011, discussed
    below, $53.5 million of standby letters of credit
    guaranteeing the Company’s industrial revenue bonds and
    $53.5 million of standby letters of credit related to
    various insurance contracts and foreign vendor commitments.
    Immediately following the repayment of the 5.75% senior
    notes due January 15, 2011 at maturity, a total of
    $289.6 million was available under the ABL Facility.

On January 17, 2006, the Company issued $900.0 million
    aggregate principal amount of 6.125% notes due 2016.
    Interest payable on these notes is subject to adjustment if
    either Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.
    (“Moody’s”) or Standard & Poor’s
    Ratings Services (“Standard & Poor’s”),
    or both, downgrades the rating assigned to the notes. Each
    rating agency downgrade results in a 0.25% increase in the
    interest rate, subject to a maximum increase of 1% per rating
    agency. If later the rating of these notes improves, then the
    interest rates would be reduced accordingly. Each 0.25% increase
    in the interest rate of these notes would increase the



Company’s interest expense by approximately
    $0.1 million per quarter per $100 million of
    outstanding notes. Currently, the interest rates have been
    increased by an aggregate amount of 0.75% as a result of
    downgrades by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s
    during 2009. Additional downgrades in the Company’s credit
    ratings could further increase the cost of its existing credit
    and adversely affect the cost of and ability to obtain
    additional credit in the future.

On April 12, 2010, the Company purchased for cash
    approximately $200 million aggregate principal amount of
    its outstanding 5.75% senior notes due January 15,
    2011 at a price equal to 103.5% of the principal amount, which
    resulted in a premium to tendering noteholders of approximately
    $7 million. The debt extinguishment resulted in a decrease
    in interest expense of approximately $10 million over the
    remaining term of the notes. In connection with the
    extinguishment, the Company paid approximately $0.5 million
    in fees and accelerated the remaining deferred financing costs
    incurred in the original issuance of the notes that were
    purchased by the Company. The premium and fees associated with
    the cash tender are included in interest expense on the 2010
    consolidated statement of operations. On October 14, 2010,
    the Company deposited $27.9 million of cash in a restricted
    account under the control of the Administrative Agent and
    reserved $280.0 million on the ABL Facility to repay the
    remaining amount outstanding of the 5.75% senior notes due
    January 15, 2011, which actions were determined by the
    Administrative Agent to adequately reserve (for purposes of the
    ABL Facility) for the repayment of such notes. Subsequent to the
    balance sheet date, the Company repaid the 5.75% senior
    notes due January 15, 2011 at maturity, using approximately
    $170 million of available cash and borrowings of
    approximately $138 million under the ABL Facility.

In 2002, the Company issued $400.0 million aggregate
    principal amount of its senior 7.20% notes due
    April 15, 2012.

As of December 31, 2010, the Company had invested cash of
    $334.8 million in money market AAA rated cash investments
    of which $149.6 million was in North America and
    $185.2 million was in Europe. The Company believes that its
    cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash generated from
    operations, availability under its ABL Facility and other
    financing sources, including new public debt offerings or bank
    facilities, will be sufficient to adequately reserve for, repay,
    defease or refinance its 7.20% senior notes due
    April 15, 2012, on or before January 15, 2012 as
    required by the ABL Facility, and meet its capital expenditure
    and working capital requirements over the next twelve months.

The Company may from time to time seek to retire its outstanding
    debt through cash purchases in the open market, privately
    negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any,
    will depend on prevailing market conditions, the Company’s
    liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other
    factors. The amount involved may be material.

The Company’s Board of Directors has authorized the
    repurchase of up to 15 million shares of the Company’s
    outstanding common stock. Since the inception of the program in
    1999, a total of approximately 11.5 million shares have
    been repurchased at an aggregate cost of approximately
    $334.7 million. All of these repurchases have been financed
    through the Company’s operations and banking arrangements.
    No shares were repurchased during 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

In preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the
    Company must make decisions which impact the reported amounts of
    assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related
    disclosures. Such decisions include the selection of appropriate
    accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which
    to base accounting estimates. In reaching such decisions, the
    Company applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis
    of the relevant circumstances and historical experience. Actual
    amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the
    consolidated financial statements are prepared.

The Company’s significant accounting policies are described
    in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included
    elsewhere in this report. Some of those significant accounting
    policies require the Company to make subjective or complex
    judgments or estimates. Critical accounting policies are defined
    as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a
    company’s financial condition and results and require
    management’s most difficult, subjective, or complex
    judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about
    the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may
    change in subsequent periods.

The Company believes the following accounting policies require
    it to use judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated
    financial statements and represent critical accounting policies.



•

Accounts receivable and revenue
    recognition.

Revenues are recognized when there
    is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred,
    the price has been fixed or is determinable, and collectability
    can be reasonably assured. The Company provides allowances for
    expected cash discounts, sales allowances, returns, claims and
    doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debt and claims
    experience and periodic evaluation of specific customer accounts
    and the aging of accounts receivable. If the financial condition
    of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting
    in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional
    allowances may be required. A 10% change in the Company’s
    allowance for discounts, returns, claims and doubtful accounts
    would have affected net earnings by approximately
    $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.

•

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (net
    realizable value).

Cost has been determined using
    the

first-in

first-out method (“FIFO”). Costs included in inventory
    include raw materials, direct and indirect labor and employee
    benefits, depreciation, general manufacturing overhead and
    various other costs of manufacturing. Market, with respect to
    all inventories, is replacement cost or net realizable value.
    Inventories on hand are compared against anticipated future
    usage, which is a function of historical usage, anticipated
    future selling price, expected sales below cost, excessive
    quantities and an evaluation for obsolescence. Actual results
    could differ from assumptions used to value obsolete inventory,
    excessive inventory or inventory expected to be sold below cost
    and additional reserves may be required. A 10% change in the
    Company’s reserve for excess or obsolete inventory would
    have affected net earnings by approximately $4 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2010.

•

Goodwill and other intangibles.

Goodwill is
    tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter or
    earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive
    changes in circumstances. The Company considers the relationship
    between its market capitalization and its book value, among
    other factors, when reviewing for indicators of impairment. The
    goodwill impairment tests are based on determining the fair
    value of the specified reporting units based on management
    judgments and assumptions using the discounted cash flows and
    comparable company market valuation approaches. The Company has
    identified Mohawk, Dal-Tile, Unilin Flooring, Unilin Chipboard
    and Melamine, and Unilin Roofing as its reporting units for the
    purposes of allocating goodwill and intangibles as well as
    assessing impairments. The valuation approaches are subject to
    key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change such
    as judgments and assumptions about appropriate sales growth
    rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital
    (“WACC”), and comparable company market multiples.
    When developing these key judgments and assumptions, the Company
    considers economic, operational and market conditions that could
    impact the fair value of the reporting unit. However, estimates
    are inherently uncertain and represent only management’s
    reasonable expectations regarding future developments. These
    estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the
    estimates are based will, in all likelihood, differ in some
    respects from actual future results. Should a significant or
    prolonged deterioration in economic conditions occur, such as
    continued declines in spending for new construction, remodeling
    and replacement activities; the inability to pass increases in
    the costs of raw materials and fuel on to customers; or a
    decline in comparable company market multiples, then key
    judgments and assumptions could be impacted. Generally, a
    decline in estimated after tax cash flows of more than 20% or a
    more than 15% increase in WACC or a decline in market
    capitalization could result in an additional indication of
    impairment.

The impairment test for intangible assets not subject to
    amortization involves a comparison of the estimated fair value
    of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying
    value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an
    impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
    Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include
    assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, royalty rates,
    WACC and the amount of expected future cash flows. These
    judgments and assumptions are subject to the variability
    discussed above.

The impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible
    assets, which for the Company are its trademarks, is conducted
    during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might
    be impaired. The determination of fair value used in the
    impairment evaluation is based on discounted estimates of future
    sales projections attributable to



ownership of the trademarks. Significant judgments inherent in
    this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth
    rates, royalty rates, WACC and the amount of expected future
    cash flows. The judgments and assumptions used in the estimate
    of fair value are generally consistent with past performance and
    are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that
    are used in current operating plans. Such assumptions are
    subject to change as a result of changing economic and
    competitive conditions. The determination of fair value is
    highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual
    cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to
    evaluate the fair value of the trademarks. Estimated cash flows
    are sensitive to changes in the economy among other things.

The Company reviews its long-lived asset groups, which include
    intangible assets subject to amortization, which for the Company
    are its patents and customer relationships, for impairment
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
    carrying amount of such asset groups may not be recoverable.
    Recoverability of asset groups to be held and used is measured
    by a comparison of the carrying amount of long-lived assets to
    future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by
    these asset groups. If such asset groups are considered to be
    impaired, the impairment recognized is the amount by which the
    carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the
    asset group. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of
    the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs of
    disposal and are no longer depreciated.

The Company conducted its annual assessment of goodwill and
    indefinite lived intangibles in the fourth quarter and no
    impairment was indicated. The Company did record impairment of
    goodwill and other intangibles of $1,543.4 million in 2008.

•

Income taxes.

The Company’s effective tax
    rate is based on its income, statutory tax rates and tax
    planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which
    it operates. Tax laws are complex and subject to different
    interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental
    taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in
    determining the Company’s tax expense and in evaluating the
    Company’s tax positions. Deferred tax assets represent
    amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable
    income in a future period. The Company evaluates the
    recoverability of these future tax benefits by assessing the
    adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources,
    including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted
    operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These
    sources of income inherently rely on estimates, including
    business forecasts and other projections of financial results
    over an extended period of time. In the event that the Company
    is not able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax
    assets in the future, a valuation allowance is provided. The
    Company would recognize such amounts through a charge to income
    in the period in which that determination is made or when tax
    law changes are enacted. The Company had valuation allowances of
    $325.1 million in 2010, $365.9 million in 2009 and
    $343.6 million in 2008. For further information regarding
    the Company’s valuation allowances, see Note 12 to the
    consolidated financial statements.

In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty
    in quantifying the Company’s income tax positions. The
    Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax
    benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the
    Company’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and
    information available as of the reporting date. For those tax
    positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit
    will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount
    of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being
    realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that
    has full knowledge of all relevant information, as required by
    the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic
    740 (“ASC

740-10”),

a replacement of FASB Interpretation No. 48,

“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes —
    an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”

. For
    those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not
    that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been
    recognized in the consolidated financial statements. As of
    December 31, 2010, the Company has $49.9 million
    accrued for uncertain tax positions. For further information
    regarding the Company’s uncertain tax positions, see
    Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.



•

Environmental and legal
    accruals.

Environmental and legal accruals are
    estimates based on judgments made by the Company relating to
    ongoing environmental and legal proceedings, as disclosed in the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements. In determining
    whether a liability is probable and reasonably estimable, the
    Company consults with its internal experts. The Company believes
    that the amounts recorded in the accompanying financial
    statements are based on the best estimates and judgments
    available to it.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2009, the FASB issued ASC 860, formerly
    SFAS No. 166,

“Accounting for Transfers of
    Financial Assets — an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 140”

. ASC 860 seeks to improve the
    relevance, representational faithfulness, and comparability of
    the information that a reporting entity provides in its
    financial statements about a transfer of financial assets; the
    effects of a transfer on its financial position, financial
    performance, and cash flows; and a transferor’s continuing
    involvement, if any, in transferred financial assets.
    Specifically, ASC 860 eliminates the concept of a
    qualifying special-purpose entity, creates more stringent
    conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial
    asset as a sale, clarifies other sale-accounting criteria, and
    changes the initial measurement of a transferor’s interest
    in transferred financial assets. ASC 860 is effective for
    annual and quarterly reporting periods that begin after
    November 15, 2009. The Company’s adoption of
    ASC 860 on January 1, 2010 did not have a material
    impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In June 2009, FASB issued ASC 810, formerly
    SFAS No. 167, “

Amendments to FASB
    Interpretation No. 46(R)”

. ASC 810 amends
    FASB Interpretation No. 46(R),

“Variable Interest
    Entities”,

for determining whether an entity is a
    variable interest entity (“VIE”) and requires an
    enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the
    enterprise’s variable interest or interests give it a
    controlling financial interest in a VIE. Under ASC 810, an
    enterprise has a controlling financial interest when it has
    a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most
    significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and
    b) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the
    right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially
    be significant to the VIE. ASC 810 also requires an
    enterprise to assess whether it has an implicit financial
    responsibility to ensure that a VIE operates as designed when
    determining whether it has power to direct the activities of the
    VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic
    performance. ASC 810 also requires ongoing assessments of
    whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a VIE,
    requires enhanced disclosures and eliminates the scope exclusion
    for qualifying special-purpose entities. ASC 810 is
    effective for annual and quarterly reporting periods that begin
    after November 15, 2009. The Company’s adoption of
    ASC 810 on January 1, 2010 did not have a material
    impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Impact of
    Inflation

Inflation affects the Company’s manufacturing costs,
    distribution costs and operating expenses. The carpet, tile and
    laminate industry experienced inflation in the prices of raw
    materials and fuel-related costs beginning in 2006, and the
    prices increased dramatically during the latter part of 2008,
    peaking in the second half of 2008. The Company expects raw
    material prices, many of which are petroleum based, to continue
    to fluctuate based upon worldwide supply and demand of
    commodities utilized in the Company’s production processes.
    In the past, the Company has generally been able to pass along
    these price increases to its customers and has been able to
    enhance productivity and develop new product innovations to help
    offset increases in costs resulting from inflation in its
    operations.

Seasonality

The Company is a calendar year-end company. With respect to its
    Mohawk and Dal-Tile segments, its results of operations for the
    first quarter tend to be the weakest. The second, third and
    fourth quarters typically produce higher net sales and operating
    income in these segments. These results are primarily due to
    consumer residential spending patterns for floor covering, which
    historically have decreased during the first two months of each
    year following the holiday season. The Unilin segment second and
    fourth quarters typically produce



higher net sales and earnings followed by a moderate first
    quarter and a weaker third quarter. The third quarter is
    traditionally the weakest due to the European holiday in late
    summer.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Financial exposures are monitored as an integral part of the
    Company’s risk management program, which seeks to reduce
    the potentially adverse effect that the volatility of exchange
    rates and natural gas markets may have on its operating results.
    From time to time the Company enters into derivative contracts
    to manage these risks. The Company does not regularly engage in
    speculative transactions, nor does it regularly hold or issue
    financial instruments for trading purposes. The Company did not
    have any derivative contracts outstanding as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Mohawk Industries, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Mohawk Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31,
    2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of
    operations, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income
    (loss), and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
    period ended December 31, 2010. These consolidated
    financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Mohawk Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
    three-year period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Mohawk Industries, Inc.’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated March 1, 2011
    expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Mohawk Industries, Inc.:

We have audited Mohawk Industries, Inc.’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (COSO). Mohawk Industries, Inc.’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as
    set forth in Item 9A. of Mohawk Industries, Inc.’s
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2010. Our responsibility is
    to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Mohawk Industries, Inc. maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the

MOHAWK
    INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements

Years Ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008

(In thousands, except per share data)

(1)

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

(a)

Basis
    of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    Mohawk Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the
    “Company” or “Mohawk”). All significant
    intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
    consolidation.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
    management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
    contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the
    financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
    expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
    differ from those estimates.

(b)

Reclassifications
    and adjustments

During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company identified an
    immaterial error in its annual and interim consolidated
    financial statements included in its

Form 10-K

for 2009 and its

Form 10-Qs

for the quarters ended July 3 and October 2, 2010. The
    error related to the balance sheet misclassification of a
    redeemable noncontrolling interest, the accretion of a
    redemption feature in the noncontrolling interest (which
    decreases retained earnings), and the related earnings per share
    impact. In accordance with the provisions of Financial
    Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting
    Standards Codification Topic

480-10-S99-3

(“ASC 480”), formerly FASB Emerging Issues Task Force
    (“EITF”) Topic D-98,

“Classification and
    Measurement of Redeemable Securities,”

the Company
    reduced both basic and diluted earnings per share attributable
    to common stockholders by $0.04 for the quarter ended
    July 3, 2010 as a result of an adjustment to the fair value
    of a redeemable noncontrolling interest in a consolidated
    subsidiary of the Company (see Note 16). In addition, the
    Company reclassified $33,459 of its noncontrolling interest from
    within equity to mezzanine on its consolidated balance sheet as
    of December 31, 2009. The Company believes the correction
    of this error to be both quantitatively and qualitatively
    immaterial to its quarterly results for 2010 or to any of its
    previously issued consolidated financial statements. The
    correction had no impact on total assets, total liabilities, net
    earnings or cash flows as previously presented.

(c)

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash

The Company considers investments with an original maturity of
    three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. As
    of December 31, 2010, the Company had invested cash of
    $334,830 in money market AAA rated cash investments of which
    $149,649 was in North America and $185,181 was in Europe. In
    addition, the Company had restricted cash of $27,954 under the
    control of an administrative agent and reserved $280,000 under
    its $600,000 four-year, senior, secured revolving credit
    facility (the “ABL Facility”) to repay the remaining
    amount outstanding of the 5.75% senior notes due
    January 15, 2011.

(d)

Accounts
    Receivable and Revenue Recognition

The Company is principally a carpet, rugs, ceramic tile,
    laminate and hardwood flooring manufacturer and sells carpet,
    rugs, ceramic tile, natural stone, hardwood, resilient and
    laminate flooring products in the U.S. principally for
    residential and commercial use. In addition, the Company
    manufactures laminate and sells carpet, rugs, hardwood and
    laminate flooring products in Europe principally for residential
    and commercial use. The Company grants credit to customers, most
    of whom are retail-flooring dealers and commercial end users,
    under credit terms that the Company believes are customary in
    the industry.



Revenues, which are recorded net of taxes collected from
    customers, are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of
    an arrangement, delivery has occurred, the price has been fixed
    or is determinable, and collectability can be reasonably
    assured. The Company provides allowances for expected cash
    discounts, returns, claims, sales allowances and doubtful
    accounts based upon historical bad debt and claims experience
    and periodic evaluations of specific customer accounts and the
    aging of accounts receivable. Licensing revenues received from
    third parties for patents are recognized based on contractual
    agreements.

(e)

Inventories

The Company accounts for all inventories on the

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) method. Inventories are stated at
    the lower of cost or market (net realizable value). Cost has
    been determined using the FIFO method. Costs included in
    inventory include raw materials, direct and indirect labor and
    employee benefits, depreciation, general manufacturing overhead
    and various other costs of manufacturing. Market, with respect
    to all inventories, is replacement cost or net realizable value.
    Inventories on hand are compared against anticipated future
    usage, which is a function of historical usage, anticipated
    future selling price, expected sales below cost, excessive
    quantities and an evaluation for obsolescence. Actual results
    could differ from assumptions used to value obsolete inventory,
    excessive inventory or inventory expected to be sold below cost
    and additional reserves may be required.

(f)

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, including
    capitalized interest. Depreciation is calculated on a
    straight-line basis over the estimated remaining useful lives,
    which are

25-35 years

for buildings and improvements, 5-15 years for machinery
    and equipment, the shorter of the estimated useful life or lease
    term for leasehold improvements and 3-7 years for furniture
    and fixtures.

(g)

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

In accordance with the provisions of ASC 350 formerly Statement
    of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
    No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets,”

the Company tests goodwill and other
    intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an
    annual basis in the fourth quarter (or on an interim basis if an
    event occurs that might reduce the fair value of the reporting
    unit below its carrying value). The Company considers the
    relationship between its market capitalization and its book
    value, among other factors, when reviewing for indicators of
    impairment. The goodwill impairment tests are based on
    determining the fair value of the specified reporting units
    based on management’s judgments and assumptions using the
    discounted cash flows and comparable company market valuation
    approaches. The Company has identified Mohawk, Dal-Tile, Unilin
    Flooring, Unilin Chipboard and Melamine, and Unilin Roofing as
    its reporting units for the purposes of allocating goodwill and
    intangibles as well as assessing impairments. The valuation
    approaches are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are
    sensitive to change such as judgments and assumptions about
    appropriate sales growth rates, operating margins, weighted
    average cost of capital (“WACC”), and comparable
    company market multiples.

When developing these key judgments and assumptions, the Company
    considers economic, operational and market conditions that could
    impact the fair value of the reporting unit. However, estimates
    are inherently uncertain and represent only management’s
    reasonable expectations regarding future developments. These
    estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the
    estimates are based will, in all likelihood, differ in some
    respects from actual future results. Should a significant or
    prolonged deterioration in economic conditions occur, such as
    continued declines in spending for new construction, remodeling
    and replacement activities; the inability to pass increases in
    the costs of raw materials and fuel on to customers; or a
    decline in comparable company market multiples, then key
    judgments and assumptions could be impacted.

The impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible
    assets, which for the Company are its trademarks, is conducted
    during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might
    be impaired. The determination of fair value used in the
    impairment



evaluation is based on discounted estimates of future sales
    projections attributable to ownership of the trademarks.
    Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include
    assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, royalty rates,
    WACC and the amount of expected future cash flows. The judgments
    and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally
    consistent with past performance and are also consistent with
    the projections and assumptions that are used in current
    operating plans. Such assumptions are subject to change as a
    result of changing economic and competitive conditions. The
    determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences
    between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the
    related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the
    trademarks. Estimated cash flows are sensitive to changes in the
    economy among other things. The impairment test for indefinite
    lived intangible assets involves a comparison of the estimated
    fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If
    the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair
    value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to
    that excess. The estimates of fair value of indefinite lived
    intangible assets are determined using a discounted cash flows
    valuation. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis
    include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates,
    royalty rates, WACC and the amount of expected future cash
    flows. These judgments and assumptions are subject to the
    variability discussed above.

Intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives are
    amortized based on average lives, which range from

7-16 years.

(h)

Income
    Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability
    method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
    the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
    the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
    liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss
    and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
    apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
    differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
    on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
    is recognized in income in the period that includes the
    enactment date.

The Company records interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits in income taxes.

(i)

Financial
    Instruments

The Company’s financial instruments consist primarily of
    receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and long-term
    debt. The carrying amount of receivables, accounts payable and
    accrued expenses approximates its fair value because of the
    short-term maturity of such instruments. The carrying amount of
    the Company’s floating rate debt approximates its fair
    value based upon level two fair value hierarchy. Interest rates
    that are currently available to the Company for issuance of
    long-term debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are
    used to estimate the fair value of the Company’s long-term
    debt.

(j)

Advertising
    Costs and Vendor Consideration

Advertising and promotion expenses are charged to earnings
    during the period in which they are incurred. Advertising and
    promotion expenses included in selling, general, and
    administrative expenses were $38,553 in 2010, $43,752 in 2009
    and $53,643 in 2008.

Vendor consideration, generally cash, is classified as a
    reduction of net sales, unless specific criteria are met
    regarding goods or services that the vendor may receive in
    return for this consideration. The Company makes various
    payments to customers, including slotting fees, advertising
    allowances, buy-downs and co-op advertising. All of these
    payments reduce gross sales with the exception of co-op
    advertising. Co-op advertising is classified as a selling,
    general and administrative expense in accordance with

ASC 605-50,

formerly FASB, Emerging Issues Task Force

01-09,

“Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a
    Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s
    Products).”

Co-op advertising expenses, a component of
    advertising and promotion expenses, were $4,660 in 2010, $3,809
    in 2009 and $7,359 in 2008.



(k)

Product
    Warranties

The Company warrants certain qualitative attributes of its
    flooring products. The Company has recorded a provision for
    estimated warranty and related costs, based on historical
    experience and periodically adjusts these provisions to reflect
    actual experience.

(l)

Impairment
    of Long-Lived Assets

The Company reviews its long-lived asset groups, which include
    intangible assets subject to amortization, which for the Company
    are its patents and customer relationships, for impairment
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
    carrying amount of such asset groups may not be recoverable.
    Recoverability of asset groups to be held and used is measured
    by a comparison of the carrying amount of long-lived assets to
    future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by
    these asset groups. If such asset groups are considered to be
    impaired, the impairment recognized is the amount by which the
    carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the
    asset group. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of
    the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs of
    disposal and are no longer depreciated.

(m)

Foreign
    Currency Translation

The Company’s subsidiaries that operate outside the United
    States use their local currency as the functional currency, with
    the exception of operations carried out in Canada and Mexico, in
    which case the functional currency is the U.S. dollar.
    Other than Canada and Mexico, the functional currency is
    translated into U.S. dollars for balance sheet accounts
    using the month end rates in effect as of the balance sheet date
    and average exchange rate for revenue and expense accounts for
    each respective period. The translation adjustments are deferred
    as a separate component of stockholders’ equity, within
    other comprehensive income (loss). Gains or losses resulting
    from transactions denominated in foreign currencies are included
    in other income or expense, within the consolidated statements
    of operations. The assets and liabilities of the Company’s
    Canada and Mexico operations are re-measured using a month end
    rate, except for non-monetary assets and liabilities, which are
    re-measured using the historical exchange rate. Income and
    expense accounts are re-measured using an average monthly rate
    for the period, except for expenses related to those balance
    sheet accounts that are re-measured using historical exchange
    rates. The resulting re-measurement adjustment is reported in
    the consolidated statements of operations when incurred.

(n)

Earnings
    per Share (“EPS”)

Basic net earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated
    using net earnings available to common stockholders divided by
    the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
    outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is similar to basic EPS
    except that the weighted-average number of shares is increased
    to include the number of additional common shares that would
    have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive common shares
    had been issued.

Dilutive common stock options are included in the diluted EPS
    calculation using the treasury stock method. Common stock
    options and unvested restricted shares (units) that were not
    included in the diluted EPS computation because the price was
    greater than the average market price of the common shares for
    the periods presented were 1,203, 1,413 and 1,099 for 2010, 2009
    and 2008, respectively. For 2009 and 2008, all outstanding
    common stock options to purchase common shares and unvested
    restricted shares (units) were excluded from the calculation of
    diluted loss per share because their effect on net loss per
    common share was anti-dilutive.



Computations of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share are

    payments granted based on the grant-date fair value estimated in
    accordance with

ASC 718-10,

Stock
    Compensation

”. Compensation expense is generally
    recognized on a straight-line basis over the award’s
    estimated lives for fixed awards with ratable vesting provisions.

Comprehensive
    Income

Comprehensive income includes foreign currency translation of
    assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, effects of
    exchange rate changes on intercompany balances of a long-term
    nature and transactions and derivative financial instruments
    designated as cash flow hedges. The Company does not provide
    income taxes on currency translation adjustments, as earnings
    from foreign subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely
    reinvested.

Amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2009, the FASB issued ASC 860, formerly
    SFAS No. 166,

“Accounting for Transfers of
    Financial Assets — an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 140”

. ASC 860 seeks to improve the
    relevance,



representational faithfulness, and comparability of the
    information that a reporting entity provides in its financial
    statements about a transfer of financial assets; the effects of
    a transfer on its financial position, financial performance, and
    cash flows; and a transferor’s continuing involvement, if
    any, in transferred financial assets. Specifically, ASC 860
    eliminates the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity,
    creates more stringent conditions for reporting a transfer of a
    portion of a financial asset as a sale, clarifies other
    sale-accounting criteria, and changes the initial measurement of
    a transferor’s interest in transferred financial assets.
    ASC 860 is effective for annual and quarterly reporting
    periods that begin after November 15, 2009. The
    Company’s adoption of ASC 860 on January 1, 2010
    did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

In June 2009, FASB issued ASC 810, formerly
    SFAS No. 167, “

Amendments to FASB
    Interpretation No. 46(R)”

. ASC 810 amends
    FASB Interpretation No. 46(R),

“Variable Interest
    Entities”,

for determining whether an entity is a
    variable interest entity (“VIE”) and requires an
    enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the
    enterprise’s variable interest or interests give it a
    controlling financial interest in a VIE. Under ASC 810, an
    enterprise has a controlling financial interest when it has
    a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most
    significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and
    b) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the
    right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially
    be significant to the VIE. ASC 810 also requires an
    enterprise to assess whether it has an implicit financial
    responsibility to ensure that a VIE operates as designed when
    determining whether it has power to direct the activities of the
    VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic
    performance. ASC 810 also requires ongoing assessments of
    whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a VIE,
    requires enhanced disclosures and eliminates the scope exclusion
    for qualifying special-purpose entities. ASC 810 is
    effective for annual and quarterly reporting periods that begin
    after November 15, 2009. The Company’s adoption of
    ASC 810 on January 1, 2010 did not have a material
    impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

The Company conducted its annual assessment in the fourth
    quarter of 2010 and determined the fair values of its reporting
    units exceeded their carrying values. As a result, no impairment
    was indicated. During 2008, the Company recorded a $1,543,397
    impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount of the
    Company’s goodwill and intangible assets to their estimated
    fair value based upon the results of two interim impairment
    tests. The total impairment included $276,807 in the Mohawk
    segment, $531,930 in the Dal-Tile segment and $734,660 in the
    Unilin segment.

Long-Term
    Debt

On September 2, 2009, the Company entered into the ABL
    Facility in connection with the replacement of the
    Company’s then-existing senior, unsecured, revolving credit
    facility (the “Senior Unsecured Facility”). At the
    time of its termination, the Senior Unsecured Facility consisted
    of a $650,000 revolving credit facility, which was to mature on
    October 28, 2010. The ABL Facility provides for a maximum
    of $600,000 of revolving credit, subject to borrowing base
    availability, including limited amounts of credit in the form of
    letters of credit and swingline loans. The borrowing base is
    equal to specified percentages of eligible accounts receivable
    and inventories of the borrowers under the ABL Facility, which
    are subject to seasonal variations, less reserves established in
    good faith by the Administrative Agent under the ABL Facility.
    All obligations under the ABL Facility, and the guarantees of
    those obligations, are secured by a security interest in certain
    accounts receivable, inventories, certain deposit and securities
    accounts, tax refunds and other personal property (excluding
    intellectual property) directly relating to, or arising from,
    and proceeds of any of the foregoing. On June 1, 2010, the
    Company amended the ABL Facility to, among other things, reduce
    the applicable interest rate margins on loans and reduce the
    commitment fees.

At the Company’s election, revolving loans under the ABL
    Facility bear interest at annual rates equal to either
    (a) LIBOR for 1, 2, 3 or 6 month periods, as selected
    by the Company, plus an applicable margin ranging between 2.75%
    and 3.25%, or (b) the higher of the prime rate, the Federal
    Funds rate plus 0.5%, or a one-month LIBOR rate, plus an
    applicable margin ranging between 1.25% and 1.75%. The Company
    also pays a commitment fee to the lenders under the ABL Facility
    on the average amount by which the aggregate



commitments of the lenders’ exceed utilization of the ABL
    Facility equal to 0.65% per annum during any quarter that this
    excess is 50% or more and 0.50% per annum during any quarter
    that this excess is less than 50%.

The ABL Facility includes certain affirmative and negative
    covenants that impose restrictions on the Company’s
    financial and business operations, including limitations on
    debt, liens, investments, fundamental changes, asset
    dispositions, dividends and other similar restricted payments,
    transactions with affiliates, payments and modifications of
    certain existing debt, future negative pledges, and changes in
    the nature of the Company’s business. The Company is also
    required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.1 to 1.0
    during any period that the unutilized amount available under the
    ABL Facility is less than 15% of the lenders’ aggregated
    commitments.

The ABL Facility is scheduled to mature on September 2,
    2013 but the maturity date will accelerate, including the
    acceleration of any unamortized deferred financing costs, to
    January 15, 2012, if the Company’s outstanding
    7.20% senior notes due April 15, 2012 have not been
    repaid, refinanced, defeased or adequately reserved for by the
    Company, as reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent,
    prior to January 15, 2012. The Company believes it will be
    able to make adequate reserves for such senior notes with cash
    and cash equivalents, unutilized borrowings under the ABL and
    other uncommitted financing sources, including new public debt
    offerings or bank facilities, although there can be no
    assurances that the Company will be able to complete any
    necessary financing transactions prior to the relevant date
    under the ABL Facility or the April 15, 2012 maturity date.

As of December 31, 2010, the amount utilized under the ABL
    Facility was $387,091 resulting in a total of $169,614 available
    under the ABL Facility. The amount utilized included the
    reserved amount of $280,000 related to the repayment of the
    Company’s outstanding 5.75% senior notes due
    January 15, 2011, discussed below, $53,542 of standby
    letters of credit guaranteeing the Company’s industrial
    revenue bonds and $53,549 of standby letters of credit related
    to various insurance contracts and foreign vendor commitments.
    Immediately following the repayment of the 5.75% senior
    notes due January 15, 2011 at maturity, discussed below, a
    total of $289,610 was available under the ABL Facility.

On January 17, 2006, the Company issued
    $900,000 million aggregate principal amount of
    6.125% notes due 2016. Interest payable on these notes is
    subject to adjustment if either Moody’s Investors Service,
    Inc. (“Moody’s”) or Standard &
    Poor’s Ratings Services (“Standard &
    Poor’s”), or both, downgrades the rating assigned to
    the notes. Each rating agency downgrade results in a 0.25%
    increase in the interest rate, subject to a maximum increase of
    1% per rating agency. If later the rating of these notes
    improves, then the interest rates would be reduced accordingly.
    Each 0.25% increase in the interest rate of these notes would
    increase the Company’s interest expense by approximately
    $63 per quarter per $100,000 of outstanding notes. Currently,
    the interest rates have been increased by an aggregate amount of
    0.75% as a result of downgrades by Moody’s and
    Standard & Poor’s during 2009. Additional
    downgrades in the Company’s credit ratings could further
    increase the cost of its existing credit and adversely affect
    the cost of and ability to obtain additional credit in the
    future.

On April 12, 2010, the Company purchased for cash
    approximately $200,000 aggregate principal amount of its
    outstanding 5.75% senior notes due January 15, 2011 at
    a price equal to 103.5% of the principal amount, which resulted
    in a premium to tendering noteholders of approximately $7,000.
    The premium and fees of $514 associated with the cash tender are
    included in interest expense on the 2010 consolidated statement
    of operations. On October 14, 2010, the Company deposited
    $27,942 of cash in a restricted account under the control of the
    Administrative Agent and reserved $280,000 on the ABL Facility
    to repay the remaining amount outstanding of the
    5.75% senior notes due January 15, 2011, which actions
    were determined by the Administrative Agent to adequately
    reserve (for purposes of the ABL Facility) for the repayment of
    such notes. Subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Company
    repaid the 5.75% senior notes due January 15, 2011 at
    maturity, including accrued interest, using approximately
    $170,000 of available cash and borrowings of approximately
    $138,000 million under the ABL Facility.

In 2002, the Company issued $400,000 aggregate principal amount
    of its senior 7.20% notes due April 15, 2012.

Stock
    Options, Stock Compensation and Treasury Stock

The Company recognizes compensation expense for all share-based
    payments granted based on the grant-date fair value estimated in
    accordance with the provisions of

ASC 718-10.

Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over
    the award’s estimated lives for fixed awards with ratable
    vesting provisions.

Under the Company’s 2007 Incentive Plan (“2007
    Plan”), which was approved by the Company’s
    stockholders on May 16, 2007, the Company reserved up to a
    maximum of 3,200 shares of common stock for issuance upon
    the grant or exercise of stock options, restricted stock,
    restricted stock units (“RSU’s”) and other types
    of awards, to directors and key employees through 2017. Option
    awards are granted with an exercise price equal to the market
    price of the Company’s common stock on the date of the
    grant and generally vest between three and five years with a

10-year

contractual term. Restricted stock and RSU’s are granted
    with a price equal to the market price of the Company’s
    common stock on the date of the grant and generally vest between
    three and five years.

During 1996, the Company adopted the 1997 Non-Employee Director
    Stock Compensation Plan. The plan provides for awards of common
    stock of the Company for non-employee directors to receive in
    lieu of cash for their annual retainers. During 2010, 2009 and
    2008, a total of 4, 3 and 2 shares, respectively, were
    awarded to the non-employee directors under the plan.



In addition, the Company maintains an employee incentive program
    that awards restricted stock on the attainment of certain
    service criteria. The outstanding awards related to these
    programs and related compensation expense was not significant
    for any of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

The Company’s Board of Directors has authorized the
    repurchase of up to 15,000 shares of the Company’s
    outstanding common stock. During 2010, the Company repurchased
    approximately 6 shares at an average price of $56.94 in
    connection with the exercise of stock options under the
    Company’s 2007 Incentive Plan. For the year ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, no shares of the Company’s
    common stock were purchased. Since the inception of the program,
    a total of approximately 11,518 shares have been
    repurchased at an aggregate cost of approximately $335,110. All
    of these repurchases have been financed through the
    Company’s operations and banking arrangements.

The fair value of option awards is estimated on the date of
    grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model that uses
    the assumptions noted in the following table. Expected
    volatility is based on the historical volatility of the
    Company’s common stock and other factors. The Company uses
    historical data to estimate option exercise and forfeiture rates
    within the valuation model. Optionees that exhibit similar
    option exercise behavior are segregated into separate groups
    within the valuation model. The expected term of options granted
    represents the period of time that options granted are expected
    to be outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on
    U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of the grant for
    the expected term of the award.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

The Company has a 401(k) retirement savings plan (the
    “Mohawk Plan”) open to substantially all of its
    employees within the Mohawk segment, Dal-Tile segment and
    certain U.S. employees of the Unilin segment,



who have completed 90 days of eligible service. For the
    Mohawk segment, the Company contributes $0.50 for every $1.00 of
    employee contributions up to a maximum of 4% of the
    employee’s salary and an additional $0.25 for every $1.00
    of employee contributions in excess of 4% of the employee’s
    salary up to a maximum of 6%. For the Dal-Tile and Unilin
    segments, the Company contributes $.50 for every $1.00 of
    employee contributions up to a maximum of 6% of the
    employee’s salary. Employee and employer contributions to
    the Mohawk Plan were $33,071 and $13,062 in 2010, $34,838 and
    $13,822 in 2009 and $40,393 and $16,024 in 2008, respectively.
    The Company also made a discretionary contribution to the Mohawk
    Plan of approximately $1,908 and $4,211 in 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. The Company discontinued the discretionary match
    on January 1, 2010.

The Company also has various pension plans covering employees in
    Belgium, France, and The Netherlands (the

“Non-U.S. Plans”)

that it acquired with the acquisition of Unilin. Benefits under
    the

Non-U.S. Plans

depend on compensation and years of service. The

Non-U.S. Plans

are funded in accordance with local regulations. The Company
    uses December 31 as the measurement date for its

Non-U.S. Plans.

This amount includes $1,066 and $85 of non-current deferred tax
    assets which are in deferred income taxes and other non-current
    assets and $5,089 and $2,836 current deferred tax liabilities
    which are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in
    the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2010 and
    2009, respectively.

Management believes it is more likely than not the Company will
    realize the benefits of these deductible differences, with the
    exception of certain carryforward deferred tax assets discussed
    below, based upon the expected reversal of deferred tax
    liabilities and the level of historic and forecasted taxable
    income over periods in which the deferred tax assets are
    deductible.

In accordance with ASC 350, the Company is required to test
    goodwill and indefinite-lived assets for impairment annually, or
    more often if an event or circumstance indicates that an
    impairment loss may have been incurred. In 2008, the Company
    recorded a non-cash pretax impairment charge of $1,543,397 to
    reduce the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles. The
    tax impact was to book an expense of $406,577 related to the
    portion of the impaired assets that are non-deductible for tax
    purposes.

The Company evaluates its ability to realize the tax benefits
    associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing its forecasted
    taxable income using both historic and projected future
    operating results, the reversal of existing temporary
    differences, taxable income in prior carry-back years (if
    permitted) and the availability of tax planning strategies. The
    valuation allowance as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 is
    $325,127 and $365,944, respectively. The December 31, 2010
    valuation allowance relates to net operating losses and tax
    credits of $162,275 and intangibles of $162,852. The
    December 31, 2009 valuation allowance relates to net
    operating losses and tax credits of $168,773 and intangibles of
    $197,171. For 2010, the total change in the valuation allowance
    was a decrease of $40,817, which includes $22,046 primarily
    related to foreign currency translation, $17,139 related to
    European deferred tax assets and a non-P&L charge of $1,632
    primarily related to current year state tax credits which have a
    full valuation allowance, and foreign net operating losses.



As of December 31, 2010, the Company has a federal net
    operating loss carryforward of $17,174. The Company also has
    state net operating loss carryforwards and state tax credits
    with potential tax benefits of $49,244, net of federal income
    tax benefit; these carryforwards expire over various periods
    based on taxing jurisdiction. A valuation allowance totaling
    $39,178 has been recorded against these deferred tax assets as
    of December 31, 2010. In addition, as of December 31,
    2010, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards in
    various foreign jurisdictions of $134,918. A valuation allowance
    totaling $123,097 has been recorded against these deferred tax
    assets as of December 31, 2010.

In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company moved the
    intellectual property and treasury operations of an indirectly
    owned European entity to a new office in another jurisdiction in
    Europe. The Company also indirectly owned a holding company in
    the new jurisdiction that provided certain treasury functions to
    Unilin, and the move allowed for the consolidation of the
    historical intellectual property and treasury operations to be
    combined with those of the holding company’s treasury
    operations in a single jurisdiction in order to integrate and
    streamline the operations, to facilitate international
    acquisitions and to improve tax and cost efficiencies. This
    restructuring resulted in a step up in the subsidiary’s
    taxable basis of its intellectual property. The step up relates
    primarily to intangible assets which will be amortized over
    10 years for tax purposes. During the fourth quarter of
    2007, the Company evaluated the evidence for recognition of the
    deferred tax asset created through the restructuring and
    determined that, based on the available evidence, the deferred
    tax asset would more likely than not be realized. The deferred
    tax asset recognized as of December 31, 2007 was
    approximately $245,000 and the related income tax benefit
    recognized in the consolidated financial statements was
    approximately $272,000.

During the third quarter of 2008, the Company reassessed the
    need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.
    Actual cash flows have been less than those projected as of
    December 31, 2007, primarily due to the slowing worldwide
    economy and declining sales volume. The Company determined that,
    given the current and expected economic conditions and the
    corresponding reductions in cash flows, its ability to realize
    the benefit of the deferred tax asset related to the European
    step up transaction described above, as well as tax losses
    generated in the same jurisdiction was not more likely than not.
    Accordingly, the Company recorded a valuation allowance against
    the deferred tax asset in the amount of $252,751 during the
    quarter ended September 27, 2008.

The Company does not provide for U.S. federal and state
    income taxes on the cumulative undistributed earnings of its
    foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are deemed to be
    permanently reinvested. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    the Company had not provided federal income taxes on earnings of
    approximately $748,000 and $723,000, respectively, from its
    foreign subsidiaries. Should these earnings be distributed in
    the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject
    to both U.S. income taxes and withholding taxes in various
    foreign jurisdictions. These taxes may be partially offset by
    U.S. foreign tax credits. Determination of the amount of
    the unrecognized deferred U.S. tax liability is not
    practical because of the complexities associated with this
    hypothetical calculation.

Tax
    Uncertainties

In the normal course of business, the Company’s tax returns
    are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such
    examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments
    by these taxing jurisdictions. Accordingly, the Company accrues
    liabilities when it believes that it is not more likely than not
    that it will realize the benefits of tax positions that it has
    taken in its tax returns or for the amount of any tax benefit
    that exceeds the cumulative probability threshold in accordance
    with

ASC 740-10,

formerly FASB Interpretation No. 48

“Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes-an Interpretation of FASB Statement
    No.

109”. Differences between the estimated and
    actual amounts determined upon ultimate resolution, individually
    or in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position but
    could possibly be material to the Company’s consolidated
    results of operations or cash flow in any given quarter or
    annual period.

As of December 31, 2010, the Company’s gross amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits is $49,943, excluding interest and
    penalties. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax
    positions, $37,379 of the



unrecognized tax benefits would affect the Company’s
    effective tax rate, exclusive of any benefits related to
    interest and penalties.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

The Company will continue to recognize interest and penalties
    related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of its
    income tax provision. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the
    Company has $15,550 and $47,870, respectively, accrued for the
    payment of interest and penalties, excluding the federal tax
    benefit of interest deductions where applicable. During the
    years ending December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company
    accrued/(reversed) interest and penalties through the
    consolidated statements of operations of $(9,852), $8,228 and
    $3,657, respectively.

The Company’s

2007-2009

federal income tax returns are currently under examination by
    the Internal Revenue Service. The Company expects this
    examination to end December 31, 2012. The Company believes
    that its unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by $10,405
    within the next twelve months. In addition, the Company has
    effectively settled all federal income tax matters related to
    years prior to 2007, with the exception of one open issue
    related to the

2004-2006

tax years.

Rental expense under operating leases was $105,976, $130,227 and

The Company had approximately $53,549 and $58,603 as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, in standby
    letters of credit for various insurance contracts and
    commitments to foreign vendors that expire within two years. In
    addition, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company
    guaranteed approximately $824 and $721 for building leases,
    respectively, related to its operating facilities in France.



The Company is involved in litigation from time to time in the
    regular course of its business. Except as noted below there are
    no material legal proceedings pending or known by the Company to
    be contemplated to which the Company is a party or to which any
    of its property is subject.

In Shirley Williams et al. v. Mohawk Industries, Inc., four
    plaintiffs filed a putative class action lawsuit in January 2004
    in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
    Georgia (Rome Division), alleging that they are former and
    current employees of the Company and that the actions and
    conduct of the Company, including the employment of persons who
    are not authorized to work in the United States, have damaged
    them and the other members of the putative class by suppressing
    the wages of the Company’s hourly employees in Georgia. The
    plaintiffs sought a variety of relief, including (a) treble
    damages; (b) return of any allegedly unlawful profits; and
    (c) attorney’s fees and costs of litigation. In April
    2010, the plaintiffs, the Company and the Company’s
    insurance carrier agreed to settle the litigation. In July 2010,
    the District Court approved the settlement. The Company accrued
    for its portion of the settlement in a prior year. The claims
    process was completed in the third quarter of 2010.

The Company believes that adequate provisions for resolution of
    all contingencies, claims and pending litigation have been made
    for probable losses and that the ultimate outcome of these
    actions will not have a material adverse effect on its financial
    condition but could have a material adverse effect on its
    results of operations in a given quarter or year.

On July 1, 2010, Monterrey, Mexico experienced flooding as
    a result of Hurricane Alex which temporarily interrupted
    operations at the Company’s Dal-Tile ceramic tile
    production facility. The plant was fully operational in the
    latter part of the third quarter of 2010. Prior to the close of
    the third quarter of 2010, the Company and its insurance carrier
    agreed to a final settlement of its claim, which included
    property damage and business interruption for approximately
    $25,000. The amount included approximately $20,000 to cover
    costs to repair

and/or

replace property and equipment and approximately $5,000 to
    recover lost margin from lost sales. The settlement with the
    insurance carrier is recorded in cost of sales in the
    Company’s 2010 consolidated statement of operations. As a
    result of the insurance settlement, the flooding did not have a
    material impact on the Company’s results of operations or
    financial position.

The Company has received partial refunds from the United States
    government in reference to settling custom disputes dating back
    to 1986. Accordingly, the Company realized a gain of $7,730 in
    other expense (income) in the Company’s 2010 consolidated
    statement of operations. The Company is pursuing additional
    recoveries for prior years but there can be no assurances such
    recoveries will occur. Additional future recoveries, if any,
    will be recorded as realized.

The Company is subject to various federal, state, local and
    foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations,
    including those governing air emissions, wastewater discharges,
    the use, storage, treatment recycling and disposal of solid and
    hazardous materials and finished product, and the cleanup of
    contamination associated therewith. Because of the nature of the
    Company’s business, the Company has incurred, and will
    continue to incur, costs relating to compliance with such laws
    and regulations. The Company is involved in various proceedings
    relating to environmental matters and is currently engaged in
    environmental investigation, remediation and post-closure care
    programs at certain sites. The Company has provided accruals for
    such activities that it has determined to be both probable and
    reasonably estimable. The Company does not expect that the
    ultimate liability with respect to such activities will have a
    material adverse effect on its operations, but may have an
    effect on a given quarter or annual period.

In the normal course of business, the Company has entered into
    various collective bargaining agreements with its workforce in
    Europe, Mexico and Malaysia, either locally or within its
    industry sector. Historically, the Company has maintained
    favorable relationships with its workforce and expects to do so
    in the future.

The Company recorded pre-tax business restructuring charges of
    $13,156 in 2010, of which $12,392 was recorded as cost of sales
    and $764 was recorded as selling, general and administrative
    expenses. The Company recorded pre-tax business restructuring
    charges of $61,725 in 2009, of which $43,436 was recorded as
    cost of sales and $18,289 was recorded as selling, general and
    administrative expenses. The charges primarily relate



to the Company’s actions taken to lower its cost structure
    and improve the efficiency of its manufacturing and distribution
    operations as it adjusts to current economic conditions.

Segment
    Reporting

The Company has three reporting segments:  the Mohawk
    segment, the Dal-Tile segment and the Unilin segment. The Mohawk
    segment designs, manufactures, sources, distributes and markets
    its floor covering product lines, which include carpets, ceramic
    tile, laminate, rugs, carpet pad, hardwood and resilient,
    primarily in North America through its network of regional
    distribution centers and satellite warehouses using
    company-operated trucks, common carrier or rail transportation.
    The segment’s product lines are sold through various
    selling channels, which include independent floor covering
    retailers, home centers, mass merchandisers, department stores,
    commercial dealers and commercial end users. The Dal-Tile
    segment designs, manufactures, sources, distributes and markets
    a broad line of ceramic tile, porcelain tile, natural stone and
    other



products, primarily in North America through its network of
    regional distribution centers and Company-operated sales service
    centers using company-operated trucks, common carriers or rail
    transportation. The segment’s product lines are sold
    through Company-owned sales service centers, independent
    distributors, home center retailers, tile and flooring retailers
    and contractors. The Unilin segment designs, manufactures,
    sources, licenses, distributes and markets laminate, hardwood
    flooring, roofing systems, insulation panels and other wood
    products, primarily in North America and Europe through various
    selling channels, which include retailers, independent
    distributors and home centers.

Amounts disclosed for each segment are prior to any elimination
    or consolidation entries. Corporate general and administrative
    expenses attributable to each segment are estimated and
    allocated accordingly. Segment performance is evaluated based on
    operating income. No single customer accounted for more than 5%
    of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009
    and 2008.

Basic and diluted earnings per share for the quarters ended
    July 3, 2010, October 2, 2010 and December 31,
    2010, includes a correction to reduce the numerator by $3,057,
    $58 and $129, respectively, for an increase in the fair value of
    a redeemable noncontrolling interest in a consolidated
    subsidiary of the Company. The Company reduced basic and diluted
    earnings per share in the quarter ended July 3, 2010 by
    $0.04 from the previously reported amount of $0.99 to correct an
    immaterial error related to the change in the aforementioned
    fair value. There was no change to the previously reported basic
    and diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended
    October 2, 2010.

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
    Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), which
    have been designed to provide reasonable assurance that such
    controls and procedures will meet their objectives, as of the
    end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
    concluded that such controls and procedures were effective at a
    reasonable assurance level for the period covered by this report.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). The
    Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of its
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010. In making this assessment, the
    Company’s management used the criteria set forth by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (“COSO”) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. The
    Company’s management has concluded that, as of
    December 31, 2010, its internal control over financial
    reporting is effective based on these criteria. The
    Company’s independent registered public accounting firm,
    KPMG LLP, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting, which is included
    herein.

Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting during the period covered by this
    report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
    to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

Limitations
    on the Effectiveness of Controls

The Company’s management recognizes that a control system,
    no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
    reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
    control system are met. Further, the design of a control system
    must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and
    the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their
    costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control
    systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
    assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if
    any, within the Company have been detected.
