PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

Mohawk
Industries, Inc. ("Mohawk" or the "Company", a term which
includes the Company and its subsidiaries, including its primary operating
subsidiaries, Mohawk Carpet Corporation, Aladdin Manufacturing Corporation and
Dal-Tile International Inc. ("Dal-Tile")) is a leading producer of
floor covering products for residential and commercial applications in the
United States. The Company is the second largest carpet and rugs manufacturer,
and a leading manufacturer, marketer and distributor of ceramic tile and
natural stone, in the United States. The Company had annual net sales in 2004
in excess of $5.8 billion.

The
Company has two reporting segments, the Mohawk segment and the Dal-Tile
segment.. Selected financial information for the Mohawk and Dal-Tile segments
is set forth in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The
Mohawk segment designs, manufactures, sources, distributes and markets its
floor covering product lines, which include carpet, rugs, ceramic tile,
hardwood, resilient and laminate, in a broad range of colors, textures, and
patterns for residential and commercial applications. The Company markets and
distributes its carpet and rugs under its soft surface floor covering brands
and hardwood, laminate, resilient and ceramic tile under its hard surface floor
covering brands. The Company positions its products in all price ranges and
emphasizes quality, style, performance and service. The Company is widely
recognized through its premier brand names, which include "Mohawk,"
"Aladdin," "Mohawk Home," "Bigelow," "Custom
Weave," "Durkan," "Helios," "Horizon,"
"Karastan," "Lees," "Merit," "Ralph
Lauren," and "WundaWeve." The Mohawk segment markets and
distributes its soft and hard surface products through over 36,000 customers,
which include independent floor covering retailers, home centers, mass
merchandisers, department stores, commercial dealers and commercial end users.
Some products are also marketed through private labeling programs. The Company's
soft surface operations are vertically integrated from the extrusion of resin
to the manufacture and shipment of finished carpet and rugs.

The
Dal-Tile segment designs, manufactures, sources and markets a broad line of
ceramic tile, porcelain tile and natural stone products used in the residential
and commercial markets for both new construction and remodeling. Most of the
Company's ceramic tile products are marketed under the "Dal-Tile" and
"American Olean" brand names and sold through independent
distributors, home center retailers, tile and flooring retailers and
contractors. The Dal-Tile segment operations are vertically integrated from the
extraction of raw material for body and glaze preparation, to the manufacturing
and distribution of ceramic and porcelain tile.

Industry

The
United States floor covering industry has grown from $12.4 billion in sales in
1992 to $20.9 billion in 2003. In 2003, the primary categories of the United
States floor covering industry were carpet and rugs (63%), ceramic tile (12%),
resilient and rubber (9%), hardwood (10%) and laminate (6%). Each of these
categories has been positively impacted by:

growth
     in housing starts and housing resales;

increases
     in average selling price per square foot;

population
     growth, requiring new and renovated housing and commercial space;

increasing average house size; and

increases in home ownership.

Compound
average growth rates for all categories, except the resilient and rubber
category, for the period from 1998 through 2003 have met or exceeded the growth
rates (measured in sales dollars) for both the gross domestic product of the
United States and housing starts over the same period. During this period, the
compound average growth rate was 3.0% for carpet and rugs, 7.0% for ceramic
tile, 1.2% for resilient and rubber, 20.9% for laminate, and 7.9% for hardwood.


According
to the most recent figures available from the United States Department of
Commerce, worldwide carpet and rug sales volume of American manufacturers and
their domestic divisions was approximately 2.0 billion square yards in 2003.
This volume represents a market in excess of approximately $13 billion. The
overall level of sales in the flooring industry is influenced by a number of
factors, including consumer confidence, spending for durable goods, interest
rates, turnover in housing, the condition of the residential and commercial
construction industries and the overall strength of the economy.

Broadloom
carpet, defined as carpet over six feet by nine feet in size, has two primary
markets, residential and commercial, with the residential market making up
approximately 76% of industry amounts shipped in 2003 and the commercial market
comprising approximately 24%. An estimated 50% of industry shipments are made
in response to replacement demand, which usually involves exact yardage, or
"cut order," shipments that typically provide higher profit margins
than sales of carpet sold in full rolls. Because the replacement business
generally involves higher quality carpet cut to order by the manufacturer,
rather than the dealer, this business tends to be more profitable for
manufacturers than the new construction business.

The
United States ceramic tile industry shipped 2.9 billion square feet, or $2.5
billion, in 2003. Sales in the ceramic tile industry are influenced by the same
factors that influence the carpet industry, including consumer confidence,
spending for durable goods, interest rates, turnover in housing, the condition
of the residential and commercial construction industries and the overall
strength of the economy.

The
ceramic tile industry's two primary markets, residential applications and
commercial applications, represent 69.4% and 29.0% of the industry total,
respectively. Of the total residential market, 61% of the dollar value of
shipments are for new construction.

Sales and Distribution

Mohawk Segment

.

Through
the Company's Mohawk segment, the Company designs, manufactures and markets
hundreds of styles of carpet and rugs in a broad range of colors, textures and
patterns. In addition, the Mohawk segment markets and distributes ceramic tile,
laminate, hardwood and resilient floor covering. The Mohawk segment positions
its product lines in all price ranges and emphasizes quality, style,
performance and service. The Company markets and distributes its soft and hard
surface product lines through over 36,000 customers, which include independent
floor covering retailers, home centers, mass merchandisers, department stores,
commercial dealers, and commercial end users. Some products are also marketed
through private labeling programs. Sales to residential customers represent a
significant portion of the total industry and the majority of the Company's
carpet and rug sales.

The
Company has positioned its premier residential carpet and rug brand names
across all price ranges. "Mohawk," "Custom Weave,"
"WundaWeve," "Horizon," "Helios" and "Karastan"
are positioned to sell primarily in the medium-to-high retail price channels in
the residential broadloom market. These lines have substantial brand name
recognition among carpet dealers and retailers with the "Karastan"
and "Mohawk" brands having the highest consumer recognition in the
industry. "Karastan" is the leader in the exclusive high-end market.
The "Aladdin" and "Mohawk Home" brand names compete
primarily in the value retail price channel. The Company markets its hard
surface product lines, which include Mohawk Ceramic, Mohawk Hardwood, Mohawk
Resilient and Mohawk Laminate across all price ranges. In addition, the Company
markets its decorative throws and pillows, woven bedspreads, textile wall
hangings and blankets primarily through the retail price channel.

The
Company offers marketing and advertising support through dealer programs like
Karastan Gallery, Mohawk ColorCenter, Mohawk Floorscapes and Mohawk Floorz.
These programs offer varying degrees of support to dealers in the form of sales
and management training, merchandising systems, exclusive promotions and
assistance in certain administrative functions such as consumer credit,
advertising and insurance.


The
commercial customer base is divided into several channels: educational
institutions, corporate office space, hospitality facilities, retail space and
health care facilities. In addition, the Company produces and sells carpet for
the export market, the federal government and other niche businesses. Different
purchase decision makers and decision-making processes exist for each channel.

The
Company's sales forces are generally organized based on product type and sales
channels in order to best serve each type of customer. A hub-and-spoke
distribution network accomplishes the product distribution on a regional level.
In this system, the Company's trucks generally deliver product from
manufacturing and central distribution centers to regional and satellite
warehouses. From there, it is shipped to retailers or to local distribution
warehouses, then to retailers.

Dal-Tile Segment

.

The
Dal-Tile segment's ceramic tile and natural stone products are distributed
through separate distribution channels consisting of retailers, contractors,
commercial users, independent distributors and home centers. The business is
organized to address the specific customer needs of each distribution channel.
Dedicated sales forces support varioius channels.

The
Company has six regional distribution centers. These centers help the Company
deliver high-quality customer service by focusing on shorter lead times,
increased order fill rates and improved on-time deliveries to its customers.
These distribution centers also enhance the Company's ability to plan and
schedule production and manage inventory requirements.

The
Company's network of over 244 sales service centers located in the United
States, Canada and Puerto Rico distributes primarily the "Daltile"
brand product, serving customers in all 50 states and portions of Canada and
Puerto Rico.. The service centers provide distribution points for both customer
pick up and delivery and include small show rooms to assist customers with
product selection.

The
Company serves as a "one-stop" source that provides customers with
one of the ceramic tile industry's broadest product lines‑a complete
selection of glazed floor tile, glazed wall tile, glazed and unglazed ceramic
mosaic tile, porcelain tile, quarry tile and stone products, as well as allied
products. In addition to products manufactured by the Company's ceramic tile
business, the Company purchases products from other manufacturers to provide a
broader product line.

The
independent distributor channel offers a unique product line under the
"American Olean" brand. Currently, the "American Olean"
brand is distributed through approximately 200 independent distributor
locations that service a variety of residential and commercial customers. The
Company is focused on increasing its presence in the independent distributor
channel, particularly in tile products that are most commonly used in flooring
applications.

The
Company believes that it has two of the leading brand names in the U.S. ceramic
tile industry-"Daltile" and "American Olean." The
"Daltile" and "American Olean" brand names date back over
fifty and seventy-five years, respectively and are well recognized in the
industry.

The
Company's sales service centers primarily distribute the "Daltile"
brand, with a fully integrated marketing program, emphasizing a focus on
quality and fashion. The broad product offering satisfies the needs of its
residential, commercial and builder customers. The "American Olean"
brand consists of a full product offering and is distributed primarily through
independent distributors. Both these brands are supported by a fully integrated
marketing program, displays, merchandising (sample boards, chip chests),
literature/catalogs and an Internet website.

Advertising and Promotion

The
Company promotes its brands through national advertising in both television and
print media as well as in the form of cooperative advertising, point-of-sale
displays and marketing literature provided to assist in marketing various
carpet and ceramic tile styles. The Company also continues to rely on the
substantial brand name recognition of its product lines. The cost of producing
display samples, a significant promotional expense, is partially offset by
sales of samples and support from suppliers in the carpet and rug business.


Manufacturing and Operations

Carpet
and Rugs Business.

The Company's manufacturing operations are vertically
integrated and include the extrusion of resin and post-consumer plastics into
polypropylene, polyester and nylon fiber, yarn processing, tufting, weaving,
dyeing, coating and finishing. Capital expenditures are primarily focused on
increasing capacity, improving productivity and reducing costs. Over the past
three years, the Company has incurred capital expenditures that have helped
increase manufacturing efficiency and capacity, and improve overall cost competitiveness.

Ceramic
Tile Business.

Over the past three years, the Dal-Tile segment has invested
in capital expenditures, principally in new plant and state-of-the-art
fast-fire equipment to increase manufacturing capacity, improve efficiency and develop
new capabilities.

The
Company believes that its manufacturing organization offers competitive
advantages due to its ability to manufacture a differentiated product line
consisting of one of the industry's broadest product offerings of colors,
textures and finishes, as well as the industry's largest offering of trim and
angle pieces and its ability to utilize the industry's newest technology.

Raw Materials and Suppliers

Carpet
and Rugs Business.

The principal raw materials the carpet and rugs business
uses are nylon, polypropylene, polyester and wool resins and fibers; synthetic
backing materials; polyurethane latex and various dyes and chemicals. Major raw
materials used in the Company's manufacturing process are available from independent
sources and the Company obtains all of its externally purchased nylon fibers
principally from three major suppliers: Invista Inc., Solutia, Inc., and
Honeywell, Inc. The carpet and rugs business has not experienced significant
shortages of raw materials in recent years. The Company believes that there is
an adequate supply of all grades of resin and fiber and that all are readily
available.

Ceramic
Tile Business.

In the Company's ceramic tile business, the Company
manufactures tile primarily from clay, talc and nepheline syenite. The Company
has entered into a long-term supply agreement for most of its talc requirements
with one supplier.

The
Company owns long-term clay mining rights in Alabama, Kentucky and Mississippi
that satisfy nearly all of its clay requirements for producing unglazed quarry
tile. The Company purchases a number of different grades of clay for the
manufacture of its non-quarry tile. The Company believes that there is an
adequate supply of all grades of clay and that all are readily available from a
number of independent sources.

The
Company has a single source supplier for its nepheline syenite requirements. If
this supplier were unable to satisfy the Company's requirements, the Company
believes that alternative supply arrangements would be available.

Glazes
are used on a significant percentage of the Company's manufactured tile. Glazes
consist of frit (ground glass), zircon, stains and other materials, with frit
being the largest ingredient. The Company manufactures approximately 45% of its
frit requirements.

Competition

Carpet
and Rugs Business.

The carpet and rugs industry is
highly competitive. Based on industry publications, the top 20 North American
carpet and rug manufacturers (including their American and foreign divisions)
in 2003 had worldwide sales in excess of $12.8 billion, and the top 20
manufacturers in 1990 had sales in excess of $6 billion. In 2003, the top five
manufacturers had worldwide sales in excess of $9.1 billion. The Company
believes it is the second largest producer of carpet and rugs (in terms of
sales volume) in the world.

Ceramic
Tile Business.

The Company estimates that over 100
tile manufacturers, more than half of which are based outside the United States,
compete for sales of ceramic tile to customers located in the United States.
Although the U.S. ceramic tile industry is highly fragmented at both the
manufacturing and distribution levels, the Company believes it is the largest
manufacturer, distributor and marketer of ceramic tile in the United States and
one of the largest in the world.


The
principal methods of competition within the carpet and rugs and ceramic tile
industries are price, style, quality and service. In each of the Company's markets,
price competition and market coverage are particularly important because there
is limited differentiation among competing product lines. The Company's recent
investments in modernized, advanced manufacturing and data processing
equipment, the extensive diversity of equipment in which the Company has
invested, its marketing strategy and its distribution system contribute to its
ability to compete primarily on the basis of performance, quality, style and
service, rather than just price.

In
each of the Company's carpet and rugs and ceramic tile businesses, the Company
faces competition from a large number of domestic and foreign manufacturers and
independent distributors of floor covering products. Some of the Company's
existing and potential competitors may have greater resources and access to
capital than the Company does. Maintaining the Company's competitive position
may require it to make substantial investments in its product development
efforts, manufacturing facilities, distribution network and sales and marketing
activities. Competitive pressures may also result in decreased demand for the
Company's products and in the loss of market share. In addition, the Company
faces, and will continue to face, pressure on sales prices of its products from
competitors, as well as from large customers. As a result of any of these
factors, there could be a material adverse effect on the Company's sales and
profitability.

Trademarks

The
Company uses several trademarks that it considers important in the marketing of
its products, including "Aladdin," "American Olean

®

"Bigelow," "Custom Weave" "Dal-Tile

"Durkan," "Helios

Sales Terms and Major
Customers

The
Company's sales terms are the same as those generally available throughout the
industry. The Company generally permits its customers to return carpet, rugs
and ceramic tile purchased from it within specified time periods from the date
of sale, if the customer is not satisfied with the quality of the product..

During
2004, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of Mohawk's total net
sales. The Company believes the loss of one or a few major customers would not
have a material adverse effect on its business.

Employees

As
of March 7, 2005, the Company employed approximately 34,300 persons, of
which approximately 514 of its employees in the United States and approximately
3,190 of its employees in Mexico are members of unions. Other than with respect
to these employees, the Company is not a party to any collective bargaining
agreements. Additionally, the Company has not experienced any strikes or work
stoppages for over 20 years. The Company believes that its relations with its
employees are good.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

Overview

The
Company is a leading producer of floor covering products for residential and
commercial applications in the United States with net sales in 2004 in excess
of $5.8 billion. The Company is the second largest carpet and rugs
manufacturer, and a leading manufacturer, marketer and distributor of ceramic
tile and natural stone, in the United States. The Company has two reporting
segments, the Mohawk segment and the Dal-Tile segment. The Mohawk segment
distributes its product lines, which include carpet, rugs, pad, ceramic tile,
hardwood, resilient and laminate through its network of approximately 52
regional distribution centers and satellite warehouses using its fleet of
company-operated trucks, common carrier or rail transportation. The segment
product lines are purchased by independent floor covering retailers, home
centers, mass merchandisers, department stores, independent distributors,
commercial dealers and commercial end users. The Dal-Tile segment product lines
include ceramic tile, porcelain tile and stone products distributed through
approximately 244 company-operated sales service centers and regional
distribution centers using primarily common carriers and rail transportation.
The segment product lines are purchased by tile specialty dealers, tile
contractors, floor covering retailers, commercial end users, independent
distributors and home centers.

The
primary categories
of the United States floor covering industry include carpet and rugs (63%),
ceramic tile (12%), hardwood (10%), resilient and rubber (9%) and laminate
(6%). Compound average growth rates for all categories, except the resilient
and rubber category, for the period from 1998 through 2003 have met or exceeded
the growth rates (measured in sales dollars) for both the gross domestic
product of the United States and housing starts over the same period. During
this period, the compound average growth rate was 3.0% for carpet and rugs,
7.0% for ceramic tile, 1.2% for resilient and rubber, 20.9% for laminate, and
7.9% for hardwood.

The
Company reported net earnings of $368.6 million and EPS of $5.46, for 2004, up
19% compared to net earnings of $310.1 million and $4.62 EPS for 2003. The
improvement in net earnings and EPS resulted from strong internal sales growth
from both the Mohawk and Dal-Tile segments, improved manufacturing
efficiencies, better leveraging of selling, general and administrative costs
and the Lees Carpet acquisition, offset by higher raw material and energy
costs. In addition, the Company has implemented multiple price increases within
the Mohawk segment during 2004 to offset increases in raw material and energy
prices. The Company has received formal notice of further cost increases to be
implemented during the first quarter of 2005, and believes the continuing high
level of commodity costs could continue to impact raw material costs in the future.
The Company believes these costs will stabilize over the long-term but the
short-term trend of these costs is uncertain.

On
March 20, 2002, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of
Dal-Tile, a leading manufacturer and distributor of ceramic tile in the United
States, for approximately $1,469 million in stock and cash. The transaction was
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the
results of operations of Dal-Tile have been included in the Company's
consolidated financial statements since that date. The primary reason for
the acquisition was to expand the Company's presence in the ceramic tile and
stone markets.

On
November 10, 2003, the Company acquired the assets and assumed certain
liabilities of the commercial carpet division of Burlington Industries, Inc.,
known as Lees Carpet, from W.L. Ross & Company for approximately $350
million in cash. The results of operations for Lees Carpet have been included
with the Mohawk segment results and in the Company's consolidated financial
statements since that date. The primary reason for the acquisition was to
expand the Company's presence in the commercial carpet market.

Year
Ended December 31, 2004, as Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2003

Net
sales for the year ended December 31, 2004, were $5,880.4 million, reflecting
an increase of $881.0 million, or approximately 17.6%, over the $4,999.4
million reported for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increased net sales
are primarily attributable to strong internal sales growth from both the Mohawk
and Dal-Tile segments. The Mohawk segment recorded net sales of $4,368.8
million in 2004 compared to $3,730.8 million in 2003, representing an increase
of $638.0 million or approximately 17.1%. The increase was attributable to
strong internal growth in all product categories and the Lees Carpet
acquisition. The Dal-Tile segment recorded net sales of $1,511.5 million in
2004, reflecting an increase of $243.0 million or 19.2%, over the $1,268.5
million reported in the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was mostly
attributable to strong internal growth in all product categories with stone and
floor tile reflecting the strongest growth.

Sales
in the first and fourth quarters of 2004 were impacted by a shift of four days
from the fourth to the first quarter when compared to 2003.

Gross
profit was $1,620.8 million (27.6% of net sales) for 2004 and $1,393.8 million
(27.9% of net sales) for 2003. The reduction in percentage was primarily attributable
to increased raw material costs, energy costs, transportation costs, and higher
import costs.


Selling,
general and administrative expenses for 2004 were $985.3 million (16.8% of net
sales) compared to $851.8 million (17.0% of net sales) for 2003. The reduction
in percentage was attributable to better leveraging of selling, general and
administrative expenses.

Operating
income for 2004 was $635.6 million (10.8% of net sales) compared to $542.0
million (10.9% of net sales) in 2003. Operating income attributable to the
Mohawk segment was $424.3 million (9.7% of segment net sales) in 2004 compared
to $364.0 million (9.8% of segment net sales) in 2003. The percentage decrease
in operating income was attributable to the higher raw material costs, energy
costs and transportation costs. Operating income attributable to the Dal-Tile
segment was $219.8 million (14.5% of segment net sales) in 2004, compared to
$187.2 million (14.8% of segment net sales) in 2003. The decrease in operating
income as a percentage of net sales is primarily attributable to higher energy
costs, import costs and transportation costs.

Interest
expense for 2004 was $53.4 million compared to $55.6 million in 2003. The
decrease in interest expense was attributable to larger benefit from a fair
value adjustment related to an interest rate swap
during 2004 when compared to 2003.

Income
tax expense was $208.8 million, or 36.2% of earnings before income taxes for
2004 compared to $178.3 million, or 36.5% of earnings before income taxes for
2003. The improved rate was a result of the utilization of tax credits.

Year Ended December 31, 2003, as Compared with Year
Ended December 31, 2002

Net
sales for the year ended December 31, 2003, were $4,999.4 million, reflecting
an increase of $482.4 million, or approximately 10.7%, over the $4,517.0
million reported in the year ended December 31, 2002. The increased net sales
were attributable to the acquisition of Dal-Tile and Lees Carpet and internal
growth. The Mohawk segment recorded net sales of $3,730.8 million in 2003
compared to $3,618.8 million in 2002, representing an increase of $112.0
million or approximately 3.0%. The growth was attributable to the Lees Carpet
acquisition and internal growth of product lines. The Dal-Tile segment recorded
net sales of $1,268.5 million in 2003, reflecting an increase of $370.4 million
or 41.2%, over the $898.2 million reported in the year ended December 31, 2002.
The Dal-Tile results are not included in the Company's consolidated financial
statements prior to the March 20, 2002 acquisition. However, when the Dal-Tile
net sales for the year ended December 31, 2003, are compared to the Dal-Tile
pro forma net sales of $1,134.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002
(derived by combining Dal-Tile net sales of $236.0 million prior to the March
20, 2002 acquisition date, after reclassifications to conform to Mohawk's
presentation, with reported Dal-Tile net sales of $898.2 million for the period
ending December 31, 2002), an increase of approximately 11.8% for the period
was realized. The growth was primarily attributable to growth within
residential products. The Company believes this pro forma net sales information
will be useful to investors because it allows investors to compare the results
of the two periods.

Gross
profit was $1,393.8 million (27.9% of net sales) for 2003 and $1,269.1 million
(28.1% of net sales) for 2002. The reduction in percentage was primarily
attributable to a change in the selling mix, increased raw material costs,
higher energy costs, higher import costs and start up costs related to the new
Dal-Tile manufacturing facility.

Selling,
general and administrative expenses for 2003 were $851.8 million (17.0% of net
sales) compared to $747.0 million (16.5% of net sales) for 2002. The increased
percentage was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Dal-Tile, which has
higher selling, general and administrative expenses than the Mohawk segment.


Operating
income for 2003 was $542.0 million (10.8% of net sales) compared to $522.1
million (11.6% of net sales) in 2002. Operating income attributable to the
Mohawk segment was $364.0 million (9.8% of segment net sales) in 2003 compared
to $390.9 million (10.8% of segment net sales) in 2002. The percentage decrease
in operating income was attributable to the higher raw material and energy
costs and a change in the selling mix. Operating income attributable to the
Dal-Tile segment was $187.2 million (14.8% of segment net sales) in 2003,
compared to $139.9 million (15.6% of segment net sales) in 2002. The decrease
in operating income as a percentage of net sales is primarily attributable to a
change in product mix, higher import prices and start up costs of a new
manufacturing facility. On a pro forma combined basis, the Dal-Tile segment
operating income was $171.7 million (15.1% of pro forma segment net sales) for
2002 (derived by combining Dal-Tile operating income of $31.8 million prior to
the March 20, 2002 acquisition, after reclassifications to conform to Mohawk's
presentation, with reported Dal-Tile operating income of $139.9 million for the
period ended December 31, 2002). The Company believes that presentation of this
pro forma combined operating income information will be useful to investors
because it allows investors to compare the results between the two periods.

Interest
expense for 2003 was $55.6 million compared to $69.0 million in 2002. The
decrease in interest expense was attributable to lower average debt levels
during 2003 when compared to 2002, offset by an increase in the average
borrowing rate due to a change in the mix of fixed and variable rate debt in
2003 when compared to 2002. Additionally, interest expense for 2002 included
$10.7 million related to the write-off of an interest rate swap previously
accounted for as a cash flow hedge.

Income
tax expense was $178.3 million, or 36.5% of earnings before income taxes for
2003 compared to $159.1 million, or 35.9% of earnings before income taxes for
2002. The change in tax rate resulted from the use of fewer available tax
credits in 2003 when compared to 2002.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

The
Company's primary capital requirements are for working capital, capital
expenditures and acquisitions.  The
Company's capital needs are met primarily through a combination of internally
generated funds, bank credit lines, term and senior notes, the sale of
receivables and credit terms from suppliers.

Cash
flows generated by operations for 2004 were $242.8 million compared to $309.4
million for 2003. The decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in
accounts receivable, which increased from $573.5 million at the beginning of
2004 to $660.7 million at December 31, 2004 and inventories, which increased
from $832.4 million at the beginning of 2004 to $1,018.0 million at December
31, 2004. The increases were primarily attributable to organic sales growth
within both the Mohawk and Dal-Tile segments.

Net
cash used in investing activities in 2004 was $121.6 million compared to $498.8
million for 2003. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower capital
expenditures and lower expenditures related to acquisitions. Capital
expenditures were incurred primarily to modernize, add and expand manufacturing
and distribution facilities and equipment. Capital expenditures, including
$1,116.8 million for acquisitions, have totaled $1,450.0 million over the past
three years. Capital spending during 2005 for both the Mohawk and Dal-Tile
segments combined, excluding acquisitions, is expected to range from $230
million to $270 million, and will be used primarily to purchase equipment and
to add manufacturing capacity.

Net
cash used in financing activities for 2004 was $121.2 million compared to cash
provided in 2003 of $189.4 million. The primary reason for the change was a
reduction in debt levels in 2004, when compared to 2003.

On
September 29, 2004, the Company amended its five-year revolving credit facility
with interest rates of either (i) LIBOR plus 0.4% to 1.4%, depending upon the
Company's performance measured against certain financial ratios, or (ii) the
base rate plus 0-0.5% depending upon the Company's performance measured against
certain financial ratios. The facility was increased from $200 million to $300
million. The increase in the facility replaces the $100 million 364-day
facility, which expired during the third quarter of 2004. The credit agreement
contains customary financial and other covenants. The Company must pay an
annual facility fee ranging from .15% to .50% of the total credit commitment,
depending upon the Company's performance measured against specific coverage
ratios, under the revolving credit line.


The
Company believes that its available credit facilities at December 31, 2004 are
adequate to support its operations and working capital requirements. At
December 31, 2004, the Company had credit facilities of $300 million under its
revolving credit line and $50 million under various short-term uncommitted
credit lines. All of these lines are unsecured. At December 31, 2004, a total
of approximately $234.1 million was available under both the credit facility
and uncommitted credit lines compared to $237.3 million available under both
the credit facility and uncommitted credit lines at December 31, 2003. The
amount used under both the credit facility and uncommitted credit lines at
December 31, 2004, consisted of $37.7 million under the Company's five-year
revolving credit facility and unsecured credit lines, $55.6 million standby
letters of credit guaranteeing the Company's industrial revenue bonds and $22.6
million standby letters of credit related to various insurance contracts and
foreign vendor commitments.

The
Company has an on-balance sheet trade accounts receivable securitization agreement
(the "Securitization Facility"). The Securitization Facility allows
the Company to borrow up to $350 million based on available accounts
receivable. At December 31, 2004, the Company had $90 million outstanding
secured by approximately $825.8 million of trade receivables compared to $182
million secured by approximately $649 million of trade receivables at December
31, 2003. During the third quarter of 2004, the Company extended the term of
its Securitization Facility until August 2005 and amended certain
representations and warranties.

The
Company's Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 15 million
shares of the Company's outstanding common stock. For the year ended December
31, 2004, a total of approximately 250,000 shares of the Company's common stock
were purchased at an aggregate cost of approximately $18.4 million. Since the
inception of the program in 1999, a total of approximately 11.2 million shares
have been repurchased at an aggregate cost of approximately $311.5 million. All
of these repurchases have been financed through the Company's operations and
banking arrangements.

The
outstanding checks in excess of cash represent trade payables checks that have
not yet cleared the bank. When the checks clear the bank, they are funded by
the revolving credit facility. This policy does not impact any liquid assets on
the consolidated balance sheets.

The
following is a summary of the Company's future minimum payments under
contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004 (in thousands):

commitments for natural gas, foreign currency, and raw material purchases.

Critical Accounting Policies

In
preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the Company must
make decisions which impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosures. Such decisions include the
selection of appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the
assumptions on which to base accounting estimates. In reaching such decisions,
the Company applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the
relevant circumstances and historical experience. Actual amounts could differ
from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are
prepared.


The
Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Some of
those significant accounting policies require the Company to make subjective or
complex judgments or estimates. Critical accounting policies are defined as
those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company's financial
condition and results and require management's most difficult, subjective, or
complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the
effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent
periods.

The
Company believes the following accounting policies require it to use judgments
and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and represent
critical accounting policies.

Accounts receivable and revenue recognition. Revenues
     are recognized when goods are shipped and legal title passes to the
     customer. The Company provides allowances for expected cash discounts,
     returns, claims, and doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debt and
     claims experience and periodic evaluation of specific customer accounts
     and the aging of accounts receivable. If the financial condition of the
     Company's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of
     their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market
     (net realizable value). Cost is determined using the last-in, first-out
     method (LIFO) for approximately 80% of the inventory within the Mohawk
     segment, which matches current costs with current revenues, and the
     first-in, first-out method (FIFO), which is used to value inventory within
     the Dal-Tile segment and inventory not valued under the LIFO method in the
     Mohawk segment. Inventories on hand are compared against anticipated
     future usage, which is a function of historical usage and anticipated
     future selling price, in order to evaluate obsolescence, excessive
     quantities, and expected sales below cost. Actual results could differ
     from assumptions used to value obsolete, excessive inventory or inventory
     expected to be sold below cost and additional reserves may be required.

Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are subject
     to annual impairment testing. The impairment tests are based on
     determining the fair value of the specified reporting units and indefinite
     life intangible assets based on management judgments and assumptions using
     estimated future cash flows. These judgments and assumptions could
     materially change the value of the specified reporting units and
     indefinite life intangible assets and, therefore, could materially impact
     the Company's consolidated financial statements. Intangible assets with
     definite lives are amortized over their useful lives. The useful life of a
     definite intangible asset is based on assumptions and judgments made by
     management at the time of acquisition. Changes in these judgments and
     assumptions that could include a loss of customers, a change in the
     assessment of future operations or a prolonged economic downturn could
     materially change the value of the definite-lived intangible assets and,
     therefore could materially impact the Company's financial statements.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
     for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
     financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
     and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
     measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in
     the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered
     or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change
     in the tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the
     enactment date. Additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively
     disagree with the Company's tax treatment of certain items, and some
     historical transactions have income tax effects going forward. Accounting
     rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws,
     rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an
     unpredictable manner.

Environmental and legal accruals are estimates based
     on judgments made by the Company relating to ongoing environmental and
     legal proceedings, as disclosed in the Company's consolidated financial
     statements. In determining whether a liability is probable and reasonably
     estimable, the Company consults with its internal experts. The Company
     believes that the amounts recorded in the accompanying financial
     statements are based on the best estimates and judgments available to it.


Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff
Position 109-1, "Application of FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes" ("SFAS No. 109") to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production
Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004" ("FSP
109-1"). The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "Jobs Act")
provides a tax deduction for income from qualified domestic production
activities. FSP 109-1 provides the treatment for the deduction as a special
deduction as described in SFAS No. 109. The
Company is currently evaluating the effect that the manufacturer's deduction
will have on future results. FSP 109-1 is effective prospectively as of January 1, 2005.

In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff
Position 109-2, "Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign
Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004" ("FSP 109-2"), which provides guidance under SFAS No. 109 with
respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the
Jobs Act on enterprises' income tax expense and deferred tax liability. The
Jobs Act was enacted on October 22, 2004. FSP 109-2 states that an enterprise
is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate
the effect of the Jobs Act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of
foreign earnings for purposes of applying FASB Statement No. 109. The Company
has not yet completed evaluating the impact of the repatriation provisions and
has not adjusted its tax expense or deferred tax liability to reflect the
repatriation provisions of the Jobs Act.

In
November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs-An Amendment
of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4" ("SFAS 151"). SFAS 151 amends the
guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, "Inventory Pricing," to clarify
the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling
costs, and wasted material (spoilage). Among other provisions, the new rule
requires that items such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double
freight, and re-handling costs be recognized as current-period charges
regardless of whether they meet the criterion of "so abnormal" as
stated in ARB No. 43. Additionally, SFAS 151 requires that the allocation of
fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity
of the production facilities. SFAS 151 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2005. The Company is currently evaluating SFAS 151 and does not
expect it to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial
statements.

In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based
Payment" ("SFAS 123R"), which replaces SFAS No. 123,
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," ("SFAS 123") and
supercedes APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees." SFAS 123R requires all share-based payments to employees,
including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial
statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim or
annual period after June 15, 2005. Transition may be accomplished using either
the prospective or retrospective methods. The Company currently measures
compensation costs related to share-based payments under APB Opinion No. 25.
The Company is currently evaluating the transition methods under SFAS 123R and
will begin expensing stock options in the third quarter of 2005.

Impact
of Inflation

Inflation
affects the Company's manufacturing costs, distribution costs and operating
expenses. The carpet and tile industry has experienced significant inflation in
the prices of raw materials and fuel-related costs beginning in the first
quarter of 2004. For the period from 1999 through 2004 the carpet and tile
industry experienced moderate inflation in the prices of raw materials and
fuel-related costs. In the past, the Company has generally passed along these
price increases to its customers and has been able to enhance productivity to
offset increases in costs resulting from inflation in both the United States
and Mexico.


Seasonality

The Company is a
calendar year-end company and its
results of operations for the first quarter tend to be the weakest.  The second, third and fourth quarters
typically produce higher net sales and operating income.  These results are primarily due to consumer
residential spending patterns for floor covering, which historically have
decreased during the first two months of each year following the holiday
season.

Certain Factors affecting the Company's Performance

In
addition to the other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K,
the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating an investment
in shares of Common Stock.

If any of the events described in these risks
were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's
business, financial condition and results of operations.

The
floor covering industry is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions,
such as consumer confidence and income, corporate and government spending,
interest rate levels and demand for housing. A prolonged decline in
construction activity or spending for replacement floor covering products could
have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.

The
U.S. floor covering industry is highly dependent on construction activity,
including new construction, remodeling and replacement which are cyclical in
nature. Although the impact of a decline in new construction activity is
typically accompanied by an increase in remodeling and replacement activity, a
prolonged decline in residential or commercial construction activity could have
a material adverse effect on the Company's business. Additionally, economic
changes that result in a prolonged decline in spending for remodeling and
replacement activities could have a material adverse effect on the Company's
business.

The
U.S. construction industry has experienced significant downturns in the past,
which have adversely affected suppliers to the industry. The industry could
experience similar downturns in the future, which could have a negative impact
on the Company's business.

The Company faces intense
competition in its industry, which could decrease demand for its products and
could have a material adverse effect on its profitability.

The industry is highly competitive. The Company
faces competition from a number of manufacturers and independent distributors.
Some of its competitors may be larger and have greater resources and access to
capital.  Maintaining the Company's
competitive position may require: substantial investments in its product
development efforts, manufacturing facilities, distribution network and sales
and marketing activities. Competitive pressures may also result in decreased
demand for its products.  Any of these
factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company.

A failure to identify suitable acquisition candidates, to complete
acquisitions and to integrate successfully the acquired operations could have a
material adverse effect on the Company's business.

As
part of its business strategy, the Company intends to pursue acquisitions of
complementary businesses.  Although it
regularly evaluates acquisition opportunities, it may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition
candidates; obtain sufficient
financing on acceptable terms to fund acquisitions; complete acquisitions; or profitably
manage acquired businesses.

Acquired operations may not achieve expected performance levels and may
involve a number of special risks, including among others an inability to successfully
integrate acquired operations and the diversion of management resources.

The Company may be unable to obtain raw materials on a
timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on its business.

The principal raw materials used in the Company's
manufacturing operations include: nylon, polyester and polypropylene resins and
fibers and carpet backings, which are used exclusively in its carpet and rugs
business; talc, clay, nepheline syenite and various glazes, including frit
(ground glass), zircon and stains, which are used exclusively in its ceramic
tile business; and other materials. The
Company has a single source supplier for all of its nepheline syenite
requirements.  An extended interruption
in the supply of these or other raw materials used in the Company's business or
in the supply of suitable substitute materials would disrupt the Company's
operations, which could have a material adverse effect on its business.


The Company may be unable to pass on to its customers
increases in the costs of raw materials and energy, which could have a material
adverse effect on its profitability.

The prices of raw materials and natural gas vary
with market conditions. Although the Company generally attempts to pass on
increases in the costs of raw materials and natural gas to its customers, the
Company's ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any
increase, competitive pressures and market conditions for its products. There
have been in the past, and may be in the future, periods of time during which
increases in these costs cannot be recovered. 
During such periods of time, there could be a material adverse effect on
the Company's profitability.

The Company has been, and
in the future may be, subject to claims and liabilities under environmental,
health and safety laws and regulations, which could be significant.

The Company's operations are subject to various
environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those
governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, and the use, storage, treatment
and disposal of hazardous materials. 
The applicable requirements under these laws are subject to amendment,
to the imposition of new or additional requirements and to changing
interpretations of agencies or courts. The Company could incur material
expenditures to comply with new or existing regulations, including fines and
penalties.

The nature of the Company's operations, including
the potential discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions, exposes
the Company to the risk of claims under environmental, health and safety laws
and regulations. The Company could incur material costs or liabilities in
connection with such claims.

Changes in international
trade laws and in the business, political and regulatory environment in Mexico
could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.

The Company's Monterrey, Mexico manufacturing
facility represents a significant portion of the Company's total manufacturing
capacity for ceramic tile. Accordingly, an event that has a material adverse
impact on the Company's Mexican operations could have a material adverse effect
on the tile operations as a whole. The business, regulatory and political
environments in Mexico differ from those in the United States, and the
Company's Mexican operations are exposed to legal, currency, tax, political,
and economic risks specific to Mexico.

The Company could face
increased competition as a result of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
("GATT") and the North American Free Trade Agreement
("NAFTA").

The
Company is uncertain what effect reduced import duties under GATT may have on
its operations, although these reduced rates may stimulate additional
competition from manufacturers that export ceramic tile to the United States.

Although
NAFTA lowers the tariffs imposed on the Company's ceramic tile manufactured in
Mexico and sold in the United States and will eliminate such tariffs entirely
on January 1, 2008, it may also stimulate competition in the United States and
Canada from manufacturers located in Mexico.

Forward-Looking Information

Certain
of the statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly those
anticipating future performance, business prospects, growth and operating
strategies, proposed acquisitions, and similar matters, and those that include
the words "believes," "anticipates," "forecast,"
"estimates" or similar expressions constitute "forward-looking
statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended.  For those statements, Mohawk
claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements
contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. There can be
no assurance that the forward-looking statements will be accurate because they
are based on many assumptions, which involve risks and uncertainties. The
following important factors could cause future results to differ: changes in
industry conditions; competition; raw material prices; timing and level of
capital expenditures; integration of acquisitions; introduction of new
products; rationalization of operations; and other risks identified in Mohawk's
SEC reports and public announcements.


Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk

Financial
exposures are managed as an integral part of the Company's risk management
program, which seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect that the
volatility of the exchange rate and natural gas markets may have on its
operating results. The Company does not regularly engage in speculative
transactions, nor does it regularly hold or issue financial instruments for
trading purposes.

Natural
Gas Risk Management

The
Company uses a combination of natural gas futures contracts and long-term
supply agreements to manage unanticipated changes in natural gas prices. The
contracts are based on forecasted usage of natural gas measured in Million
British Thermal Units ("MMBTU").

The
Company has designated the natural gas futures contracts as cash flow hedges.
The outstanding contracts are valued at market with the offset applied to other
comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes and any hedge ineffectiveness.

Any
gain or loss is reclassified from other comprehensive income and recognized in
cost of goods sold in the same period or periods during which the hedged
transaction affects earnings. At December 31, 2004, the Company had natural gas
contracts that mature from January 2005 to March 2005 with an aggregate
notional amount of approximately 1 million MMBTU's. The fair value of these
contracts was a liability of $1.3 million. At December 31, 2003, the Company
had natural gas contracts that matured from January 2004 to December 2004 with
an aggregate notional amount of approximately 3.9 million MMBTU's. The fair
value of these contracts was an asset of $3.6 million. The offset to these
assets is recorded in other comprehensive income, net of applicable income
taxes. The ineffective portion of the derivative is recognized directly in the
cost of goods sold within the consolidated statements of earnings and was not
significant for the periods reported. The amount that the Company anticipates  will be reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income in the
next twelve months is a loss of approximately $1.3 million.

The
Company's natural gas long-term supply agreements are accounted for under the
normal purchases provision within SFAS No. 133 and its amendments. At December
31, 2004, the Company had normal purchase commitments of approximately 1.9
million MMBTU's for periods maturing from January 2005 through March 2006. The
contracted value of these commitments was approximately $9.9 million and the
fair value of these commitments was approximately $11.9 million, at December
31, 2004. At December 31, 2003, the Company had normal purchase commitments of
approximately 3.1 million MMBTU's. The contracted value of these commitments was
approximately $13.8 million and the fair value of these commitments was
approximately $17.0 million.

Foreign Currency
Rate Management

The
Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign
denominated costs associated with its operations in Mexico. The objective of
these transactions is to reduce volatility of exchange rates where these
operations are located by fixing a portion of their costs in U.S. currency.
Accordingly, these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges. Gains
and losses are reclassified from other comprehensive income and recognized in
cost of goods sold in the same period or periods during which the hedged
transaction affects earnings. The Company had forward contracts to purchase
approximately 145.3 million Mexican pesos at December 31, 2003. The aggregate
U.S. dollar value of these contracts at December 31, 2003 was approximately
$12.7 million. The contracts are marked to market in other current liabilities
with the offset to other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes.
Unrealized losses at December 31, 2003 were not significant. The Company had no
forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2004.

Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

INDEX TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Consolidated Financial

Statements

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Mohawk
Industries, Inc.:

We
have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Mohawk Industries, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated
statements of earnings, stockholders' equity and comprehensive income, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2004.
In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also
have audited the financial statement schedule as listed in Item 15(a)2. These
consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Mohawk Industries,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.  Also in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company's
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on
criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and
our report dated March 11, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on
management's assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control
over financial reporting.

Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm on  Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Mohawk Industries, Inc.:

We have audited management's
assessment, included in the "Management's Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting" set forth in Item 9A of Mohawk Industries, Inc.'s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, that Mohawk
Industries, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). Mohawk Industries, Inc.'s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assessment, and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company's internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management's
assessment that Mohawk Industries, Inc. maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). Also, in our opinion, Mohawk Industries, Inc. maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, based on criteria
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States), the consolidated balance sheets of Mohawk Industries, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated
statements of earnings, stockholders' equity and comprehensive income, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2004,
and our report dated March 11, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on
those consolidated financial statements

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002

(In thousands, except  per share data)

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a) Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Mohawk Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company" or
"Mohawk").  All significant intercompany balances and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

(b) Accounts Receivable and Revenue Recognition

The Company is principally a carpet, rug and
ceramic tile manufacturer and sells carpet, rugs, ceramic tile, natural stone,
hardwood, resilient and laminate flooring products throughout the United States principally for residential and
commercial use. The Company grants credit to customers, most of whom are
retail-flooring dealers and commercial end users, under credit terms that are
customary in the industry.

Revenues are recognized when goods are shipped, which is
when the legal title passes to the customer. The Company provides allowances for
expected cash discounts, returns, claims and doubtful accounts based upon
historical bad debt and claims experience and periodic evaluations of specific
customer accounts.

(c) Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market
(net realizable value).  Cost is determined using the last-in, first-out
(LIFO) method, which matches current costs with current revenues, for
approximately 80% of the inventories within the Mohawk segment and the first-in,
first-out (FIFO) method for the Dal-Tile segment and the remaining inventories
within the Mohawk segment.

(d) Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost,
including capitalized interest.  Depreciation is calculated on a
straight-line basis over the estimated remaining useful lives, which are 25-35
years for buildings and improvements, 5-15 years for machinery and equipment,
the shorter of the estimated useful life or life of the lease for leasehold
improvements and 3-7 years for furniture and fixtures.

(e) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

In accordance with the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets" the Company tests goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite
lives for impairment on an annual basis (or on an interim basis if an event
occurs that might reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying
value). The Company conducts testing for impairment during the fourth quarter of
its fiscal year. Intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives are
amortized based on average lives.


MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Statements (Continued)

(f) Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and
liability method.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on
deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that includes the enactment date.

(g) Financial Instruments

The Company's financial instruments consist primarily of
receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and long-term debt.  The
carrying amount of receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses
approximates their fair value because of the short-term maturity of such
instruments. The carrying amount of the Company's floating rate debt
approximates its fair value. Interest rates that are currently available to the
Company for issuance of long-term debt with similar terms and remaining
maturities are used to estimate the fair value of the Company's long-term debt.
The estimated fair value of the Company's long-term debt at December 31, 2004
and 2003 was $961,120 and $1,095,590, compared to a carrying amount of $891,341
and $1,012,413, respectively.

(h) Derivative Instruments

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities requires the Company to recognize all derivatives on the consolidated
balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to
fair value through earnings. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the
nature of the hedge, changes in its fair value are either offset against the
change in fair value of assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through
earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is
recognized in earnings. The Company engages in activities that expose it to
market risks, including the effects of changes in interest rates, exchange rates
and  natural gas prices. Financial exposures are managed as an
integral part of the Company's risk management program, which seeks to reduce
the potentially adverse effect that the volatility of the interest rate,
exchange rate and natural gas markets may have on operating results. The Company
does not regularly engage in speculative transactions, nor does it regularly
hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.

The Company formally documents all hedging instruments
and hedging items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for
undertaking hedged items. This process includes linking all derivatives that are
designated as fair value and cash flow hedges to specific assets or liabilities
on the consolidated balance sheet or to forecasted transactions. The Company
also formally assesses, both at inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the
derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in
offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of hedged items. When it is
determined that a derivative is not highly effective, the derivative expires, or
is sold, terminated, or exercised, or the derivative is discontinued because it
is unlikely that a forecasted transaction will occur, the Company discontinues
hedge accounting for that specific hedge instrument.

(

i) Advertising Costs and Vendor
Consideration

Advertising and promotion expenses are charged to
earnings during the period in which they are incurred.  Advertising and
promotion expenses included in selling, administrative, and general expenses
were $31,474 in 2004, $26,990 in 2003 and $31,829 in 2002.


MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Statements (Continued)

Vendor consideration, generally cash, is classified as a
reduction of net sales, unless specific criteria are met regarding goods or
services that the vendor may receive in return for this consideration. The
Company makes various payments to customers, including slotting fees,
advertising allowances, buy-downs and co-op advertising. All of these payments
reduce gross sales with the exception of co-op advertising. Co-op advertising is
classified as a selling, general and administrative expense. Co-op advertising
expenses, a component of advertising and promotion expenses, were $10,389 in
2004, $9,355 in 2003 and $14,090 in 2002.

(j) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets and intangibles subject to
amortization are reviewed for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying
amount of the asset exceeds the expected undiscounted cash flows of the asset,
an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying
amount exceeds the expected undiscounted cash flows. Assets to be disposed of
are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated
costs of disposal and are no longer depreciated.

(k) Foreign Currency Translation

The Company's subsidiaries that operate outside the
United States use their local currency as the functional currency, with the
exception of operations carried out in Canada and Mexico, in which case the functional
currency is the U.S. dollar. Other than Canada and Mexico, the functional currency is
translated into U.S. dollars for balance sheet accounts using the month end
rates in effect as of the balance sheet date and average exchange rate for
revenue and expense accounts for each respective period. The translation
adjustments are deferred as a separate component of stockholders' equity, within
other comprehensive income. Gains or losses resulting from transactions
denominated in foreign currencies are included in other income or expense,
within the consolidated statements of earnings. The assets and liabilities of
the Company's Canada and Mexico operations are re-measured using a month end rate, except
for non-monetary assets and liabilities, which are re-measured using the
historical exchange rate. Income and expense accounts are re-measured using an
average monthly rate for the period, except for expenses related to those
balance sheet accounts that are re-measured using historical exchange rates. The
resulting re-measurement adjustment is reported in the consolidated statements
of operations when incurred.

(l) Earnings per Share ("EPS")

Basic net earnings per share ("EPS") is calculated using
net earnings available to common stockholders divided by the weighted-average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is
similar to basic EPS except that the weighted-average number of shares is
increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been
outstanding if the potentially dilutive common shares had been issued.

Dilutive common stock options are included in the
diluted EPS calculation using the treasury stock method.  Common stock
options that were not included in the diluted EPS computation because the
options' exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common
shares for the periods presented were 21, 605 and 571 for 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

(m) Stock-Based Compensation

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the
disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation-Transition and Disclosure." This statement amends SFAS No. 123,
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," to provide alternative methods of
transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting
for stock-based compensation and requires prominent disclosure in both the
annual and interim financial statements of the method of accounting used and the
financial impact of stock-based compensation. As permitted by SFAS No. 123, the
Company accounts for stock options granted as prescribed under Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,"
which recognizes compensation cost based upon the intrinsic value of the award.


MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Statements (Continued)

If the Company had elected to recognize compensation
expense based upon the fair value at the grant dates for awards under its plans,
the Company's net earnings per share would have been reduced as follows:

(n) Effect of New Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff
Position 109-1, "Application of FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes" ("SFAS No. 109") to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production
Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004" ("FSP
109-1"). The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "Jobs Act")
provides a tax deduction for income from qualified domestic production
activities. FSP 109-1 provides the treatment for the deduction as a special
deduction as described in SFAS No. 109. The
Company is currently evaluating the effect that the manufacturer's deduction
will have on future results. FSP 109-1 is effective prospectively as of January 1, 2005.

In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff
Position 109-2, "Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign
Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004" ("FSP 109-2"), which provides guidance under SFAS No. 109 with
respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the
Jobs Act on enterprises' income tax expense and deferred tax liability. The
Jobs Act was enacted on October 22, 2004. FSP 109-2 states that an enterprise
is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate
the effect of the Jobs Act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of
foreign earnings for purposes of applying FASB Statement No. 109. The Company
has not yet completed evaluating the impact of the repatriation provisions and
has not adjusted its tax expense or deferred tax liability to reflect the
repatriation provisions of the Jobs Act.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,
"Inventory Costs-An Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4" ("SFAS 151"). SFAS 151
amends the guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, "Inventory Pricing," to clarify
the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling
costs and wasted material (spoilage). Among other provisions, the new rule
requires that items such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double
freight, and re-handling costs be recognized as current-period charges
regardless of whether they meet the criterion of "so abnormal" as stated in ARB
No. 43. Additionally, SFAS 151 requires that the allocation of fixed production
overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the
production facilities. SFAS 151 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
June 15, 2005. The Company is currently evaluating SFAS 151 and does not expect
it to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.


MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Statements (Continued)

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised
2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R"), which replaces SFAS No. 123,
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS 123") and supercedes APB
Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." SFAS 123R requires
all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock
options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values
beginning with the first interim or annual period after June 15, 2005.
Transition may be accomplished using either the prospective or retrospective
methods. The Company currently measures compensation costs related to
share-based payments under APB Opinion No. 25. The Company is currently
evaluating the transition methods under SFAS 123R and will begin expensing stock
options in the third quarter of 2005.

(o) Fiscal Year

The Company ends its fiscal year on December 31. 
Each of the first three quarters in the fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest
the calendar quarter end.

(p) Reclassifications

In 2004, the Company reclassified certain prior period
financial statement balances to conform to current presentations.

(2) Acquisitions

On March 20, 2002, the Company acquired all of the
outstanding capital stock of Dal-Tile International Inc. ("Dal-Tile"), a leading
manufacturer and distributor of ceramic tile in the United States, for
approximately $1,468,325, consisting of approximately 12,900 shares of the
Company's common stock, options to purchase approximately 2,100 shares of the
Company's common stock and approximately $717,638 in cash, including direct
acquisition costs. The Company's common stock and options were valued at
approximately $750,687 based on the measurement date stock price of $55.04 per
share ($710,420) and the estimated fair value of the options using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model ($40,267). The acquisition was accounted for by the
purchase method and, accordingly, the results of operations of Dal-Tile have
been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from March 20,
2002. The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed based upon the estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The
trademark value was established based upon an independent appraisal. The excess
of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets
acquired of approximately $1,168,286 was recorded as goodwill. None of the
goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The primary
reason for the acquisition was to expand the Company's presence in the ceramic
tile and stone markets.

Mohawk considered whether identifiable intangible
assets, such as customer relationships, patents, covenants not to compete,
software, production backlog, marketing agreements, unpatented technology and
trade secrets, might exist and none were identified other than trademarks,
during the purchase price negotiations and during the subsequent purchase price
allocation evaluation. Accordingly, the valuation resulted in the recognition of
goodwill and trademarks.


MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Statements (Continued)

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets" ("SFAS No. 142"), goodwill recorded in the Dal-Tile
acquisition will not be amortized. Additionally, the Company determined that the
trademark intangible assets have indefinite useful lives because they are
expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. Goodwill and the trademark
intangible assets are subject to annual impairment testing.

The following table summarizes the fair values of the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition.

On May 5, 2003, the Company acquired certain assets of
International Marble and Granite of Colorado, Inc., a distributor of natural
stone slabs and tile. The primary reason for the acquisition was to expand the
Company's presence in the stone flooring and countertop slab market. The
acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method and, accordingly, the
results of operations are included within the Dal-Tile segment from May 5, 2003.
The purchase price was not significant.

On June 30, 2003, the Company acquired certain assets of
a manufacturer and distributor of washable bath rugs. The primary reason for the
acquisition was to expand the Company's presence in the bath mat market. The
acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method and, accordingly, the
results of operations are included within the Mohawk segment from June 30, 2003.
The purchase price was not significant.

On November 10, 2003, the Company acquired the assets
and assumed certain liabilities of the carpet division of Burlington Industries,
Inc. ("Lees Carpet") from W.L. Ross & Company for approximately $352,009 in
cash. The results of Lees Carpet have been included with the Mohawk segment
results in the Company's consolidated financial statements since that date. The
primary reason for the acquisition was to expand the Company's presence in the
commercial carpet market.

(5) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The Company evaluates its goodwill and indefinite life
intangibles on an annual basis for impairment. The Company has two reporting
segments, the Mohawk segment and the Dal-Tile segment and, accordingly, has
assigned the acquired goodwill and indefinite life intangibles to the respective
reporting segments. During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company evaluated the
goodwill and indefinite life intangibles using the discounted cash flow approach
and determined that there was no impairment.

(7) Long-Term Debt

On September 29, 2004, the Company amended its five-year
revolving credit facility with interest rates of either (i) LIBOR plus 0.4% to
1.4%, depending upon the Company's performance measured against certain
financial ratios, or (ii) the base rate plus 0-0.5%, depending upon the Company's
performance measured against certain financial ratios. The facility was
increased from $200,000 to $300,000. The increase in the facility replaces the
$100,000 364-day facility, which expired during the third quarter of 2004. The
credit agreement contains customary financial and other covenants. The Company
must pay an annual facility fee ranging from .15% to .50% of the total credit
commitment, depending upon the Company's performance measured against specific
coverage ratios. At December 31, 2004, a total of approximately $234,130 was
available under both the credit facility and uncommitted credit lines compared
to $237,344 available under both the credit facility and uncommitted credit
lines at December 31, 2003. The amount used under both the credit facility and
uncommitted credit lines at December 31, 2004, consisted of $37,721 under the
Company's revolving credit facility and unsecured credit lines, $55,599 standby
letters of credit guaranteeing the Company's industrial revenue bonds and
$22,550 standby letters of credit related to various insurance contracts and
foreign vendor commitments. The revolving credit facility and uncommitted credit
lines are unsecured.

The Company has an on-balance sheet trade accounts
receivable securitization agreement (the "Securitization Facility"). The
Securitization Facility allows the Company to borrow up to $350,000 based on
available accounts receivable. At December 31, 2004, the Company had $90,000
outstanding secured by approximately $825,799 million of trade receivables
compared to $182,000 secured by approximately $649,018 of trade receivables at
December 31, 2003. During the third quarter of 2004, the Company extended the
term of its Securitization Facility until August 2005 and amended certain
representations and warranties.

(9) Derivative Financial Instruments

Natural Gas Risk Management

The Company uses a combination of natural gas futures
contracts and long-term supply agreements to manage unanticipated changes in
natural gas prices. The contracts are based on forecasted usage of natural gas
measured in Million British Thermal Units ("MMBTU").

The Company has designated the natural gas futures
contracts as cash flow hedges. The outstanding contracts are valued at market
with the offset applied to other comprehensive income, net of applicable income
taxes and any hedge ineffectiveness.

Any gain or loss is reclassified from other
comprehensive income and recognized in cost of goods sold in the same period or
periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. At December 31,
2004, the Company had natural gas contracts that mature from January 2005 to
March 2005 with an aggregate notional amount of approximately 1,010 MMBTU's. The
fair value of these contracts was a liability of $1,280. At December 31, 2003,
the Company had natural gas contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional
amount of approximately 3,950 MMBTU's. The fair value of these contracts was an
asset of $3,565. The offset to these assets is recorded in other comprehensive
income, net of applicable income taxes. The ineffective portion of the
derivative is recognized in the cost of goods sold within the consolidated
statements of earnings and was not significant for the periods reported. The
amount that the Company anticipates that will be reclassified out of accumulated
other comprehensive income in the next twelve months is a loss of approximately
$1,280.

The Company's natural gas long-term supply agreements
are accounted for under the normal purchases provision within SFAS No. 133 and
its amendments. At December 31, 2004, the Company had normal purchase
commitments of approximately 1,892 MMBTU's for periods maturing from January
2005 through March 2006. The contracted value of these commitments was
approximately $9,879 and the fair value of these commitments was approximately
$11,941, at December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2003, the Company had normal
purchase commitments of approximately 3,095 MMBTU's. The contracted value of
these commitments was approximately $13,774 and the fair value of these
commitments was approximately $17,018.

Foreign Currency Rate Management

The Company enters into foreign exchange forward
contracts to hedge foreign denominated costs associated with its operations in
Mexico. The objective of these transactions is to reduce volatility of exchange
rates where these operations are located by fixing a portion of their costs in
U.S. currency. Accordingly, these contracts have been designated as cash flow
hedges. Gains and losses are reclassified from other comprehensive income and
recognized in cost of goods sold in the same period or periods during which the
hedged transaction affects earnings. The Company had forward contracts to
purchase approximately 145,284 Mexican pesos at December 31, 2003. The aggregate
U.S. dollar value of these contracts at December 31, 2003 was approximately
$12,665. The contracts are marked to market in other current liabilities with
the offset to other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes.
Unrealized losses at December 31, 2003 were not significant. The Company had no
forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2004.

(11) Stock Options, Stock Compensation and Treasury Stock

Under the 2002 Long-Term Incentive Plan, options may be
granted to directors and key employees through 2012 to purchase a maximum of
3,200 shares of common stock. Under the 2002 plan, options that were not issued
from the 1992, 1993 and 1997 plans were cancelled.  During 2004, 2003 and
2002, options to purchase 411, 565 and 731 shares, respectively, were granted
under the 1992, 1993, 1997 and 2002 plans. Options granted under each of these
plans expire 10 years from the date of grant and become exercisable at such
dates and at prices as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Company's
Board of Directors. In connection with the acquisition of Dal-Tile in 2002, the
Company issued 2,096 options to employees of Dal-Tile in exchange for their
respective options.

During 1996, the Company adopted the 1997 Non-Employee
Director Stock Compensation Plan.  The plan provides for awards of common
stock of the Company for non-employee directors to receive in lieu of cash for
their annual retainers.  During 2004, 2003 and 2002, a total of 1, 1 and 2
shares, respectively, were awarded to the non-employee directors under the plan.

(12) Employee Benefit Plans

The Company has a 401(k) retirement savings plan (the
"Mohawk Plan") open to substantially all of its employees who have completed 90
days of eligible service. For the Mohawk segment, the Company contributes $0.50
for every $1.00 of employee contributions up to a maximum of 4% of the
employee's salary and an additional $0.25 for every $1.00 of employee
contribution in excess of 4% of the employee's salary up to a maximum of 6%. For
the Dal-Tile segment, the Company contributes $.50 for every $1.00 of employee
contributions up to a maximum of 6% of the employee's salary. Employee and
employer contributions to the Mohawk Plan were $35,440 and $13,896 in 2004,
$28,807 and $10,995 in 2003, and $20,237 and $7,359 in 2002, respectively. The
Company also made a discretionary contribution to the Mohawk Plan of
approximately $5,214, $4,595 and $3,797 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Based upon the expected reversal of deferred tax
liabilities and the level of historical and projected taxable income over
periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, the Company's
management believes it is more likely than not the Company will realize the
benefits of these deductible differences.

Income tax expense of $1,659 was recorded in other
comprehensive income related to the Company's hedge instruments as of December
31, 2004.

The Company does not provide for U.S. federal and state
income taxes on the cumulative undistributed earnings of its foreign
subsidiaries because such earnings are reinvested and will continue to be
reinvested indefinitely. At December 31, 2004, the Company had not provided
federal income taxes on earnings of approximately $48,172 from its foreign
subsidiaries. Should these earnings be distributed in the form of dividends or
otherwise, the Company would be subject to both U.S. income taxes and
withholding taxes in various international jurisdictions. These taxes will be
partially offset by U.S. foreign tax credits.

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 was enacted on
October 22, 2004. This new law made numerous and substantive changes in the
taxation of foreign-sourced and domestic income. As of this date, the U.S.
Treasury Department has not issued regulations providing implementation guidance
for this new law. Due to the lack of guidance and the complex calculations
involved, the Company has not completed its analysis of the effect this legislation may
have on it.

In the normal course of business, the Company's tax
returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such
examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing
authorities, and the Company has accrued a liability when it believes that it is
probable that it will be assessed. Differences between the estimated and actual
amounts determined upon ultimate resolution, individually or in the aggregate,
are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated
financial position but could possibly be material to the Company's consolidated
results of operations or cash flow of any one period.

(14) Commitments and Contingencies

The Company is obligated under various operating leases
for office and manufacturing space, machinery, and equipment.

Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable

The Company has approximately $36,693 and $23,433 as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003 in standby letters of credit for various insurance
contracts and commitments to foreign vendors that expire within two years.

The Company is involved in routine litigation from time
to time in the regular course of its business. Except as noted below, there are
no material legal proceedings pending or known to be contemplated to which the
Company is a party or to which any of its property is subject.

The Company is subject to various federal, state, local
and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations, including
those governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use, storage,
treatment and disposal of solid and hazardous materials, and the cleanup of
contamination associated therewith. Because of the nature of the Company's
business, the Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs relating
to compliance with such laws and regulations. The Company is involved in various
proceedings relating to environmental matters and is currently engaged in
environmental investigation, remediation and post-closure care programs at
certain sites. The Company has provided accruals for such activities that it has
determined to be both probable and reasonably estimable. The Company does not
expect that the ultimate liability with respect to such activities will have a
material adverse effect on it.

(16) Segment Reporting

The Company has two reporting segments, the Mohawk
segment, and the Dal-Tile segment. The Mohawk segment (an aggregation of the
Mohawk Flooring reporting unit and the Mohawk Home reporting unit) manufactures, sources, markets
and distributes its product lines, which include carpet, rugs, pad, ceramic
tile, hardwood, resilient and laminate through independent floor covering
retailers, home centers, mass merchandisers, department stores, commercial
dealers and commercial end users. The Dal-Tile segment product lines include
ceramic tile, porcelain tile and stone products sold through tile and flooring
retailers, contractors, independent distributors and home centers.

Amounts disclosed for each segment are prior to any
elimination or consolidation entries. Corporate general and administrative
expenses amounts attributable to each segment are estimated and allocated
accordingly. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating income. Export
sales are not significant and long-lived assets located outside the United
States of America, principally Mexico, were $97,425 and $85,339 at December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end
of the period covered by this report, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer have concluded that such controls and procedures were
effective for the period covered by this report.

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

The Company's management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). The
Company's management assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. In making this assessment, the
Company's management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework. The Company's management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2004,
its internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these
criteria. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP,
has issued an attestation report on management's assessment of the Company's
internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal controls over
financial reporting during the period covered by this report that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's
internal controls over financial reporting.

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls

The Company's management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company's
disclosure controls and procedures or the Company's internal controls over
financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no
matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further,
the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their
costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances
of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
