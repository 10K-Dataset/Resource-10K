PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

Mohawk Industries, Inc., (“Mohawk” or the
    “Company”), a term which includes the Company and its
    subsidiaries, including its primary operating subsidiaries,
    Mohawk Carpet, LLC, Dal-Tile Corporation and Unilin BVBA, is a
    leading producer of floor covering products for residential and
    commercial applications in the United States (“U.S.”)
    and residential applications in Europe. The Company is the
    second largest carpet and rug manufacturer and one of the
    largest manufacturers, marketers and distributors of ceramic
    tile, natural stone and hardwood flooring in the U.S., as well
    as a leading producer of laminate flooring in the U.S. and
    Europe. The Company had annual net sales in 2009 of
    $5.3 billion. Approximately 85% of this amount was
    generated by sales in North America and approximately 15% was
    generated by sales outside North America. The Company has three
    reporting segments, the Mohawk segment, the Dal-Tile segment and
    the Unilin segment. Selected financial information for the
    Mohawk, Dal-Tile and Unilin segments, geographic net sales and
    the location of long-lived assets is set forth in note 16
    to the consolidated financial statements.

The Mohawk segment designs, manufactures, sources, distributes
    and markets its floor covering product lines, which include
    carpets, ceramic tile, laminate, rugs, carpet pad, hardwood and
    resilient, in a broad range of colors, textures and patterns for
    residential and commercial applications in both new construction
    and remodeling. The Mohawk segment markets and distributes its
    carpets and rugs under its soft surface floor covering brands
    and ceramic tile, laminate, hardwood and resilient under its
    hard surface floor covering brands. The Mohawk segment positions
    its products in all price ranges and emphasizes quality, style,
    performance and service. The Mohawk segment is widely recognized
    through its premier brand names, which include
    “Mohawk

    The Mohawk segment markets and distributes soft and hard surface
    products through over 28,000 customers, which include
    independent floor covering retailers, home centers, mass
    merchandisers, department stores, commercial dealers and
    commercial end users. Some products are also marketed through
    private labeling programs. The Mohawk segment’s soft
    surface operations are vertically integrated from the extrusion
    of resin to the manufacturing and distribution of finished
    carpets and rugs.

The Dal-Tile segment designs, manufactures, sources, distributes
    and markets a broad line of ceramic tile, porcelain tile,
    natural stone and other products used in the residential and
    commercial markets for both new construction and remodeling.
    Most of the Dal-Tile segment’s ceramic tile products are
    marketed under the
    “Dal-Tile

®

”

    and “American
    Olean

®

”

    brand names and sold through company-owned service centers,
    independent distributors, home center retailers, tile and
    flooring retailers and contractors. The Dal-Tile segment
    operations are vertically integrated from the production of raw
    material for body and glaze preparation to the manufacturing and
    distribution of ceramic and porcelain tile.

The Unilin segment is a leading designer, manufacturer,
    licensor, distributor and marketer of laminate and hardwood
    flooring in Europe and the U.S. Unilin is one of the
    leaders in laminate flooring technology, having commercialized
    direct pressure laminate, or DPL, a technology used in a
    majority of laminates today, and has developed the patented
    UNICLIC

®

glueless installation system and a variety of other new
    technologies, such as beveled edges, multiple length planks and
    new surface technologies. Unilin is one of the largest
    vertically-integrated laminate flooring manufacturers in the
    U.S. producing both laminate flooring and related high
    density fiberboard. Unilin sells its flooring products under the
    Quick-Step

brands through retailers, independent distributors and home
    centers. Unilin also produces roofing systems, insulation panels
    and other wood products.

Industry

The U.S. floor covering industry has grown from
    $12.4 billion in sales in 1992 to $20.2 billion in
    2008. In 2008, the primary categories of the U.S. floor
    covering industry were carpet and rug (58%), ceramic tile (11%),
    resilient and rubber (11%), hardwood (10%), stone (5%) and
    laminate (5%). Each of these categories



has been influenced by the average selling price per square
    foot, the residential builder and homeowner remodeling markets,
    housing starts and housing resales, average house size and home
    ownership. In addition, the level of sales in the floor covering
    industry, both in the U.S. and Europe, is influenced by
    consumer confidence, spending for durable goods, interest rates
    and availability of credit, turnover in housing, the condition
    of the residential and commercial construction industries and
    the overall strength of the economy. The U.S. floor
    covering industry has experienced declining demand beginning in
    the fourth quarter of 2006 which worsened considerably during
    the later parts of 2008 and continued to decline throughout
    2009. The global economy continues in the most significant
    downturn in recent history. Overall economic conditions and
    consumer sentiment have continued to be challenging, which has
    intensified the pressure on the demand for housing and flooring
    products.

The worldwide carpet and rug sales volume of
    U.S. manufacturers was approximately 1.4 billion
    square yards, or $11.7 billion, in 2008. The carpet and
    rugs category has two primary markets, residential and
    commercial. In 2008, the residential market made up
    approximately 68% of industry amounts shipped and the commercial
    market comprised approximately 32%. Of the total residential
    market, 69% of the dollar values of shipments are made in
    response to residential replacement demand.

The U.S. ceramic tile industry shipped 2.1 billion
    square feet, or $2.3 billion, in 2008. The ceramic tile
    industry’s two primary markets, residential applications
    and commercial applications, represent 58% and 42% of the 2008
    industry total, respectively. Of the total residential market,
    51% of the dollar values of shipments are made in response to
    residential replacement demand.

In 2008, the U.S. stone flooring industry shipped
    0.2 billion square feet, representing a market of
    approximately $1.0 billion. Sales of U.S. stone
    flooring are primarily distributed to the residential market for
    both new construction and residential replacement.

In 2008, the U.S. hardwood industry shipped
    0.9 billion square feet, representing a market of
    approximately $2.0 billion. Sales of U.S. hardwood are
    primarily distributed to the residential market for both new
    construction and residential replacement.

In 2008, the U.S. resilient and rubber industry shipped
    3.6 billion square feet, representing a market of
    approximately $2.2 billion. Sales of U.S. resilient
    are primarily distributed to the residential market for both new
    construction and residential replacement.

In 2008, the U.S. laminate industry shipped
    1.0 billion square feet, or $1.1 billion. In 2008, the
    European laminate industry produced approximately
    5.0 billion square feet which accounted for approximately
    15% of the European floor covering market. Sales of
    U.S. laminate flooring are primarily distributed through
    the residential replacement market. Sales to other end user
    markets are not significant.

Sales and
    Distribution

Mohawk
    Segment

Through its Mohawk segment, the Company designs, manufactures,
    distributes and markets thousands of styles of carpet and rugs
    in a broad range of colors, textures and patterns. In addition,
    the Mohawk segment markets and distributes ceramic tile,
    laminate, hardwood, resilient floor covering, carpet pad and
    flooring accessories. The Mohawk segment positions product lines
    in all price ranges and emphasizes quality, style, performance
    and service. The Mohawk segment markets and distributes its soft
    and hard surface product lines to over 28,000 customers, which
    include independent floor covering retailers, home centers, mass
    merchandisers, department stores, commercial dealers and
    commercial end users. Some products are also marketed through
    private labeling programs. Sales to residential customers
    represent a significant portion of the total industry and the
    majority of the Company’s carpet and rug sales.

The Company has positioned its premier residential carpet and
    rug brand names across all price ranges. Mohawk, Horizon,
    “WundaWeve

®

,”

    Lauren Ralph Lauren and Karastan are positioned to sell
    primarily in the medium-to-high retail price channels in the
    residential broadloom market. These lines have substantial brand
    name recognition among carpet dealers and retailers, with the
    Karastan and Mohawk brands having among the



highest consumer recognition in the industry. Karastan is a
    leader in the high-end market. The Aladdin and Mohawk Home brand
    names compete primarily in the value retail price channel. The
    Portico and
    “Properties

®

”

    brand names compete primarily in the builder and multi-family
    markets, respectively. The Company markets its hard surface
    product lines, which include Mohawk Ceramic, Mohawk Hardwood,
    Mohawk Laminate and Congoleum across all price ranges.

The Company offers marketing and advertising support through
    dealer programs like Mohawk Floorscapes, Mohawk ColorCenter, and
    Karastan. These programs offer varying degrees of support to
    dealers in the form of sales and management training, in-store
    merchandising systems, exclusive promotions and assistance in
    certain administrative functions such as consumer credit,
    advertising and website technology.

The commercial customer base is divided into several channels:
    corporate office space, educational institutions, hospitality
    facilities, retail space, public space, government and health
    care facilities. Different purchase decision makers and
    decision-making processes exist for each channel. In addition,
    the Company produces and sells broadloom carpet and carpet tile
    under the brand names “Bigelow
    Commercial

®

,”

    Lees, Durkan, “Karastan
    Contract

®

,”

    and Merit.

The Company’s sales forces are generally organized based on
    product type and sales channels in order to best serve each type
    of customer. Product delivery to dealers is done predominantly
    on Mohawk trucks operating from strategically positioned
    warehouses/cross-docks that receive inbound product directly
    from the source of manufacture.

Dal-Tile
    Segment

The Dal-Tile segment designs, manufactures, distributes and
    markets a broad line of ceramic tile, porcelain tile and natural
    stone products. Products are distributed through separate
    distribution channels consisting of retailers, contractors,
    commercial users, independent distributors and home centers. The
    business is organized to address the specific customer needs of
    each distribution channel, and dedicated sales forces support
    the various channels.

The Company serves as a “one-stop” source that
    provides customers with one of the ceramic tile industry’s
    broadest product lines — a complete selection of
    glazed floor tile, glazed wall tile, glazed and unglazed ceramic
    mosaic tile, porcelain tile, quarry tile and stone products, as
    well as allied products. In addition to products manufactured by
    the Company’s ceramic tile business, the Company also
    sources products from other manufacturers to enhance its product
    offering.

The Company has two of the leading brand names in the
    U.S. ceramic tile industry— Dal-Tile and American
    Olean. The Dal-Tile and American Olean brand names date back
    over 50 years and are well recognized in the industry. Both
    of these brands are supported by a fully integrated marketing
    program, displays, merchandising (sample boards and chip
    chests), literature/catalogs and an internet website.

A network of sales service centers distributes primarily the
    Dal-Tile brand product with a fully integrated marketing
    program, emphasizing a focus on quality and fashion serving
    customers in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. The service
    centers provide distribution points for customer

pick-up,

local delivery and showrooms to assist customers. The broad
    product offering satisfies the needs of its residential and
    commercial customers.

The independent distributor channel offers a distinct product
    line under the American Olean brand. Currently, the American
    Olean brand is distributed through independent distributors and
    sales service centers that service a variety of residential and
    commercial customers. The Company is focused on sales growth
    opportunities through innovative products and programs in both
    the residential and commercial channels.

The Company has four regional distribution centers in the
    Dal-Tile operations and shares two distributions centers with
    other segments. These centers help deliver high-quality customer
    service by focusing on shorter lead times, increased order fill
    rates and improved on-time deliveries to customers.



Unilin
    Segment

The Unilin segment designs, manufactures, licenses, distributes
    and markets laminate and hardwood flooring in Europe and the
    U.S. It also designs and manufactures roofing systems,
    insulation panels and other wood products in Europe. Products
    are distributed through separate distribution channels
    consisting of retailers, independent distributors and home
    centers. Unilin U.S. operations also manufacture Mohawk
    branded laminate and hardwood flooring which sells through the
    Mohawk channel. The majority of Unilin’s laminate sales,
    both in the U.S. and Europe, are for residential
    replacement. The business is organized to address the specific
    customer needs of each distribution channel.

In the U.S., the Unilin operations have three regional
    distribution centers for laminate and wood products. These
    distribution centers help deliver high-quality customer service
    and also enhance the Company’s ability to plan and schedule
    production and manage inventory requirements.

In Europe, the Unilin operations distribute products directly
    from manufacturing facilities. This integration with
    manufacturing sites allows for quick responses to customer needs
    and high inventory turns.

The Unilin segment markets and sells laminate and hardwood
    flooring products under the Quick-Step, Columbia Flooring,
    Century Flooring, and Universal Flooring brands through
    retailers, independent distributors and home centers. In
    addition, Unilin also sells laminate and hardwood flooring
    products under private label. The Company believes Quick-Step is
    one of the leading brand names in the U.S. and European
    flooring industry.

Advertising
    and Promotion

The Company promotes its brands through advertising in
    television, print, social and internet media as well as in the
    form of cooperative advertising, point-of-sale displays,
    advertising and sponsorship of a cycling team, and marketing
    literature provided to assist in marketing various flooring
    styles. The Company also continues to rely on the substantial
    brand name recognition of its product lines. The cost of
    producing display samples, a significant promotional expense, is
    partially offset by sales of samples.

Manufacturing
    and Operations

Mohawk
    Segment

The Company’s manufacturing operations are vertically
    integrated and include the extrusion of resin and post-consumer
    plastics into polypropylene, polyester, nylon and triexta fiber,
    yarn processing, backing manufacturing, tufting, weaving,
    dyeing, coating and finishing. Over the past three years, the
    Mohawk Segment has incurred capital expenditures that have
    helped increase manufacturing efficiency and improve overall
    cost competitiveness.

Dal-Tile
    Segment

The Company believes that its manufacturing organization offers
    competitive advantages due to its ability to manufacture a
    differentiated product line consisting of one of the
    industry’s broadest product offerings of colors, textures
    and finishes, as well as the industry’s largest offering of
    trim and angle pieces and its ability to utilize the
    industry’s newest technology. In addition, Dal-Tile also
    imports or sources a portion of its product to supplement its
    product offerings. Over the past three years, the Dal-Tile
    segment has invested in capital expenditures, principally in
    state-of-the-art equipment, to increase manufacturing capacity,
    improve efficiency and develop new capabilities.

Unilin
    Segment

The Company’s laminate flooring manufacturing operations
    are vertically integrated, both in the U.S. and in Europe,
    and include high-density fiberboard (“HDF”)
    production, paper impregnation, short-cycle pressing, cutting
    and milling. The European operations also include resin
    production. Unilin has state-of-the-art equipment that results
    in competitive manufacturing in terms of cost and flexibility.
    Most of the equipment for



the production of laminate flooring in Belgium and North
    Carolina is relatively new. In addition, Unilin has significant
    manufacturing capability for both engineered and prefinished
    solid wood flooring for the U.S. and European markets. Over
    the past three years, the Unilin segment has invested in capital
    expenditures, principally in new plants and state-of-the-art
    equipment to increase manufacturing capacity, improve efficiency
    and develop new capabilities.

The manufacturing facilities for other activities in the Unilin
    business (roofing systems, insulation panels and other wood
    products) are all configured for cost-efficient manufacturing
    and production flexibility and are competitive in the European
    market.

Raw
    Materials and Suppliers

Mohawk
    Segment

The principal raw materials the carpet and rug business uses are
    nylon, polypropylene, triexta, polyester, wool, synthetic
    backing materials, latex and various dyes and chemicals. Major
    raw materials used in the Company’s manufacturing process
    are available from independent sources and the Company obtains
    most of its externally purchased fibers and resins principally
    from four major suppliers. Although temporary disruptions of
    supply of carpet raw materials were experienced in 2005, the
    carpet and rug business has not experienced significant
    shortages of raw materials in recent years. The Company believes
    that there is an adequate supply of all grades of resin and
    fiber, which are readily available.

Dal-Tile
    Segment

In the ceramic tile business, the Company manufactures tile
    primarily from clay, talc, nepheline syenite and glazes. The
    Company has entered into a long-term supply agreement for most
    of its talc requirements. The Company has long-term clay mining
    rights in Kentucky and Mississippi that satisfy nearly all of
    its clay requirements for producing unglazed quarry tile. The
    Company purchases a number of different grades of clay for the
    manufacture of its non-quarry tile. The Company believes that
    there is an adequate supply of all grades of clay and that all
    are readily available from a number of independent sources. The
    Company has two suppliers for its nepheline syenite
    requirements. If these suppliers were unable to satisfy the
    requirements, the Company believes that alternative supply
    arrangements would be available. Glazes are used on a
    significant percentage of manufactured tiles. Glazes consist of
    frit (ground glass), zircon, stains and other materials, with
    frit being the largest ingredient. The Company manufactures
    approximately 66% of its frit requirements.

Unilin
    Segment

The principal raw materials used in producing boards, laminate
    and hardwood flooring are wood, paper, resins, coatings and
    stains. Wood supply is a very fragmented market in Europe. The
    Company has long-standing relationships with numerous suppliers.
    These suppliers provide a wide variety of wood species, varying
    from fresh round wood to several kinds of by-products of
    sawmills and used wood recycled specifically for chipboard
    production, giving the Company a cost-effective and secure
    supply of raw material. In the U.S., the Company has a long-term
    contract with a contiguously located lumber company that
    supplies most of its total needs for HDF board production. The
    supply of various species of hardwoods and hardwood veneers used
    in the production of solid wood and engineered flooring is both
    localized and global.

Major manufacturers supply the papers required in the laminate
    flooring business in both Europe and the U.S. The Company
    processes most of the paper impregnation internally in its
    laminate flooring facilities in Europe and the U.S. In
    Europe, the resins for paper impregnation are manufactured by
    the Company, which permits greater control over the laminate
    flooring manufacturing process, enabling the Company to produce
    higher-quality products. The Company buys the balance of its
    resin requirements from a number of companies. The Company
    believes there are ample sources of supply located within a
    reasonable distance of Unilin’s facilities.



Competition

The principal methods of competition within the floor covering
    industry generally are service, style, quality, price, product
    innovation and technology. In each of the markets, price
    competition and market coverage are particularly important
    because there is limited differentiation among competing product
    lines. The Company’s investments in manufacturing
    equipment, computer systems and distribution systems, as well as
    the Company’s marketing strategy, contribute to its ability
    to compete primarily on the basis of performance, quality, style
    and service, rather than just price.

Mohawk
    Segment

The carpet and rug industry is highly competitive. Based on
    industry publications, the top 5 North American carpet and rug
    manufacturers (including their North American and foreign
    divisions) in 2008 had worldwide carpet and rug sales in excess
    of $8 billion of the over $11 billion market. The
    Company believes it is the second largest producer of carpets
    and rugs (in terms of sales dollars) in the world based on its
    2008 sales.

Dal-Tile
    Segment

While the ceramic tile industry is more fragmented, the Company
    believes it is substantially larger than the next largest
    competitor and that it is the only significant manufacturer with
    its own North American distribution system. The Company
    estimates that over 100 tile manufacturers, more than half of
    which are based outside the U.S., compete for sales of ceramic
    tile to customers located in the U.S. Although the
    U.S. ceramic tile industry is highly fragmented at both the
    manufacturing and distribution levels, the Company believes it
    is one of the largest manufacturers, distributors and marketers
    of ceramic tile in the U.S. and the world.

Unilin
    Segment

The Company believes it has a competitive advantage in the
    laminate flooring channel as a result of Unilin’s industry
    leading design and patented technologies, which allows the
    Company to distinguish its laminate and hardwood flooring
    products in the areas of finish, quality, installation and
    assembly. The Company faces competition in the laminate and
    hardwood flooring channel from a large number of domestic and
    foreign manufacturers. The Company believes it is one of the
    largest manufacturers, distributors and marketers of laminate
    flooring in the world, with a focus on high-end products. In the
    U.S., the Company has vertically-integrated operations that
    produce both high density fiberboard and laminate flooring. The
    Company estimates that there are over 100 wood flooring
    manufacturers located in various countries. The Company believes
    it is one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of
    hardwood flooring in the U.S.

Patents
    and Trademarks

Intellectual property is important to the Company’s
    business, and the Company relies on a combination of patent,
    copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to protect its

    UNICLIC family, as well as the snap, pretension, clearance and
    beveled edge patent families, which protects Unilin’s
    interlocking laminate flooring panel technology. The patents in
    the UNICLIC family are not expected to expire until 2017.



Sales
    Terms and Major Customers

The Company’s sales terms are the same as those generally
    available throughout the industry. The Company generally permits
    its customers to return carpet, rug, ceramic tile, wood, vinyl
    and laminate flooring purchased from it within specified time
    periods from the date of sale, if the customer is not satisfied
    with the quality of the product.

During 2009, no single customer accounted for more than 5% of
    total net sales, and the top ten customers accounted for less
    than 20% of the Company’s sales. The Company believes the
    loss of one major customer would not have a material adverse
    effect on its business.

Employees

As of December 31, 2009, the Company employed approximately
    27,400 persons consisting of approximately 21,500 in the
    U.S., approximately 3,100 in Mexico, approximately 2,100 in
    Europe, approximately 600 in Malaysia and approximately 100 in
    Canada. The majority of the Company’s European and Mexican
    manufacturing employees are members of unions. Most of the
    Company’s U.S. employees are not a party to any
    collective bargaining agreement. Additionally, the Company has
    not experienced any strikes or work stoppages in the U.S.,
    Mexico or Malaysia for over 20 years. The Company believes
    that its relations with its employees are good.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Certain
    Factors affecting the Company’s Performance

In addition to the other information provided in this

Form 10-K,

the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating
    an investment in shares of Common Stock.

If any of the events described in these risks were to occur, it
    could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    business, financial condition and results of operations.

The
    floor covering industry is sensitive to changes in general
    economic conditions, such as consumer confidence and income,
    corporate and government spending, interest rate levels,
    availability of credit and demand for housing. The current
    downturn in the U.S. and global economies, along with the
    residential and commercial markets in such economies, has
    negatively impacted the floor covering industry and the
    Company’s business. These difficult economic conditions may
    continue or deteriorate in the foreseeable future. Further,
    significant or prolonged declines in such economies or in
    spending for replacement floor covering products or new
    construction activity could have a material adverse effect on
    the Company’s business.

The floor covering industry in which the Company participates is
    highly dependent on general economic conditions, such as
    consumer confidence and income, corporate and government
    spending, interest rate levels, availability of credit and
    demand for housing. The Company derives a majority of the
    Company’s sales from



the replacement segment of the market. Therefore, economic
    changes that result in a significant or prolonged decline in
    spending for remodeling and replacement activities could have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s business and
    results of operations.

The floor covering industry is highly dependent on residential
    and commercial construction activity, including new
    construction, which is cyclical in nature and currently in a
    downturn. The current downturn in the U.S. and global
    economies, along with the housing markets in such economies, has
    negatively impacted the floor covering industry and the
    Company’s business. Although the impact of a decline in new
    construction activity is typically accompanied by an increase in
    remodeling and replacement activity, these activities have also
    lagged during the current downturn. The difficult economic
    conditions may continue or deteriorate in the foreseeable
    future. A significant or prolonged decline in residential or
    commercial construction activity could have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s business and results of operations.

Uncertainty
    in the credit market or downturns in the global economy and the
    Company’s business could affect the Company’s overall
    availability and cost of credit.

Uncertainty in the credit markets could affect the overall
    availability and cost of credit. The impact of the current
    situation on our ability to obtain financing, including any
    financing necessary to refinance our existing senior unsecured
    notes, in the future, and the cost and terms of it, is
    uncertain. These and other economic factors could have a
    material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our
    financial condition and operating results. Further, these
    generally negative economic and business conditions may factor
    into our periodic credit ratings assessment by either or both
    Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Standard &
    Poor’s Ratings Services. The rating agency’s
    evaluation is based on a number of factors, which include scale
    and diversification, brand strength, profitability, leverage,
    liquidity and interest coverage. During 2009, our senior
    unsecured notes were downgraded by the rating agencies, which
    will increase the Company’s interest expense by
    approximately $10.5 million per year and could adversely
    affect the cost of and ability to obtain additional credit in
    the future. Additional downgrades in the Company’s credit
    ratings could further increase the cost of its existing credit
    and adversely affect the cost of and ability to obtain
    additional credit in the future, and the Company can provide no
    assurances that additional downgrades will not occur.
    Additionally, our credit facilities require us to meet certain
    affirmative and negative covenants that impose restrictions on
    our financial and business operations, including limitations
    relating to debt, investments, asset dispositions and changes in
    the nature of our business. We are also required to maintain a
    fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.1 to 1.0 during any period that
    the unutilized amount available under the ABL Facility is less
    than 15% of the amount available under the ABL Facility. Failure
    to comply with these covenants could materially and adversely
    affect our ability to finance our operations or capital needs
    and to engage in other activities that may be in our best
    interest.

The
    Company faces intense competition in the flooring industry,
    which could decrease demand for the Company’s products or
    force it to lower prices, which could have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s profitability.

The floor covering industry is highly competitive. The Company
    faces competition from a number of manufacturers and independent
    distributors. Some of the Company’s competitors are larger
    and have greater resources and access to capital than the
    Company does. Maintaining the Company’s competitive
    position may require substantial investments in the
    Company’s product development efforts, manufacturing
    facilities, distribution network and sales and marketing
    activities. Competitive pressures may also result in decreased
    demand for the Company’s products or force the Company to
    lower prices. Any of these factors or others may impact demand
    which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    business.

The
    Company may be unable to obtain raw materials on a timely basis,
    which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    business.

The principal raw materials used in the Company’s
    manufacturing operations include nylon and polyester and
    polypropylene and triexta resins and fibers, which are used
    primarily in the Company’s carpet and rugs business; talc,
    clay, nepheline syenite and various glazes, including frit
    (ground glass), zircon and stains, which



are used exclusively in the Company’s ceramic tile
    business; wood, paper, and resins which are used primarily in
    the Company’s laminate flooring business; and other
    materials. For certain of such raw materials, the Company is
    dependent on one or a small number of suppliers. An adverse
    change in the Company’s relationship with such a supplier,
    the financial condition of such a supplier or such
    supplier’s ability to manufacture or deliver such raw
    materials to the Company could lead to an interruption of
    supply. An extended interruption in the supply of these or other
    raw materials used in the Company’s business or in the
    supply of suitable substitute materials would disrupt the
    Company’s operations, which could have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s business.

In
    periods of rising costs, the Company may be unable to pass raw
    materials and fuel-related cost increases on to its customers,
    which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    profitability.

The prices of raw materials and fuel-related costs vary with
    market conditions. Although the Company generally attempts to
    pass on increases in raw material and fuel-related costs to its
    customers, the Company’s ability to do so is dependent upon
    the rate and magnitude of any increase, competitive pressures
    and market conditions for the Company’s products. There
    have been in the past, and may be in the future, periods of time
    during which increases in these costs cannot be recovered.
    During such periods of time, the Company’s profitability
    may be materially adversely affected.

Fluctuations
    in currency exchange rates may impact the Company’s
    financial condition and results of operations and may affect the
    comparability of results between the Company’s financial
    periods.

The results of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries reported
    in the local currency are translated into U.S. dollars for
    balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect as of the
    balance sheet date and for the statement of operations accounts
    using, principally, the Company’s average rates during the
    period. The exchange rates between some of these currencies and
    the U.S. dollar in recent years have fluctuated
    significantly and may continue to do so in the future. The
    Company may not be able to manage effectively the Company’s
    currency translation risks and volatility in currency exchange
    rates may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements and affect comparability of
    the Company’s results between financial periods.

The
    Company may experience certain risks associated with
    acquisitions.

The Company has typically grown its business through
    acquisitions. Growth through acquisitions involves risks, many
    of which may continue to affect the Company after the
    acquisition. The Company cannot give assurance that an acquired
    company will achieve the levels of revenue, profitability and
    production that the Company expects. The combination of an
    acquired company’s business with the Company’s
    existing businesses involves risks. The Company cannot be
    assured that reported earnings will meet expectations because of
    goodwill and intangible asset impairment, increased interest
    costs and issuance of additional securities or incurrence of
    debt. The Company may also face challenges in consolidating
    functions, integrating the Company’s organizations,
    procedures, operations and product lines in a timely and
    efficient manner and retaining key personnel. These challenges
    may result in:

•

maintaining executive offices in different locations;

•

manufacturing and selling different types of products through
    different distribution channels;

•

conducting business from various locations;

•

maintaining different operating systems and software on
    different computer hardware; and

•

providing different employment and compensation arrangements for
    employees.

The diversion of management attention and any difficulties
    encountered in the transition and integration process could have
    a material adverse effect on the Company’s revenues, level
    of expenses and operating results.



Failure to successfully manage and integrate an acquisition with
    the Company’s existing operations could lead to the
    potential loss of customers of the acquired business, the
    potential loss of employees who may be vital to the new
    operations, the potential loss of business opportunities or
    other adverse consequences that could affect the Company’s
    financial condition and results of operations. Even if
    integration occurs successfully, failure of the acquisition to
    achieve levels of anticipated sales growth, profitability or
    productivity or otherwise perform as expected, may adversely
    impact the Company’s financial condition and results of
    operations.

A
    failure to identify suitable acquisition candidates and to
    complete acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on
    the Company’s business.

As part of the Company’s business strategy, the Company
    intends to continue to pursue acquisitions of complementary
    businesses. Although the Company regularly evaluates acquisition
    opportunities, the Company may not be able successfully to
    identify suitable acquisition candidates; to obtain sufficient
    financing on acceptable terms to fund acquisitions; to complete
    acquisitions and integrate acquired businesses with the
    Company’s existing businesses; or to manage profitably
    acquired businesses.

The
    Company has been, and in the future may be, subject to claims
    and liabilities under environmental, health and safety laws and
    regulations, which could be significant.

The Company’s operations are subject to various
    environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including
    those governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, and the
    use, storage, treatment and disposal of materials and finished
    product. The applicable requirements under these laws are
    subject to amendment, to the imposition of new or additional
    requirements and to changing interpretations of agencies or
    courts. The Company could incur material expenditures to comply
    with new or existing regulations, including fines and penalties.

The nature of the Company’s operations, including the
    potential discovery of presently unknown environmental
    conditions, exposes it to the risk of claims under
    environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. The
    Company could incur material costs or liabilities in connection
    with such claims.

We may
    be exposed to litigation, claims and other legal proceedings in
    the ordinary course of business relating to our products, which
    could affect our results of operations and financial
    condition.

In the ordinary course of our business, we are subject to a
    variety of product-related claims, lawsuits and legal
    proceedings, including those relating to product liability,
    product warranty, product recall, personal injury, and other
    matters that are inherently subject to many uncertainties
    regarding the possibility of a loss to us. Such matters could
    have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
    operations and financial condition if we are unable to
    successfully defend against or resolve these matters or if our
    insurance coverage is insufficient to satisfy any judgments
    against us or settlements relating to these matters. Although we
    have product liability insurance, our policies may not provide
    coverage for certain claims against us or may not be sufficient
    to cover all possible liabilities. Moreover, adverse publicity
    arising from claims made against us, even if the claims were not
    successful, could adversely affect our reputation or the
    reputation and sales of our products.

Regulatory
    decisions could cause the prices of fuel and energy to
    fluctuate, and any price increases that result may reduce
    results of operations.

The Company’s manufacturing operations and shipping needs
    require high inputs of energy, including the use of substantial
    amounts of electricity, natural gas, and petroleum based
    products, which are subject to price fluctuations due to changes
    in supply and demand and are also affected by local, national
    and international regulatory decisions. Significant increases in
    the cost of these commodities, either as a result of changes in
    market prices due to regulatory decisions or as a result of
    additional costs in order to comply with regulatory decisions,
    may have adverse effects on the Company’s results of
    operations and cash flows if the Company is unable to pass such
    increases to its customers in a timely manner.



Changes
    in laws or in the business, political and regulatory
    environments in which the Company operates could have a material
    adverse effect on the Company’s business.

The Company’s manufacturing facilities in Mexico and Europe
    represent a significant portion of the Company’s capacity
    for ceramic tile and laminate flooring, respectively, and the
    Company’s European operations represent a significant
    source of the Company’s revenues and profits. Accordingly,
    an event that has a material adverse impact on either of these
    operations or that changes the current tax treatment of the
    results thereof could have a material adverse effect on the
    Company. The business, regulatory and political environments in
    Mexico and Europe differ from those in the U.S., and the
    Company’s Mexican and European operations are exposed to
    legal, currency, tax, political, and economic risks specific to
    the countries in which they occur, particularly with respect to
    labor regulations, which tend to be more stringent in Europe
    and, to a lesser extent, Mexico. The Company cannot assure
    investors that the Company will succeed in developing and
    implementing policies and strategies to counter the foregoing
    factors effectively in each location where the Company does
    business and therefore that the foregoing factors will not have
    a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations or
    upon the Company’s financial condition and results of
    operations.

If the
    Company is unable to protect the Company’s intellectual
    property rights, particularly with respect to the Company’s
    patented laminate flooring technology and the Company’s
    registered trademarks, the Company’s business and prospects
    could be harmed.

The future success and competitive position of certain of the
    Company’s businesses, particularly the Company’s
    laminate flooring business, depend in part upon the
    Company’s ability to obtain and maintain proprietary
    technology used in the Company’s principal product
    families. The Company relies, in part, on the patent, trade
    secret and trademark laws of the U.S. and countries in
    Europe, as well as confidentiality agreements with some of the
    Company’s employees, to protect that technology.

The Company has obtained a number of patents relating to the
    Company’s products and associated methods and has filed
    applications for additional patents, including the
    UNICLIC

®

family of patents, which protects Unilin’s interlocking
    laminate flooring panel technology. The Company cannot assure
    investors that any patents owned by or issued to it will provide
    the Company with competitive advantages, that third parties will
    not challenge these patents, or that the Company’s pending
    patent applications will be approved. In addition, patent
    filings by third parties, whether made before or after the date
    of the Company’s filings, could render the Company’s
    intellectual property less valuable.

Furthermore, despite the Company’s efforts, the Company may
    be unable to prevent competitors

and/or

third
    parties from using the Company’s technology without the
    Company’s authorization, independently developing
    technology that is similar to that of the Company or designing
    around the Company’s patents. The use of the Company’s
    technology or similar technology by others could reduce or
    eliminate any competitive advantage the Company has developed,
    cause the Company to lose sales or otherwise harm the
    Company’s business. In addition, if the Company does not
    obtain sufficient protection for the Company’s intellectual
    property, the Company’s competitiveness in the markets it
    serves could be significantly impaired, which would limit the
    Company’s growth and future revenue.

The Company has obtained and applied for numerous U.S. and
    Foreign Service marks and trademark registrations and will
    continue to evaluate the registration of additional service
    marks and trademarks, as appropriate. The Company cannot
    guarantee that any of the Company’s pending or future
    applications will be approved by the applicable governmental
    authorities. Moreover, even if such applications are approved,
    third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge the
    registrations. A failure to obtain trademark registrations in
    the U.S. and in other countries could limit the
    Company’s ability to protect the Company’s trademarks
    and impede the Company’s marketing efforts in those
    jurisdictions.

The Company generally requires third parties with access to the
    Company’s trade secrets to agree to keep such information
    confidential. While such measures are intended to protect the
    Company’s trade secrets, there can be no assurance that
    these agreements will not be breached, that the Company will
    have adequate remedies for any breach or that the Company’s
    confidential and proprietary information and technology will not
    be independently developed by or become otherwise known to third
    parties. In any of these circumstances,



the Company’s competitiveness could be significantly
    impaired, which would limit the Company’s growth and future
    revenue.

Companies
    may claim that the Company infringed their intellectual property
    or proprietary rights, which could cause it to incur significant
    expenses or prevent it from selling the Company’s
    products.

In the past, companies have claimed that certain technologies
    incorporated in the Company’s products infringe their
    patent rights. There can be no assurance that the Company will
    not receive notices in the future from parties asserting that
    the Company’s products infringe, or may infringe, those
    parties’ intellectual property rights. The Company cannot
    be certain that the Company’s products do not and will not
    infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of
    others. Historically, patent applications in the U.S. and
    some foreign countries have not been publicly disclosed until
    the patent is issued (or, in some recent cases, until
    18 months following submission), and the Company may not be
    aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to the
    Company’s products or processes. If patents are later
    issued on these applications, the Company may be liable for
    infringement.

Furthermore, the Company may initiate claims or litigation
    against parties for infringement of the Company’s
    proprietary rights or to establish the invalidity,
    noninfringement, or unenforceability of the proprietary rights
    of others. Likewise, the Company may have similar claims brought
    against it by competitors. Litigation, either as plaintiff or
    defendant, could result in significant expense to the Company
    and divert the efforts of the Company’s technical and
    management personnel from operations, whether or not such
    litigation is resolved in the Company’s favor. In the event
    of an adverse ruling in any such litigation, the Company might
    be required to pay substantial damages (including punitive
    damages and attorney’s fees), discontinue the use and sale
    of infringing products, expend significant resources to develop
    non-infringing technology or obtain licenses to infringing
    technology. There can be no assurance that licenses to disputed
    technology or intellectual property rights would be available on
    reasonable commercial terms, if at all. In the event of a
    successful claim against the Company along with failure to
    develop or license a substitute technology, the Company’s
    business, financial condition and results of operations would be
    materially and adversely affected.

The
    Company is subject to changing regulation of corporate
    governance and public disclosure that have increased both costs
    and the risk of noncompliance.

The Company’s stock is publicly traded. As a result, the
    Company is subject to the rules and regulations of federal and
    state agencies and financial market exchange entities charged
    with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies
    whose securities are publicly traded. These entities, including
    the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC and NYSE,
    frequently issue new requirements and regulations, such as the
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Company’s efforts to comply
    with the regulations and interpretations have resulted in, and
    are likely to continue to result in, increased general and
    administrative costs and diversion of management’s time and
    attention from revenue generating activities to compliance
    activities.

Declines
    in the Company’s business conditions may result in an
    impairment of the Company’s tangible and intangible assets
    which could result in a material non-cash charge.

A decrease in the Company’s market capitalization,
    including a short-term decline in stock price, or a negative
    long-term performance outlook, could result in an impairment of
    its tangible and intangible assets which results when the
    carrying value of the Company’s assets exceed their fair
    value. In 2008, the Company’s goodwill and other intangible
    assets suffered an impairment and additional impairment charges
    could occur in future periods.

Forward-Looking
    Information

Certain of the statements in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

particularly those anticipating future performance, business
    prospects, growth and operating strategies, proposed
    acquisitions, and similar matters, and those that include the
    words “believes,” “anticipates,”
    “forecast,” “estimates” or similar
    expressions



constitute “forward-looking statements” within the
    meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
    amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
    1934, as amended. For those statements, Mohawk claims the
    protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements
    contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of

    statements will be accurate because they are based on many
    assumptions, which involve risks and uncertainties. The
    following important factors could cause future results to
    differ: changes in industry conditions; competition; raw
    material prices; energy costs; timing and level of capital
    expenditures; integration of acquisitions; legislative
    enactments and regulatory decisions; introduction of new
    products; rationalization of operations; litigation; and other
    risks identified in Mohawk’s SEC reports and public
    announcements.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

The Company is involved in litigation from time to time in the
    regular course of its business. Except as noted below there are
    no material legal proceedings pending or known by the Company to
    be contemplated to which the Company is a party or to which any
    of its property is subject.

In Shirley Williams et al.

v. Mohawk Industries, Inc.,
    four plaintiffs filed a putative class action lawsuit in January
    2004 in the United States District Court for the Northern
    District of Georgia (Rome Division), alleging that they are
    former and current employees of the Company and that the actions
    and conduct of the Company, including the employment of persons
    who are not authorized to work in the United States, have
    damaged them and the other members of the putative class by
    suppressing the wages of the Company’s hourly employees in
    Georgia. The plaintiffs seek a variety of relief, including
    (a) treble damages; (b) return of any allegedly
    unlawful profits; and (c) attorney’s fees and costs of
    litigation. In February 2004, the Company filed a Motion to
    Dismiss the Complaint, which was denied by the District Court in
    April 2004. Following appellate review of this decision, the
    case was returned to the District Court for further proceedings.
    On December 18, 2007, the plaintiffs filed a motion for
    class certification. On March 3, 2008, the District Court
    denied the plaintiffs motion for class certification. The
    plaintiffs then appealed the decision to the United States Court
    of Appeals



for the 11th Circuit on March 17, 2008. On
    May 28, 2009, the Court of Appeals issued an order
    reversing the District Court’s decision and remanding the
    case back to the District Court for further proceedings on the
    class certification issue. Discovery has been stayed at the
    District Court since the appeal. In August 2009, the Company
    filed a petition for certiorari with the United States Supreme
    Court, which was denied in November 2009. The Company will
    continue to vigorously defend itself against this action.

In Collins & Aikman Floorcoverings, Inc., et.
    al. v. Interface, Inc., United States District Court for
    the Northern District of Georgia (Rome Division), Mohawk
    Industries, Inc. joined Collins & Aikman
    Floorcoverings, Inc. (“CAF”) and Shaw Industries
    Group, Inc. (“Shaw”) in suing Interface, Inc.
    (“Interface”) for declaratory judgments that United
    States Patent 6,908,656 (the “Patent”), assigned to
    Interface and relating to certain styles of carpet tiles, is not
    infringed and is invalid. Also in June 2005, in Interface, Inc.,
    et al. v. Mohawk Industries, Inc., et. al. United States
    District Court for the Northern District of Georgia (Atlanta
    Division), Interface sued Mohawk Industries, Inc., Mohawk Carpet
    Corporation, and Mohawk Commercial, Inc. for allegedly
    infringing the Patent. Interface brought similar suits against
    entities affiliated with CAF and Shaw. Interface sought monetary
    damages as well as injunctive relief. The cases were
    consolidated in the United States District Court for the
    Northern District of Georgia (Rome Division). During the second
    quarter of 2009, the Company and Interface reached a settlement
    and the pending cases were dismissed by the District Court on
    June 26, 2009.

The Company believes that adequate provisions for resolution of
    all contingencies, claims and pending litigation have been made
    for probable losses and that the ultimate outcome of these
    actions will not have a material adverse effect on its financial
    condition but could have a material adverse effect on its
    results of operations in a given quarter or year.

Environmental
    Matters

The Company is subject to various federal, state, local and
    foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations,
    including those governing air emissions, wastewater discharges,
    the use, storage, treatment and disposal of solid and hazardous
    materials, and the cleanup of contamination associated
    therewith. Because of the nature of the Company’s business,
    the Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs
    relating to compliance with such laws and regulations. The
    Company is involved in various proceedings relating to
    environmental matters and is currently engaged in environmental
    investigation, remediation and post-closure care programs at
    certain sites. The Company has provided accruals for such
    activities that it has determined to be both probable and
    reasonably estimable. The Company does not expect that the
    ultimate liability with respect to such activities will have a
    material adverse effect on its operations, but may have an
    effect on the results of operations for a given quarter or
    annual period.

Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Overview

The Company is a leading producer of floor covering products for
    residential and commercial applications in the U.S. and
    Europe with net sales in 2009 of $5.3 billion. The Company
    is the second largest carpet and rug manufacturer in the U.S., a
    leading manufacturer, marketer and distributor of ceramic tile,
    natural stone and hardwood flooring in the U.S. and a
    leading producer of laminate flooring in the U.S. and
    Europe. In 2008, the primary categories of the U.S. floor
    covering industry, based on sales dollars, were carpet and rug
    (58%), ceramic tile (11%), resilient and rubber (11%), hardwood
    (10%), stone (5%) and laminate (5%).

The Company believes that the U.S. floor covering industry
    has experienced declining demand beginning in the fourth quarter
    of 2006 which worsened considerably during the later parts of
    2008 and continued to decline throughout 2009. The global
    economy continues in the most significant downturn in recent
    history. Overall economic conditions and consumer sentiment have
    remained challenging, which has intensified the pressure on the
    demand for housing and flooring products. Although the Company
    cannot determine with certainty as to when market conditions
    will stabilize and begin to improve, the Company believes it is
    well-positioned in the long-term as the industry improves. The
    Company continues to monitor expenses based on current industry
    conditions and will continue to adjust as required.

The Company has three reporting segments, the Mohawk segment,
    the Dal-Tile segment and the Unilin segment. The Mohawk segment
    manufactures, markets and distributes its product lines
    primarily in North America, which include carpet, rugs, pad,
    ceramic tile, hardwood, resilient and laminate, through its
    network of regional distribution centers and satellite
    warehouses using company-operated trucks, common carrier or rail
    transportation. The segment product lines are sold through
    various selling channels, which include floor covering
    retailers, home centers, mass merchandisers, department stores,
    independent distributors, commercial dealers and commercial end
    users. The Dal-Tile segment manufactures, markets and
    distributes its product lines primarily in North America, which
    include ceramic tile, porcelain tile and stone products, through
    its network of regional distribution centers and
    company-operated sales service centers using company-operated
    trucks, common carriers or rail transportation. The segment
    product lines are purchased by floor covering retailers, home
    centers, independent distributors, tile specialty dealers, tile
    contractors, and commercial end users. The Unilin segment
    manufactures, markets and distributes its product lines
    primarily in North America and Europe, which include laminate
    flooring, wood flooring, roofing systems and other wood products
    through various selling channels, which include retailers, home
    centers and independent distributors.

The Company reported net loss of $5.5 million or loss per
    share of $0.08 for 2009, compared to net loss of
    $1,458.2 million or loss per share of $21.32 for 2008. The
    net loss for 2008 included a $1,543.4 million impairment
    charge to reduce the carrying amount of the Company’s
    goodwill and intangible assets and a charge of $253 million
    to record a tax valuation allowance against the carrying amount
    of a deferred tax asset recognized in the fourth quarter of
    2007. In addition, the change in EPS resulted from the impact of
    lower sales volumes, which the Company believes is attributable
    to continued weakness in the U.S. residential remodeling
    and new construction markets, commercial real estate market and
    European demand, the net effect of price and product mix and
    higher warranty requirements, partially offset by lower raw
    material, energy and selling general and administrative costs.
    During 2009, the Company recognized a higher trend of incidents
    related to the use of new technology in certain commercial
    carpet tiles and recorded a $121.2 million carpet sales
    allowance and a $12.4 million inventory write-off. The
    Company discontinued sales of these commercial carpet tiles and
    replaced it with an established technology. The amounts recorded
    reflect the Company’s best reasonable estimate but the
    actual amount of claims and related costs could vary from such
    estimates.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company generated
    $672.2 million of operating cash flow which it used to
    reduce debt by $103.6 million and build cash. As of
    December 31, 2009, the Company had



cash and cash equivalents of $531.5 million. In addition,
    the Company adjusted capital expenditures to align its
    manufacturing, distribution and selling infrastructure to market
    conditions.

Net
    sales

Net sales for 2009 were $5,344.0 million, reflecting a
    decrease of $1,482.3 million, or 21.7%, from the
    $6,826.3 million reported for 2008. The decrease was
    primarily driven by a decline in sales volumes of approximately
    $1,047 million due to the continued weakness in the
    U.S. residential remodeling and new construction markets,
    commercial real estate market and European demand, a decline of
    approximately $298 million due to unfavorable price and
    product mix as customers trade down to lower priced products, a
    decrease of approximately $81 million due to a net increase
    in warranty requirements described in the overview and a decline
    of approximately $56 million due to unfavorable foreign
    exchange rates and other.

Mohawk Segment

— Net sales decreased
    $771.4 million, or 21.3%, to $2,856.7 million in 2009
    compared to $3,628.2 million in 2008. The decrease was
    primarily driven by a decline in sales volumes of approximately
    $531 million due to the continued weakness in the
    U.S. residential remodeling and new construction markets
    and the declining commercial real estate market, a decline of
    approximately $151 million due to unfavorable price and
    product mix as customers trade down to lower priced products and
    a decrease of approximately $81 million due to a net
    increase in warranty requirements described above in the
    overview.

Dal-Tile Segment

— Net sales decreased
    $388.6 million, or 21.4%, to $1,426.8 million in 2009
    compared to $1,815.4 million in 2008. The decrease was
    primarily driven by a decline in sales volumes of approximately
    $301 million due to the continued weakness in the
    U.S. residential remodeling and new construction markets
    and the declining commercial real estate market, a decline of
    approximately $73 million due to unfavorable



price and product mix as customers trade down to lower priced
    products and a decline of approximately $15 million due to
    unfavorable foreign exchange rates.

Unilin Segment

— Net sales decreased
    $336.9 million, or 23.0%, to $1,128.3 million in 2009
    compared to $1,465.2 million in 2008. The decrease was
    driven by a decline in sales volumes of approximately
    $215 million due to the continued weakness in the
    U.S. residential remodeling and new construction markets
    and slowing European demand, a decline of approximately
    $74 million due to the net effect of price and product mix
    as customers trade down to lower priced products and a decline
    of approximately $48 million due to unfavorable foreign
    exchange rates.

Gross
    profit

Gross profit for 2009 was $1,232.2 million (23.1% of net
    sales) and represented a decrease of $505.5 million
    compared to gross profit of $1,737.8 million (25.5% of net
    sales) for 2008. Gross profit in 2009 was unfavorably impacted
    by approximately $315 million resulting from lower sales
    volume, a decline of approximately $185 million due to the
    net effect of price and product mix, a decline of approximately
    $89 million due to a net increase in warranty requirements
    described above in the overview, restructuring charges of
    approximately $28 million and the impact of unfavorable
    foreign exchange rates of approximately $9 million,
    partially offset by lower manufacturing costs of approximately
    $120 million. The decrease in gross profit percentage is
    primarily attributable to unfavorable price and product mix,
    increased warranty requirements and restructuring costs,
    partially offset by lower raw material and manufacturing costs

Selling,
    general and administrative expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2009 were
    $1,188.5 million (22.3% of net sales), reflecting a
    decrease of $130.0 million, or 9.9%, compared to
    $1,318.5 million (19.3% of net sales) for the prior year.
    The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses is
    primarily driven by lower sales and various cost savings
    initiatives implemented by the Company, partially offset by
    approximately $8 million of unfavorable foreign exchange
    rates and approximately $4 million for restructuring
    charges. The increase in selling general and administrative
    expenses as a percentage of net sales is primarily a result of a
    higher mix of fixed costs on lower net sales, and restructuring
    costs.

Operating
    income (loss)

Operating income for 2009 was $43.7 million (0.8% of net
    sales) reflecting an increase of $1,167.9 million compared
    to an operating loss of $1,124.1 million in 2008. The
    change was primarily driven by the recognition of an impairment
    of goodwill and other intangibles of approximately
    $1,543.4 million in 2008. In addition, operating income in
    the current period was impacted by a decline of approximately
    $315 million due to lower sales volumes, a decline of
    approximately $185 million due to unfavorable price and
    product mix, a decrease of approximately $89 million due to
    a net increase in warranty requirements described above in the
    overview and restructuring charges of approximately
    $32 million, partially offset by lower manufacturing and
    selling, general and administrative costs of approximately
    $244 million.

Mohawk Segment

— Operating loss was
    $126.0 million in 2009 reflecting a decrease of
    $90.2 million compared to operating loss of
    $216.2 million in 2008. The increase was primarily driven
    by the recognition of



an impairment of goodwill and other intangibles of approximately
    $276.8 million in 2008. In addition, operating income in
    the current period was impacted by a decline of approximately
    $133 million due to lower sales volumes, a decrease of
    approximately $89 million due to a net increase in warranty
    requirements and a decline of approximately $74 million due
    to unfavorable price and product mix and restructuring charges
    of approximately $7 million, partially offset by lower
    manufacturing and selling, general and administrative costs of
    approximately $116 million.

Dal-Tile Segment

— Operating income was
    $84.2 million (5.9% of segment net sales) in 2009
    reflecting an increase of $407.5 million compared to
    operating loss of $323.4 million for 2008. The change was
    primarily driven by the recognition of an impairment of goodwill
    and other intangibles of approximately $531.9 million in
    2008. In addition, operating income in the current period was
    impacted by a decline of approximately $108 million due to
    lower sales volumes, a decline of approximately $35 million
    due to unfavorable price and product mix and restructuring
    charges of approximately $12 million, partially offset by
    lower manufacturing and selling, general and administrative
    costs of approximately $23 million.

Unilin Segment

— Operating income was
    $106.0 million (9.4% of segment net sales) in 2009
    reflecting an increase of $670.9 million compared to
    operating loss of $564.9 million for 2008. The increase was
    primarily driven by the recognition of an impairment of goodwill
    and other intangibles of $734.7 million in 2008. In
    addition, operating income in the current period was impacted by
    a decline of approximately $76 million due to the net
    effect of price and product mix, a decline in sales volumes of
    approximately $74 million, restructuring charges of
    approximately $13 million and the impact of unfavorable
    foreign exchange rates of approximately $8 million,
    partially offset by lower raw material, manufacturing and
    selling, general and administrative costs of approximately
    $107 million.

Interest
    expense

Interest expense for 2009 was $127.0 million compared to
    $127.1 million in 2008. Interest expense in 2009 was
    directly impacted by higher interest rates on the Company’s
    notes and revolving credit facilities due to three credit rating
    downgrades in 2009, partially offset by lower average debt
    levels in the current year compared to 2008.

Income
    tax (benefit) expense

For 2009, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of
    $76.7 million on loss before taxes of $77.7 million as
    compared to income tax expense of $180.1 million on loss
    before taxes of $1,272.5 million for 2008. The change is
    principally due to the non-deductible 2008 goodwill impairment
    charge, the recognition of a $253 million valuation
    allowance against a deferred asset, and the geographic
    distribution of income (loss).

In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company moved the
    intellectual property and treasury operations of an indirectly
    owned European entity to a new office in another jurisdiction in
    Europe. The Company also indirectly owned a holding company in
    the new jurisdiction that provided certain treasury functions to
    Unilin, and the move allowed for the consolidation of the
    historical intellectual property and treasury operations to be
    combined with those of the holding company’s treasury
    operations in a single jurisdiction in order to integrate and
    streamline the operations, to facilitate international
    acquisitions and to improve tax and cost efficiencies. This
    restructuring resulted in a step up in the subsidiary’s
    taxable basis of its intellectual property. The step up relates
    primarily to intangible assets which will be amortized over
    10 years for tax purposes. During the fourth quarter of
    2007, the Company evaluated the evidence for recognition of the
    deferred tax asset created through the restructuring and
    determined that, based on the available evidence at the time,
    the deferred tax asset would more likely than not be realized.
    The deferred tax asset recognized as of December 31, 2007
    was approximately $245 million and the related income tax
    benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements was
    approximately $272 million.

During the third quarter of 2008, the Company reassessed the
    need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.
    Cash flows had decreased from that projected as of
    December 31, 2007, primarily due to the slowing worldwide
    economy and declining sales volume. The Company determined that,
    given the current



and expected economic conditions and the corresponding
    reductions in cash flows, its ability to realize the benefit of
    the deferred tax asset related to the transaction described
    above as well as tax losses generated in the same jurisdiction
    was not more likely than not. Accordingly the Company recorded a
    valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset in the amount
    of $253 million during the quarter ended September 27,
    2008.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2008, as Compared with Year Ended
    December 31, 2007

Net
    sales

Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008, were
    $6,826.3 million, reflecting a decrease of
    $759.7 million, or 10.0%, from the $7,586.0 million
    reported for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease
    was primarily driven by a decline in sales volumes of
    approximately $971 million due to the continued decline in
    the U.S. residential markets, softening commercial demand
    and slowing European demand, partially offset by a benefit of
    approximately $132 million due to the net effect of price
    increases and product mix, and a benefit of approximately
    $79 million due to favorable foreign exchange rates.

Mohawk Segment

— Net sales decreased
    $577.6 million, or 13.7%, to $3,628.2 million in 2008,
    compared to $4,205.7 million in 2007. The decrease was
    primarily driven by a decline in sales volumes of approximately
    $639 million due to the continued decline in the
    U.S. residential market and softening commercial demand,
    partially offset by a benefit of approximately $83 million
    due to the net effect of price increases and product mix.

Dal-Tile Segment

— Net sales decreased
    $122.4 million, or 6.3%, to $1,815.4 million in 2008,
    compared to $1,937.7 million reported in 2007. This
    decrease was primarily driven by a decline in sales volumes of
    approximately $146 million due to the continued decline in
    the U.S. residential market, partially offset by a benefit
    of approximately $24 million due to the net effect of price
    increases and product mix.

Unilin Segment

— Net sales decreased
    $22.4 million, or 1.5%, to $1,465.2 million in 2008,
    compared to $1,487.6 million in 2007. The decrease in net
    sales was driven by a decline in sales volume of approximately
    $188 million due to the continued decline in the
    U.S. residential market and slowing European demand,
    partially offset by a benefit of approximately $63 million
    due to the Wood Acquisition, a benefit of approximately
    $79 million due to favorable foreign exchange rates and a
    benefit of approximately $23 million due to the net effect
    of price increases and product mix.

Gross
    profit

Gross profit was $1,737.8 million (25.5% of net sales) for
    2008 and represented a decrease of $377.0 million, or
    17.8%, compared to gross profit of $2,114.8 million (27.9%
    of net sales) for 2007. Gross profit was unfavorably impacted by
    increasing costs for raw materials and energy of approximately
    $172 million, net of cost savings initiatives, and a
    decline in volumes of approximately $279 million, partially
    offset by the net effect of price increases and product mix of
    approximately $97 million.

Selling,
    general and administrative expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2008 were
    $1,318.5 million (19.3% of net sales), reflecting a
    decrease of $46.2 million, or 3.4%, compared to
    $1,364.7 million (18.0% of net sales) for 2007.



The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses is
    attributable to various cost savings initiatives implemented by
    the Company, offset by approximately $25 million of
    unfavorable foreign exchange rates.

Impairment
    of goodwill and intangibles

During 2008, the Company recorded a $1,543.4 million
    impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount of the
    Company’s goodwill and intangible assets to their estimated
    fair value based upon the results of two interim impairment
    tests. The Company performed interim impairment tests because of
    a prolonged decline in the Company’s market capitalization
    which the Company believes is primarily a result of the weakness
    in the U.S. residential housing market and the slowing
    European economy. In both the third and fourth quarters of 2008,
    the Company concluded that the weakness in the
    U.S. residential housing market is likely to persist based
    on its review of, among other things, sequential quarterly
    housing starts, recent turmoil surrounding the nation’s
    largest mortgage lenders, the potential negative impact on the
    availability of mortgage financing and housing start forecasts
    published by national home builder associations pushing recovery
    in the U.S. residential housing market beyond 2009. The
    total impairment included $276.8 million in the Mohawk
    segment, $531.9 million in the Dal-Tile segment and
    $734.7 million in the Unilin segment. If, in the future,
    the Company’s market capitalization

and/or

the
    estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units were
    to decline further, it may be necessary to record further
    impairment charges.

Operating
    (loss) income

Operating loss for 2008 was $1,124.1 million reflecting a
    decrease of $1,874.2 million compared to operating income
    of $750.1 million (9.9% of net sales) in 2007. The decrease
    was primarily driven by the recognition of impairment of
    goodwill and other intangibles of $1,543.4 million, a
    decline in sales volumes of approximately $285 million and
    rising costs for raw materials and energy of approximately
    $116 million, net of cost savings initiatives, partially
    offset by a benefit of approximately $130 million due to
    the net effect of price increases and product mix.

Mohawk Segment

— Operating loss was
    $216.2 million in 2008 reflecting a decrease of
    $471.1 million compared to operating income of
    $254.9 million (6.1% of segment net sales) in 2007. The
    decrease was primarily due to the impairment of goodwill and
    other intangibles of $276.8 million, a decline in sales
    volumes of approximately $142 million and rising costs for
    raw materials and energy of approximately $82 million, net
    of cost savings initiatives, partially offset by a benefit of
    approximately $82 million due to the net effect of price
    increases and product mix.

Dal-Tile Segment

— Operating loss was
    $323.4 million in 2008 reflecting a decrease of
    $582.1 million, compared to operating income of
    $258.7 million (13.4% of segment net sales) in 2007. The
    decrease was primarily due to the impairment of goodwill of
    $531.9 million, rising costs for raw materials and energy
    of approximately $31 million, net of cost savings
    initiatives, and a decline in sales volumes of approximately
    $56 million, partially offset by a benefit of approximately
    $41 million due to the net effect of price increases and
    product mix.

Unilin Segment

— Operating loss was
    $564.9 million in 2008, reflecting a decrease of
    $837.2 million compared to operating income of
    $272.3 million (18.3% of segment net sales) in 2007. The
    decrease was primarily due to the impairment of goodwill and
    other intangibles of $734.7 million, a decline in sales
    volumes of approximately $88 million and rising costs for
    raw materials and energy of approximately $19 million, net
    of cost savings initiatives, partially offset by a benefit of
    approximately $7 million due to the net effect of price
    increases and product mix.

Interest
    expense

Interest expense for 2008 was $127.1 million compared to
    $154.5 million in 2007. The decrease in interest expense
    for 2008 as compared to 2007 was attributable to lower average
    debt and lower average interest rates on outstanding revolving
    debt.



Income
    tax (benefit) expense

The 2008 provision for income tax was $180.1 million, as
    compared to an income tax benefit of $102.7 million for
    2007. The effective tax rate for 2008 was (14.2)% as compared to
    an effective tax rate benefit of 16.8% for 2007. The change in
    the tax rate was primarily due to the impact on pre-tax earnings
    of the impairment charge on non-deductible goodwill, the 2008
    asset restructurings, and the recognition of a valuation
    allowance of $253 million, which is described above,
    against certain deferred tax assets that the Company believes is
    no longer more likely than not to be realized. Without the
    impact of these three items, the Company would have reflected a
    2008 provision for income tax of $70.5 million, as compared
    to a provision of $168.9 million for 2007.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

The Company’s primary capital requirements are for working
    capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. The
    Company’s capital needs are met primarily through a
    combination of internally generated funds, bank credit lines,
    term and senior notes and credit terms from suppliers.

Cash flows provided by operations for 2009 were
    $672.2 million compared to cash flows provided by
    operations of $576.1 million in 2008. The increase in
    operating cash flows for 2009 as compared to 2008 is primarily
    attributable to lower working capital requirements due to lower
    sales demand.

Net cash used in investing activities for 2009 was
    $114.8 million compared to $226.1 million in 2008. The
    decrease is due to lower capital spending as a result of lower
    sales and tighter management of expenditures during 2009 as
    compared to 2008. Capital expenditures, including
    $161.3 million for acquisitions have totaled
    $651.1 million over the past three years. Capital spending
    during 2010, excluding acquisitions, is expected to range from
    $150 million to $160 million, and is intended to be
    used primarily to purchase equipment and to streamline
    manufacturing capacity.

Net cash used in financing activities for 2009 was
    $125.8 million compared to net cash used by financing
    activities of $348.9 million in 2008. The change in cash
    used in financing activities as compared to 2008 is primarily
    attributable to lower debt levels as the Company manages its
    working capital requirements to align with its current sales.

On September 2, 2009, the Company entered into a
    $600 million four-year, senior, secured revolving credit
    facility (the “ABL Facility”) in connection with the
    replacement of the Company’s then-existing senior,
    unsecured, revolving credit facility (the “Senior Unsecured
    Facility”). At the time of its termination, the Senior
    Unsecured Facility consisted of a $650 million revolving
    credit facility, which was to mature on October 28, 2010.
    The ABL Facility provides for a maximum of $600 million of
    revolving credit, subject to borrowing base availability,
    including limited amounts of credit in the form of letters of
    credit and swingline loans. The borrowing base is equal to
    specified percentages of eligible accounts receivable and
    inventories of the Company and other borrowers under the ABL
    Facility, which are subject to seasonal variations, less
    reserves established in good faith by the Administrative Agent
    under the ABL Facility. All obligations under the ABL Facility,
    and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured by a
    security interest in certain accounts receivable, inventories,
    certain deposit and securities accounts, tax refunds and other
    personal property (excluding intellectual property) directly
    relating to, or arising from, and proceeds of, any of the
    foregoing. In connection with the entry into the ABL Facility,
    the Company incurred approximately $23.7 million in debt
    issuance costs which will be amortized on a straight-line basis
    over the four-year term of the facility and recognized as
    interest expense in the condensed consolidated statement of
    operations.

At the Company’s election, revolving loans under the ABL
    Facility bear interest at annual rates equal to either
    (a) LIBOR for 1, 2, 3 or 6 month periods, as selected
    by the Company, plus an applicable margin ranging between 3.75%
    and 4.25%, or (b) the higher of the prime rate, the Federal
    Funds rate plus 0.5%, or a daily LIBOR rate, plus an applicable
    margin ranging between 2.25% and 2.75%. The Company also pays a
    commitment fee to the Lenders under the ABL Facility on the
    average amount by which the aggregate commitments of the
    Lenders’ exceed utilization of the ABL Facility equal to
    1.00% per annum during any



quarter that this excess is 50% or more, and 0.75% per annum
    during any quarter that this excess is less than 50%.

The ABL Facility includes certain affirmative and negative
    covenants that impose restrictions on Mohawk’s financial
    and business operations, including limitations on debt, liens,
    investments, fundamental changes, asset dispositions, dividends
    and other similar restricted payments, transactions with
    affiliates, payments and modifications of certain existing debt,
    future negative pledges, and changes in the nature of the
    Company’s business. Many of these limitations are subject
    to numerous exceptions. The Company is also required to maintain
    a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.1 to 1.0 during any period
    that the unutilized amount available under the ABL Facility is
    less than 15% of the amount available under the ABL Facility.

The ABL Facility is scheduled to mature on September 2,
    2013 but the maturity date will be accelerated to:
    (i) October 15, 2010 if the Company’s outstanding
    5.75% senior notes due January 15, 2011 have not been
    repaid, refinanced, defeased or adequately reserved for by the
    Company, as reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent,
    prior to October 15, 2010, and (ii) January 15,
    2012, if the Company’s outstanding 7.20% senior notes
    due April 15, 2012 have not been repaid, refinanced,
    defeased or adequately reserved for by the Company, as
    reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent, prior to
    January 15, 2012. The Company can make adequate reserves
    for such senior notes with unrestricted cash on hand and
    unutilized borrowing availability under the ABL Facility. The
    Company believes cash and cash equivalents and availability
    under the ABL Facility will be sufficient to satisfy the
    October 15, 2010 requirements of the ABL Facility, although
    there can be no assurances the Company will have adequate
    reserves as defined in the ABL Facility.

As of December 31, 2009, the amount considered used under
    the ABL Facility was $113.4 million leaving a total of
    approximately $462 million available under the ABL
    Facility. The amount used under the ABL Facility is composed of
    $53.5 million standby letters of credit guaranteeing the
    Company’s industrial revenue bonds and $59.9 million
    of standby letters of credit related to various insurance
    contracts and foreign vendor commitments.

During 2009, the Company terminated its
    Euro 130.0 million, five-year unsecured, revolving
    credit facility and its on-balance sheet trade accounts
    receivable securitization agreement, which allowed for
    borrowings up to $250.0 million based on available accounts
    receivable.

On January 17, 2006, the Company issued $500.0 million
    aggregate principal amount of 5.750% notes due 2011 and
    $900.0 million aggregate principal amount of
    6.125% notes due 2016. Interest payable on each series of
    the notes is subject to adjustment if either Moody’s
    Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) or
    Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services
    (“Standard & Poor’s”), or both,
    downgrades the rating assigned to the notes. Each rating agency
    downgrade results in a 0.25% increase in the interest rate,
    subject to a maximum increase of 1% per rating agency. If later
    the rating of these notes improves, then the interest rates
    would be reduced accordingly. Each 0.25% increase in the
    interest rate of these notes would increase the Company’s
    interest expense by approximately $3.5 million per year.
    Currently, the interest rates have been increased by an
    aggregate amount of 0.75% as a result of downgrades by
    Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s during 2009.
    These downgrades increase the Company’s interest expense by
    approximately $10.5 million per year and could adversely
    affect the cost of and ability to obtain additional credit in
    the future. Additional downgrades in the Company’s credit
    ratings could further increase the cost of its existing credit
    and adversely affect the cost of and ability to obtain
    additional credit in the future.

In 2002, the Company issued $400.0 million aggregate
    principal amount of its senior 7.2% notes due 2012.

The Company may from time to time seek to retire its outstanding
    debt through cash purchases in the open market, privately
    negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any,
    will depend on prevailing market conditions, the Company’s
    liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other
    factors. The amount involved may be material.

As of December 31, 2009, the Company had invested cash of
    $464.9 million in money market AAA rated cash investments
    of which $367.3 million was in North America and
    $97.6 million was in Europe. The



Company believes that its cash and cash equivalents on hand,
    cash generated from operations and availability under its ABL
    Facility will be sufficient to repay, defease or refinance its
    5.75% senior notes due January 2011 and meet its capital
    expenditures and working capital requirements over the next
    twelve months.

The Company’s Board of Directors has authorized the
    repurchase of up to 15 million shares of the Company’s
    outstanding common stock. Since the inception of the program in
    1999, a total of approximately 11.5 million shares have
    been repurchased at an aggregate cost of approximately
    $334.7 million. All of these repurchases have been financed
    through the Company’s operations and banking arrangements.
    No shares were repurchased during 2009, 2008 and 2007.

On October 31, 2005, the Company entered into a Discounted
    Stock Purchase Agreement (the “DSPA”) with certain
    members of the Unilin management team (the “Unilin
    Management”). The Company terminated the DSPA during the
    year ended December 31, 2009. Under the terms of the DSPA,
    the Company was obligated to make cash payments to the Unilin
    Management in the event that certain performance goals were
    satisfied. In each of the years in the five-year period ended
    December 31, 2010, the remaining members of Unilin
    Management could earn amounts, in the aggregate, equal to the
    average value of 30,671 shares of the Company’s common
    stock over the 20 trading day period ending on December 31 of
    the prior year. Any failure in a given year to reach the
    performance goals could have been rectified, and consequently
    the amounts payable with respect to achieving such criteria
    could have been made, in any of the other years. The amount of
    the liability is measured each period and recognized as
    compensation expense in the consolidated statement of
    operations. No expense related to the DSPA was recognized by the
    Company in 2009.

The outstanding checks in excess of cash represent trade
    payables checks that have not yet cleared the bank. When the
    checks clear the bank, they are funded by the ABL Facility. This
    policy does not impact any liquid assets on the consolidated
    balance sheets.

    Accounting Policies

In preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the
    Company must make decisions which impact the reported amounts of
    assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related
    disclosures. Such decisions include the selection of appropriate
    accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which
    to base accounting estimates. In reaching such decisions, the
    Company applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis
    of the relevant circumstances and historical experience. Actual
    amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the
    consolidated financial statements are prepared.

The Company’s significant accounting policies are described
    in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included
    elsewhere in this report. Some of those significant accounting
    policies require the Company to make subjective or complex
    judgments or estimates. Critical accounting policies are defined
    as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a
    company’s financial condition and results and require
    management’s most difficult, subjective, or complex
    judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about
    the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may
    change in subsequent periods.

The Company believes the following accounting policies require
    it to use judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated
    financial statements and represent critical accounting policies.

•

Accounts receivable and revenue
    recognition.

Revenues are recognized when there
    is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred,
    the price has been fixed or is determinable, and collectability
    can be reasonably assured. The Company provides allowances for
    expected cash discounts, returns, claims and doubtful accounts
    based upon historical bad debt and claims experience and
    periodic evaluation of specific customer accounts and the aging
    of accounts receivable. If the financial condition of the
    Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an
    impairment of their ability to make payments, additional
    allowances may be required.

•

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (net
    realizable value).

Cost has been determined using
    the

first-in

first-out method (“FIFO”). Costs included in inventory
    include raw materials, direct and indirect labor and employee
    benefits, depreciation, general manufacturing overhead and
    various other costs of manufacturing. Market, with respect to
    all inventories, is replacement cost or net realizable value.
    Inventories on hand are compared against anticipated future
    usage, which is a function of historical usage, anticipated
    future selling price, expected sales below cost, excessive
    quantities and an evaluation for obsolescence. Actual results
    could differ from assumptions used to value obsolete inventory,
    excessive inventory or inventory expected to be sold below cost
    and additional reserves may be required.

•

Goodwill and other intangibles.

Goodwill is
    tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter or
    earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive
    changes in circumstances. The Company considers the relationship
    between its market capitalization and its book value, among
    other factors, when reviewing for indicators of impairment. The
    goodwill impairment tests are based on determining the fair
    value of the specified reporting units based on management
    judgments and assumptions using the discounted cash flows and
    comparable company market valuation approaches. The Company has
    identified Mohawk, Dal-Tile, Unilin Flooring, Unilin Chipboard
    and Melamine, and Unilin Roofing as its reporting units for the
    purposes of allocating goodwill and intangibles as well as
    assessing impairments. The valuation approaches are subject to
    key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change such
    as judgments and assumptions about appropriate sales growth
    rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital
    (“WACC”), and comparable company market multiples.
    When developing these key judgments and assumptions, the Company
    considers economic, operational and



market conditions that could impact the fair value of the
    reporting unit. However, estimates are inherently uncertain and
    represent only management’s reasonable expectations
    regarding future developments. These estimates and the judgments
    and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will, in all
    likelihood, differ in some respects from actual future results.
    Should a significant or prolonged deterioration in economic
    conditions occur, such as continued declines in spending for new
    construction, remodeling and replacement activities; the
    inability to pass increases in the costs of raw materials and
    fuel on to customers; or a decline in comparable company market
    multiples, then key judgments and assumptions could be impacted.
    Generally, a moderate decline in estimated operating income or a
    small increase in WACC or a decline in market capitalization
    could result in an additional indication of impairment.

The impairment test for intangible assets not subject to
    amortization involves a comparison of the estimated fair value
    of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying
    value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an
    impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
    Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include
    assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, royalty rates,
    WACC and the amount of expected future cash flows. These
    judgments and assumptions are subject to the variability
    discussed above.

The impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible
    assets, which for the Company are its trademarks, is conducted
    during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might
    be impaired. The determination of fair value used in the
    impairment evaluation is based on discounted estimates of future
    sales projections attributable to ownership of the trademarks.
    Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include
    assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, royalty rates,
    WACC and the amount of expected future cash flows. The judgments
    and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally
    consistent with past performance and are also consistent with
    the projections and assumptions that are used in current
    operating plans. Such assumptions are subject to change as a
    result of changing economic and competitive conditions. The
    determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences
    between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the
    related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the
    trademarks. Estimated cash flows are sensitive to changes in the
    economy among other things.

The Company reviews its long-lived asset groups, which include
    intangible assets subject to amortization, which for the Company
    are its patents and customer relationships, for impairment
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
    carrying amount of such asset groups may not be recoverable.
    Recoverability of asset groups to be held and used is measured
    by a comparison of the carrying amount of long-lived assets to
    future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by
    these asset groups. If such asset groups are considered to be
    impaired, the impairment recognized is the amount by which the
    carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the
    asset group. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of
    the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs of
    disposal and are no longer depreciated.

The Company conducted its annual assessment of goodwill and
    indefinite lived intangibles in the fourth quarter and no
    impairment was indicated. The Company did record impairment of
    goodwill and other intangibles of $1,543.4 million in 2008.

•

The Company’s effective tax rate is based on its income,
    statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in
    the jurisdictions in which it operates. Tax laws are complex and
    subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and
    respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment
    is required in determining the Company’s tax expense and in
    evaluating the Company’s tax positions. Deferred tax assets
    represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on
    taxable income in a future period. The Company evaluates the
    recoverability of these future tax benefits by assessing the
    adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources,
    including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted
    operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These
    sources of income inherently rely on estimates, including
    business forecasts and other projections of financial results
    over an extended period of time. In the event that the Company
    is not able to realize



all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future, a
    valuation allowance is provided. The Company would recognize
    such amounts through a charge to income in the period in which
    that determination is made or when tax law changes are enacted.
    The Company recorded valuation allowances of $365.9 million
    in 2009, $343.6 million in 2008 and $75.0 million in
    2007.

In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty
    in quantifying the Company’s income tax positions. The
    Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax
    benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the
    Company’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and
    information available as of the reporting date. For those tax
    positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit
    will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount
    of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being
    realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that
    has full knowledge of all relevant information, as required by
    the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic
    740 (“ASC

740-10”),

a replacement of FASB Interpretation No. 48,

“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes —
    an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”

. For
    those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not
    that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been
    recognized in the consolidated financial statements. As of
    December 31, 2009, the Company has $105.6 million
    accrued for uncertain tax positions.

•

Environmental and legal accruals are estimates based on
    judgments made by the Company relating to ongoing environmental
    and legal proceedings, as disclosed in the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements. In determining whether a
    liability is probable and reasonably estimable, the Company
    consults with its internal experts. The Company believes that
    the amounts recorded in the accompanying financial statements
    are based on the best estimates and judgments available
    to it.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued ASC

820-10,

formerly Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 157,

“Fair Value
    Measurements”

. ASC

820-10

defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
    value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value
    measurements. ASC

820-10

requires companies to disclose the fair value of financial
    instruments according to a fair value hierarchy. Additionally,
    companies are required to provide certain disclosures regarding
    instruments within the hierarchy, including a reconciliation of
    the beginning and ending balances for each major category of
    assets and liabilities. ASC

820-10

is
    effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning
    January 1, 2008 for financial assets and liabilities and
    January 1, 2009 for non-financial assets and liabilities.
    The Company’s adoption of ASC

820-10

for
    financial assets and liabilities on January 1, 2008 and

non-financial

assets and liabilities on January 1, 2009 did not have a
    material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued ASC

805-10,

formerly SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007),

“Business Combinations”

. ASC

805-10

establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer
    recognizes and measures in its financial statements the
    identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any
    noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill
    acquired. ASC

805-10

also
    establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of
    the nature and financial effects of the business combination.
    ASC

805-10

is to be applied prospectively to business combinations for
    which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009.
    The adoption of ASC

805-10

on
    January 1, 2009 did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements, although the
    adoption of ASC

805-10

will
    impact the recognition and measurement of future business
    combinations and certain income tax benefits recognized from
    prior business combinations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued ASC

810-10,

formerly SFAS No. 160,

“Noncontrolling
    Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements — an
    amendment of Accounting Research
    Bulletin No. 51”

. ASC

810-10

establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership
    interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent,
    the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent
    and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parent’s
    ownership interest, and the valuation of retained noncontrolling
    equity investments when



a subsidiary is deconsolidated. ASC

810-10

also
    establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and
    distinguish between the interests of the parent and the
    interests of the noncontrolling owners. ASC

810-10

is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008. The adoption of ASC

810-10

on
    January 1, 2009 did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements. Upon adoption,
    the Company reclassified $31.1 million on the condensed
    consolidated balance sheets from other long-term liabilities to
    noncontrolling interest within equity and reclassified the
    related net earnings to net earnings attributable to the
    noncontrolling interest on the consolidated statements of
    operations.

In March 2008, the FASB issued ASC

815-10,

formerly SFAS No. 161,

“Disclosures about
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”

. ASC

815-10

is
    intended to improve financial reporting about derivative
    instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced
    disclosures to enable investors to better understand their
    effects on an entity’s financial position, financial
    performance, and cash flows. The provisions of ASC

815-10

are
    effective for the first quarter of 2009. The adoption of ASC

815-10

on
    January 1, 2009 did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In April 2009, the FASB issued ASC

825-10,

formerly the FASB Staff Position on

FAS 107-1

and APB

28-1,

“

Interim Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial
    Instruments”

. ASC

825-10

requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments
    in interim reporting periods of publicly-traded companies that
    were previously only required to be disclosed in annual
    financial statements. The provisions of ASC

825-10

are
    effective for the second quarter of 2009. The adoption of this
    standard on June 27, 2009 did not have a material impact on
    the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In May 2009, the FASB issued ASC

855-10-05,

formerly SFAS No. 165,

“Subsequent
    Events”

. ASC

855-10-05

establishes general standards for accounting for and disclosure
    of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before
    financial statements are available to be issued
    (“subsequent events”). More specifically, ASC

855-10-05

sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which
    management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or
    transactions that may occur for potential recognition in the
    financial statements, identifies the circumstances under which
    an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring
    after the balance sheet date in its financial statements and the
    disclosures that should be made about events or transactions
    that occur after the balance sheet date. ASC

855-10-05

provides largely the same guidance on subsequent events which
    previously existed only in the auditing literature. ASC

855-10-05

is
    effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after
    June 15, 2009, and is to be applied prospectively. The
    adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In June 2009, the FASB issued ASC 860, formerly
    SFAS No. 166,

“Accounting for Transfers of
    Financial Assets — an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 140”

. ASC 860 seeks to improve the relevance,
    representational faithfulness, and comparability of the
    information that a reporting entity provides in its financial
    statements about a transfer of financial assets; the effects of
    a transfer on its financial position, financial performance, and
    cash flows; and a transferor’s continuing involvement, if
    any, in transferred financial assets. Specifically, ASC 860
    eliminates the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity,
    creates more stringent conditions for reporting a transfer of a
    portion of a financial asset as a sale, clarifies other
    sale-accounting criteria, and changes the initial measurement of
    a transferor’s interest in transferred financial assets.
    ASC 860 is effective for annual and quarterly reporting periods
    that begin after November 15, 2009. The adoption of this
    standard on January 1, 2010 is not expected to have a
    material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

In June 2009, the FASB issued ASC 810, formerly
    SFAS No. 167, “

Amendments to FASB
    Interpretation No. 46(R)”

. ASC 810 amends FASB
    Interpretation No. 46(R),

“Variable Interest
    Entities”

for determining whether an entity is a
    variable interest entity (“VIE”) and requires an
    enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the
    enterprise’s variable interest or interests give it a
    controlling financial interest in a VIE. Under ASC 810, an
    enterprise has a controlling financial interest when it has
    a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most
    significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and
    b) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the
    right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially
    be significant to the VIE. ASC 810 also requires an enterprise
    to assess whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to



ensure that a VIE operates as designed when determining whether
    it has power to direct the activities of the VIE that most
    significantly impact the entity’s economic performance. ASC
    810 also requires ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise
    is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, requires enhanced
    disclosures and eliminates the scope exclusion for qualifying
    special-purpose entities. ASC 810 is effective for annual and
    quarterly reporting periods that begin after November 15,
    2009. The adoption of this standard on January 1, 2010 is
    not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

In June 2009, the FASB issued ASC

105-10,

formerly SFAS No. 168,

“The FASB Accounting
    Standards Codification and Hierarchy of Generally Accepted
    Accounting Principles, a replacement of FASB Statement
    No. 162”

. ASC

105-10

establishes the FASB Standards Accounting Codification
    (“Codification”) as the source of authoritative
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
    (“GAAP”) recognized by the FASB to be applied to
    nongovernmental entities and rules and interpretive releases of
    the SEC as authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. The
    Codification superseded all the existing non-SEC accounting and
    reporting standards upon its effective date. ASC

105-10

also
    replaced FASB Statement No. 162,

“The Hierarchy of
    Generally Accepted Accounting Principles”

given that
    once in effect, the Codification carries the same level of
    authority. ASC

105-10

is
    effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual
    periods ending after September 15, 2009. The adoption of
    this standard did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Impact of
    Inflation

Inflation affects the Company’s manufacturing costs,
    distribution costs and operating expenses. The carpet, tile and
    laminate industry experienced significant inflation in the
    prices of raw materials and fuel-related costs beginning in the
    first quarter of 2004, and the prices increased dramatically
    during the latter part of 2008, peaking in the second half of
    2008. The Company expects raw material prices to continue to
    fluctuate based upon worldwide demand of commodities utilized in
    the Company’s production processes. In the past, the
    Company has generally been able to pass along these price
    increases to its customers and has been able to enhance
    productivity to help offset increases in costs resulting from
    inflation in its operations.

Seasonality

The Company is a calendar year-end company. With respect to its
    Mohawk and Dal-Tile segments, its results of operations for the
    first quarter tend to be the weakest. The second, third and
    fourth quarters typically produce higher net sales and operating
    income in these segments. These results are primarily due to
    consumer residential spending patterns for floor covering, which
    historically have decreased during the first two months of each
    year following the holiday season. The Unilin segment second and
    fourth quarters typically produce higher net sales and earnings
    followed by a moderate first quarter and a weaker third quarter.
    The third quarter is traditionally the weakest due to the
    European holiday in late summer.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Financial exposures are managed as an integral part of the
    Company’s risk management program, which seeks to reduce
    the potentially adverse effect that the volatility of exchange
    rates and natural gas markets may have on its operating results.
    The Company does not regularly engage in speculative
    transactions, nor does it regularly hold or issue financial
    instruments for trading purposes.

Natural
    Gas Risk Management

The Company uses a combination of natural gas futures contracts
    and long-term supply agreements to manage unanticipated changes
    in natural gas prices. The contracts are based on forecasted
    usage of natural gas measured in Million British Thermal Units
    (“MMBTU”).

The Company has designated the natural gas futures contracts as
    cash flow hedges. The outstanding contracts are valued at market
    with the offset applied to other comprehensive income, net of
    applicable income taxes and any hedge ineffectiveness.



Any gain or loss is reclassified from other comprehensive income
    and recognized in cost of sales in the same period or periods
    during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. As of
    December 31, 2009, the Company had no outstanding natural
    gas contracts. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had
    natural gas contracts that mature from January 2009 to December
    2009 with an aggregate notional amount of approximately 2,650
    thousand MMBTU’s. The fair value of these contracts was a
    liability of $5.9 million as of December 31, 2008. The
    offset to these liabilities is recorded in other comprehensive
    income, net of applicable income taxes. The ineffective portion
    of the derivative is recognized in the cost of sales within the
    consolidated statements of operations and was not significant
    for the periods reported.

The Company’s natural gas long-term supply agreements are
    accounted for under the normal purchase provision within ASC
    815, formerly SFAS No. 133 and its amendments. As of
    December 31, 2009, the Company had no outstanding normal
    purchase commitments for natural gas. As of December 31,
    2008, the Company had normal purchase commitments of
    approximately 2,026 thousand MMBTU’s for periods maturing
    from January 2009 through December 2009. The contracted value of
    these commitments was approximately $17.2 million as of
    December 31, 2008.

Foreign
    Currency Rate Management

The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to
    hedge foreign denominated costs associated with its operations
    in Mexico. The objective of these transactions is to reduce
    volatility of exchange rates where these operations are located
    by fixing a portion of their costs in U.S. currency.
    Accordingly, these contracts have been designated as cash flow
    hedges. Gains and losses are reclassified from other
    comprehensive income and recognized in cost of sales in the same
    period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects
    earnings. The Company had no outstanding forward contracts to
    purchase Mexican pesos as of December 31, 2009. The Company
    had forward contracts to purchase approximately
    269.1 million Mexican pesos as of December 31, 2008.
    The aggregate U.S. dollar value of these contracts as of
    December 31, 2008 was approximately $23.9 million and
    the fair value of these contracts was a liability of
    approximately $5.2 million.

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Mohawk Industries, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Mohawk Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31,
    2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of
    operations, equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for
    each of the years in the three-year period ended
    December 31, 2009. These consolidated financial statements
    are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
    financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Mohawk Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
    three-year period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards
    Board Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty
    in Income Taxes — an Interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109

, included in ASC subtopic

740-10,

Income Taxes-Overall, effective January 1, 2007.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Mohawk Industries, Inc.’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Mohawk Industries, Inc.:

We have audited Mohawk Industries, Inc.’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (COSO). Mohawk Industries, Inc.’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as
    set forth in Item 9A of Mohawk Industries, Inc.’s
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2009. Our responsibility is
    to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Mohawk Industries, Inc. maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Mohawk Industries, Inc. and
    subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the
    related consolidated statements of operations, equity and
    comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in
    the three-year period ended December 31, 2009, and our
    report dated February 26, 2010 expressed an unqualified
    opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

MOHAWK
    INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements

Years Ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007

(In thousands, except per share data)

(1)

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

(a)

Basis
    of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    Mohawk Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the
    “Company” or “Mohawk”). All significant
    intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
    consolidation.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
    management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
    contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the
    financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
    expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
    differ from those estimates.

(b)

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers investments with an original maturity of
    three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. As
    of December 31, 2009, the Company had invested cash of
    $464,936 in money market AAA rated cash investments of which
    $367,305 was in North America and $97,631 was in Europe.

(c)

Accounts
    Receivable and Revenue Recognition

The Company is principally a carpet, rugs, ceramic tile,
    laminate and hardwood manufacturer and sells carpet, rugs,
    ceramic tile, natural stone, hardwood, resilient and laminate
    flooring products in the United States. In addition, the Company
    manufactures laminate and sells carpet, rugs and laminate
    flooring products in Europe principally for residential and
    commercial use. The Company grants credit to customers, most of
    whom are retail-flooring dealers and commercial end users, under
    credit terms that the Company believes are customary in the
    industry.

Revenues, which are recorded net of taxes collected from
    customers, are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of
    an arrangement, delivery has occurred, the price has been fixed
    or is determinable, and collectability can be reasonably
    assured. The Company provides allowances for expected cash
    discounts, returns, claims and doubtful accounts based upon
    historical bad debt and claims experience and periodic
    evaluations of specific customer accounts. Licensing revenues
    received from third parties for patents are recognized based on
    contractual agreements.

(d)

Inventories

The Company accounts for all inventories on the

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) method. Inventories are stated at
    the lower of cost or market (net realizable value). Cost has
    been determined using the FIFO method. Costs in inventory
    include raw materials, direct and indirect labor and employee
    benefits, depreciation, general manufacturing overhead and
    various other costs of manufacturing. Market, with respect to
    all inventories, is replacement cost or net realizable value.
    Inventories on hand are compared against anticipated future
    usage, which is a function of historical usage, anticipated
    future selling price, expected sales below cost, excessive
    quantities and an evaluation for obsolescence. Actual results
    could differ from assumptions used to value obsolete inventory,
    excessive inventory or inventory expected to be sold below cost
    and additional reserves may be required.



(e)

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, including
    capitalized interest. Depreciation is calculated on a
    straight-line basis over the estimated remaining useful lives,
    which are

25-35 years

for buildings and improvements, 5-15 years for machinery
    and equipment, the shorter of the estimated useful life or lease
    term for leasehold improvements and 3-7 years for furniture
    and fixtures.

(f)

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

In accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (“FASB”) FASB Accounting Standards
    Codification Topic 350 (“ASC 350”), formerly Statement
    of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
    No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets,”

the Company tests goodwill and other
    intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an
    annual basis in the fourth quarter (or on an interim basis if an
    event occurs that might reduce the fair value of the reporting
    unit below its carrying value). The Company considers the
    relationship between its market capitalization and its book
    value, among other factors, when reviewing for indicators of
    impairment. The goodwill impairment tests are based on
    determining the fair value of the specified reporting units
    based on management’s judgments and assumptions using the
    discounted cash flows and comparable company market valuation
    approaches. The Company has identified Mohawk, Dal-Tile, Unilin
    Flooring, Unilin Chipboard and Melamine, and Unilin Roofing as
    its reporting units for the purposes of allocating goodwill and
    intangibles as well as assessing impairments. The valuation
    approaches are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are
    sensitive to change such as judgments and assumptions about
    appropriate sales growth rates, operating margins, weighted
    average cost of capital (“WACC”), and comparable
    company market multiples.

When developing these key judgments and assumptions, the Company
    considers economic, operational and market conditions that could
    impact the fair value of the reporting unit. However, estimates
    are inherently uncertain and represent only management’s
    reasonable expectations regarding future developments. These
    estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the
    estimates are based will, in all likelihood, differ in some
    respects from actual future results. Should a significant or
    prolonged deterioration in economic conditions occur, such as
    continued declines in spending for new construction; remodeling
    and replacement activities; the inability to pass increases in
    the costs of raw materials and fuel on to customers; or a
    decline in comparable company market multiples, then key
    judgments and assumptions could be impacted.

The impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible
    assets, which for the Company are its trademarks, is conducted
    during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might
    be impaired. The determination of fair value used in the
    impairment evaluation is based on discounted estimates of future
    sales projections attributable to ownership of the trademarks.
    Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include
    assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates, royalty rates,
    WACC and the amount of expected future cash flows. The judgments
    and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally
    consistent with past performance and are also consistent with
    the projections and assumptions that are used in current
    operating plans. Such assumptions are subject to change as a
    result of changing economic and competitive conditions. The
    determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences
    between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the
    related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the
    trademarks. Estimated cash flows are sensitive to changes in the
    economy among other things. The impairment test for indefinite
    lived intangible assets involves a comparison of the estimated
    fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If
    the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair
    value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to
    that excess. The estimates of fair value of indefinite lived
    intangible assets are determined using a discounted cash flows
    valuation. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis
    include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates,
    royalty rates, WACC and the amount of expected future cash
    flows. These judgments and assumptions are subject to the
    variability discussed above.

Intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives are
    amortized based on average lives, which range from
    7-16 years.



(g)

Income
    Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability
    method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
    the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
    the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
    liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss
    and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
    apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
    differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
    on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
    is recognized in income in the period that includes the
    enactment date.

(h)

Financial
    Instruments

The Company’s financial instruments consist primarily of
    receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and long-term
    debt. The carrying amount of receivables, accounts payable and
    accrued expenses approximates its fair value because of the
    short-term maturity of such instruments. The carrying amount of
    the Company’s floating rate debt approximates its fair
    value based upon level two fair value hierarchy. Interest rates
    that are currently available to the Company for issuance of
    long-term debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are
    used to estimate the fair value of the Company’s long-term
    debt.

(i)

Derivative
    Instruments

Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities
    requires the Company to recognize all derivatives on the
    consolidated balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are
    not qualifying hedges must be adjusted to fair value through
    earnings. If the derivative is a qualifying hedge, depending on
    the nature of the hedge, changes in its fair value are either
    offset against the change in fair value of assets, liabilities,
    or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other
    comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in
    earnings. The Company engages in activities that expose it to
    market risks, including the effects of changes in interest
    rates, exchange rates and natural gas commodity prices.
    Financial exposures are managed as an integral part of the
    Company’s risk management program, which seeks to reduce
    the potentially adverse effect that the volatility of the
    interest rate, exchange rate and natural gas commodity markets
    may have on operating results. The Company does not engage in
    speculative transactions, nor does it hold or issue financial
    instruments for trading purposes.

The Company formally documents hedging instruments and hedging
    items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for
    undertaking hedged items. This process includes linking all
    derivatives that are designated as fair value and cash flow
    hedges to specific assets, liabilities or firm commitments on
    the consolidated balance sheet or to forecasted transactions.
    The Company also formally assesses, both at inception and on an
    ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging
    transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair
    value or cash flows of hedged items. Regression analysis is used
    to assess effectiveness of the hedging relationship and the
    dollar offset method is used to measure any ineffectiveness
    associated with the hedges. When it is determined that a
    derivative is not highly effective, the derivative expires, or
    is sold, terminated, or exercised, or the derivative is
    discontinued because it is unlikely that a forecasted
    transaction will occur, the Company discontinues hedge
    accounting prospectively for that specific hedge instrument.

(j)

Advertising
    Costs and Vendor Consideration

Advertising and promotion expenses are charged to earnings
    during the period in which they are incurred. Advertising and
    promotion expenses included in selling, general, and
    administrative expenses were $43,752 in 2009, $53,643 in 2008
    and $56,168 in 2007.

Vendor consideration, generally cash, is classified as a
    reduction of net sales, unless specific criteria are met
    regarding goods or services that the vendor may receive in
    return for this consideration. The Company makes various
    payments to customers, including slotting fees, advertising
    allowances, buy-downs and co-op advertising. All of these
    payments reduce gross sales with the exception of co-op
    advertising. Co-op advertising is classified as a selling,
    general and administrative expense in accordance with ASC

605-50,



formerly, FASB, Emerging Issues Task Force

01-09,

“Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a
    Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s
    Products).”

Co-op advertising expenses, a component of
    advertising and promotion expenses, were $3,809 in 2009, $7,359
    in 2008 and $5,686 in 2007.

(k)

Product
    Warranties

The Company warrants certain qualitative attributes of its
    flooring products. The Company has recorded a provision for
    estimated warranty and related costs, based on historical
    experience and periodically adjusts these provisions to reflect
    actual experience.

(l)

Impairment
    of Long-Lived Assets

The Company reviews its long-lived asset groups, which include
    intangible assets subject to amortization, which for the Company
    are its patents and customer relationships, for impairment
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
    carrying amount of such asset groups may not be recoverable.
    Recoverability of asset groups to be held and used is measured
    by a comparison of the carrying amount of long-lived assets to
    future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by
    these asset groups. If such asset groups are considered to be
    impaired, the impairment recognized is the amount by which the
    carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the
    asset group. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of
    the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs of
    disposal and are no longer depreciated.

(m)

Foreign
    Currency Translation

The Company’s subsidiaries that operate outside the United
    States use their local currency as the functional currency, with
    the exception of operations carried out in Canada and Mexico, in
    which case the functional currency is the U.S. dollar.
    Other than Canada and Mexico, the functional currency is
    translated into U.S. dollars for balance sheet accounts
    using the month end rates in effect as of the balance sheet date
    and average exchange rate for revenue and expense accounts for
    each respective period. The translation adjustments are deferred
    as a separate component of stockholders’ equity, within
    other comprehensive income. Gains or losses resulting from
    transactions denominated in foreign currencies are included in
    other income or expense, within the consolidated statements of
    operations. The assets and liabilities of the Company’s
    Canada and Mexico operations are re-measured using a month end
    rate, except for non-monetary assets and liabilities, which are
    re-measured using the historical exchange rate. Income and
    expense accounts are re-measured using an average monthly rate
    for the period, except for expenses related to those balance
    sheet accounts that are re-measured using historical exchange
    rates. The resulting re-measurement adjustment is reported in
    the consolidated statements of operations when incurred.

(n)

Earnings
    per Share (“EPS”)

Basic net earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated
    using net earnings available to common stockholders divided by
    the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
    outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is similar to basic EPS
    except that the weighted-average number of shares is increased
    to include the number of additional common shares that would
    have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive common shares
    had been issued.

Dilutive common stock options are included in the diluted EPS
    calculation using the treasury stock method. Common stock
    options that were not included in the diluted EPS computation
    because the options’ exercise price was greater than the
    average market price of the common shares for the periods
    presented were 1,355, 1,083 and 656 for 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. For 2009 and 2008, all outstanding common stock
    options to purchase common shares and unvested restricted shares
    (units) were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per
    share because their effect on net loss per common share was
    anti-dilutive.



Computations of basic and diluted (loss) earnings per share are
    presented in the following table:

    Compensation

”. Compensation expense is generally
    recognized on a straight-line basis over the options estimated
    lives for fixed awards with ratable vesting provisions.

Comprehensive
    Income

Comprehensive income includes foreign currency translation of
    assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, effects of
    exchange rate changes on intercompany balances of a long-term
    nature and transactions and derivative financial instruments
    designated as cash flow hedges. The Company does not provide
    income taxes on currency translation adjustments, as earnings
    from foreign subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely
    reinvested.

Amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued ASC

820-10,

formerly Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 157,

“Fair Value
    Measurements”

. ASC

820-10

defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
    value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value
    measurements. ASC

820-10

requires companies to disclose the fair value of financial
    instruments according to a fair value hierarchy. Additionally,
    companies are required to provide certain disclosures regarding
    instruments within the hierarchy, including a reconciliation of
    the beginning and ending balances for each major category of
    assets and liabilities. ASC

820-10

is
    effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning
    January 1, 2008 for financial assets and liabilities and
    January 1, 2009 for non-financial assets and liabilities.
    The Company’s adoption of ASC

820-10

for
    financial assets and liabilities on January 1, 2008 and



non-financial

assets and liabilities on January 1, 2009 did not have a
    material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued ASC

805-10,

formerly SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007),

“Business Combinations”

. ASC

805-10

establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer
    recognizes and measures in its financial statements the
    identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any
    noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill
    acquired. ASC

805-10

also
    establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of
    the nature and financial effects of the business combination.
    ASC

805-10

is to be applied prospectively to business combinations for
    which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009.
    The adoption of ASC

805-10

on
    January 1, 2009 did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements, although the
    adoption of ASC

805-10

will
    impact the recognition and measurement of future business
    combinations and certain income tax benefits recognized from
    prior business combinations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued ASC

810-10,

formerly SFAS No. 160,

“Noncontrolling
    Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements — an
    amendment of Accounting Research
    Bulletin No. 51”

. ASC

810-10

establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership
    interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent,
    the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent
    and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parent’s
    ownership interest, and the valuation of retained noncontrolling
    equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. ASC

810-10

also
    establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and
    distinguish between the interests of the parent and the
    interests of the noncontrolling owners. ASC

810-10

is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008. The adoption of ASC

810-10

on
    January 1, 2009 did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements. Upon adoption,
    the Company reclassified $31,130 on the condensed consolidated
    balance sheets from other long-term liabilities to
    noncontrolling interest within equity and reclassified the
    related net earnings to net earnings attributable to the
    noncontrolling interest on the consolidated statements of
    operations.

In March 2008, the FASB issued ASC

815-10,

formerly SFAS No. 161,

“Disclosures about
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”

. ASC

815-10

is
    intended to improve financial reporting about derivative
    instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced
    disclosures to enable investors to better understand their
    effects on an entity’s financial position, financial
    performance, and cash flows. The provisions of ASC

815-10

are
    effective for the first quarter of 2009. The adoption of ASC

815-10

on
    January 1, 2009 did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In April 2009, the FASB issued ASC

825-10,

formerly the FASB Staff Position on

FAS 107-1

and APB

28-1,

“

Interim Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial
    Instruments”

. ASC

825-10

requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments
    in interim reporting periods of publicly-traded companies that
    were previously only required to be disclosed in annual
    financial statements. The provisions of ASC

825-10

are
    effective for the second quarter of 2009. The adoption of this
    standard on June 27, 2009 did not have a material impact on
    the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In May 2009, the FASB issued ASC

855-10-05,

formerly SFAS No. 165,

“Subsequent
    Events”

. ASC

855-10-05

establishes general standards for accounting for and disclosure
    of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before
    financial statements are available to be issued
    (“subsequent events”). More specifically, ASC

855-10-05

sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which
    management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or
    transactions that may occur for potential recognition in the
    financial statements, identifies the circumstances under which
    an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring
    after the balance sheet date in its financial statements and the
    disclosures that should be made about events or transactions
    that occur after the balance sheet date. ASC

855-10-05

provides largely the same guidance on subsequent events which
    previously existed only in the auditing literature. ASC

855-10-05

is
    effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after
    June 15, 2009, and is to be applied prospectively. The
    adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In June 2009, the FASB issued ASC 860, formerly
    SFAS No. 166,

“Accounting for Transfers of
    Financial Assets — an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 140”

. ASC 860 seeks to improve the relevance,



representational faithfulness, and comparability of the
    information that a reporting entity provides in its financial
    statements about a transfer of financial assets; the effects of
    a transfer on its financial position, financial performance, and
    cash flows; and a transferor’s continuing involvement, if
    any, in transferred financial assets. Specifically, ASC 860
    eliminates the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity,
    creates more stringent conditions for reporting a transfer of a
    portion of a financial asset as a sale, clarifies other
    sale-accounting criteria, and changes the initial measurement of
    a transferor’s interest in transferred financial assets.
    ASC 860 is effective for annual and quarterly reporting periods
    that begin after November 15, 2009. The adoption of this
    standard on January 1, 2010 is not expected to have a
    material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

In June 2009, the FASB issued ASC 810, formerly
    SFAS No. 167, “

Amendments to FASB
    Interpretation No. 46(R)”

. ASC 810 amends FASB
    Interpretation No. 46(R),

“Variable Interest
    Entities”

for determining whether an entity is a
    variable interest entity (“VIE”) and requires an
    enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the
    enterprise’s variable interest or interests give it a
    controlling financial interest in a VIE. Under ASC 810, an
    enterprise has a controlling financial interest when it has
    a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most
    significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and
    b) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the
    right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially
    be significant to the VIE. ASC 810 also requires an enterprise
    to assess whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to
    ensure that a VIE operates as designed when determining whether
    it has power to direct the activities of the VIE that most
    significantly impact the entity’s economic performance. ASC
    810 also requires ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise
    is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, requires enhanced
    disclosures and eliminates the scope exclusion for qualifying
    special-purpose entities. ASC 810 is effective for annual and
    quarterly reporting periods that begin after November 15,
    2009. The adoption of this standard on January 1, 2010 is
    not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

In June 2009, the FASB issued ASC

105-10,

formerly SFAS No. 168,

“The FASB Accounting
    Standards Codification and Hierarchy of Generally Accepted
    Accounting Principles, a replacement of FASB Statement
    No. 162”

. ASC

105-10

establishes the FASB Standards Accounting Codification
    (“Codification”) as the source of authoritative
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
    (“GAAP”) recognized by the FASB to be applied to
    nongovernmental entities and rules and interpretive releases of
    the SEC as authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. The
    Codification superseded all the existing non-SEC accounting and
    reporting standards upon its effective date. ASC

105-10

also
    replaced FASB Statement No. 162,

“The Hierarchy of
    Generally Accepted Accounting Principles”

given that
    once in effect, the Codification carries the same level of
    authority. ASC

105-10

is
    effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual
    periods ending after September 15, 2009. The adoption of
    this standard did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

(r)  Fiscal
    Year

The Company ends its fiscal year on December 31. Each of
    the first three quarters in the fiscal year ends on the Saturday
    nearest the calendar quarter end.

(2)

Acquisitions

During 2009 and 2008, the Company acquired a business in the
    Unilin segment for $5,604 and certain stone center assets in the
    Dal-Tile segment for $8,276, respectively.

During 2007, the Company acquired certain wood flooring assets
    and liabilities of Columbia Forest Products, Inc.
    (“Columbia”) for approximately $147,097. The
    acquisition included the assets of two pre-finished solid plants
    and one engineered wood plant in the United States and an
    engineered wood plant in Malaysia. The results of operations
    from the date of acquisition are included in the Company’s
    consolidated results.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

The Company conducted its annual assessment in the fourth
    quarter of 2009 and determined the fair values of its reporting
    units exceeded their carrying values. As a result, no impairment
    was indicated. During 2008, the Company recorded a $1,543,397
    impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount of the
    Company’s goodwill and intangible assets to their estimated
    fair value based upon the results of two interim impairment
    tests. The total impairment included $276,807 in the Mohawk
    segment, $531,930 in the Dal-Tile segment and $734,660 in the
    Unilin segment.

(7)  Long-Term
    Debt

On September 2, 2009, the Company entered into a $600,000
    four-year, senior, secured revolving credit facility (the
    “ABL Facility”) in connection with the replacement of
    the Company’s then-existing senior, unsecured, revolving
    credit facility (the “Senior Unsecured Facility”). At
    the time of its termination, the Senior Unsecured Facility
    consisted of a $650,000 revolving credit facility, which was to
    mature on October 28, 2010. The ABL Facility provides for a
    maximum of $600,000 of revolving credit, subject to borrowing
    base availability, including limited amounts of credit in the
    form of letters of credit and swingline loans. The borrowing
    base is equal to specified percentages of eligible accounts
    receivable and inventories of the Company and other borrowers
    under the ABL Facility, which are subject to seasonal
    variations, less reserves established in good faith by the
    Administrative Agent under the ABL Facility. All obligations
    under the ABL Facility, and the guarantees of those obligations,
    are secured by a security interest in certain accounts
    receivable, inventories, certain deposit and securities
    accounts, tax refunds and other personal property (excluding
    intellectual property) directly relating to, or arising from,
    and proceeds of, any of the foregoing. In connection with the
    entry into the ABL Facility, the Company incurred $23,714 in
    debt issuance costs which will be amortized on a straight-line
    basis over the four-year term of the facility and recognized as
    interest expense in the condensed consolidated statement of
    operations.

At the Company’s election, revolving loans under the ABL
    Facility bear interest at annual rates equal to either
    (a) LIBOR for 1, 2, 3 or 6 month periods, as selected
    by the Company, plus an applicable margin ranging between 3.75%
    and 4.25%, or (b) the higher of the prime rate, the Federal
    Funds rate plus 0.5%, or a daily LIBOR rate, plus an applicable
    margin ranging between 2.25% and 2.75%. The Company also pays a
    commitment fee to the Lenders under the ABL Facility on the
    average amount by which the aggregate commitments of the
    Lenders’ exceed utilization of the ABL Facility equal to
    1.00% per annum during any



quarter that this excess is 50% or more, and 0.75% per annum
    during any quarter that this excess is less than 50%.

The ABL Facility includes certain affirmative and negative
    covenants that impose restrictions on Mohawk’s financial
    and business operations, including limitations on debt, liens,
    investments, fundamental changes, asset dispositions, dividends
    and other similar restricted payments, transactions with
    affiliates, payments and modifications of certain existing debt,
    future negative pledges, and changes in the nature of the
    Company’s business. Many of these limitations are subject
    to numerous exceptions. The Company is also required to maintain
    a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.1 to 1.0 during any period
    that the unutilized amount available under the ABL Facility is
    less than 15% of the amount available under the ABL Facility.

The ABL Facility is scheduled to mature on September 2,
    2013 but the maturity date will accelerate to:
    (i) October 15, 2010 if the Company’s outstanding
    5.75% senior notes due January 15, 2011 have not been
    repaid, refinanced, defeased or adequately reserved for by the
    Company, as reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent,
    prior to October 15, 2010, and (ii) January 15,
    2012, if the Company’s outstanding 7.20% senior notes
    due April 15, 2012 have not been repaid, refinanced,
    defeased or adequately reserved for by the Company, as
    reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent, prior to
    January 15, 2012. The Company can make adequate reserves
    for such senior notes with unrestricted cash on hand and
    unutilized borrowing availability under the ABL Facility. The
    Company believes cash and cash equivalents and availability
    under the ABL Facility will be sufficient to satisfy the
    October 15, 2010 requirements of the ABL Facility, although
    there can be no assurances the Company will have adequate
    reserves as defined in the ABL Facility.

As of December 31, 2009, the amount considered used under
    the ABL Facility was $113,451 leaving a total of $461,871
    available under the ABL Facility. The amount used under the ABL
    Facility is composed of $53,542 of standby letters of credit
    guaranteeing the Company’s industrial revenue bonds and
    $59,909 of standby letters of credit related to various
    insurance contracts and foreign vendor commitments.

During 2009, the Company terminated its Euro 130,000,
    five-year unsecured, revolving credit facility and its
    on-balance sheet trade accounts receivable securitization
    agreement, which allowed for borrowings up to $250,000 based on
    available accounts receivable.

On January 17, 2006, the Company issued $500,000 aggregate
    principal amount of 5.750% notes due 2011 and $900,000
    aggregate principal amount of 6.125% notes due 2016.
    Interest payable on each series of the notes is subject to
    adjustment if either Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.
    (“Moody’s”) or Standard & Poor’s
    Ratings Services (“Standard & Poor’s”),
    or both, downgrades the rating assigned to the notes. Each
    rating agency downgrade results in a 0.25% increase in the
    interest rate, subject to a maximum increase of 1% per rating
    agency. If later the rating of these notes improves, then the
    interest rates would be reduced accordingly. Each 0.25% increase
    in the interest rate of these notes would increase the
    Company’s interest expense by approximately $3,500 per
    year. Currently, the interest rates have been increased by an
    aggregate amount of 0.75% as a result of downgrades by
    Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s during 2009.
    These downgrades increase the Company’s interest expense by
    approximately $10,500 per year and could adversely affect the
    cost of and ability to obtain additional credit in the future.
    Additional downgrades in the Company’s credit ratings could
    further increase the cost of its existing credit and adversely
    affect the cost of and ability to obtain additional credit in
    the future.

In 2002, the Company issued $400,000 aggregate principal amount
    of its senior 7.2% notes due 2012.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Natural
    Gas Risk Management

The Company uses a combination of natural gas futures contracts
    and long-term supply agreements to manage unanticipated changes
    in natural gas prices. The contracts are based on forecasted
    usage of natural gas measured in Million British Thermal Units
    (“MMBTU”).

The Company has designated the natural gas futures contracts as
    cash flow hedges. The outstanding contracts are valued at market
    with the offset applied to other comprehensive income, net of
    applicable income taxes and any hedge ineffectiveness.

Any gain or loss is reclassified from other comprehensive income
    and recognized in cost of goods sold in the same period or
    periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. As
    of December 31, 2009, the Company had no outstanding
    natural gas contracts. As of December 31, 2008, the Company
    had natural gas contracts that matured from January 2009 to
    December 2009 with an aggregate notional amount of approximately
    2,650 MMBTU’s. The fair value of these contracts was a
    liability of $5,913 as of December 31, 2008. The offset to
    these liabilities is recorded in other comprehensive income, net
    of applicable income taxes. The ineffective portion of the
    derivative is recognized in the cost of goods sold within the
    consolidated statements of operations and was not significant
    for the periods reported.

The Company’s natural gas long-term supply agreements are
    accounted for under the normal purchase provision within ASC
    815, formerly SFAS No. 133 and its amendments. As of
    December 31, 2009, the Company had no outstanding normal
    purchase commitments for natural gas. As of December 31,
    2008, the Company had normal purchase commitments of
    approximately 2,026 MMBTU’s for periods maturing from
    January 2009 through December 2009. The contracted value of
    these commitments was approximately $17,151 as of
    December 31, 2008.

Foreign
    Currency Rate Management

The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to
    hedge foreign denominated costs associated with its operations
    in Mexico. The objective of these transactions is to reduce
    volatility of exchange rates where these operations are located
    by fixing a portion of their costs in U.S. currency.
    Accordingly, these contracts have been designated as cash flow
    hedges. Gains and losses are reclassified from other
    comprehensive income and recognized in cost of goods sold in the
    same period or periods during which the hedged transaction
    affects earnings. The Company had no outstanding forward
    contracts to purchase Mexican pesos as of December 31,
    2009. The Company had forward contracts to purchase
    approximately 269,129 Mexican pesos as of December 31,
    2008. The fair value of these contracts was a liability of
    $5,237 as of December 31, 2008. The aggregate
    U.S. dollar value of these contracts as of
    December 31, 2008 was approximately $23,923. The offset to
    these liabilities is recorded in other comprehensive income, net
    of applicable income taxes. The ineffective portion of the
    derivative is recognized in the cost of goods sold within the
    consolidated statements of operations and was not significant
    for the periods reported.

Product
    Warranties

The Company warrants certain qualitative attributes of its
    products for up to 50 years. The Company records a
    provision for estimated warranty and related costs in accrued
    expenses, based on historical experience and periodically
    adjusts these provisions to reflect actual experience.

(11)  Stock
    Options, Stock Compensation and Treasury Stock

The Company recognizes compensation expense for all share-based
    payments granted based on the

grant-date

fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of ASC

718-10.

Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over
    the options estimated lives for fixed awards with ratable
    vesting provisions.

Under the Company’s 2007 Incentive Plan (“2007
    Plan”), which was approved by the Company’s
    stockholders on May 16, 2007, the Company reserved up to a
    maximum of 3,200 shares of common stock for issuance upon
    the grant or exercise of stock options, restricted stock,
    restricted stock units (“RSU’s”) and other types
    of awards, to directors and key employees through 2017. Option
    awards are granted with an exercise price equal to the market
    price of the Company’s common stock on the date of the
    grant and generally vest between three and five years with a

10-year

contractual term. Restricted stock and RSU’s are granted
    with a price equal to the market price of the Company’s
    common stock on the date of the grant and generally vest between
    three and five years.

During 1996, the Company adopted the 1997 Non-Employee Director
    Stock Compensation Plan. The plan provides for awards of common
    stock of the Company for non-employee directors to receive in
    lieu of



cash for their annual retainers. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, a
    total of 2, 1 and 1 shares, respectively, were awarded to
    the non-employee directors under the plan.

In addition, the Company maintains an employee incentive program
    that awards restricted stock on the attainment of certain
    service criteria. The outstanding awards related to these
    programs and related compensation expense was not significant
    for any of the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

The Company’s Board of Directors has authorized the
    repurchase of up to 15,000 shares of the Company’s
    outstanding common stock. For the year ended December 31,
    2009, 2008 and 2007 no shares of the Company’s common stock
    were purchased. Since the inception of the program, a total of
    approximately 11,512 shares have been repurchased at an
    aggregate cost of approximately $334,747. All of these
    repurchases have been financed through the Company’s
    operations and banking arrangements.

On October 31, 2005, the Company entered into a Discounted
    Stock Purchase Agreement (the “DSPA”) with certain
    members of the Unilin management team (the “Unilin
    Management”). The Company terminated the DSPA during the
    year ended December 31, 2009. Under the terms of the DSPA,
    the Company was obligated to make cash payments to the Unilin
    Management in the event that certain performance goals are
    satisfied. In each of the years in the five-year period ending
    December 31, 2010, the remaining members of the Unilin
    Management could earn amounts, in the aggregate, equal to the
    average value of 30,671 shares of the Company’s common
    stock over the 20 trading day period ending on December 31 of
    the prior year. Any failure in a given year to reach the
    performance goals could have been rectified, and consequently
    the amounts payable with respect to achieving such criteria
    could have been made, in any of the other years. The amount of
    the liability was measured each period and recognized as
    compensation expense in the consolidated statement of
    operations. No expense related to the DSPA was recognized by the
    Company in 2009. The Company expensed approximately $0 and
    $2,300 under the DSPA for the years ended December 31, 2008
    and 2007, respectively.

The fair value of option awards is estimated on the date of
    grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model that uses
    the assumptions noted in the following table. Expected
    volatility is based on the historical volatility of the
    Company’s common stock and other factors. The Company uses
    historical data to estimate option exercise and forfeiture rates
    within the valuation model. Optionees that exhibit similar
    option exercise behavior are segregated into separate groups
    within the valuation model. The expected term of options granted
    represents the period of time that options granted are expected
    to be outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on
    U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of the grant for
    the expected term of the award.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

The Company has a 401(k) retirement savings plan (the
    “Mohawk Plan”) open to substantially all of its
    employees within the Mohawk segment, Dal-Tile segment and, as of
    January 1, 2007, certain U.S. employees of the Unilin
    segment, who have completed 90 days of eligible service.
    For the Mohawk segment, the Company contributes $0.50 for every
    $1.00 of employee contributions up to a maximum of 4% of the
    employee’s salary and an additional $0.25 for every $1.00
    of employee contributions in excess of 4% of the employee’s
    salary up to a maximum of 6%. For the Dal-Tile and Unilin
    segments, the Company contributes $.50 for every $1.00 of
    employee contributions up to a maximum of 6% of the
    employee’s salary. Employee and employer contributions to
    the Mohawk Plan were $34,838 and $13,822 in 2009, $40,393 and
    $16,024 in 2008, and $43,187 and $16,946 in 2007, respectively.
    The Company also made a discretionary contribution to the Mohawk
    Plan of approximately $1,908, $4,211 and $5,500 in 2009, 2008
    and 2007, respectively.

The Company also has various pension plans covering employees in
    Belgium, France, and The Netherlands (the

“Non-U.S. Plans”)

that it acquired with the acquisition of Unilin. Benefits under
    the

Non-U.S. Plans

depend on compensation and years of service. The

Non-U.S. Plans

are funded in accordance with local regulations. The Company
    uses December 31 as the measurement date for its

Non-U.S. Plans.

The discount rate assumptions used to account for pension
    obligations reflect the rates at which the Company believes
    these obligations will be effectively settled. In developing the
    discount rate, the Company evaluated input from its actuaries,
    including estimated timing of obligation payments and yield on
    investments. The rate of compensation increase for the

Non-U.S. Plans

is based upon the Company’s annual reviews.

2015-2019.

The Company expects to make cash contributions of $856 to its

Non-U.S. pension

plans in 2010.

The fair value of the

Non-U.S. pension

plan investments were estimated using market observable data.
    Within the hierarchy of fair value measurements, these
    investments represent Level 2 fair values. The fair value
    and percentage of each asset category of the total investments
    held by the plans as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 were as

This amount includes $85 and $29 of non-current deferred tax
    assets which are in deferred income taxes and other non-current
    assets and $2,836 and $3,030 current deferred tax liabilities
    which are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in
    the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2009 and
    2008, respectively.

Management believes it is more likely than not the Company will
    realize the benefits of these deductible differences, with the
    exception of certain carryforward deferred tax assets discussed
    below, based upon the expected reversal of deferred tax
    liabilities and the level of historic and forecasted taxable
    income over periods in which the deferred tax assets are
    deductible.

In accordance with ASC 350, the company is required to test
    goodwill and indefinite-lived assets for impairment annually, or
    more often if an event or circumstance indicates that an
    impairment loss may have been incurred. In 2008, the Company
    recorded a non-cash pretax impairment charge of $1,543,397 to
    reduce the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles. The
    tax impact was to book an expense of $406,577 related to the
    portion of the impaired assets that are non-deductible for tax
    purposes.

The Company evaluates its ability to realize the tax benefits
    associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing its forecasted
    taxable income using both historic and projected future
    operating results, the reversal of existing temporary
    differences, taxable income in prior carry-back years (if
    permitted) and the availability of tax planning strategies. The
    valuation allowance as of December 31, 2009 and
    December 31, 2008 is $365,944 and $343,572, respectively.
    The December 31, 2009 valuation allowance relates to net
    operating losses and tax credits of $168,773 and intangibles of
    $197,171. The December 31, 2008 valuation allowance relates
    to net operating losses and tax credits of $127,525 and
    intangibles of $216,047. For 2009, the total change in the
    valuation allowance was an increase of $22,372, which includes
    an accumulated other comprehensive income change of $6,740
    primarily related to foreign currency translation, and a
    non-P&L change of $3,418 primarily related to current year
    state tax credits which have a full valuation allowance.



As of December 31, 2009, the Company has state net
    operating loss carryforwards and state tax credits with
    potential tax benefits of $53,550, net of federal income tax
    benefit; these carryforwards expire over various periods based
    on taxing jurisdiction. A valuation allowance totaling $32,473
    has been recorded against these deferred tax assets as of
    December 31, 2009. In addition, as of December 31,
    2009, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards in
    various foreign jurisdictions of $161,405. A valuation allowance
    totaling $136,300 has been recorded against these deferred tax
    assets as of December 31, 2009.

In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company moved the
    intellectual property and treasury operations of an indirectly
    owned European entity to a new office in another jurisdiction in
    Europe. The Company also indirectly owned a holding company in
    the new jurisdiction that provided certain treasury functions to
    Unilin, and the move allowed for the consolidation of the
    historical intellectual property and treasury operations to be
    combined with those of the holding company’s treasury
    operations in a single jurisdiction in order to integrate and
    streamline the operations, to facilitate international
    acquisitions and to improve tax and cost efficiencies. This
    restructuring resulted in a step up in the subsidiary’s
    taxable basis of its intellectual property. The step up relates
    primarily to intangible assets which will be amortized over
    10 years for tax purposes. During the fourth quarter of
    2007, the Company evaluated the evidence for recognition of the
    deferred tax asset created through the restructuring and
    determined that, based on the available evidence, the deferred
    tax asset would more likely than not be realized. The deferred
    tax asset recognized as of December 31, 2007 was
    approximately $245,000 and the related income tax benefit
    recognized in the consolidated financial statements was
    approximately $272,000.

During the third quarter of 2008, the Company reassessed the
    need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.
    Actual cash flows have been less than those projected as of
    December 31, 2007, primarily due to the slowing worldwide
    economy and declining sales volume. The Company determined that,
    given the current and expected economic conditions and the
    corresponding reductions in cash flows, its ability to realize
    the benefit of the deferred tax asset related to the European
    step up transaction described above, as well as tax losses
    generated in the same jurisdiction was not more likely than not.
    Accordingly, the Company recorded a valuation allowance against
    the deferred tax asset in the amount of $252,751 during the
    quarter ended September 27, 2008.

The Company does not provide for U.S. federal and state
    income taxes on the cumulative undistributed earnings of its
    foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are permanently
    reinvested. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company
    had not provided federal income taxes on earnings of
    approximately $723,000 and $654,000, respectively, from its
    foreign subsidiaries. Should these earnings be distributed in
    the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject
    to both U.S. income taxes and withholding taxes in various
    foreign jurisdictions. These taxes may be partially offset by
    U.S. foreign tax credits. Determination of the amount of
    the unrecognized deferred US tax liability is not practical
    because of the complexities associated with this hypothetical
    calculation.

Tax
    Uncertainties

In the normal course of business, the Company’s tax returns
    are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such
    examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments
    by these taxing jurisdictions. Accordingly, the Company accrues
    liabilities when it believes that it is not more likely than not
    that it will realize the benefits of tax positions that it has
    taken in its tax returns or for the amount of any tax benefit
    that exceeds the cumulative probability threshold in accordance
    with ASC

740-10,

formerly FASB Interpretation No. 48 “

Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes-an Interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109

”. Differences between the estimated and
    actual amounts determined upon ultimate resolution, individually
    or in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position but
    could possibly be material to the Company’s consolidated
    results of operations or cash flow in any given quarter or
    annual period.

The Company adopted the provisions of ASC

740-10

on
    January 1, 2007. Upon adoption, the Company recognized no
    change to opening retained earnings. As of December 31,
    2009, the Company’s gross amount of unrecognized tax
    benefits is $105,779, excluding interest and penalties. If the
    Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the net
    effect would be a benefit of $43,014 to the Company’s
    effective tax rate and a balance sheet adjustment of $62,765,
    exclusive of any benefits related to interest and penalties.



A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

The Company will continue to recognize interest and penalties
    related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of its
    income tax provision. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the
    Company has $47,870 and $39,641, respectively, accrued for the
    payment of interest and penalties, excluding the federal tax
    benefit of interest deductions where applicable. During the
    years ending December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company
    accrued interest and penalties through continuing operations of
    $8,228, $3,657 and $1,115, respectively.

The Company’s

2004-2006

federal income tax returns are currently under examination by
    the Internal Revenue Service. The Company expects this
    examination to end within the next twelve months. The Company is
    also protesting through the IRS Appeals division a few open
    issues related to the audit of its 1999 — 2003 tax
    years. In connection with this protest, the Company paid a
    $35,844 cash bond to the IRS. The Company believes it is
    reasonably possible that it will effectively settle all open tax
    years, 1999 through 2006, with the Internal Revenue Service
    within the next twelve months and expects to make a cash payment
    of approximately $33,000 (including penalties and interest). The
    Company believes it is reasonably possible that the balance of
    unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by an additional
    $36,277 (which includes accrued penalties and interest expense)
    within the next twelve months due to settlements or statutory
    expirations in various tax jurisdictions. Except as noted above,
    the Company has substantially concluded all income tax matters
    related to years prior to 2004.

The Company had approximately $58,603 and $73,928 as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in standby
    letters of credit for various insurance contracts and
    commitments to foreign vendors that expire within two years. In
    addition, as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company
    guaranteed approximately $721 and $85,640 for building leases,
    respectively, related to its operating facilities in France.

The Company is involved in litigation from time to time in the
    regular course of its business. Except as noted below there are
    no material legal proceedings pending or known by the Company to
    be contemplated to which the Company is a party or to which any
    of its property is subject.

In Shirley Williams et al. v. Mohawk Industries, Inc., four
    plaintiffs filed a putative class action lawsuit in January 2004
    in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
    Georgia (Rome Division), alleging that they are former and
    current employees of the Company and that the actions and
    conduct of the Company, including the employment of persons who
    are not authorized to work in the United States, have damaged
    them and the other members of the putative class by suppressing
    the wages of the Company’s hourly employees in Georgia. The
    plaintiffs seek a variety of relief, including (a) treble
    damages; (b) return of any allegedly unlawful profits; and
    (c) attorney’s fees and costs of litigation. In
    February 2004, the Company filed a Motion to Dismiss the
    Complaint, which was denied by the District Court in April 2004.
    Following appellate review of this decision, the case was
    returned to the District Court for further proceedings. On
    December 18, 2007, the plaintiffs filed a motion for class
    certification. On March 3, 2008, the District Court denied
    the plaintiffs motion for class certification. The plaintiffs
    then appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals
    for the 11th Circuit on March 17, 2008. On
    May 28, 2009, the Court of Appeals issued an order
    reversing the District Court’s decision and remanding the
    case back to the District Court for further proceedings on the
    class certification issue. Discovery has been stayed at the
    District Court since the appeal. In August 2009, the Company
    filed a petition for certiorari with the United States Supreme
    Court, which was denied in November 2009. The Company will
    continue to vigorously defend itself against this action.

In Collins & Aikman Floorcoverings, Inc., et.
    al. v. Interface, Inc., United States District Court for
    the Northern District of Georgia (Rome Division), Mohawk
    Industries, Inc. joined Collins & Aikman
    Floorcoverings, Inc. (“CAF”) and Shaw Industries
    Group, Inc. (“Shaw”) in suing Interface, Inc.
    (“Interface”) for declaratory judgments that United
    States Patent 6,908,656 (the “Patent”), assigned to
    Interface and relating to certain styles of carpet tiles, is not
    infringed and is invalid. Also in June 2005, in Interface, Inc.,
    et al. v. Mohawk Industries, Inc., et. al. United States
    District Court for the Northern District of Georgia (Atlanta
    Division), Interface sued Mohawk Industries, Inc., Mohawk Carpet
    Corporation, and Mohawk Commercial, Inc. for allegedly
    infringing the Patent. Interface brought similar suits against
    entities affiliated with CAF and Shaw. Interface sought monetary
    damages as well as injunctive relief. The cases were
    consolidated in the United States District Court for the
    Northern District of Georgia (Rome Division). During the second
    quarter of 2009, the Company and Interface reached a settlement
    and the pending cases were dismissed by the District Court on
    June 26, 2009.

The Company believes that adequate provisions for resolution of
    all contingencies, claims and pending litigation have been made
    for probable losses and that the ultimate outcome of these
    actions will not have a material adverse effect on its financial
    condition but could have a material adverse effect on its
    results of operations in a given quarter or year.

The Company has received partial refunds from the United States
    government in reference to settling custom disputes dating back
    to 1982. Accordingly, the Company recorded a net gain of $9,154
    ($5,799 net of taxes) in other income (expense) for the
    year ended December 31, 2007. No refunds were received in
    2009 or 2008. Additional future recoveries will be recorded as
    realized.

The Company is subject to various federal, state, local and
    foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations,
    including those governing air emissions, wastewater discharges,
    the use, storage, treatment and disposal of solid and hazardous
    materials, and the cleanup of contamination associated
    therewith. Because of the nature of the Company’s business,
    the Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs
    relating to compliance with such laws and regulations. The
    Company is involved in various proceedings relating to
    environmental matters and is currently engaged in environmental
    investigation, remediation and post-closure care programs at
    certain sites. The Company has provided accruals for such
    activities that it has determined to



be both probable and reasonably estimable. The Company does not
    expect that the ultimate liability with respect to such
    activities will have a material adverse effect on its
    operations, but may have an effect on a given quarter or annual
    period.

In the normal course of business, the Company has entered into
    various collective bargaining agreements with its workforce in
    Europe, Mexico and Malaysia, either locally or within its
    industry sector. Historically, the Company has maintained
    favorable relationships with its workforce and expects to do so
    in the future.

The Company recorded pre-tax business restructuring charges of
    $61,725 for 2009, of which $43,436 was recorded as cost of sales
    and $18,289 was recorded as selling, general and administrative
    expenses. The Company recorded pre-tax business restructuring
    charges of $29,670 for 2008, of which $15,687 was recorded as
    cost of sales and $13,983 was recorded as selling, general and
    administrative expenses. The charges primarily relate to the
    Company’s actions taken to lower its cost structure and
    improve the efficiency of its manufacturing and distribution
    operations as it adjusts to current economic conditions.

Segment
    Reporting

The Company has three reporting segments, the Mohawk segment,
    the Dal-Tile segment and the Unilin segment. The Mohawk segment
    manufactures, markets and distributes its product lines
    primarily in North America, which include carpet, rugs, pad,
    ceramic tile, hardwood, resilient and laminate, through its
    network of regional distribution centers and satellite
    warehouses using company-operated trucks, common carrier or rail
    transportation. The segment product lines are sold through
    various selling channels, which include floor covering
    retailers, home centers, mass merchandisers, department stores,
    independent distributors, commercial dealers and commercial end
    users. The Dal-Tile segment manufactures, markets and
    distributes its product lines primarily in North America, which
    include ceramic tile, porcelain tile and stone products, through
    its network of regional distribution centers and
    company-operated sales service centers using company-operated
    trucks, common carriers or rail transportation. The segment
    product lines are purchased by floor covering retailers, home
    centers, independent distributors, tile specialty dealers, tile
    contractors, and commercial end users. The Unilin segment
    manufactures, markets and distributes its product lines
    primarily in North America and Europe, which include laminate
    flooring, wood flooring, roofing systems, insulation panels and
    other wood products through various selling channels, which
    include retailers, home centers and independent distributors.

Amounts disclosed for each segment are prior to any elimination
    or consolidation entries. Corporate general and administrative
    expenses attributable to each segment are estimated and
    allocated accordingly. Segment performance is evaluated based on
    operating income. No single customer accounted for more than 5%
    of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008
    and 2007.

Controls
    and Procedures

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
    Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), which
    have been designed to provide reasonable assurance that such
    controls and procedures will meet their objectives, as of the
    end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
    concluded that such controls and procedures were effective at a
    reasonable assurance level for the period covered by this report.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). The
    Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of its
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009. In making this assessment, the
    Company’s management used the criteria set forth by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (“COSO”) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. The
    Company’s management has concluded that, as of
    December 31, 2009, its internal control over financial
    reporting is effective based on these criteria. The
    Company’s independent registered public accounting firm,
    KPMG LLP, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting, which is included
    herein.

Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting during the period covered by this
    report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
    to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

Limitations
    on the Effectiveness of Controls

The Company’s management recognizes that a control system,
    no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
    reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
    control system are met. Further, the design of a control system
    must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and
    the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their
    costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control
    systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
    assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if
    any, within the Company have been detected.
