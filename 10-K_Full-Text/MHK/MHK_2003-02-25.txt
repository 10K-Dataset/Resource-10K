Item 1.

Business

General

Mohawk
Industries, Inc. ("Mohawk" or the "Company", a term which
includes the Company and its subsidiaries, including its primary operating
subsidiaries, Mohawk Carpet Corporation, Aladdin Manufacturing Corporation and
Dal-Tile International Inc. ("Dal-Tile")) is the leading producer of
floorcovering products for residential and commercial applications in the
United States. The Company is the second largest carpet and rug manufacturer,
and a leading manufacturer, marketer and distributor of ceramic tile and
natural stone, in the United States. On a pro forma basis after giving effect
to the acquisition of Dal-Tile as if it had occurred on January 1, 2002, the
Company had annual net sales in 2002 of approximately $4.8 billion.

Through
the Company's Mohawk segment, the Company designs, manufactures and markets
carpet and rugs in a broad range of colors, textures and patterns and is a
leading producer of woven and tufted broadloom carpet and rugs for principally
residential applications. The Company also markets and distributes hardwood,
laminate, vinyl and ceramic tile under its hardsurface line. The Company
positions its products in all price ranges and emphasizes quality, style,
performance and service. The Company is widely recognized through its premier
brand names, which include "Mohawk," "Aladdin,"
"Mohawk Home," "Bigelow Commercial," "Custom
Weave," "Durkan Commercial," "Durkan Patterned
Carpets," "Goodwin Weavers," "Helios,"
"Horizon," "Karastan," "Karastan Contract,"
"ColorCenter," "Mohawk Commercial,"
"Floorscapes," "Newmark Rug," "World" and
"WundaWeve." The Company markets and distributes its carpet and rug
products through over 35,000 customers, which include primarily independent
carpet retailers, home centers, mass merchandisers, department stores,
commercial dealers and commercial end users. Some products are also marketed
through private labeling programs. The Company's carpet and rug operations are
vertically integrated from the extrusion of resin and post-consumer plastics
into fiber, to the conversion of fiber into yarn and to the manufacture and
shipment of finished carpet and rugs.

Through
the Company's Dal-Tile segment, the Company designs, manufactures and markets a
broad line of wall, floor, quarry and mosaic tile products used in the
residential and commercial markets for both new construction and remodeling.
Most of the Company's ceramic tile products are marketed under the
"Dal-Tile" and "American Olean" brand names. The Company's
ceramic tile business is organized into three strategic business channels:
contractors and retailers, independent distributors and home center retailers.
The Company maintains over 220 sales service centers in the United States,
Canada and Puerto Rico. The Company's independent distributor unit distributes
the American Olean brand through approximately 200 independent distributor
locations serving a variety of residential and commercial customers. The
Company's home center retailer unit supplies products to more than 2,000 home
center retail outlets operating in the do-it-yourself and buy-it-yourself
markets. Each business unit has a dedicated sales force supporting that unit.

The Dal-Tile Acquisition

On
March 20, 2002, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of
Dal-Tile, a leading manufacturer and distributor of ceramic tile in the United
States for approximately $1,469 million, consisting of approximately 12.9
million shares of the Company's common stock, options to purchase approximately
2.1 million shares of the Company's common stock and $718 million in cash. The
Company's common stock and options were valued at $751 million based on the
measurement date stock price of $55.04 per share ($710.4 million) and the estimated
fair value of options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model ($40.3
million). The transaction has been accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting and, accordingly, the results of operations of Dal-Tile have been
included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from March 20,
2002. The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed based upon estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess
of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets
acquired of approximately $1,168.3 million was recorded as goodwill. The
primary reasons for the acquisition included:


the ability to combine Mohawk's
     current efforts in the hard-flooring business with Dal-Tile's larger, more
     established ceramic tile and natural stone business;

the opportunity to use Mohawk and Dal-Tile's existing
distribution channels to increase sales of both carpets and hard
floorcoverings;

the potential to reduce overhead and other costs by
adding Dal-Tile's distribution network to Mohawk's logistical and distribution
system;

the potential to reduce manufacturing costs and
increase quality by identifying manufacturing best practices; and

the potential to reduce general, administrative,
overhead and other miscellaneous costs by spreading fixed costs over a larger
business.

As
a result of the Dal-Tile acquisition, the Company has determined that it has
two operating segments, the Mohawk segment and the Dal-Tile segment. The Mohawk
segment is comprised of all the product lines and operations that were the
Company's prior to the Dal-Tile acquisition. The Dal-Tile segment is comprised
of the Dal-Tile product lines and operations. Selected financial information
for the Mohawk and Dal-Tile segments is set forth in Note 17 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Industry

The
floorcovering industry has grown from $12.4 billion in sales in 1992 to $20.2
billion in 2001. In 2001, the primary categories of the United States
floorcovering industry were carpet and rugs (65%), ceramic tile (10%), vinyl
and rubber (12%), hardwood (9%) and laminate (4%). Each of these categories has
been positively impacted by:

U.S.
     population growth, requiring new and renovated housing and commercial
     space;

increasing average house size (up approximately 33%
     since 1980); and

growth in vacation homes.

Compound
average growth rates for units sold (measured by square yards) for each of the
floorcovering categories above for the period from 1992 through 2001, with the
exception of the vinyl and rubber category, have exceeded the growth rate for
both the gross domestic product of the United States and housing starts over
the same period. During this period, the compound average growth rate was 4.5%
for carpet and rugs, 9.6% for ceramic tile, 3.1% for vinyl and rubber and 8.1%
for hardwood. Laminate, which is a relatively new product, experienced a
compound average growth rate of 33.6% from 1996 through 2001.

According
to the most recent figures available from the United States Department of
Commerce, worldwide carpet and rug sales volume of American manufacturers and
their domestic divisions was 1.9 billion square yards in 2001. This volume
represents a market in excess of approximately $12 billion. The overall level of
sales in the carpet industry is influenced by a number of factors, including
consumer confidence, spending for durable goods, interest rates, turnover in
housing, the condition of the residential and commercial construction
industries and the overall strength of the economy.

Broadloom
carpet, defined as carpet over six feet by nine feet in size, represented 78%
of the amounts shipped by the industry in 2001. Tufted broadloom carpet, a
category that refers to the manner of construction in addition to size,
represented 84.2% of the broadloom industry volume shipped in 2001. The
broadloom carpet industry has two primary markets, residential and commercial,
with the residential market making up approximately 71% of industry amounts
shipped in 2001 and the commercial market comprising approximately 29%. An
estimated 48% of industry shipments are made in response to replacement demand,
which usually involves exact yardage, or "cut order," shipments that
typically provide higher profit margins than sales of carpet sold in full
rolls. Because the replacement business generally involves higher quality
carpet cut to order by the manufacturer, rather than the dealer, this business
tends to be more profitable for manufacturers than the new construction
business.

The United States ceramic tile industry shipped 2.3
billion square feet, or $2.1 billion, in 2001. The compound average growth rate
of dollar shipments was 7.1% from 1992 through 2001 for ceramic tile. Sales in


the ceramic tile industry are influenced by the same factors
that influence the carpet industry, including consumer confidence, spending for
durable goods, interest rates, turnover in housing, the condition of the
residential and commercial construction industries and the overall strength of
the economy.

The
ceramic tile industry's two primary markets, residential applications and
commercial applications, represent 61.8% and 36.1% of the industry total,
respectively. Of the total residential market, 67% of the dollar shipments are
for new construction.

Sales and Distribution

Mohawk Segment

.

The
Company designs, manufactures and markets hundreds of styles of carpet and rugs
in a broad range of colors, textures and patterns. In addition, the Mohawk
segment markets and distributes ceramic tile, laminate, hardwood and vinyl
floor covering. The Mohawk segment positions its products in all price ranges
and emphasizes quality, style, performance and service. The Company markets and
distributes carpet and rugs through over 35,000 customers, which include
independent carpet retailers, home centers, mass merchandisers, department
stores, commercial dealers, and commercial end users. Some products are also
marketed through private labeling programs.

Sales
to residential customers represent a significant portion of the total industry
and the majority of the Company's carpet and rug sales. The Company's customers
include independent retailers, department stores, mass merchandisers, retail
groups and contractors.

The
Company has positioned its premier residential carpet and rug brand names
across all price ranges. "Mohawk," "Custom Weave,"
"WundaWeve," "Galaxy," "Horizon,"
"Helios" and "Karastan" are positioned to sell primarily in
the medium-to-high retail price range in the residential broadloom market, and
these lines are also sold under private labels. These lines have substantial
brand name recognition among carpet dealers and retailers with the
"Karastan," and "Mohawk" brands having the highest consumer
recognition in the industry. "Karastan" is the leader in the
exclusive high-end market. The "Aladdin" and "World" brand
names compete primarily in the low-to-medium retail price range.

The
Company offers marketing and advertising support through dealer programs like
Karastan Gallery, ColorCenter and Floorscapes. These programs offer varying
degrees of support to dealers in the form of sales and management training,
merchandising systems, exclusive promotions and assistance in certain
administrative functions such as consumer credit, advertising and insurance.

The
Company's sales forces are generally organized based on product type and sales
channels in order to best serve each type of customer. A hub-and-spoke
distribution network accomplishes the product distribution on a regional level.
In this system, the Company's trucks generally deliver product from
manufacturing and central distribution sites to regional warehouses. From
there, it is shipped to retailers or to local distribution warehouses, then to
retailers.

The
commercial customer base is divided into several channels: educational
institutions, corporate office space, hospitality facilities, retail space and
health care facilities. In addition, the Company produces and sells carpet for
the export market, the federal government and other niche businesses. Different
purchase decision makers and decision-making processes exist for each channel.

The
Company's "Aladdin" commercial brand is sold primarily through retail
dealers to customers in the retail space, corporate office and other channels.
These customers are more price conscious in their purchase decisions. The
"Bigelow Commercial" brand is sold primarily to commercial office and
retail channels through commercial flooring contractors. The "Karastan
Contract" and "Durkan Commercial" brands are positioned
primarily to service the medium to high-end fashion conscious customer in both
the retail and corporate office channels. The "Mohawk Commercial"
brand is marketed to customers in the educational institutional and health care
facility channels that are performance oriented. The "Durkan
Hospitality" brand specializes in carpet sold through the hospitality
channel to hotels, resorts and casinos.


The
Company believes its ability to make woven carpet under the Mohawk Commercial
and Karastan Contract brand names in large volume for commercial applications
differentiates it from other manufacturers, most of which produce tufted carpet
almost exclusively. Woven carpet, and specifically the Company's woven
interlock products, provides unique characteristics that delivers a better
value to the customer and the Company. The Company believes that it is one of
the largest producers of woven carpet in the United States and that it has
several carpet weaving machines and processes that no other manufacturer has,
thereby allowing it to create carpet to meet specifications that its
competitors cannot duplicate.

The
Mohawk Home Division is the largest textile and machine made rug manufacturer
in the United States. Mohawk Home's affordable price points strategy for the
mainstream retailers and home centers is directed at the mid and lower retail
price ranges. Product categories are diverse, including polypropylene woven and
tufted rugs, printed and woven nylon rugs, doormats and washable bath rugs. The
flooring products are marketed under the Mohawk Home label and private labels
of key retailers. Mohawk Home is the largest manufacturer of washable bath rugs
offering synthetic and cotton fibers constructed using hand guided and machine
made technology.  Mohawk Home has set up
relationships sourcing some of its domestic lines from countries in the far
east.

Mohawk
Home has expanded its market position to include decorative throws and pillows,
woven bedspreads, textile wall hangings and blankets.  These products are sold under the Mohawk Home label to large
retailers as well as catalog houses, private label programs, and the gift
trade.

The
Karastan brand of area rugs was repositioned under Mohawk Home during the
fourth quarter of 2002 as the division's premier high-end brand.  The addition of Karastan to Mohawk Home will
enable it to leverage channels of distribution and brand recognition and
maximize market penetration to, retailers and gift storeowners. The Karastan
and Mohawk Home brand names enable Mohawk Home to differentiate its product
lines and market its product lines through various price points.

Dal-Tile Segment

.

The
Dal-Tile segment's ceramic tile and natural stone products are distributed
through three separate distribution channels consisting of company-operated
sales service centers, independent distributors and home center retailers. The
business is organized into three strategic business units to address the specific
customer needs of each distribution channel. A dedicated sales force supports
each strategic business unit.

The
Company has four regional distribution centers strategically located in
California, Maryland, Texas and Florida. These centers help the Company
maintain high-quality customer service in each distribution channel by focusing
on shorter lead times, increased order fill rates and improved on-time
deliveries to its customers. These distribution centers also enhance the
Company's ability to plan and schedule production and manage inventory
requirements.

Sales
Service Centers.

The Company's network of over 220 sales service centers
located in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico distributes primarily the
Dal-Tile brand product, serving customers in all 50 states and portions of
Canada and Puerto Rico.

The
Company serves as a "one-stop" source that provides customers with
one of the ceramic tile industry's broadest product lines-a complete selection
of glazed floor tile, glazed wall tile, glazed and unglazed ceramic mosaic
tile, porcelain tile, quarry tile and stone products, as well as allied
products. In addition to products manufactured by the Company's ceramic tile
business, the Company carries a selection of products purchased from other
manufacturers to provide customers with a broader product line.

Independent
Distributors

. The independent distributor channel is serviced through a
dedicated business unit to serve the particular requirements of its
distributors. Currently, the American Olean brand is distributed through
approximately 200 independent distributor locations that service a variety of
residential and commercial customers. The Company is focused on increasing its
presence in the independent distributor channel, particularly in tile products
that are most commonly used in flooring applications.

Home-Center
Retailers

. The Company believes its Dal-Tile segment is one of the U.S.
ceramic tile industry's largest suppliers to the do-it-yourself and
buy-it-yourself markets through home center retailers, such as The


Home Depot and Lowe's. The home center retailer channel has
provided this segment with new sources of sales over the past five years and is
expected to continue presenting important growth opportunities.

Brands
and Marketing Programs

. The Company believes that it has two of the leading
brand names in the U.S. ceramic tile industry-Dal-Tile and American Olean. The
roots of the Dal-Tile and American Olean brand names date back approximately
fifty and seventy-five years, respectively.

The
Company's sales service centers primarily distribute the Dal-Tile brand, with a
fully integrated marketing program, emphasizing a focus on fashion. The broad
product offering satisfies the needs of its residential, commercial and builder
customers, which include retailers, professional installers, designers,
architects and builders.

The
American Olean brand consists of a full product offering and is distributed
primarily through independent distributors. The brand is supported by a fully
integrated marketing program, including public relations efforts, displays,
merchandising (sample boards, chip chests), literature/catalogs and an Internet
website.

Advertising and Promotion

The
Company promotes its brands through national advertising in both television and
print media as well as in the form of cooperative advertising, point-of-sale
displays and marketing literature provided to assist in marketing various
carpet and ceramic tile styles. The Company also continues to rely on the
substantial brand name recognition of its product lines. The cost of producing
display samples, a significant promotional expense, is partially offset by
sales of samples and support from suppliers in the carpet and rug business.

Manufacturing and Operations

Carpet
and Rugs Business.

The Company's manufacturing operations are vertically
integrated and include the extrusion of resin and post-consumer plastics into
polypropylene, polyester and nylon fiber, yarn processing, tufting, weaving,
dyeing, coating and finishing. Capital expenditures are primarily focused on
increasing capacity, improving productivity and reducing costs. Over the past
three years, the Company has incurred significant capital expenditures that
have helped increase manufacturing efficiency and capacity, and improve overall
cost competitiveness.

Ceramic
Tile Business.

Over the past three years, the Dal-Tile segment has invested
significantly in capital expenditures, principally for new plants and
state-of-the-art fast-fire equipment to increase manufacturing capacity,
improve efficiency and develop new capabilities. In addition, the Company is
adding a porcelain tile manufacturing plant, which will significantly expand
its production capacity in 2003 and 2004.

The
ceramic tile business commenced operations in Mexico at the Company's Monterrey
facility in 1955 and since then has been manufacturing products at this
facility for U.S. and Mexican consumption. The Monterrey location produces
ceramic tile frit (ground glass) and refractories.

The
Company believes that its manufacturing organization offers competitive
advantages due to its ability to manufacture a differentiated product line
consisting of one of the industry's broadest product offerings of colors,
textures and finishes, as well as the industry's largest offering of trim and
angle pieces and its ability to utilize the industry's newest technology.

Raw Materials and Suppliers

Carpet
and Rugs Business.

The principal raw materials the carpet and rug business
uses are nylon staple fibers, nylon filament fibers, raw wool, polypropylene
filament fibers, polyester staple fibers, polypropylene, nylon and polyester
resins and post-consumer plastics, synthetic backing materials, polyurethane
and latex and various dyes and chemicals. The Company obtains all of its major
raw materials from independent sources and all of its externally purchased
nylon fibers from four major suppliers: E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company,
Solutia, Inc., BASF Corporation and Honeywell, Inc. In January 2003, Honeywell
announced plans to purchase BASF's nylon fiber business. Most of the fibers the
Company uses in carpet production are treated with stain-resistant chemicals.
The carpet and rug business has not experienced significant shortages of raw
materials in


recent years. The Company believes that the loss of any one
supplier to its carpet and rug business would not have a material effect on its
business and that an alternative supply arrangement could be made in a
relatively short period of time.

Ceramic
Tile Business.

In the Company's ceramic tile business, the Company
manufactures wall tile primarily from talc and clay; floor tile and glazed
mosaic tile primarily from impure nepheline syenite and clay; unglazed ceramic
tile primarily from pure nepheline syenite and clay; and unglazed quarry tile
from clay. The Company has entered into a long-term supply agreement for most
of its talc requirements with one supplier.

The
Company owns long-term clay mining rights in Alabama, Kentucky and Mississippi
that satisfy nearly all of its clay requirements for producing unglazed quarry
tile. The Company purchases a number of different grades of clay for the
manufacture of its non-quarry tile. The Company believes that there is an
adequate supply of all grades of clay and that all are readily available from a
number of independent sources.

The
Company has a single source supplier for its impure nepheline syenite and pure
nepheline syenite requirement. If there were a supply interruption other
suppliers of these raw materials should be available.

Glazes
are used on a significant percentage of the Company's manufactured tile. Glazes
consist of frit (ground glass), zircon, stains and other materials, with frit
being the largest ingredient. The Company manufactures approximately 43% of its
frit requirements.

Competition

Carpet
and Rugs Business.

The carpet and rugs industry is
highly competitive. Based on industry publications, the top 20 North American
carpet and rug manufacturers (including their American and foreign divisions)
in 2001 had worldwide sales in excess of $13.3 billion, and the top 20
manufacturers in 1990 had sales in excess of $6 billion. In 2001, the top five
manufacturers had worldwide sales in excess of $9.8 billion. With 2002 carpet
and rug net sales of approximately $3.2 billion, the Company believes it is the
second largest producer of carpet and rugs (in terms of sales volume).

Ceramic
Tile Business.

The Company estimates that over 100
tile manufacturers, more than half of which are based outside the United
States, compete for sales of ceramic tile to customers located in the United
States. Although the U.S. ceramic tile industry is highly fragmented at both
the manufacturing and distribution levels, the Company believes it is the
largest manufacturer, distributor and marketer of ceramic tile in the United
States and one of the largest in the world.

The
principal methods of competition within the carpet and rugs and ceramic tile
industries are price, style, quality and service. In each of the Company's
markets, price competition and market coverage are particularly important
because there is relatively little perceived differentiation among competing
product lines. The Company's recent investments in modernized, advanced
manufacturing and data processing equipment, the extensive diversity of
equipment in which the Company has invested and its marketing strategy
contribute to its ability to compete primarily on the basis of performance,
quality, style and service, rather than just price.

In
each of the Company's carpet and rug and ceramic tile businesses, the Company
faces competition from a large number of domestic and foreign manufacturers and
independent distributors of floorcovering products. Some of the Company's
existing and potential competitors may be larger and have greater resources and
access to capital than the Company does. Maintaining the Company's competitive
position may require it to make substantial investments in its product
development efforts, manufacturing facilities, distribution network and sales
and marketing activities. Competitive pressures may also result in decreased
demand for the Company's products and in the loss of market share. In addition,
the Company faces, and will continue to face, pressure on sales prices of its
products from competitors, as well as from large customers. As a result of any
of these factors, there could be a material adverse effect on the Company's
sales and profitability.

The
Company uses several trademarks that it considers important in the marketing of
its products, including "Aladdin," "American Olean

"Bigelow Commercial," "Custom Weave" "Dal-Tile

Sales Terms and Major
Customers

The
Company's sales terms are the same as those generally available throughout the
industry. The Company generally permits its customers to return broadloom
carpet and ceramic tile purchased from it within 30 days from the date of sale,
if the customer is not satisfied with the quality of the product. This return
policy is consistent with the Company's emphasis on quality, style and
performance and promotes customer satisfaction without generating enough
returns to affect materially its operating results or financial position.

During
2002, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of Mohawk's total net
sales. The Company believes the loss of one or a few major customers would not
have a material adverse effect on its business.

Employees

As
of February 24, 2003, the Company employed approximately 31,780 persons, of which
approximately 570 of its employees in the United States and approximately 3,000
of its employees in Mexico are members of unions. Other than with respect to
these employees, the Company is not a party to any collective bargaining
agreements. Additionally, the Company has not experienced any strikes or work
stoppages for over 20 years. The Company believes that its relations with its
employees are good.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

The
Company is involved in routine litigation from time to time in the regular
course of its business. Except as noted below, there are no material legal
proceedings pending or known to be contemplated to which the Company is a party
or to which any of its property is subject.

Environmental Matters

The
Company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental
health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing air
emissions, wastewater discharges, the use, storage, treatment and disposal of
solid and hazardous materials, and the cleanup of contamination associated
therewith. Because of the nature of the Company's business, the Company has
incurred, and will continue to incur, costs relating to compliance with such
laws and regulations. The Company is involved in various proceedings relating
to environmental matters and is currently engaged in environmental
investigation, remediation and post-closure care programs at certain sites. The
Company has provided reserves for such activities that it has determined to be
both probable and reasonably estimable. The Company does not expect that the
ultimate liability with respect to such activities will have a material adverse
effect on it.


Three
sites near Mohawk's Dallas facility in its Dal-Tile segment are involved in
environmental cleanup projects relating principally to the disposal or alleged
disposal by Dal-Tile of waste materials containing lead compounds. Dal-Tile's
approved closure plans have been implemented and each site is now undergoing post-closure
care.  Dal-Tile has been named as a
potentially responsible party under the federal Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA") and similar state

Item
7.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

General

During
the three-year period ended December 31, 2002, the Company continued to
experience growth both internally and through acquisitions.

On
November 14, 2000, the Company acquired certain assets of Crown Crafts. Under
the agreement, the Company paid approximately $37 million in cash for
substantially all of the fixed assets and inventory of the division. The
acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.

On
March 20, 2002, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of
Dal-Tile, a leading manufacturer and distributor of ceramic tile in the United
States, for approximately $1,469 million, consisting of approximately 12.9
million shares of the Company's common stock, options to purchase approximately
2.1 million shares of the Company's common stock and $718 million in cash. The
Company's common stock and options were valued at $751 million based on the
measurement date stock price of $55.04 per share ($710.4 million) and the
estimated fair value of options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
($40.3 million). The transaction will be accounted for using the purchase
method of accounting and, accordingly, the results of operations of Dal-Tile
have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from
March 20, 2002. The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based upon estimated fair values at the date of
acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net
identifiable assets acquired of approximately $1,168.3 million was recorded as
goodwill. The primary reasons for the acquisition included:

the ability to combine Mohawk's
     current efforts in the hard-flooring business with Dal-Tile's larger, more
     established ceramic tile and natural stone business;

the opportunity to use Mohawk and Dal-Tile's existing
distribution channels to increase sales of both carpets and hard
floorcoverings;

the potential to improve service and reduce costs by
adding Dal-Tile's distribution network to Mohawk's logistical and distribution
system;

the potential to reduce manufacturing costs and
increase quality by identifying manufacturing best practices; and

the potential to reduce general, administrative,
overhead and other miscellaneous costs by spreading fixed costs over a larger
business.

Effective
November 1, 2000, the Company entered into an agreement with Congoleum
Corporation, Inc., to become a national distributor of their vinyl products.
This agreement was the final step, which gave the Company access to a complete
line of soft and hard floor covering products to supply to customers throughout
the United States.

The
primary categories
of the floorcovering industry include carpet and rugs (65%), ceramic tile
(10%), vinyl and rubber (12%), hardwood (9%) and laminate (4%).  Compound average growth rates in units sold
(measured in square yards) for all categories, except the vinyl and rubber
category, for the period from 1992 through 2001 have exceeded the growth rate
for both the gross domestic product of the United States and housing starts
over the same period.  During this
period, the compound average growth rate was 4.5% for carpet and rugs, 9.6% for
ceramic tile, 3.1% for vinyl and rubber and 8.1% for hardwood.  Laminate, which is a relatively new product,
experienced a compound average growth rate of 33.6% from 1996 through
2001.  Although beginning from a smaller
base, the growth rates for hard floorcoverings may indicate increasing consumer
preference for these products for certain applications.  In response to this increasing demand, the
Company has increased its distribution of hard surface products, including
ceramic tile, vinyl, hardwood and laminate. The acquisition of Dal-Tile
provides a unique opportunity to help the Company achieve its strategic goal of
becoming one of the world's leading floorcovering manufacturers and
distributors.

As
a result of the Dal-Tile acquisition, the Company has determined that it has
two operating segments, the Mohawk segment and the Dal-Tile segment. The Mohawk
segment is comprised of all the product lines and operations that were the
Company's prior to the Dal-Tile acquisition. The Dal-Tile segment is comprised
of the Dal-Tile product lines and operations.


Critical Accounting Policies

The
Company's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations are based on its consolidated financial statements that were
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.

The
Company makes estimates and assumptions when preparing financial statements.
These estimates and assumptions affect various matters, including:

reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the
     Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets at the dates of the financial
     statements,

disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
     the dates of the financial statements, and

reported amounts of expenses in the Company's
     Consolidated Statements of Earnings during the reporting periods. These
     estimates involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future
     economic factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management's
     control. As a result, actual amounts could differ from these estimates.

The
SEC issued disclosure guidance for accounting policies that management believes
are most "critical." The SEC defines these critical accounting
policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company's
financial condition and results and require management's most difficult, subjective,
or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the
effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent
periods.

The
Company believes the following accounting policies require it to use more
significant judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial
statements and could represent critical accounting policies as defined by the
SEC. The Company discusses its significant accounting policies, including those
that do not require management to make difficult, subjective, or complex
judgments or estimates, in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Accounts receivable and revenue recognition. Revenues
     are recognized when goods are shipped, which is when legal title passes to
     the customer. The Company provides allowances for expected cash discounts,
     returns, claims and doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debt and
     claims experience and periodic evaluation of the aging of accounts
     receivable. If the financial condition of the Company's customers were to
     deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments,
     additional allowances may be required.

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market
     (net realizable value). Cost is determined using the last-in, first-out
     method (LIFO) predominantly within the Mohawk segment, which matches
     current costs with current revenues, and the first-in, first-out method
     (FIFO), which is used to value inventory within the Dal-Tile segment.
     Inventories on hand are compared against anticipated future usage, which
     is a function of historical usage, in order to evaluate obsolescence and
     excessive quantities. Actual results could differ from assumptions used to
     value obsolete or excessive inventory and additional reserves may be
     required.

Goodwill and intangible assets are subject to annual
 impairment testing. The impairment tests are based on determining the fair
 value of the specified reporting units based on management judgments and
 assumptions using estimated future cash flows. These judgments and assumptions
 could materially change the value of the specified reporting units and,
 therefore, could materially impact the Company's consolidated financial
 statements.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
 future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
 statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
 respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
 enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the
 temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on
 deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rates is recognized
 in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date. Additionally,
 taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with the Company's tax
 treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax
 effects going forward. Accounting rules require these future effects to be
 evaluated using current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change
 at any time and in an unpredictable manner.


Results of Operations

Year Ended December 31, 2002, as Compared with Year
Ended December 31, 2001

Net
sales for the year ended December 31, 2002, were $4,522.3 million, reflecting
an increase of $1,076.4 million, or approximately 31.2%, over the $3,445.9
million reported in the year ended December 31, 2001. The increased net sales
were attributable to the Dal-Tile acquisition and internal growth of the Mohawk
segment product lines. The Mohawk segment recorded net sales of $3,624.2
million in 2002 compared to $3,445.9 million in 2001, representing an increase
of $178.2 million or approximately 5.2%. The growth was attributable to all segment
product lines. Since the completion of the Dal-Tile acquisition, the Dal-Tile
segment recorded net sales of $898.2 million in 2002. A comparison of net sales
for the Dal-Tile segment for 2002 and 2001, in each case including Dal-Tile's
net sales (after reclassifications to conform to Mohawk's presentation) prior
to the acquisition, shows an increase of $97.4 million, or approximately 9.4%,
from $1,036.8 million to $1,134.2 million.

Quarterly
net sales and the percentage changes in net sales by quarter for 2002 versus
2001 were as follows (dollars in thousands):

%

Gross
profit was $1,237.1 million (27.4% of net sales) for 2002 and $832.9 million
(24.2% of net sales) for 2001. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales in
2002 was favorably impacted when compared to 2001 by Dal-Tile's higher gross
profit percentage and improved manufacturing efficiencies within the Mohawk
segment.

Selling,
general and administrative expenses for 2002 were $718.0 million (15.9% of net
sales) compared to $505.7 million (14.7% of net sales) for 2001. The increased
percentage was attributable to the Dal-Tile segment which has higher selling,
general and administrative expenses but also has higher gross profit as a
percentage of net sales. The Mohawk and Dal-Tile (including selling, general
and administrative costs prior to the acquisition of Dal-Tile) segments
selling, general and administrative expenses reflected improvements over 2001,
when compared to 2002. The improvements were due to better control of operating
costs as net sales increased.

Operating
income for 2002 was $519.1 million (11.5% of net sales) compared to $327.2
million (9.5% of net sales) in 2001. Operating income attributable to the
Mohawk segment was $388.4 million (10.7% of segment net sales) in 2002 compared
to $336.7 million (9.8% of segment net sales) in 2001. Operating income
attributable to the Dal-Tile segment was $139.9 million (15.6% of segment net
sales) in 2002.  A comparison of
operating income for the Dal-Tile segment's 2002 and 2001, in each case
including Dal-Tile's operating income (after reclassifications to conform to
Mohawk's presentation) prior to the acquisition, shows an increase of $17.1
million, or approximately 11.1%, from $154.6 million (14.9% of segment net
sales) to $171.7 million (15.1% of segment net sales).

Interest
expense for 2002 was $69.0 million compared to $29.8 million in 2001.  The increase in interest expense was
attributable to additional debt incurred in March 2002 to finance the
acquisition of Dal-Tile, the write-off of approximately $10.7 million relating
to an interest rate swap previously accounted for as a cash flow hedge and an
increase in the average borrowing rate due to a change in the mix of fixed rate
and variable rate debt, when compared to 2001.


Income
tax expense was $159.1 million, or 35.9% of earnings before income taxes for
2002 compared to $102.8 million, or 35.3% of earnings before income taxes for
2001.

Year
Ended December 31, 2001, as Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2000

Net
sales for the year ended December 31, 2001, were $3,445.9 million, reflecting
an increase of $41.9 million, or approximately 1.2%, over the $3,404.0 million
reported in the year ended December 31, 2000. The Company believes that the
2001 net sales increase was attributable primarily to internal growth in
carpet, rugs, padding and hard surface products.

Quarterly
net sales and the percentage changes in net sales by quarter for 2001 versus
2000 were as follows (dollars in thousands):

Gross
profit was $832.9 million (24.2% of net sales) for 2001 and $822.8 million
(24.2% of net sales) for 2000. Favorable material and fuel costs and an
improved product mix impacted gross profit dollars for 2001.

Selling, general and
administrative expenses for 2001 were $505.7 million (14.7% of net sales)
compared to $505.7 million (14.9% of net sales) for 2000.

Interest
expense for 2001 was $29.8 million compared to $38.0 million in 2000.  The primary factors contributing to the
decrease were lower debt levels compared to 2000.

Income
tax expense for 2001 was $102.8 million or 35.3% of earnings before income
taxes.  In 2000, income tax expense was
$105.0 million, representing 39.2% of earnings before income taxes. The
reduction in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to tax credits and
other tax strategies.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

The
Company's primary capital requirements are for working capital, capital
expenditures and acquisitions.  The
Company's capital needs are met primarily through a combination of internally
generated funds, bank credit lines, term and senior notes, the sale of
receivables and credit terms from suppliers.

The
level of accounts receivable increased from $404.9 million at the beginning of
2002 to $501.1 million at December 31, 2002. 
The $96.2 million increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition
of Dal-Tile.  Inventories increased from
$531.4 million at the beginning of 2002 to $678.0 million at December 31, 2002,
due primarily to the Dal-Tile acquisition.

The
outstanding checks in excess of cash represent trade payables checks that have
not yet cleared the bank. When the checks clear the bank, they are funded by
the revolving credit facility. This policy does not impact any liquid assets on
the consolidated balance sheets.

Excluding
the acquisition of Dal-Tile, capital expenditures totaled $111.9 million during
2002. The capital expenditures made during 2002 were incurred primarily to
modernize and expand manufacturing facilities and equipment.  The Company's capital projects are primarily
focused on increasing capacity, improving productivity and reducing costs.  Capital expenditures, including $754.5
million for acquisitions, have totaled $992.8 million over the past three
years. The Company's capital spending during 2003, excluding acquisitions, is
expected to range from $120 million to $140 million, and will be used primarily
to purchase equipment to increase production capacity and productivity.


The
Company's revolving line of credit agreement provides for an interest rate of
either (i) LIBOR plus 0.2% to 0.5%, depending upon the Company's performance
measured against certain financial ratios, or (ii) the prime rate less 1.0% and
has a termination date of January 28, 2004. 
At December 31, 2002, the Company had credit facilities of $450 million
under its revolving credit line and $55 million under various short-term
uncommitted credit lines. At December 31, 2002, a total of $462.5 million was
unused under these lines. All of these lines are unsecured. The credit
agreement contains customary financial and other covenants.  The Company must pay an annual facility fee
ranging from .0015 to .0025 of the total credit commitment, depending upon the
Company's performance measured against specific coverage ratios, under the
revolving credit line.

In
connection with the Dal-Tile acquisition, the Company entered into a 364-day
term loan facility (the "Bridge Facility") on March 20, 2002, to
finance a portion of the acquisition. On April 2, 2002, the Company sold $300
million of its 6.50% senior notes due 2007, Series A and $400 million of its
7.20% senior notes due 2012, Series B through institutional private placements
and used the proceeds to repay outstanding indebtedness of approximately $601
million under the Bridge Facility and approximately $0.9 million under the Company's
revolving credit facility. On June 13, 2002, the Company exchanged
approximately $295 million of its registered 6.50% notes due 2007, Series C for
an equal amount of its Series A senior notes and approximately $397.8 million
of its registered 7.20% senior notes due 2012, Series D for an equal amount of
its Series B senior notes. Interest on each series is payable semiannually.

The Company has two trade
accounts receivable securitization agreements with bank agents for asset-backed
commercial paper conduits. These facilities enable the Company to borrow up to
$205 million through the Mohawk segment and up to $75 million through its
Dal-Tile segment. Each securitization is secured by the respective segment trade
receivables and is subject to annual renewal. At December 31, 2002, the Company
had no amounts outstanding under either securitization facility, both of which
were available up to their respective facility limits. At December 31, 2001, the
Mohawk segment had $125 million outstanding secured by approximately $461.1
million of receivables.

The
Company's debt structure also includes a combination of variable rate
industrial revenue bonds and fixed rate term notes and senior notes with
interest rates ranging from 1.28% up to 8.46%. The industrial revenue bonds
mature beginning in 2006 through 2019 and the term and senior notes mature
through 2012. The industrial revenue bonds are backed by unsecured letters of
credit. The term and senior notes are also unsecured. The aggregate principal
amount of industrial revenue bonds, term and senior notes was $815.2 million at
December 31, 2002.

On
January 3, 2001, the Company entered into a five-year interest rate swap, which
converted a notional amount of approximately $100 million of its variable rate
debt to a fixed rate. Under the agreement, payments are made based on a fixed
rate of 5.82% and received on a LIBOR based variable rate. Differentials
received or paid under the agreement will be recognized as interest expense. During
December 2002, the Company determined, based on future cash flow projections,
that the cash flow hedge would more than likely become ineffective as strong
cash flow has allowed the Company to significantly reduce its outstanding LIBOR
based variable rate debt below the $100 million hedged notional amount. The
unrealized loss on the interest rate swap previously included in other
comprehensive income has been recorded as a realized loss in interest expense
in the fourth quarter of 2002. The amount recorded in interest expense was
$10.7 million. The Company continues to carry the liability on the consolidated
balance sheets at its fair value and the interest rate swap will be marked to
market in future reporting periods with any changes being recorded in interest
expense.

The
Company's Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 15 million
shares of its outstanding common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2002, a
total of approximately 1.4 million shares of the Company's common stock were
purchased at an aggregate cost of approximately $64.0 million. Since the
inception of the program, a total of approximately 10.4 million shares have
been repurchased at an aggregate cost of approximately $265.3 million. All of
these repurchases have been financed through the Company's operations and
banking arrangements.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In
June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 143 "

Accounting
for Asset

Retirement Obligations

"("SFAS No.
143"). SFAS No. 143 provides new guidance on the recognition and
measurement of an asset retirement obligation and its associated asset
retirement cost. It also provides accounting guidance for legal obligations
associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets. The Company
adopted SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003 and it is not expected to materially
impact the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In
April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 145,
"

Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB
Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections

." The Statement rescinds
SFAS No. 4, "Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt,"
and an amendment of that Statement, SFAS No. 64, "Extinguishments of Debt
Made to Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements." SFAS No. 145 recognizes that
the use of debt extinguishment can be a part of the risk management strategy of
a company and hence, the classification of all early extinguishment of debt as
an extraordinary item may no longer be appropriate. In addition, the Statement
amends SFAS No. 13, "Accounting for Leases," to eliminate an
inconsistency between the required accounting for sale-leaseback transactions
and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic
effects that are similar to sale-leaseback transactions. Provisions of this
Statement, as they relate to Statement No. 13, are to be effective for
transactions occurring after May 15, 2002. Provisions, which relate to
Statement No. 4, are effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002.
The Company adopted SFAS No. 145 on January 1, 2003, and it is not expected to
materially impact the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In
November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 146,
"

Accounting for the Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities

"
("SFAS No. 146"). SFAS No. 146 is effective for exit or disposal
activities initiated after December 31, 2002, and requires recording costs
associated with exit or disposal activities at their fair values when a
liability has been incurred. Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted
SFAS No. 146 and it is not expected to materially impact the Company's
consolidated financial statements.

In
November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation
No. 45, "

Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others

"
("Fin 45"). Fin 45 requires that the guarantor recognize, at the
inception of certain guarantees, a liability for the fair value of the
obligation undertaken in issuing such guarantee. Fin 45 also requires
additional disclosure about the guarantor's obligations under certain
guarantees that it has issued. The initial recognition and measurement
provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to
guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002 and the disclosure
requirements are effective after December 15, 2002, and are included in footnote
10 to the consolidated financial statements.

In
December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 148,
"

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure an
amendment of FASB Statement No. 123

"("SFAS No. 148").


This statement amends SFAS No. 123 to provide alternative methods of transition
for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation and amends the disclosure requirements of
SFAS 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial
statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation
and the effect of the method used on reported results. The transition and
annual disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148 are effective for fiscal years
ending after December 15, 2002. Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted
the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148 regarding disclosure requirements
for condensed consolidated financial statements for interim periods. The
Company has not determined whether it will voluntarily change to the fair value
based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation.

In
January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation
No. 46, "

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities and Interpretation
of ARB No. 51

" ("Fin 46"). Fin 46 establishes the criteria
for consolidating variable interest entities. The Company is evaluating Fin 46,
which is effective for fiscal years or interim periods beginning after June 15,
2003, to variable entities that were acquired before February 1, 2003. The
Company does not expect Fin 46 to materially impact the Company's consolidated
financial statements.

Impact
of Inflation

Inflation
affects the Company's manufacturing costs and operating expenses. The carpet
and tile industry has experienced inflation in the prices of raw materials and
fuel-related costs. In the past, the Company has generally passed along these
price increases to its customers and has been able to enhance productivity to
offset increases in costs resulting from inflation in both the United States
and Mexico.

Seasonality

The Company is a
calendar year-end company and its
results of operations for the first quarter tend to be the weakest.  The second, third and fourth quarters
typically produce higher net sales and operating income.  These results are primarily due to consumer
residential spending patterns for floorcovering, which historically have
decreased during the first two months of each year following the holiday
season.

Certain factors affecting the Company's performance

In
addition to the other information provided in this Form 10-K, the following
risk factors should be considered when evaluating an investment in shares of Common
Stock.

If any of the events described in these risks
were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's
business, financial condition and results of operations.

The failure to integrate
Mohawk and Dal-Tile successfully by managing the challenges of that integration
may result in the Company not achieving the anticipated potential benefits of
the merger.

The
Company faces challenges in consolidating functions, integrating its
organizations, procedures, operations and product lines in a timely and
efficient manner and retaining key personnel.

These
challenges will result principally because the two companies currently:

maintain executive offices in different locations;

manufacture and sell different types of products
     through different distribution channels;

conduct their businesses from various locations; and

have different employment and compensation
     arrangements for their employees.

In
addition, Dal-Tile has a significant manufacturing operation in Mexico, and the
Company has not previously operated a manufacturing facility outside of the
United States.  As a result, the
integration will be complex and will require additional attention from members
of management.  The diversion of
management attention and any difficulties encountered in the transition and
integration process could have a material adverse effect on the Company's
revenues, level of expenses and operating results.


The
floorcovering industry is cyclical and prolonged declines in residential or
commercial construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's business.

The
U.S. floorcovering industry is highly dependent on residential and commercial
construction activity, including new construction as well as remodeling.  New construction activity and remodeling to
a lesser degree are cyclical in nature and a prolonged decline in residential
or commercial construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. Construction
activity is significantly affected by numerous factors, all of which are beyond
the Company's control, including:

national and
     local economic conditions;

interest rates;

housing demand;

employment
     levels;

changes in disposable
     income;

financing
     availability;

commercial rental
     vacancy rates;

business
     expenditures;

federal and state
     income tax policies; and

consumer
     confidence.

The
U.S. construction industry has experienced significant downturns in the past,
which have adversely affected suppliers to the industry, including suppliers of
floorcoverings. The industry could experience similar downturns in the future,
which could have a negative impact on the Company's business, financial
condition and results of operations.

The Company faces intense
competition in its industry, which could decrease demand for its products and
could have a material adverse effect on its profitability.

The industry is highly competitive. The Company
faces competition from a large number of domestic and foreign manufacturers and
independent distributors of floorcovering products. Some of its existing and
potential competitors may be larger and have greater resources and access to
capital than it does.  Maintaining the
Company's competitive position may require it to make substantial investments
in its product development efforts, manufacturing facilities, distribution
network and sales and marketing activities. Competitive pressures may also
result in decreased demand for its products and in the loss of market
share.  In addition, the Company faces,
and will continue to face, pressure on sales prices of its products from
competitors, as well as from large customers. As a result of any of these factors,
there could be a material adverse effect on the Company's sales and
profitability.

A failure to identify suitable acquisition candidates, to complete
acquisitions and to integrate successfully the acquired operations could have a
material adverse effect on the Company's business.

As
part of its business strategy, the Company intends to pursue acquisitions of
complementary businesses.  Although it
regularly evaluates acquisition opportunities, it may not be able to:

successfully
     identify suitable acquisition candidates;

obtain sufficient
     financing on acceptable terms to fund acquisitions;

complete
     acquisitions; or

profitably
     manage acquired businesses.

Acquired operations may not achieve levels of
sales, operating income or productivity comparable to those of its existing operations,
or otherwise perform as expected. Acquisitions may also involve a number of
special risks, some or all of which could have a material and adverse effect on
the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition,
including, among others:

the Company's inability to integrate
     operations, systems and procedures and to eliminate redundancies and
     excess costs effectively;


diversion of
     management's attention and resources; and

difficulty
     retaining and training acquired key personnel.

The Company may be unable to obtain raw materials on a
timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on its business.

The Company's business is dependent upon a
continuous supply of raw materials from third party suppliers. The principal raw
materials used in its manufacturing operations include: nylon fiber and
polypropylene resin, which are used exclusively in its carpet and rug business;
talc, clay, impure nepheline syenite, pure nepheline syenite and various
glazes, including frit (ground glass), zircon and stains, which are used
exclusively in its ceramic tile business; and other materials. The Company has a single source
supplier for all of its impure nepheline syenite and pure nepheline syenite
requirements.  An extended interruption
in the supply of these or other raw materials used in the Company's business or
in the supply of suitable substitute materials would disrupt the Company's
operations, which could have a material adverse effect on its business,
financial condition and results of operations.

The Company may be unable to pass on to its customers
increases in the costs of raw materials and energy, which could have a material
adverse effect on its profitability.

Significant increases in the costs of raw
materials and natural gas used in the manufacture of the Company's products
could have a material adverse effect on its operating margins and its business,
financial condition and results of operations. 
The Company purchases nylon fiber, polypropylene resin, talc, clay, impure
nepheline syenite, pure nepheline syenite, frit, zircon, stains and other
materials from third party suppliers. 
The cost of some of these materials, like nylon and polypropylene resin,
is related to oil prices. The Company also purchases significant amounts of
natural gas to supply the energy required in some of its production
processes.  The prices of these raw
materials and of natural gas vary with market conditions. Although the Company
generally attempts to pass on increases in the costs of raw materials and
natural gas to its customers, the Company's ability to do so is, to a large
extent, dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase, competitive
pressures and market conditions for its products.  There have been in the past, and may be in the future, periods of
time during which increases in these costs cannot be recovered.  During such periods of time, there could be
a material adverse effect on the Company's profitability.

The Company has been, and
in the future may be subject to claims and liabilities under environmental,
health and safety laws and regulations, which could be significant.

The Company's operations are subject to various
federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and
regulations, including those governing air emissions, wastewater discharges,
and the use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials.  The applicable requirements under these laws
are subject to amendment, to the imposition of new or additional requirements
and to changing interpretations of agencies or courts. New or additional
requirements could be imposed, and the Company could incur material
expenditures to comply with new or existing regulations.

The nature of the Company's operations and
previous operations by others at real property currently or formerly owned or
operated by the Company and the disposal of waste at third party sites exposes
the Company to the risk of claims under environmental, health and safety laws
and regulations. The Company could incur material costs or liabilities in
connection with such claims.  The
Company has been, and will continue to be, subject to these claims.

The discovery of presently unknown environmental
conditions, changes in environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations,
enforcement of existing or new requirements or other unanticipated events could
give rise to expenditures and liabilities, including fines or penalties, that
could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating
results or financial condition.

Changes in international
trade laws and in the business, political and regulatory environment in Mexico
could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.

The Company's Monterrey, Mexico manufacturing facility
represents a significant portion of the Company's total manufacturing capacity
for ceramic tile. Accordingly, an event that has a material adverse impact on
the Company's Mexican operations could have a material adverse effect on the
tile operations as a whole. The


business, regulatory and political environments in Mexico
differ from those in the United States, and the Company's Mexican operations are
exposed to a number of inherent risks, including:

changes in
     international trade laws, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement,
     or NAFTA, affecting the Company's import and export activities in Mexico;

changes in
     Mexican labor laws and regulations affecting the Company's ability to hire
     and retain employees in Mexico;

currency exchange
     restrictions and fluctuations in the value of foreign currency;

potentially
     adverse tax consequences;

local laws
     concerning repatriation of profits;

political
     conditions in Mexico;

unexpected
     changes in the regulatory environment in Mexico; and

changes in general
     economic conditions in Mexico.

The Company could face increased competition as a
result of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the North American
Free Trade Agreement.

The United States is party to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ("GATT"). Under GATT, the United
States currently imposes import duties on ceramic tile imported from countries
outside North America at no more than 12%, to be reduced ratably to no less
than 8.5% by 2004. Accordingly, as these duties decrease, GATT may stimulate
competition from manufacturers in these countries, which now export, or may
seek to export, ceramic tile to the United States. The Company is uncertain
what effect GATT may have on its operations.

The North American Free Trade Agreement
("NAFTA") was entered into by Canada, Mexico and the United States
and over a transition period will remove most customs duties imposed on goods
traded among the three countries. In addition, NAFTA will remove or limit many
investment restrictions, liberalize trade in services, provide a specialized
means for settlement of, and remedies for, trade disputes arising under
applicable laws and will result in new laws and regulations to further these
goals. Although NAFTA lowers the tariffs imposed on the Company's ceramic tile
manufactured in Mexico and sold in the United States, it may also stimulate
competition in the United States and Canada from manufacturers located in
Mexico, which could negatively affect the Company's business.

Forward-Looking Information

Certain of the
matters discussed in the preceding pages, particularly regarding anticipation of
future financial performance, business prospects, growth and operating
strategies, proposed acquisitions, new products and similar matters, and those
preceded by, followed by or that otherwise include the words "believes,"
"expects," "anticipates," "intends," "estimates" or similar expressions
constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities and
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  For those statements, Mohawk claims the
protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements are based on
assumptions regarding the Company's ability to maintain its sales growth and
gross margins and to control costs. These or other assumptions could prove
inaccurate and therefore, there can be no assurance that the "forward-looking
statements" will prove to be accurate. Forward-looking statements involve a
number of risks and uncertainties. The following important factors, in addition
to those discussed elsewhere in this document, affect the future results of
Mohawk and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed
in the forward-looking statements: materially adverse changes in economic
conditions generally in the carpet, rug, ceramic tile and other floorcovering
markets served by Mohawk; the successful integration of Dal-Tile into Mohawk's
business; competition from other carpet, rug, ceramic tile and floorcovering
manufacturers; raw material prices; declines in residential or commercial
construction activity; timing and level of capital expenditures; the successful
integration of acquisitions, including the challenges inherent in diverting
Mohawk management's attention and resources from other strategic matters and
from operational matters for an extended period of time; the successful
introduction of new products; the successful rationalization of existing
operations; and other risks identified from time to time in the Company's SEC
reports and public announcements. Any forward-looking statements represent
Mohawk's estimates only as of the date of this report and should not be relied
upon as representing Mohawk's estimates as of any subsequent date. While Mohawk
may elect to update


forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Mohawk
specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if Mohawk's estimates
change.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk

Financial
exposures are managed as an integral part of the Company's risk management
program, which seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect that the
volatility of the interest rate, exchange rate and natural gas markets may have
on its operating results. The Company does not regularly engage in speculative
transactions, nor does it regularly hold or issue financial instruments for
trading purposes.

Interest Rate Risk Management

The
Company used an interest rate swap contract to adjust the proportion of total
debt that was subject to variable interest rates as compared to fixed interest
rates. Under the interest rate swap contract, the Company agreed to pay an
amount equal to a fixed-rate of interest times a notional principal amount of
$100 million, and to receive in return an amount equal to a specified
variable-rate of interest times the same notional principal amount. The
notional amounts of the contracts are not exchanged, and no other cash payments
are made. The contract fair value is reflected on the consolidated balance
sheets and related gains or losses were deferred in other comprehensive income.
These deferred gains and losses are recognized in income as an adjustment to
interest expense over the same period in which the related interest payments
being hedged are recognized in income. However, to the extent that any of these
contracts are not considered to be 100% effective in offsetting the change in
the value of the interest payments being hedged, any changes in fair value
relating to the ineffective portion of these contracts is immediately
recognized in earnings. During December 2002, the Company determined, based on
future cash flow projections, that the cash flow hedge would more than likely
become ineffective as strong cash flow has allowed the Company to significantly
reduce its outstanding LIBOR based variable rate debt below the $100 million
hedged notional amount. The unrealized loss on the interest rate swap
previously included in other comprehensive income has been recorded as a
realized loss in interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2002. The amount
recorded in interest expense was $10.7 million. The Company continues to carry
the liability on its consolidated balance sheets at its fair value and the
interest rate swap will be marked to market in future reporting periods with
any changes being recorded in interest expense. The floating interest rate at
which the hedge was deemed ineffective was 1.42%. A 50 basis point change in
interest rates would reduce/increase interest expense by approximately $1.5
million.

Natural Gas Risk Management

The
Company uses a combination of natural gas futures contracts and long-term
supply agreements to manage unanticipated changes in natural gas prices. The
contracts are based on forecasted usage of natural gas measured in Million
British Thermal Units ("MMBTU").

The
Company has designated the natural gas futures contracts as cash flow hedges.
The outstanding contracts are valued at market with the offset going to other
comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes and any hedge
ineffectiveness. Any gain or loss is recognized in cost of goods sold in the
same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects
earnings.  At December 31, 2002, the
Company had natural gas contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional amount
of approximately 1.5 million MMBTU's. The fair value of these contracts, which
mature from January 2003 to December 2004, was an asset of $1.9 million, with
the offset recorded in other comprehensive income, net of applicable income
taxes.

The
long-term supply agreements are accounted for under the normal purchases
provision within SFAS No. 133 and its amendments. At December 31, 2002, the
Company has normal purchase commitments of approximately 4.6 million MMBTU's
for periods maturing from January 2003 through August 2005. The contracted
value of these commitments was approximately $17.4 million and the fair value
of these commitments was approximately $19.7 million, at December 31, 2002.

Foreign Currency Rate Management

The
Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge costs
associated with its operations in Mexico. The objective of these transactions
is to reduce volatility of exchange rates where these operations are located by
fixing a portion of their costs in US currency. Gains and losses are recognized
in


cost of goods sold in the same period or periods during which the hedged
transaction affects earnings. Accordingly, these contracts have been designated
as cash flow hedges. At December 31, 2002, the Company had forward contracts
maturing from January 2003 through December 2003, to purchase approximately
357.5 million Mexican pesos. The aggregate U.S. Dollar value of these contracts
at December 31, 2002 was approximately $34.6 million. The contracts are marked
to market in other current liabilities with the offset to other comprehensive
income, net of applicable income taxes. Unrealized losses at December 31, 2002,
were not material.

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000

(In thousands, except per share data)

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a) Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Mohawk Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company" or
"Mohawk").  All significant intercompany balances and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

(b) Accounts Receivable and Revenue Recognition

The Company is principally a broadloom carpet, rug and
ceramic tile manufacturer and sells carpet, rugs, ceramic tile and other
floorcovering materials throughout the United States principally for residential
and commercial use.  The Company grants credit to customers, most of whom
are retail-flooring dealers and commercial end users, under credit terms that
are customary in the industry.

Revenues are recognized when goods are shipped, which is
when the legal title passes to the customer. The Company provides allowances for
expected cash discounts, returns, claims and doubtful accounts based upon
historical bad debt and claims experience and periodic evaluations of the aging
of the accounts receivable.

(c) Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market
(net realizable value).  Cost is determined using the last-in, first-out
(LIFO) method, which matches current costs with current revenues, for
substantially all inventories within the Mohawk segment and the first-in,
first-out (FIFO) method for the Dal-Tile segment inventories.

(d) Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost,
including interest on funds borrowed to finance the acquisition or construction
of major capital additions.  Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line
basis over the estimated remaining useful lives, which are 35 years for
buildings and improvements, 15 years for extrusion equipment, 10 years for
tufting equipment, the life of the lease for leasehold improvements, five years
for vehicles and seven years for other equipment, and furniture and fixtures.

(e) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, the
Company tests goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for
impairment on an annual basis (or on an interim basis if an event occurs that
might reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value). The
Company conducts testing for impairment during the fourth quarter of its fiscal
year.

(f) Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and
liability method.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are


MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Continued)

measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of
a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date.

(g) Financial Instruments

The Company's financial instruments consist primarily of
accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and long-term debt. 
The carrying amount of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
expenses approximates their fair value because of the short-term maturity of
such instruments.  Interest rates that are currently available to the
Company for issuance of long-term debt with similar terms and remaining
maturities are used to estimate the fair value of the Company's long-term debt. 
The estimated fair value of the Company's long-term debt at December 31, 2002
and 2001 was $894,462 and $311,617, compared to a carrying amount of $820,427
and $308,433, respectively.

(h) Derivative Instruments

Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 "

Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities

" ("SFAS No.133") and its amendments which
require the Company to recognize all derivatives on the consolidated balance
sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair
value through earnings. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of
the hedge, changes in its fair value are either offset against the change in
fair value of assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings or
recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in
earnings. The Company engages in activities that expose it to market risks,
including the effects of changes in interest rates, exchange rates and changes
in natural gas prices. Financial exposures are managed as an integral part of
the Company's risk management program, which seeks to reduce the potentially
adverse effect that the volatility of the interest rate, exchange rate and
natural gas markets may have on operating results. The Company does not
regularly engage in speculative transactions, nor does it regularly hold or
issue financial instruments for trading purposes. There was no impact on the
consolidated financial statements upon adoption of SFAS No.133.

The Company formally documents all hedging instruments
and hedging items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for
undertaking hedged items. This process includes linking all derivatives that are
designated as fair value and cash flow hedges to specific assets or liabilities
on the consolidated balance sheet or to forecasted transactions. The Company
also formally assesses, both at inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the
derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in
offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of hedged items. When it is
determined that a derivative is not highly effective, the derivative expires, or
is sold, terminated, or exercised, or the derivative is discontinued because it
is unlikely that a forecasted transaction will occur, the Company discontinues
hedge accounting for that specific hedge instrument.

(i) Fiscal Year

The Company ends its fiscal year on December 31. 
Each of the first three quarters in the fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest
the calendar quarter end.

(

j) Advertising Costs and Vendor
Consideration

Advertising and promotion expenses are charged to
earnings during the period in which they are incurred.  Advertising and
promotion expenses included in selling, administrative and general expenses were
$31,829 in 2002, $28,845 in 2001 and $25,526 in 2000.

In 2001, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 01-09 "

Accounting
for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer

" ("EITF 01-09").
This issuance provides guidance primarily on income statement classification of
consideration from a vendor to a purchaser of the vendor's products. Generally,
cash consideration is to be


MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Continued)

classified as a reduction of net sales, unless specific
criteria are met regarding goods or services that the vendor may receive in
return for this consideration. The Company makes various payments to customers,
including slotting fees, advertising allowances, buy-downs and co-op
advertising. All of these payments reduce gross sales with the exception of
co-op advertising. Co-op advertising is classified as a selling, general and
administrative expense. Co-op advertising expenses were $14,090 in 2002, $11,803
in 2001 and $11,570 in 2000.

(k) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

In 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 144 ("SFAS No. 144"), "

Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.

"  SFAS No. 144 replaced SFAS No. 121,
"

Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of

."
SFAS No. 144 establishes a single accounting model for the impairment or
disposal of long-lived assets including discontinued operations. On determining
that assets have been impaired or are to be disposed of, including discontinued
operations, the Company measures the lower of the carrying value or fair value
less costs to sell, whether reported in continuing operations or discontinued
operations. SFAS No. 144 also broadens the reporting of discontinued operations
to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished
from the rest of the entity.

(l) Earnings per Share ("EPS")

The Company applies the provisions of Financial
Accounting Standards Board SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share, which requires
companies to present basic EPS and diluted EPS.  Basic EPS excludes
dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by
the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. 
Diluted EPS reflects the dilution that could occur if securities or other
contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or
resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the
Company.

Dilutive common stock options are included in the
diluted EPS calculation using the treasury stock method.  Common stock
options that were not included in the diluted EPS computation because the
options' exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common
shares for the periods presented are immaterial.

(m) Effect of New Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued SFAS No. 143, "

Accounting for Asset

Retirement Obligations

"("SFAS
No. 143"). SFAS No. 143 provides new guidance on the recognition and measurement
of an asset retirement obligation and its associated asset retirement cost. It
also provides accounting guidance for legal obligations associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets. The Company adopted SFAS No. 143 on
January 1, 2003, and it is not expected to materially impact the Company's
consolidated financial statements.

In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued SFAS No. 145, "

Rescission of Financial Accounting Standards Board
Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical
Corrections

." The Statement rescinds SFAS No. 4, "Reporting Gains and Losses
from Extinguishment of Debt," and an amendment of that Statement, SFAS No. 64,
"Extinguishments of Debt Made to Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements." SFAS No.
145 recognizes that the use of debt extinguishment can be a part of the risk
management strategy of a company and hence, the classification of all early
extinguishment of debt as an extraordinary item may no longer be appropriate. In
addition, the Statement amends SFAS No. 13, "Accounting for Leases," to
eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale-leaseback
transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that
have economic effects that are similar to sale-leaseback transactions.
Provisions of this Statement, as they relate to Statement No. 13, are to be
effective for transactions occurring after May 15, 2002. Provisions, which
relate to Statement No. 4, are effective for fiscal years beginning after May
15, 2002. The Company adopted SFAS No. 145 on January 1, 2003 and it is not
expected to materially impact the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued SFAS No. 146, "

Accounting for the Costs Associated with Exit or
Disposal Activities,

" ("SFAS No. 146"). SFAS No. 146 is effective for exit
or


MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Continued)

disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002 and requires recording
costs associated with exit or disposal activities at their fair values when a
liability has been incurred. Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS
No. 146 and it is not expected to materially impact the Company's consolidated
financial statements.

In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Interpretation No. 45, "

Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others

" ("Fin 45"). Fin 45 requires that the guarantor recognize, at the
inception of certain guarantees, a liability for the fair value of the
obligation undertaken in issuing such guarantee. Fin 45 also requires additional
disclosure about the guarantor's obligations under certain guarantees that it
has issued. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of this
interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or
modified after December 31, 2002 and the disclosure requirements are effective
after December 15, 2002 and are included in footnote 10 to the consolidated
financial statements.

In December 2002, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 148, "

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation-Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123

"("SFAS
No. 148"). This statement amends SFAS No. 123 to provide alternative methods of
transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting
for stock-based employee compensation and amends the disclosure requirements of
SFAS 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial
statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation
and the effect of the method used on reported results. The transition and annual
disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148 are effective for fiscal years ending
after December 15, 2002. Effective January 1, 2003,
the Company adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148 regarding
disclosure requirements for condensed consolidated financial statements for
interim periods. The Company has not yet determined whether it will voluntarily
change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation.

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Interpretation No. 46, "

Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities and Interpretation of ARB No. 51

" ("Fin 46"). Fin 46 establishes
the criteria for consolidating variable interest entities. The Company is
evaluating Fin 46, which is effective for fiscal years or interim periods
beginning after June 15, 2003, to variable entities that were acquired before
February 1, 2003. The Company does not expect Fin 46 to materially impact the
Company's consolidated financial statements.

(2) Acquisitions

On November 14, 2000, the Company acquired certain fixed
assets and inventory of Crown Crafts, Inc., using the purchase method of
accounting and accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets
acquired and the liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values at the date
of acquisition. The estimated fair values were $37,284 for assets acquired and
$440 for liabilities assumed.

On March 20, 2002, the Company acquired all of the
outstanding capital stock of Dal-Tile International Inc. ("Dal-Tile"), a leading
manufacturer and distributor of ceramic tile in the United States, for
approximately $1,468,325, consisting of approximately 12,900 shares of the
Company's common stock, options to purchase approximately 2,100 shares of the
Company's common stock and approximately $717,638 in cash, including direct
acquisition costs. The Company's common stock and options were valued at
approximately $750,687 based on the measurement date stock price of $55.04 per
share ($710,420) and the estimated fair value of the options using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model ($40,267). The acquisition was accounted for
by the purchase method and, accordingly, the results of operations of Dal-Tile
have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from March
20, 2002. The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair values at the date of
acquisition. The trademark value was established based upon an independent
appraisal. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net
identifiable assets acquired of approximately $1,168,286 was recorded as
goodwill. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax
purposes. The primary reasons for the acquisition included:


MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Continued)

the ability to combine Mohawk's current efforts in the
  hard-flooring business with Dal-Tile's larger, more established ceramic tile
  and natural stone business;

the opportunity to use Mohawk and Dal-Tile's existing
  distribution channels to increase sales of both carpets and hard
  floorcoverings;

the potential to reduce overhead and other costs by adding
  Dal-Tile's distribution network to Mohawk's logistical and distribution
  system;

the potential to reduce manufacturing costs and increase
  quality by identifying manufacturing best practices; and

the potential to reduce general, administrative, overhead
  and other miscellaneous costs by spreading fixed costs over a larger business.

Mohawk considered whether identifiable intangible
assets, such as customer relationships, patents, covenants not to compete,
software, production backlog, marketing agreements, unpatented technology and
trade secrets, might exist and none were identified other than trademarks,
during the purchase price negotiations and during the subsequent purchase price
allocation evaluation. Accordingly, the valuation resulted in the recognition of
goodwill and trademarks.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 142, "

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

"("SFAS No.
142"), goodwill recorded in the Dal-Tile acquisition will not be amortized.
Additionally, the Company determined that the trademark intangible assets have
indefinite useful lives because they are expected to generate cash flows
indefinitely. Goodwill and the trademark intangible assets are subject to annual
impairment testing.

The following table summarizes the preliminary estimated
fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of
acquisition.

The following unaudited pro forma financial information
presents the combined results of operations of Mohawk and Dal-Tile as if the
acquisition had occurred at the beginning of 2001, after giving effect to
certain adjustments, including increased interest expense on debt related to the
acquisition, the elimination of goodwill amortization and related income tax
effects. The pro forma information does not necessarily reflect the results of
operations that would have occurred had Mohawk and Dal-Tile constituted a single
entity during such periods. The following table discloses the results for the
fiscal years ended December 31:

(5) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No.
142,which requires the Company to evaluate its goodwill on an annual basis for
impairment. Furthermore, any goodwill that was acquired in a purchase business
combination completed after June 30, 2001 will not be amortized. Goodwill that
was acquired in business combinations completed before July 1, 2001 is no longer
being amortized. The Company has two reportable units, the Mohawk unit and the
Dal-Tile unit, and accordingly, has assigned the acquired goodwill to the
respective reporting units. The amount assigned to the Mohawk unit was $109,167
and $1,168,286 to the Dal-Tile unit. During the fourth quarter of 2002, the
Company evaluated both reporting units using the discounted cash flow approach
and determined that there was no impairment for either reportable unit.

(7) Long-Term Debt

The Company's revolving line of credit agreement
provides for an interest rate of either (i) LIBOR plus 0.2% to 0.5%, depending
upon the Company's performance measured against certain financial ratios, or
(ii) the prime rate less 1.0% and has a termination date of January 28, 2004. 
At December 31, 2002, the Company had credit facilities of $450,000 under its
revolving credit line and $55,000 under various short-term uncommitted credit
lines. At December 31, 2002, a total of $462,501 was unused under these lines.
All of these lines are unsecured. The credit agreement contains customary
financial and other covenants.  The Company must pay an annual facility fee
ranging from .0015 to .0025 of the total credit commitment, depending upon the
Company's performance measured against specific coverage ratios, under the
revolving credit line.

In connection with the Dal-Tile acquisition, the Company
entered into a 364-day term loan facility (the "Bridge Facility") on March 20,
2002 to finance a portion of the acquisition. On April 2, 2002, the Company sold
$300,000 of its 6.50% senior notes due 2007, Series A and $400,000 of its 7.20%
senior notes due 2012, Series B through institutional private placements and
used the proceeds to repay outstanding indebtedness of approximately $601,000
under the Bridge Facility and approximately $90,000 under the Company's
revolving credit facility. On June 13, 2002, the Company exchanged $294,965 of
its registered 6.50% notes due 2007, Series C for an equal amount of its Series
A senior notes and $397,800 of its registered 7.20% senior notes due 2012,
Series D for an equal amount of its Series B senior notes. Interest on each
series is payable semiannually.

The Company has two trade accounts receivable
securitization agreements with bank agents for asset-backed commercial paper
conduits. These facilities enable the Company to borrow up to $205,000 through
the Mohawk segment and up to $75,000 through its Dal-Tile segment. Each
securitization is secured by the respective segment trade receivables and is
subject to annual renewal. At December 31, 2002, the Company had no amounts
outstanding under either securitization facility, both of which were available
up to their respective facility limits. At December 31, 2001, the Mohawk segment
had $125,000 outstanding secured by approximately $461,072 of receivables.

The Company guarantees the Industrial Revenue Bonds with
various standby letters of credit, which were in aggregate $55,200 at December
31, 2002 and 2001.

(9) Derivative Financial Instruments

Interest Rate Risk Management

The Company used an interest rate swap contract to
adjust the proportion of total debt that was subject to variable interest rates
as compared to fixed interest rates. Under the interest rate swap contract, the
Company agreed to pay an amount equal to a fixed-rate of interest times a
notional principal amount of $100,000, and to receive in return an amount equal
to a specified variable-rate of interest times the same notional principal
amount. The notional amounts of the contracts are not exchanged, and no other
cash payments are made. The contract fair value is reflected on the consolidated
balance sheets and related gains or losses were deferred in other comprehensive
income. These deferred gains and losses are recognized in income as an
adjustment to interest expense over the same period in which the related
interest payments being hedged are recognized in income. However, to the extent
that any of these contracts are not considered to be 100% effective in
offsetting the change in the value of the interest payments being hedged, any
changes in fair value relating to the ineffective portion of these contracts is
immediately recognized in earnings. During December 2002, the Company
determined, based on future cash flow projections, that the cash flow hedge
would more than likely become ineffective as strong cash flow has allowed the
Company to significantly reduce its outstanding LIBOR based variable rate debt
below the $100,000 hedged notional amount. The unrealized loss on the interest
rate swap previously included in other comprehensive income has been recorded in
interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2002. The amount recorded in interest
expense was $10,700. The Company continues to carry the liability on the
consolidated balance sheets at its fair value and it will be marked to market in
future reporting periods with any changes being recorded in interest expense.

Natural Gas Risk Management

The Company uses a combination of natural gas futures
contracts and long-term supply agreements to manage unanticipated changes in
natural gas prices. The contracts are based on forecasted usage of natural gas
measured in Million British Thermal Units ("MMBTU").

The Company has designated the natural gas futures
contracts as cash flow hedges. The outstanding contracts are valued at market
with the offset going to other comprehensive income, net of applicable income
taxes and any hedge ineffectiveness. Any gain or loss is recognized in cost of
goods sold in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction
affects earnings.  At December 31, 2002, the Company had natural gas
contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of approximately 1,450
MMBTU's. The fair value of these contracts, which mature from January 2003 to
December 2004, was an asset of  $1,911, with the offset recorded in other
comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes.

The long-term supply agreements are accounted for under
the normal purchases provision within SFAS No. 133 and its amendments. At
December 31, 2002, the Company has normal purchase commitments of approximately
4,560 MMBTU's for periods maturing from January 2003 through August 2005. The
contracted


MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Continued)

value of these commitments was approximately $17,441 and the
fair value of these commitments was approximately $19,694, at December 31, 2002.

Foreign Currency Rate Management

The Company enters into foreign exchange forward
contracts to hedge costs associated with its operations in Mexico. The objective
of these transactions is to reduce volatility of exchange rates where these
operations are located by fixing a portion of their costs in US currency. Gains
and losses are recognized in cost of goods sold in the same period or periods
during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Accordingly, these
contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges. At December 31, 2002, the
Company had forward contracts maturing from January 2003 through December 2003,
to purchase approximately 357,522 Mexican pesos. The aggregate U.S. Dollar value
of these contracts at December 31, 2002 was approximately $34,581. The contracts
are marked to market in other current liabilities with the offset to other
comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes. Unrealized losses at
December 31, 2002, were not material.

(10) Product warranties

The Company warrants certain qualitative attributes of
its products for up to 20 years. The Company records a provision for estimated
warranty and related costs, based on historical experience and periodically
adjusts these provisions to reflect actual experience.

Stock Options, Stock
Compensation and Treasury Stock

Under the 2002 Long-Term Incentive Plan, options may be
granted to directors and key employees through 2012 to purchase a maximum of
3,200 shares of common stock. Under the 2002 plan, options that were not issued
from the 1992, 1993 and 1997 plans were cancelled.  During 2002, 2001, and
2000 options to purchase 731, 704, and 181 shares, respectively, were granted
under the 1992, 1993, 1997 and 2002 plans. Options granted under each of these
plans expire 10 years from the date of grant and become exercisable at such
dates and at prices as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Company's
Board of Directors. In connection with the acquisition of Dal-Tile, the Company
issued 2,096 options to employees of Dal-Tile in exchange for their respective
options.

During 1996, the Company adopted the 1997 Non-Employee
Director Stock Compensation Plan.  The plan provides for awards of common
stock of the Company for non-employee directors to receive in lieu of cash for
their annual retainers.  During 2002, 2001, and 2000 a total of two, two,
and four shares, respectively, were awarded to the non-employee directors under
the plan.

(12) Employee Benefit Plans

The Company has a 401(k) retirement savings plan (the
"Mohawk Plan") open to substantially all of its employees who have completed 90
days of eligible service.  The Company contributes $0.50 for every $1.00 of
employee contributions up to a maximum of 4% of the employee's salary and an
additional $0.25 for every $1.00 of employee contribution in excess of 4% of the
employee's salary up to a maximum of 6%. Employee and employer contributions to
the Mohawk Plan were $20,237 and $7,359 in 2002, $18,322 and $6,521 in 2001, and
$16,926 and $6,055 in 2000, respectively. The Company also made a discretionary
contribution to the Mohawk Plan of approximately $3,797, $2,500 and $2,500 in
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

The Dal-Tile International Inc. Employees' Retirement
Savings Plan (the "Dal-Tile Plan") is a defined contribution 401(k) plan
covering substantially all Dal-Tile employees.  Employees were eligible to
participate after completion of 60 days of service. Under the terms of the
Dal-Tile Plan, Dal-Tile contributes $.50 for every $1.00 of employee
contributions up to a maximum of 6% of the employee's salary and employees are
vested in the contributions based on years of credited service.  Employee
and employer contributions to the Dal-Tile Plan were $5,026 and $2,103 in 2002,
respectively. The Dal-Tile Plan was merged into the Mohawk Plan effective
January 1, 2003. Dal-Tile also maintains a performance based profit sharing plan
in which the Company contributed approximately $1,588 in 2002.

which the deferred tax assets are deductible, the Company's management believes
it is more likely than not the Company will realize the benefits of these
deductible differences at December 31, 2002.

The Company is obligated under various capital and
operating leases for office and manufacturing space, machinery and equipment.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Continued)

The Company assumed several
capitalized leases from recent acquisitions for machinery and equipment, at a
cost of $5,010 as of December 31, 2002 and 2001. The amortization of these
capital leases is included in depreciation expense. Accumulated amortization was
$4,245 and $2,038 as of December 31, 2002 and 2001.

Rental expense under operating leases
was $62,066, $39,072 and $36,392 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

The Company has approximately $19,600 in standby letters
of credit for various insurance contracts and commitments to foreign vendors
that expire within two years.

The Company is involved in routine litigation from time
to time in the regular course of its business. Except as noted below, there are
no material legal proceedings pending or known to be contemplated to which the
Company is a party or to which any of its property is subject.

The Company is subject to various
federal, state, local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and
regulations, including those governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, the
use, storage, treatment and disposal of solid and hazardous materials, and the
cleanup of contamination associated therewith. Because of the nature of the
Company's business, the Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs
relating to compliance with such laws and regulations. The Company is involved
in various proceedings relating to environmental matters and is currently
engaged in environmental investigation, remediation and post-closure care
programs at certain sites. The Company has provided reserves for such activities
that it has determined to be both probable and reasonably estimable. The Company
does not expect that the ultimate liability with respect to such activities will
have a material adverse effect on it.

Three sites near Mohawk's Dallas facility in its
Dal-Tile segment are involved in environmental cleanup projects relating
principally to the disposal or alleged disposal by Dal-Tile of waste materials
containing lead compounds. Dal-Tile's approved closure plans have been
implemented and each site is now undergoing post-closure care.  Dal-Tile
has been named as a potentially responsible party under the federal
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA")
and similar state statutes for the disposal of certain hazardous substances at
various other sites in the United States.  The Company does not believe
that any future costs for these sites will have a material adverse effect on it.

December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000

(In thousands, except per share data)

(1) Long-Term Debt

The Company's revolving line of credit agreement
provides for an interest rate of either (i) LIBOR plus 0.2% to 0.5%, depending
upon the Company's performance measured against certain financial ratios, or
(ii) the prime rate less 1.0% and has a termination date of January 28, 2004. 
At December 31, 2002, the Company had credit facilities of $450,000 under its
revolving credit line and $55,000 under various short-term uncommitted credit
lines. At December 31, 2002, a total of $462,501 was unused under these lines.
All of these lines are unsecured. The credit agreement contains customary
financial and other covenants.  The Company must pay an annual facility fee
ranging from .0015 to .0025 of the total credit commitment, depending upon the
Company's performance measured against specific coverage ratios, under the
revolving credit line.

In connection with the Dal-Tile acquisition, the Company
entered into a 364-day term loan facility (the "Bridge Facility") on March 20,
2002 to finance a portion of the acquisition. On April 2, 2002, the Company sold
$300,000 of its 6.50% senior notes due 2007, Series A and $400,000 of its 7.20%
senior notes due 2012, Series B through institutional private placements and
used the proceeds to repay outstanding indebtedness of approximately $601,000
under the Bridge Facility and approximately $90,000 under the Company's
revolving credit facility. On June 13, 2002, the Company exchanged $294,965 of
its registered 6.50% notes due 2007, Series C for an equal amount of its Series
A senior notes and $397,800 of its registered 7.20% senior notes due 2012,
Series D for an equal amount of its Series B senior notes. Interest on each
series is payable semiannually.

The Company used an interest rate swap contract to
adjust the proportion of total debt that was subject to variable interest rates
as compared to fixed interest rates. Under an interest rate swap contract, the
Company agreed to pay an amount equal to a fixed-rate of interest times a
notional principal amount, and to receive in return an amount equal to a
specified variable-rate of interest times the same notional principal amount of
$100,000. The notional amounts of the contracts are not exchanged, and no other
cash payments are made. The contract fair value is reflected on the consolidated
balance sheets and related gains or losses are deferred in other comprehensive
income. These deferred gains and losses were recognized in income as an
adjustment to interest expense over the same period in which the related
interest payments being hedged are recognized in income. However, to the extent
that any of these contracts are not considered to be 100% effective in
offsetting the change in the value of the interest payments being hedged, any
changes in fair value relating to the ineffective portion of these contracts is
immediately recognized in earnings. During December 2002, the Company
determined, based on future cash flow projections, that the cash flow hedge
would more than likely become ineffective as strong cash flow has allowed the
Company to significantly reduce its outstanding LIBOR based variable rate debt
below the $100,000 hedged notional amount. The unrealized loss on the interest
rate swap previously included in other comprehensive income has been recorded in
interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2002. The amount recorded in interest
expense was $10,700. The Company continues to carry the liability on the balance
sheet at its fair value and it will be marked to market in future reporting
periods with any changes being recorded in interest expense.
