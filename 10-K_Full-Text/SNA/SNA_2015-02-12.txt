SNAP-ON INCORPORATED


PART I

Safe Harbor

Statements in this document that are not historical facts,
including statements that (i) are in the future tense; (ii) include the words “expects,” “plans,” “targets,” “estimates,” “believes,” “anticipates,” or similar words that
reference

Snap-on

Incorporated (“Snap-on” or “the company”) or its management; (iii) are specifically identified as forward-looking; or (iv) describe Snap-on’s or
management’s future outlook, plans, estimates, objectives or goals, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Snap-on cautions the reader that any forward-looking statements
included in this document that are based upon assumptions and estimates were developed by management in good faith and are subject to risks, uncertainties or other factors that could cause (and in some cases have caused) actual results to differ
materially from those described in any such statement. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results or regarded as a representation by the company or its management that the projected results
will be achieved. For those forward-looking statements, Snap-on cautions the reader that numerous important factors, such as those listed below, as well as those factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly those in “Item
1A: Risk Factors,” could affect the company’s actual results and could cause its actual consolidated results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement made by, or on behalf of, Snap-on.

These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, uncertainties related to estimates, statements, assumptions and projections
generally, and the timing and progress with which Snap-on can attain value through its Snap-on Value Creation Processes, including its ability to realize efficiencies and savings from its rapid continuous improvement and other cost reduction
initiatives, improve workforce productivity, achieve improvements in the company’s manufacturing footprint and greater efficiencies in its supply chain, and enhance machine maintenance, plant productivity and manufacturing line set-up and
change-over practices, any or all of which could result in production inefficiencies, higher costs and/or lost revenues. These risks also include uncertainties related to

Snap-on’s

capability to implement
future strategies with respect to its existing businesses, its ability to refine its brand and franchise strategies, retain and attract franchisees, further enhance service and value to franchisees and thereby help improve their sales and
profitability, introduce successful new products, successfully pursue, complete and integrate acquisitions, as well as its ability to withstand disruption arising from natural disasters, planned facility closures or other labor interruptions, the
effects of external negative factors, including adverse developments in world financial markets, weakness in certain areas of the global economy, and significant changes in the current competitive environment, inflation, interest rates and other
monetary and market fluctuations, changes in tax rates and regulations, and the impact of energy and raw material supply and pricing, including steel and gasoline, the amount, rate and growth of

Snap-on’s

general and administrative expenses, including health care and postretirement costs (resulting from, among other matters, U.S. health care legislation and its implementation), continuing and potentially increasing required contributions to pension
and postretirement plans, the impacts of non-strategic business and/or product line rationalizations, and the effects on business as a result of new legislation, regulations or government-related developments or issues, risks associated with data
security and technological systems and protections, and other world or local events outside

Snap-on’s

control, including terrorist disruptions.

Snap-on

disclaims
any responsibility to update any forward-looking statement provided in this document, except as required by law.

In addition,
investors should be aware that generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) prescribe when a company should reserve for particular risks, including litigation exposures. Accordingly, results for a
given reporting period could be significantly affected if and when a reserve is established for a major contingency. Reported results, therefore, may appear to be volatile in certain accounting periods.

Snap-on’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday that is on or nearest to December 31. Unless otherwise indicated, references in this
document to “fiscal 2014” or “2014” refer to the fiscal year ended January 3, 2015; references to “fiscal 2013” or “2013” refer to the fiscal year ended December 28, 2013; and references to
“fiscal 2012” or “2012” refer to the fiscal year ended December 29, 2012. Snap-on’s 2014 fiscal year contained 53 weeks of operating results, with the extra week occurring in the fourth quarter; Snap-on’s 2013 and
2012 fiscal years each contained 52 weeks of operating results. References in this document to 2014, 2013 and 2012 year end refer to January 3, 2015, December 28, 2013, and December 29, 2012, respectively.

2014 ANNUAL REPORT



Item 1: Business

Snap-on was incorporated under the laws of the state of Wisconsin in 1920 and reincorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in
1930. Snap-on is a leading global innovator, manufacturer and marketer of tools, equipment, diagnostics, repair information and systems solutions for professional users performing critical tasks. Products and services include hand and power tools,
tool storage, diagnostics software, information and management systems, shop equipment and other solutions for vehicle dealerships and repair centers, as well as for customers in industries, including aviation and aerospace, agriculture,
construction, government and military, mining, natural resources, power generation and technical education.

Snap-on

also derives income from various financing programs designed to facilitate the sales of its
products.

Snap-on markets its products and brands through multiple sales distribution channels in more than 130 countries.

Snap-on’s

largest geographic markets include the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Australia, Japan, France, Italy, Sweden, Spain, China, Brazil, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Mexico,
Argentina, Denmark, Norway, India, the Russian Federation, Finland and Indonesia. Snap-on reaches its customers through the company’s franchisee, company-direct, distributor and internet channels. Snap-on originated the mobile tool distribution
channel in the automotive repair market.

The company began with the development of the original Snap-on interchangeable
socket set in 1920 and subsequently pioneered mobile tool distribution in the automotive repair market, where fully stocked vans sell to professional vehicle technicians at their place of business. For many decades, the company was viewed primarily
as a hand tool company selling through vans to vehicle technicians. Today, Snap-on defines its value proposition more broadly, extending its reach “beyond the garage” to deliver a broad array of unique solutions that make work easier for
serious professionals performing critical tasks. Building upon capabilities already demonstrated in the automotive repair arena, the company’s “coherent growth” strategy focuses on developing and expanding its professional customer
base in adjacent markets, additional geographies and other areas, including in critical industries, where the cost and penalties for failure can be high. In addition to its coherent growth strategy, Snap-on is committed to its “Value Creation
Processes” – a set of strategic principles and processes designed to create value and employed in the areas of (i) safety; (ii) quality; (iii) customer connection; (iv) innovation; and (v) rapid continuous
improvement (“RCI”).

Snap-on’s primary customer segments include: (i) commercial and industrial
customers, including professionals in critical industries and emerging markets; (ii) professional vehicle repair technicians who purchase products through the company’s worldwide mobile tool distribution network; and (iii) other
professional customers related to vehicle repair, including owners and managers of independent and original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) dealership service and repair shops (“OEM dealerships”). Snap-on’s Financial Services
customer segment includes: (i) franchisees’ customers and Snap-on’s industrial and other customers who require financing for the purchase or lease of tools and diagnostics and equipment products on an extended-term payment plan; and
(ii) franchisees who require financing for business loans and vehicle leases.

Snap-on’s business segments are based
on the organization structure used by management for making operating and investment decisions and for assessing performance. Snap-on’s reportable business segments are: (i) the Commercial & Industrial Group; (ii) the Snap-on
Tools Group; (iii) the Repair Systems & Information Group; and (iv) Financial Services. The Commercial & Industrial Group consists of business operations serving a broad range of industrial and commercial customers
worldwide, primarily through direct and distributor channels. The Snap-on Tools Group consists of business operations primarily serving vehicle service and repair technicians through the company’s worldwide mobile tool distribution channel. The
Repair Systems & Information Group consists of business operations serving other professional vehicle repair customers worldwide, primarily owners and managers of independent repair shops and OEM dealerships, through direct and distributor
channels. Financial Services consists of the business operations of Snap-on Credit LLC (“SOC”), the company’s financial services business in the United States, and Snap-on’s other financial services subsidiaries in those
international markets where Snap-on has franchise operations. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on business segments and foreign operations.

Snap-on evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment revenues, including both external and intersegment net sales, and segment operating earnings. Snap-on accounts for intersegment
sales and transfers based primarily on standard costs with reasonable mark-ups established between the segments. Identifiable assets by segment are those assets used in the respective reportable segment’s operations. Corporate assets consist of
cash and cash equivalents (excluding cash held at Financial Services), deferred income taxes and certain other assets. All significant intersegment amounts are eliminated to arrive at Snap-on’s consolidated financial results.

On May 28, 2014, Snap-on acquired substantially all of the assets of Pro-Cut International, Inc. (“Pro-Cut”) for a cash
purchase price of $41.3 million. Pro-Cut designs, manufactures and distributes on-car brake lathes, related equipment


SNAP-ON INCORPORATED


and accessories used in brake servicing by automotive repair facilities. The acquisition of the Pro-Cut product line complemented and increased Snap-on’s existing undercar equipment product
offering, broadened its established capabilities in serving vehicle repair facilities and expanded the company’s presence with repair shop owners and managers. For segment reporting purposes, the results of operations and assets of Pro-Cut have
been included in the Repair Systems & Information Group since the date of acquisition. Pro forma financial information has not been presented as the net effects of the

Pro-Cut

acquisition were neither
significant nor material to Snap-on’s results of operations or financial position.

On May 13, 2013, Snap-on
acquired Challenger Lifts, Inc. (“Challenger”) for a cash purchase price of $38.2 million. Challenger designs, manufactures and distributes a comprehensive line of vehicle lifts and accessories to a diverse customer base in the
automotive repair sector. The acquisition of the Challenger vehicle lift product line complemented and increased Snap-on’s existing undercar equipment product offering, broadened its established capabilities in serving vehicle repair
facilities and expanded the company’s presence with repair shop owners and managers. For segment reporting purposes, the results of operations and assets of Challenger have been included in the Repair Systems & Information Group
since the date of acquisition. Pro forma financial information has not been presented as the net effects of the Challenger acquisition were neither significant nor material to Snap-on’s results of operations or financial position.

2014 ANNUAL REPORT



The

diagnostics and repair information

product category includes handheld and
PC-based diagnostic products, service and repair information products, diagnostic software solutions, electronic parts catalogs, business management systems and services, point-of-sale systems, integrated systems for vehicle service shops, OEM
purchasing facilitation services, and warranty management systems and analytics to help OEM dealerships manage and track performance.

vehicle lifts, test lane systems, collision repair equipment, air conditioning service equipment, brake service equipment, fluid exchange equipment, transmission troubleshooting equipment, safety testing equipment, battery chargers and hoists.

Snap-on supports the sale of its diagnostics and vehicle service shop equipment by offering training programs as well as
after-sales support for its customers, primarily focusing on the technologies and the application of specific products developed and marketed by Snap-on.

Products are marketed under a number of brand names and trademarks, many of which are well known in the vehicle service and industrial markets served. Some of the major trade names and trademarks and the
products and services with which they are associated include the following:


SNAP-ON INCORPORATED


Financial Services

Snap-on also generates revenue from various financing programs that include: (i) installment sales and lease contracts arising from
franchisees’ customers and Snap-on’s industrial and other customers for the purchase or lease of tools, including tool storage, and diagnostic and equipment products on an extended-term payment plan; and (ii) business loans and
vehicle leases to franchisees. The decision to finance through Snap-on or another financing entity is solely at the customer’s election. When assessing customers for potential financing, Snap-on considers various factors including financial
condition, collateral, debt-servicing ability, past payment experience and credit bureau information.

United States

In the United States, Snap-on offers financing through SOC and provides financing for new contracts originated by SOC. Financing revenue
from contract originations owned by SOC is recognized by SOC over the life of the contracts, with interest computed on the average daily balances of the underlying contracts.

International

Snap-on also offers financing to its franchisees and
customer networks through its international finance subsidiaries located in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. Snap-on offers financing to its franchisees and customer networks in Ireland, the Netherlands and Germany through its
U.K. finance subsidiary. Snap-on offers financing to its franchisees and customer network in Puerto Rico through SOC. Snap-on’s international finance subsidiaries own and service the receivables originated through their financing programs.
Financing revenue from these contracts is recognized over the life of the contracts, with interest computed on the average daily balances of the underlying contracts.

Other

Franchise fee revenue, including nominal, non-refundable
initial and ongoing monthly fees (primarily for sales and business training, and marketing and product promotion programs), is recognized as the fees are earned. Franchise fee revenue totaled $12.1 million, $11.9 million and $9.9 million in fiscal
2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Sales and Distribution

Snap-on markets and distributes its products and related services principally to professional tool and equipment users around the world. The two largest market sectors are the vehicle service and repair
sector and the industrial sector.

Vehicle Service and Repair Sector

The vehicle service and repair sector has three main customer groups: (i) professional technicians who purchase tools and diagnostic
and equipment products for themselves; (ii) other professional customers related to vehicle repair, including owners and managers of independent repair shops and OEM dealerships who purchase tools and diagnostic and equipment products for use
by multiple technicians within a service or repair facility; and (iii) OEMs.

Snap-on provides innovative tool, equipment
and business solutions, as well as technical sales support and training, designed to meet technicians’ evolving needs. Snap-on’s mobile tool distribution system offers technicians the convenience of purchasing quality tools at their place
of business with minimal disruption of their work routine.

Snap-on

also provides owners and managers of repair shops, where technicians work, with tools, diagnostic equipment, and repair and service
information, including electronic parts catalogs and shop management products. Snap-on’s OEM facilitation business provides OEMs with products and services including tools, consulting and facilitation services, which include product
procurement, distribution and administrative support to customers for their dealership equipment programs.

The vehicle
service and repair sector is characterized by an increasing rate of technological change within motor vehicles, vehicle population growth and increasing vehicle life, and the resulting effects of these changes on the businesses of both our suppliers
and customers. Snap-on believes it is a meaningful participant in the vehicle service and repair market sector.

Industrial Sector

Snap-on markets its products and services globally to a broad cross-section of commercial and industrial customers,
including maintenance and repair operations; manufacturing and assembly facilities; various government agencies, facilities and operations, including military operations; vocational and technical schools; aviation and aerospace operations; OEM and
service and repair customers; oil and gas developers; mining operations; energy and power

2014 ANNUAL REPORT



generation, equipment fabricators and operators; railroad manufacturing and maintenance; customers in agriculture; infrastructure construction companies; and other customers that require
instrumentation, service tools and/or equipment for their product and business needs.

The industrial sector for Snap-on
focuses on providing value-added products and services to an increasingly expanding global base of customers in critical industries, particularly those in the market segments of natural resources, aerospace, government and technical education.
Through its experienced and dispersed sales organization, industrial “solutioneers” develop unique and highly valued productivity solutions for customers worldwide that leverage Snap-on’s product, service and development capabilities.

The industrial sector is characterized by a highly competitive, cost-conscious environment, and a trend toward customers
making many of their tool and equipment purchases through one integrated supplier. Snap-on believes it is a meaningful participant in the industrial tools and equipment market sector.

Distribution Channels

Snap-on serves customers primarily through the
following channels of distribution: (i) the mobile van channel; (ii) company direct sales; (iii) distributors; and (iv) e-commerce. The following discussion summarizes Snap-on’s general approach for each channel, and is not
intended to be all-inclusive.

Mobile Van Channel

In the United States, a significant portion of sales to the vehicle service and repair sector is conducted through

Snap-on’s

mobile franchise van channel.
Snap-on’s franchisees primarily serve vehicle repair technicians and vehicle service shop owners, generally providing weekly contact at the customer’s place of business. Franchisees’ sales are concentrated in hand and power tools,
tool storage products, shop equipment, and diagnostic and repair information products, which can easily be transported in a van and demonstrated during a brief sales call. Franchisees purchase

Snap-on’s

products at a discount from suggested list prices and resell them at prices established by the franchisee. U.S. franchisees are provided a list of calls that serves as the basis of the franchisee’s sales route.

Snap-on

also provides certain franchisees the opportunity to add vans to their franchise or to
add a limited number of additional franchises. Snap-on charges nominal initial and ongoing monthly franchise fees. Since 1991, written franchise agreements have been entered into with all new U.S. franchisees.

Snap-on previously offered an option termed the “Gateway Franchise Program” to certain potential U.S. franchisees,
including those that did not meet the standard franchise qualification requirements. Gateway Franchise Program participants had less upfront investment and were provided an initial base level of consigned inventory from

Snap-on

to assist them in gaining experience and building equity toward the future purchase of a standard franchise. Snap-on ceased offering new Gateway franchises in February 2013 and
anticipates not having any remaining Gateway franchises by the end of February 2015. As of 2014 year end, five of Snap-on’s U.S. franchised routes were operated as Gateway franchises.

Snap-on

also has a company-owned van program in the United States that is designed to:
(i) provide another pool of potential franchisees and field organization personnel; (ii) service customers in select new and/or open routes not currently serviced by franchisees; and (iii) allow

Snap-on

to pilot new sales and promotional ideas prior to introducing them to franchisees. As of 2014 year end, company-owned vans comprised approximately 5% of the total U.S. van population; Snap-on
may elect to increase or reduce the number of company-owned vans in the future.

In addition to its mobile van channel in the
United States, Snap-on has replicated its U.S. franchise distribution model in certain other countries including Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, South Africa, New Zealand, Belgium and Ireland. In many of these
markets, as in the United States, purchase decisions are generally made or influenced by professional vehicle service technicians as well as repair shop owners and managers. As of 2014 year end, Snap-on’s worldwide mobile van count was
approximately 4,800 vans, including approximately 3,500 vans in the United States.

Through SOC, financing is available to
U.S. franchisees, including financing for van leases, working capital loans and loans to help enable new franchisees to fund the purchase of the franchise. In many international markets,

Snap-on

offers a
variety of financing options to its franchisees and/or customer networks through its international finance subsidiaries. The decision to finance through

Snap-on

or another financing entity is solely at
the customer’s election.


SNAP-ON INCORPORATED


Snap-on

supports its franchisees with a field
organization of regional offices, franchise performance teams, Diagnostic Sales Developers (“DSDs”), customer care centers and distribution centers.

Snap-on

also provides sales and business training,
and marketing and product promotion programs, as well as customer and franchisee financing programs through SOC and the company’s international finance subsidiaries, all of which are designed to strengthen franchisee sales. In North America,
the United States National Franchise Advisory Council and the Canadian National Franchise Advisory Council, both of which are composed primarily of franchisees that are elected by franchisees, assist

Snap-on

in identifying and implementing enhancements to the franchise program.

In the United States, franchisees work closely with
DSDs. The DSDs train franchisees on the sale of higher-price-point diagnostics and demonstrate and sell vehicle service shop management and information systems. DSDs work independently and with franchisees to identify and generate sales among
vehicle service technicians and repair shop owners and managers. DSDs are

Snap-on

employees who are compensated through a combination of base salary and commission; a franchisee receives a brokerage fee from
certain sales made by the DSDs to the franchisee’s customers. Most products sold through franchisees and DSDs are sold under the

Snap-on,

Blue-Point and ShopKey brand names.

Company Direct Sales

A
significant proportion of shop equipment sales in North America under the John Bean, Hofmann, Blackhawk, Challenger and Pro-Cut brands, diagnostic products under the

Snap-on

brand and information products
under the Mitchell1 brand are made by direct and independent sales forces that have responsibility for national and other accounts. As the vehicle service and repair sector consolidates (with more business conducted by national chains and
franchised service centers),

Snap-on

believes these larger organizations can be serviced most effectively by sales people who can demonstrate and sell the full line of diagnostic and equipment products and

services. Snap-on

also sells these products and services directly to OEMs and their franchised dealers.

Snap-on

brand tools and equipment are marketed to industrial and governmental customers in the United States through both industrial sales representatives, who are
employees, and independent industrial distributors. Outside of the United States, industrial sales are also conducted through other independent distributors. Sales representatives focus on industrial customers whose main purchase criteria are
quality and integrated solutions. As of 2014 year end, Snap-on had industrial sales representatives in the United States (including Puerto Rico), Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico and various European, Asian, Latin American, Middle Eastern and
African countries, with the United States representing the majority of

Snap-on’s

total industrial sales.

Snap-on also sells software, services and solutions to the automotive, commercial, agriculture, power equipment and power sports segments. Products and services are marketed to targeted groups, including
OEMs and their dealerships, fleets, and individual repair shops. To effectively reach OEMs, which frequently have a multi-national presence, Snap-on has deployed focused business teams globally.

Distributors

Sales of
certain tools and equipment are made through independent distributors who purchase the items from

Snap-on

and resell them to end users. Hand tools under the BAHCO, Fish and Hook, Lindström and Williams
brands and trade names, for example, are sold through distributors in Europe, North and South America, Asia and certain other parts of the world. Wheel service and other vehicle service equipment are sold through distributors primarily under brands
including Hofmann, John Bean, Challenger, Pro-Cut, Cartec and Blackhawk. Diagnostic and equipment products are marketed through distributors in South America and Asia, and through both a direct sales force and distributors in Europe under the

Snap-on,

Sun, BAHCO and Blue-Point brands.

E-commerce

Snap-on’s e-commerce development initiatives allow

Snap-on

to combine the capabilities of
the internet with

Snap-on’s

existing brand sales and distribution strengths to reach new and under-served customer segments.

Snap-on

offers current and prospective
customers online, around-the-clock access to research and purchase products through its public internet website at

www.snapon.com

. The site features an online catalog of

Snap-on

hand tools, power tools,
tool storage units and diagnostic equipment available to customers in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. E-commerce and certain other system enhancement initiatives are designed to improve productivity and further leverage
the one-on-one relationships and service

Snap-on

has with its current and prospective customers. Sales through the company’s e-commerce distribution channel were not significant in any of the last three
years.

2014 ANNUAL REPORT



Competition

Snap-on

competes on the basis of its product quality and performance, product line breadth and depth, service, brand awareness and imagery, technological innovation
and availability of financing (through SOC or its international finance subsidiaries). While Snap-on does not believe that any single company competes with it across all of its product lines and distribution channels, various companies compete in
one or more product categories and/or distribution channels.

Snap-on

believes it is a
leading manufacturer and distributor of professional tools, tool storage, diagnostic and equipment products, and repair software and solutions, offering a broad line of these products to both vehicle service and industrial marketplaces. Various
competitors target and sell to professional technicians in the vehicle service and repair sector through the mobile tool distribution channel;

Snap-on

also competes with companies that sell tools and equipment
to vehicle service and repair technicians through retail stores and online, vehicle parts supply outlets, and tool supply warehouses/distributorships. Within the power tools category and the industrial sector, Snap-on has various other competitors,
including companies with offerings that overlap with other areas discussed herein. Major competitors selling diagnostics, shop equipment and information to vehicle dealerships and independent repair shops include OEMs and their proprietary
electronic parts catalogs, as well as diagnostics and information systems, and other companies that offer products serving this sector.

Raw Materials and Purchased Product

Snap-on’s supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers. Snap-on believes it has secured an ample supply of both bar and coil steel for
the near future to ensure stable supply to meet material demands. The company does not currently anticipate experiencing any significant impact in 2015 from steel pricing or availability issues.

Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property

Snap-on

vigorously pursues and relies on patent protection to protect its intellectual property and position in its markets. As of 2014 year end,

Snap-on

and its subsidiaries held approximately 700 active and pending patents in the United States and approximately 1,500 active and pending patents outside of the United States. Sales relating to any single
patent did not represent a material portion of

Snap-on’s

revenues in any of the last three years.

Examples of products that have features or designs that benefit from patent protection include wheel alignment systems, wheel balancers, tire changers, vehicle lifts, test lanes, brake lathes, sealed
ratchets, electronic torque instruments, ratcheting screwdrivers, emissions-sensing devices and diagnostic equipment.

Much of
the technology used in the manufacture of vehicle service tools and equipment is in the public domain.

Snap-on

relies primarily on trade secret protection to protect proprietary processes used in
manufacturing. Methods and processes are patented when appropriate. Copyright protection is also utilized when appropriate.

Trademarks used by

Snap-on

are of continuing importance to

Snap-on

in the marketplace. Trademarks have been registered in the United States and more than 120 other countries, and additional applications for trademark registrations are pending.

Snap-on

vigorously polices proper use of its trademarks.

Snap-on’s

right to manufacture and sell certain products is dependent upon licenses from others; however, these
products under license do not represent a material portion of

Snap-on’s

net sales.

Domain names have become a valuable corporate asset for companies around the world, including

Snap-on.

Domain names often contain a trademark or service mark or even a corporate name and are often considered intellectual property. The recognition and value of the

Snap-on

name, trademark and domain name are core strengths of the company.

Snap-on

strategically licenses the

Snap-on

brand to carefully selected manufacturing and distribution companies for items such as apparel, work boots, lighting and a variety
of other goods, in order to further build equity and market presence for the company’s strongest brand.


SNAP-ON INCORPORATED


Environmental

Snap-on

is subject to various environmental laws, ordinances, regulations, and other requirements of government authorities in the United States and other nations.
At

Snap-on,

these environmental liabilities are managed through the

Snap-on

Environmental, Health and Safety Management System (“EH & SMS”), which is
applied worldwide. The system is based upon continual improvement and is certified to ISO 14001:2004 and OHSAS 18001:2007, verified through Det Norske Veritas (DNV) Certification, Inc.

Snap-on

believes that it complies with applicable environmental control requirements in its
operations. Expenditures on environmental matters through EH & SMS have not had, and

Snap-on

does not for the foreseeable future expect them to have, a material effect upon

Snap-on’s

capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

Employees

Snap-on employed approximately 11,400 people at the end of January 2015; Snap-on employed approximately 11,300 people at the end of
January 2014.

Approximately 2,600 employees, or 23% of Snap-on’s worldwide workforce, are represented by unions and/or
covered under collective bargaining agreements. The number of covered union employees whose contracts expire over the next five years approximates 1,250 employees in 2015; 400 employees in 2016; and 600 employees in 2017; there are no contracts
currently scheduled to expire in 2018 or 2019. In recent years, Snap-on has not experienced any significant work slowdowns, stoppages or other labor disruptions.

There can be no assurance that these and other future contracts with

Snap-on’s

unions will be renegotiated upon terms acceptable to

Snap-on.

Working Capital

Most of

Snap-on’s

businesses are not seasonal and their inventory needs are relatively constant. Snap-on did not have a significant backlog of orders at 2014
year end. In recent years, Snap-on has been using its working capital to fund, in part, the continued growth of the company’s financial services portfolio.

Snap-on’s liquidity and capital resources and use of working capital are discussed herein in “Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations.”

As of 2014 year end, neither

Snap-on

nor any of its segments
depend on any single customer, small group of customers or government for any material part of its revenues.

Item 1A: Risk Factors

In evaluating the company, careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors, in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Consolidated
Financial Statements and the related notes. Each of these risk factors could adversely affect the company’s business, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in the
company’s common stock.

Economic conditions and world events could affect our operating results.

We, our franchisees and our customers, may be adversely affected by changing economic conditions, including conditions that may
particularly impact specific regions. These conditions may result in reduced consumer and investor confidence, instability in the credit and financial markets, volatile corporate profits, and reduced business and consumer spending. We, our
franchisees and our customers, and the economy as a whole, also may be affected by future world or local events outside our control, such as acts of terrorism, developments in the war on terrorism, conflicts in international situations and natural
disasters, as well as government-related developments or issues. These factors may affect our results of operations by reducing our sales, margins and/or net earnings as a result of a slowdown in customer orders or order cancellations, impact the
availability of raw materials and/or the supply chain, and could potentially lead to future impairment of our intangible assets. In addition, political and social turmoil related to international conflicts and terrorist acts may put pressure on
economic conditions abroad. Unstable political, social and economic conditions may make it difficult for our franchisees, customers, suppliers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. If such conditions persist, our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected.

2014 ANNUAL REPORT



Raw material and energy price fluctuations and shortages (including steel and various
fuel sources) could adversely affect the ability to obtain needed manufacturing materials and could adversely affect our results of operations.

The principal raw material used in the manufacture of our products is steel, which we purchase in competitive, price-sensitive markets. To meet

Snap-on’s

high
quality standards, our steel needs range from specialized alloys, which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers, to commodity types of alloys. These raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality. Some
of these materials have been, and in the future may be, in short supply, particularly in the event of mill shutdowns or production cut backs. As some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures, we could experience inventory shortages
if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice. Additionally, unexpected price increases for raw materials could result in higher prices to our customers or an erosion of the margins on our products.

We believe our ability to sell our products is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road, the number of miles driven and the
general aging of vehicles. These factors affect the frequency, type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians, and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians, the prosperity of technicians and,
consequently, the demand technicians have for our tools, other products and services, and the value technicians place on those products and services. To the extent that the prices of gasoline and other petroleum-based fuels increase, as they have at
times in recent years, consumers may turn to other methods of transportation, including more frequent use of public transportation, which could result in a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles. A decrease in the use of privately
operated vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for our products.

We use various energy sources to transport,
produce and distribute products, and some of our products have components that are petroleum based. Petroleum and energy prices have periodically increased significantly over short periods of time; further volatility and changes may be caused by
market fluctuations, supply and demand, currency fluctuation, production and transportation disruption, world events and changes in governmental programs. Energy price increases raise both our operating costs and the costs of our materials, and we
may not be able to increase our prices enough to offset these costs. Higher prices also may reduce the level of future customer orders and our profitability.

The performance of

Snap-on’s

mobile tool distribution business depends on the success of its franchisees.

Approximately 42% of our 2014 revenues were generated by the

Snap-on

Tools Group, which consists
of

Snap-on’s

business operations serving the worldwide mobile tool distribution channel. Except in limited circumstances, each of our mobile tool vans is operated by a franchisee pursuant to a franchise
agreement.

Snap-on’s

success is dependent on its relationships with franchisees, individually and collectively, as they are the primary sales and service link between the company and vehicle service and
repair technicians, who are an important class of end users for

Snap-on’s

products and services. If our franchisees are not successful, or if we do not maintain an effective relationship with our
franchisees, the delivery of products, the collection of receivables and/or our relationship with end users could be adversely affected and thereby negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

In addition, if we are unable to maintain effective relationships with franchisees, Snap-on or the franchisees may choose to
terminate the relationship, which may result in (i) open routes, in which end-user customers are not provided reliable service; (ii) litigation resulting from termination; (iii) reduced collections or increased write-offs of
franchisee receivables owed to

Snap-on;

and/or (iv) reduced collections or increased write-offs of extended credit contracts.

New and stricter legislation and regulations may affect our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

Increased legislative and regulatory activity and burdens, and a more stringent manner in which they are applied, could significantly
impact our business and the economy as a whole. For example, the Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”), which was adopted in 2010 and is being phased in over several years, significantly affects the provision of both health care services and
benefits in the United States; the ACA may impact our cost of providing our employees and retirees with health insurance and/or benefits, and may also impact various other aspects of our business. The ACA did not have a material impact on our fiscal
2014, 2013 or 2012 financial results; however, we are continuing to assess the impact of the ACA on our health care benefit costs.

Financial services businesses of all kinds are subject to increasing regulation and enforcement. In addition to potentially increasing the costs of doing business due to compliance obligations, new laws
and regulations, or changes to existing


SNAP-ON INCORPORATED


laws and regulations, as well as the enforcement thereof, may affect the relationships between creditors and debtors, inhibit the rights of creditors to collect amounts owed to them, expand
liability for certain actions or inactions, or limit the types of financial products or services offered, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Failure to comply
with any of these laws or regulations could also result in penalties and damage to our reputation, and/or the incurrence of remediation costs.

These developments, and other potential future legislation and regulations, as well as the increasingly strict regulatory environment, may also adversely affect the customers to which, and the markets
into which, we sell our products, and increase our costs and otherwise negatively affect our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition, including in ways that cannot yet be foreseen.

Exposure to credit risks of customers and resellers may make it difficult to collect receivables and could adversely affect operating
results and financial condition.

A decline in industry and/or economic conditions could have the potential to weaken the
financial position of some of our customers. If circumstances surrounding our customers’ ability to repay their credit obligations were to deteriorate and result in the write-down or write-off of such receivables, it would negatively affect our
operating results for the period in which they occur and, if large, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our inability to provide acceptable financing alternatives to end-user customers and franchisees could adversely impact our operating
results.

An integral component of our business and profitability is our ability to offer competitive financing
alternatives to end-user customers and franchisees. The lack of our ability to obtain capital resources or other financing to support our receivables on terms that we believe are attractive, whether resulting from the state of the financial markets,
our own operating performance, or other factors, would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition. Adverse fluctuations in interest rates and/or our ability to provide competitive financing programs could also have an adverse
impact on our revenue and profitability.

Failure to achieve expected investment returns on pension plan assets, as well as
changes in interest rates or plan demographics, could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Snap-on

sponsors various defined benefit pension plans (the “pension plans”). The assets of the pension plans are broadly diversified in an attempt
to mitigate the risk of a large loss. The assets are invested in equity securities, debt securities, hedge funds, real estate and other real assets, insurance contracts, and cash and cash equivalents. Required funding for the
company’s domestic defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with guidelines set forth in the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”); foreign defined benefit pension plans are funded in accordance
with local statutes or practice. Additional contributions to enhance the funded status of the pension plans can be made at the company’s discretion. However, there can be no assurance that the value of the pension plan assets, or the
investment returns on those plan assets, will be sufficient to meet the future benefit obligations of such plans. In addition, during periods of adverse investment market conditions and declining interest rates, the company may be required to
make additional cash contributions to the pension plans that could reduce our financial flexibility. Changes in plan demographics, including an increase in the number of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase the
costs and funding requirements of the obligations related to the company’s pension plans.

Our pension plan obligations
are affected by changes in market interest rates. Significant fluctuations in market interest rates have added, and may further add, volatility to our pension plan obligations. In periods of declining market interest rates, our pension
plan obligations generally increase; in periods of increasing market interest rates, our pension plan obligations generally decrease. While our plan assets are broadly diversified, there are inherent market risks associated with investments; if
adverse market conditions occur, our plan assets could incur significant or material losses. Since we may need to make additional contributions to address changes in obligations and/or a loss in plan assets, the combination of declining market
interest rates, past or future plan asset investment losses, and/or changes in plan demographics could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

The company’s pension plan expense is comprised of the following factors: (i) service cost; (ii) interest on projected
benefit obligations; (iii) the expected return on plan assets; (iv) the amortization of prior service costs and credits; (v) the effects of actuarial gains and losses; and (vi) settlement/curtailment costs, when applicable. The
accounting for pensions

2014 ANNUAL REPORT



involves the estimation of a number of factors that are highly uncertain. Certain factors, such as the interest on projected benefit obligations and the expected return on pension plan
assets, are impacted by changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets. A significant decrease in market interest rates and a decrease in the fair value of pension plan assets would increase net pension expense and may adversely
affect the company’s future results of operations. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the company’s pension plans.

Adverse developments in the credit and financial markets could negatively impact the availability of credit that we and our customers need to operate our businesses.

We depend upon the availability of credit to operate our business, including the financing of receivables from end-user customers that
are originated by our financial services businesses. Our end-user customers, franchisees and suppliers also require access to credit for their businesses. At times in recent years, world financial markets have been unstable and subject to
uncertainty. Adverse developments in the credit and financial markets, or unfavorable changes in Snap-on’s credit rating, could negatively impact the availability of future financing and the terms on which it might be available to

Snap-on,

its end-user customers, franchisees and suppliers. Inability to access credit or capital markets, or a deterioration in the terms on which financing might be available, could have an adverse impact on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Increasing our financial leverage could affect our operations and
profitability.

The maximum available credit under our multi-currency revolving credit facility is $700 million. The
company’s leverage ratio may affect both our availability of additional capital resources as well as our operations in several ways, including:

•

The terms on which credit may be available to us could be less attractive, both in the economic terms of the credit and the covenants stipulated by
the credit terms;

•

The possible lack of availability of additional credit;

•

The potential for higher levels of interest expense to service or maintain our outstanding debt;

•

The possibility of additional borrowings in the future to repay our indebtedness when it comes due; and

•

The possible diversion of capital resources from other uses.

While we believe we will have the ability to service our debt and obtain additional resources in the future if and when needed, that will
depend upon our results of operations and financial position at the time, the then-current state of the credit and financial markets, and other factors that may be beyond our control. Therefore, we cannot give assurances that credit will be
available on terms that we consider attractive, or at all, if and when necessary or beneficial to us.

Data security and
information technology infrastructure and security are critical to supporting business objectives; failure of our systems to operate effectively could adversely affect our business and reputation.

We depend heavily on information technology infrastructure to achieve our business objectives and to protect sensitive information, and
continually invest in improving such systems. Problems that impair or compromise this infrastructure, including due to natural disasters, security breaches or malicious attacks, or during system upgrades and/or new system implementations, could
impede our ability to record or process orders, manufacture and ship in a timely manner, account for and collect receivables, protect sensitive data of the company, our customers, our suppliers and business partners, or otherwise carry on business
in the normal course. Any such events, if significant, could cause us to lose customers and/or revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to remediate, including as a result of legal or regulatory claims or proceedings, and could also
damage our reputation.

In association with initiatives to better integrate business units, rationalize operating footprint
and improve responsiveness to franchisees and customers,

Snap-on

is continually replacing and enhancing its global Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) management information systems. As we integrate, implement
and deploy new information technology processes and a common information infrastructure across our global operations, we could experience disruptions in our business that could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

Failure to maintain effective distribution of products and services could adversely impact
revenue, gross margin and profitability.


SNAP-ON INCORPORATED


We use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services. Successfully
managing the interaction of our distribution efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process. Moreover, since each distribution method has distinct risks, costs and gross margins, our failure
to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability.

Risks associated with the disruption of manufacturing operations could adversely affect profitability or competitive position.

We manufacture a significant portion of the products we sell. Any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing
manufacturing facilities, whether due to technical or labor difficulties, facility consolidation or closure actions, lack of raw material or component availability, destruction of or damage to any facility (as a result of natural disasters, use and
storage of hazardous materials or other events), or other reasons, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The inability to continue to introduce new products that respond to customer needs and achieve market acceptance could result in lower
revenues and reduced profitability.

Sales from new products represent a significant portion of our net sales and are
expected to continue to represent a significant component of our future net sales. We may not be able to compete effectively unless we continue to enhance existing products or introduce new products to the marketplace in a timely manner. Product
improvements and new product introductions require significant financial and other resources, including significant planning, design, development, and testing at the technological, product and manufacturing process levels. Our competitors’
new products may beat our products to market, be more effective with more features, be less expensive than our products, and/or render our products obsolete. Any new products that we develop may not receive market acceptance or otherwise generate
any meaningful net sales or profits for us relative to our expectations based on, among other things, existing and anticipated investments in manufacturing capacity and commitments to fund advertising, marketing, promotional programs and research
and development.

The global tool, equipment, and diagnostics and repair information industries are competitive.

We face strong competition in all of our market segments. Price competition in our various industries is intense and pricing pressures
from competitors and customers are increasing. In general, as a manufacturer and marketer of premium products and services, the expectations of Snap-on’s customers and its franchisees are high and continue to increase. Any inability to maintain
customer satisfaction could diminish Snap-on’s premium image and reputation and could result in a lessening of our ability to command premium pricing. We expect that the level of competition will remain high in the future, which could limit our
ability to maintain or increase market share or profitability.

Product liability claims and litigation could affect our
business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The products that we design and/or
manufacture, and/or the services we provide, can lead to product liability claims or other legal claims being filed against us. To the extent that plaintiffs are successful in showing either that defects in the design or manufacture of our products
led to personal injury or property damage, or that our provision of services resulted in similar injury or damage, we may be subject to claims for damages. Although we are insured for damages above a certain amount, we bear the costs and expenses
associated with defending claims, including frivolous lawsuits, and are responsible for damages below the insurance retention amount. As a manufacturer, we can be subject to the costs and potential negative publicity of product recalls, which could
impact our results.

The recognition of impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets would adversely impact
our future financial condition and results of operations.

We have a substantial amount of goodwill and purchased
intangible assets, almost all of which are booked in the Commercial & Industrial Group and in the Repair Systems & Information Group. We are required to perform impairment tests on our goodwill and other intangibles annually or at
any time when events occur that could impact the value of our business segments. Our determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on a comparison of each of our reporting units’ fair market value with its carrying value.
Significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances, such as significant and long-term adverse changes in business climate, adverse actions by regulators, unanticipated competition,

2014 ANNUAL REPORT



the loss of key customers, and/or changes in technology or markets, could require a provision for impairment in a future period that could substantially impact our reported earnings and reduce
our consolidated net worth and shareholders’ equity. Should the economic environment in these markets deteriorate, our results of operations and financial position could be materially impacted, including as a result of the effects of potential
impairment write-downs of goodwill and/or other intangible assets related to these businesses.

Failure to adequately protect intellectual
property could adversely affect our business.

Intellectual property rights are an important and integral component of our
business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements and third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements. Adverse
determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products. Failure to obtain or maintain adequate
protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Foreign operations are subject to political, economic, currency exchange and other risks that could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Approximately 34% of our revenues in 2014 were generated
outside of the United States. Future growth rates and success of our business depends in large part on continued growth in our non-U.S. operations, including growth in emerging markets and critical industries. Numerous risks and uncertainties
affect our non-U.S. operations. These risks and uncertainties include political, economic and social instability, such as acts of war, civil disturbance or acts of terrorism, local labor conditions, changes in government policies and
regulations, including imposition or increases in withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by international subsidiaries, as well as the exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption laws in various countries, such as the U.S.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, currency instability, transportation delays or interruptions, sovereign debt uncertainties and difficulties in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights, as well as natural disasters. Should the economic
environment in our non-U.S. markets deteriorate from current levels, our results of operations and financial position could be materially impacted, including as a result of the effects of potential impairment write-downs of goodwill and/or other
intangible assets related to these businesses.

The reporting currency for Snap-on’s consolidated financial statements is
the U.S. dollar. Certain of the company’s assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In preparing

Snap-on’s

Consolidated Financial
Statements, those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are translated into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates. Increases or decreases in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies affect the U.S. dollar value of those
items, as reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Substantial fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar could have a significant impact on the company’s financial condition and results of operations.

We are also affected by changes in inflation rates and interest rates. Additionally, cash generated in non-U.S. jurisdictions may be
difficult to repatriate to the United States in a tax-efficient manner. Our foreign operations are also subject to other risks and challenges, such as the need to staff and manage diverse workforces, respond to the needs of multiple national
and international marketplaces, and differing business climates and cultures in various countries.


SNAP-ON INCORPORATED


Our operations expose us to the risk of environmental liabilities, costs, litigation
and violations that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and reputation.

Certain of our
operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground, air and water and establish standards for the generation, treatment,
use, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes. We must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the United States and abroad in connection with our operations. Failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and
criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to our reputation. In addition, we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices. Legislation has been
proposed, and governmental regulatory action has been both proposed and taken, that may significantly impact environmental compliance in the United States; these actions could increase our costs of production by raising the cost of energy as well as
by further restricting emissions or other processes that we currently use in our operations. We cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our
estimates.

Legal disputes could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows.

From time to time we are subject to legal disputes that are being litigated and/or settled in the ordinary
course of business. Disputes or future lawsuits could result in the diversion of management’s time and attention away from business operations. Additionally, negative developments with respect to legal disputes and the costs incurred in
defending ourselves could have an adverse impact on the company and its reputation. Adverse outcomes or settlements could also require us to pay damages, potentially in excess of amounts reserved, or incur liability for other remedies that could
have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The
inability to successfully defend claims from taxing authorities could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We conduct business in many countries, which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions. Due to the subjectivity of tax laws between those
jurisdictions, as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments. Claims from taxing authorities related to these differences could have an adverse impact
on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Compliance with regulations related to conflict minerals
could increase costs and affect the manufacturing and sale of our products.

Public companies are required to disclose the
use of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold (collectively, “conflict minerals”) mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries (the “covered countries”) if a conflict mineral(s) is necessary to the
functionality of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by the company.

We may determine, as part of our
compliance efforts, that certain products or components we obtain from our suppliers contain conflict minerals. If we are unable to conclude that all our products are free from conflict minerals originating from covered countries, this could have a
negative impact on our business, reputation and/or results of operations. We may also encounter challenges to satisfy customers who require that our products be certified as conflict free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are
unable to substantiate such a claim. Compliance with these rules could also affect the sourcing and availability of some of the minerals used in the manufacture of products or components we obtain from our suppliers, including our ability to
obtain products or components in sufficient quantities and/or at competitive prices.

2014 ANNUAL REPORT



The accounting for certain stock-based compensation awards and stock-based deferred
compensation liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations.

Certain stock-based compensation awards
granted by the company are subject to mark-to-market accounting treatment, which requires us to recognize changes in the fair value of these awards each period based on the company’s period-end stock price. Volatility in the company’s
stock price, including as a result of macro-economic conditions and other factors beyond our control, could increase or decrease this expense in future periods. While we have entered into prepaid equity forward agreements to manage a portion of the
market risk associated with stock-based deferred compensation liabilities, depending on changes in the company’s period-end stock price, the application of mark-to-market accounting on certain of our other stock-based compensation awards and
stock-based deferred compensation liabilities could have an adverse effect, or favorable benefit, on our financial condition and results of operations in certain periods.

Failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could lead to a loss of revenue and/or profitability.

Snap-on’s success depends, in part, on the efforts and abilities of its senior management team and other key employees. Their skills, experience and industry contacts significantly benefit our
operations and administration. The failure to attract and retain members of our senior management team and other key employees could have a negative effect on our operating results. In addition, transitions of important responsibilities to new
individuals inherently include the possibility of disruptions to our business and operations, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The steps taken to restructure operations, rationalize operating footprint, lower operating expenses and achieve greater efficiencies
in the supply chain could disrupt business.

We have taken steps in the past, and expect to take additional steps in the
future, intended to improve customer service and drive further efficiencies and reduce costs, some of which could be disruptive to our business. These actions, collectively across our operating groups, are focused on the following:

•

Continuing to invest in initiatives focused on building a strong sales and operating presence in emerging growth markets;

•

Continuing to enhance service and value to our franchisees and customers;

•

Continuing to implement efficiency and productivity initiatives throughout the company to drive further efficiencies and reduce costs;

•

Continuing on the company’s existing path to improve and transform global manufacturing and the supply chain into a market-demand-based
replenishment system with lower costs;

•

Continuing to invest in developing and marketing new, innovative, higher-value-added products and advanced technologies;

•

Extending our products and services into additional and/or adjacent markets or to new customers; and

•

Continuing to provide financing for, and grow our portfolio of, receivables within our financial services businesses.

A failure to succeed in the implementation of any or all of these actions could result in an inability to achieve our financial goals and
could be disruptive to the business.

In addition, any future reductions to headcount and other cost reduction measures may
result in the loss of technical expertise and could adversely affect our research and development efforts as well as our ability to meet product development schedules. Efforts to reduce components of expense could result in the recording of charges
for inventory and technology-related write-offs, workforce reduction costs or other charges relating to the consolidation or closure of facilities. If we were to incur a substantial charge to further these efforts, our earnings per share would be
adversely affected in such period. If we are unable to effectively manage our cost reduction and restructuring efforts, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected.


SNAP-ON INCORPORATED


We may not successfully integrate businesses we acquire, which could have an adverse
impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Subject to further adjustment pursuant to the 1996 Authorization described below, as of January 3, 2015, the approximate value of shares that
may yet be purchased pursuant to the three outstanding Board authorizations discussed below is $210.9 million.

•

In 1996, the Board authorized the company to repurchase shares of the company’s common stock from time to time in the open market or in
privately negotiated transactions (“the 1996 Authorization”). The 1996 Authorization allows the repurchase of up to the number of shares issued or delivered from treasury from time to time under the various plans the company has in place
that call for the issuance of the company’s common stock. Because the number of shares that are purchased pursuant to the 1996 Authorization will change from time to time as (i) the company issues shares under its various plans; and
(ii) shares are repurchased pursuant to this authorization, the number of shares authorized to be repurchased will vary from time to time. The 1996 Authorization will expire when terminated by the Board. When calculating the approximate value
of shares that the company may yet purchase under the 1996 Authorization, the company assumed a price of $128.24, $135.72 and $136.29 per share of common stock as of the end of the fiscal 2014 months ended October 25,
2014, November 22, 2014, and January 3, 2015, respectively.

•

In 1998, the Board authorized the repurchase of an aggregate of $100 million of the company’s common stock (“the 1998
Authorization”). The 1998 Authorization will expire when the aggregate repurchase price limit is met, unless terminated earlier by the Board.

•

In 1999, the Board authorized the repurchase of an aggregate of $50 million of the company’s common stock (“the 1999 Authorization”).
The 1999 Authorization will expire when the aggregate repurchase price limit is met, unless terminated earlier by the Board.

2014 ANNUAL REPORT



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Item 7:
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Management Overview

We believe our broad-based organic sales growth in 2014 affirms Snap-on’s unique capabilities in providing repeatability and
reliability to a wide range of professional customers performing critical tasks in workplaces of consequence. Leveraging capabilities already demonstrated in the automotive repair arena, our “coherent growth” strategy focuses on developing
and expanding our professional customer base, not only in automotive repair, but in adjacent markets, additional geographies and other areas, including in critical industries, where the cost and penalties for failure can be high.

We believe our 2014 operating results also provide continued evidence that Snap-on’s value proposition of making work easier for
serious professionals in workplaces of consequence is an ongoing strength as we move forward along our runways for coherent growth: enhancing the franchise network, expanding in the vehicle repair garage, extending to critical industries and
building in emerging markets. We also believe our year-over-year improvement in operating margin further evidences the potential of our Snap-on Value Creation Processes – our suite of strategic principles and processes we employ every day
designed to create value and employed in the areas of safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement.

In 2014, we continued to invest in our most important strategic growth initiatives aimed at enhancing the franchisee network, expanding in the vehicle repair garage, extending in critical industries and
building in emerging markets. Recent examples of our continued investment and expansion initiatives include the May 2014 acquisition of Pro-Cut International, Inc.

(“Pro-Cut”)

and the May 2013
acquisition of Challenger Lifts, Inc. (“Challenger”), which are further discussed in “Results of Operations” below. The acquisitions of both the Pro-Cut and Challenger product lines complemented and increased our existing
undercar equipment product offering, broadened our established capabilities in serving vehicle repair facilities and expanded our presence with repair shop owners and managers.

Our global financial services operations continue to serve a significant strategic role in providing financing options for our
franchisees, for their customers, and for customers in other parts of our business. We expect that our global financial services business, which includes both Snap-on Credit LLC (“SOC”) in the United States and our other international
finance subsidiaries, will continue to be a meaningful contributor to our operating earnings.

Consolidated

net sales
of $3,277.7 million in 2014 increased $221.2 million, or 7.2%, from 2013 levels, including $37.0 million of acquisition-related sales and an unfavorable $25.3 million impact from foreign currency translation. Organic sales (excluding
acquisition-related sales and foreign currency translation impacts) increased $209.5 million or 6.9%. Operating earnings before financial services of $535.6 million in 2014 were up $75.1 million, or 16.3%, from 2013 levels, reflecting contributions
from higher sales and improved operating margins, including contributions from ongoing efficiency and productivity initiatives, as well as benefits from restructuring actions (collectively, “Rapid Continuous Improvement” or “RCI
initiatives”). Operating earnings of $684.7 million in 2014 increased $98.5 million, or 16.8%, from operating earnings of $586.2 million last year. In 2014, net earnings attributable to Snap-on Incorporated were $421.9 million or $7.14 per
diluted share. Net earnings attributable to Snap-on Incorporated in 2013 were $350.3 million or $5.93 per diluted share.

In
the

Commercial & Industrial Group

, segment net sales of $1,174.8 million in 2014 increased $83.8 million, or 7.7%, from 2013 levels. Excluding $18.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales in 2014 increased
$102.0 million, or 9.5%, primarily due to higher sales to customers in critical industries and in the segment’s European-based hand tools business. Operating earnings of $158.6 million in 2014 increased $21.3 million, or 15.5%, from 2013 levels
primarily as a result of the higher sales and the savings from RCI initiatives.


SNAP-ON INCORPORATED

priorities in 2015:

Investing in emerging market growth initiatives, including in China, India, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Latin America;

•

Broadening our product offering and engineered solutions designed particularly for critical industry segments;

Snap-on Tools Group

, segment net sales of $1,455.2 million in 2014 increased $96.8 million, or 7.1%, from 2013 levels;
excluding $6.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales in 2014 increased $103.1 million, or 7.6%, reflecting higher sales in both the company’s U.S. and international franchise operations. Operating earnings of $223.1
million in 2014 increased $28.5 million, or 14.6%, from 2013 levels, primarily as a result of the higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives.

The Snap-on Tools Group made continued progress in 2014 on its fundamental, strategic initiatives to strengthen the group and enhance franchisee profitability. In 2015, the Snap-on Tools Group intends to
further build on the progress made in 2014, with specific initiatives focused on the following:

•

Developing new programs and products to expand market coverage, reaching new technicians and increasing penetration with existing customers;

to continue to serve customers more effectively, more profitably and with improved satisfaction.

In the

Repair

translation, organic sales increased $49.1 million or 4.9%. The organic sales increase primarily reflects higher sales to original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) dealership service and repair shops (“OEM dealerships”), as well as
increased sales to independent repair shop owners and managers, including higher sales of diagnostic and repair information products and increased sales of undercar equipment. Operating earnings of $251.2 million in 2014 increased $19.3 million, or
8.3%, from 2013 levels, primarily due to higher sales, including acquisition-related sales, and savings from RCI initiatives.

•

Expanding the product offering with new products and services, thereby providing more to sell to repair shop owners and managers;

•

Continuing software and hardware upgrades;

•

Leveraging integration of software solutions;

•

Continuing productivity advancements through RCI initiatives and leveraging of resources; and

•

Increasing penetration in geographic markets, including emerging markets.

$110.9 million, or 14.3%, from 2013 levels. In recent years, Snap-on has steadily grown its financial services portfolio by providing financing for new finance and contract receivables originated by both SOC and the company’s international
finance subsidiaries. In 2014, operating earnings from financial services of $149.1 million increased $23.4 million, or 18.6%, from $125.7 million last year.

NM: Not
meaningful

Percentage Disclosure: All income statement line item percentages below “Operating earnings from financial services” are
calculated as a percentage of the sum of Net sales and Financial services revenue.

Snap-on’s 2014 fiscal year contained
53 weeks of operating results, with the extra week occurring in the fourth quarter. Snap-on’s 2013 fiscal year contained 52 weeks of operating results. The impact of the additional week of operations in fiscal 2014 was not material to
Snap-on’s full year or fourth quarter 2014 net sales or net earnings.

Net sales of $3,277.7 million in 2014 increased
$221.2 million, or 7.2%, from 2013 levels, including $37.0 million of acquisition-related sales and an unfavorable $25.3 million impact from foreign currency translation. Organic sales (excluding acquisition-related sales and foreign currency
translation impacts) in 2014 increased $209.5 million, or 6.9%, from 2013 levels. Snap-on has significant international operations and is subject to risks inherent with foreign operations, including foreign currency translation fluctuations.

Gross profit of $1,584.3 million in 2014 increased $111.4 million from $1,472.9 million last year. Gross margin (gross profit
as a percentage of net sales) of 48.3% in 2014 increased 10 basis points (100 basis points (“bps”) equals 1.0 percent) from 48.2% last year primarily due to benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives, partially offset by
increased restructuring and other costs. Restructuring costs included in gross profit were $5.7 million and $4.4 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.

2014 ANNUAL REPORT



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(continued)

Operating expenses of $1,048.7 million in 2014 increased $36.3 million from $1,012.4
million last year primarily due to higher volume-related and other expenses. The operating expense margin (operating expenses as a percentage of net sales) of 32.0% in 2014 improved 110 bps from 33.1% last year primarily due to sales volume
leverage. Restructuring costs included in operating expenses were $0.8 million and $1.9 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Operating earnings before financial services of $535.6 million in 2014, including $11.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects,

or 16.8%, from $586.2 million last year. As a percentage of revenues (net sales plus financial services revenue), operating earnings of 19.6% in 2014 improved 150 bps from 18.1% last year.

Interest expense of $52.9 million in 2014 decreased $3.2 million from $56.1 million last year primarily due to lower average debt levels
as a result of the March 2014 repayment of $100.0 million of unsecured notes at maturity. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on Snap-on’s debt and credit facilities.

Other income (expense) – net was expense of $0.9 million and $3.9 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Other income (expense)

SNAP-ON INCORPORATED

Snap-on’s business segments are based on the organization structure used by management for making operating and investment decisions and for assessing performance. Snap-on’s reportable business
segments are: (i) the Commercial & Industrial Group; (ii) the Snap-on Tools Group; (iii) the Repair Systems & Information Group; and (iv) Financial Services. The Commercial & Industrial Group consists

managers of independent repair shops and OEM dealerships, through direct and distributor channels. Financial Services consists of the business operations of

Snap-on’s

finance subsidiaries.

Snap-on evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment revenues, including both external and intersegment net
sales, and segment operating earnings. Snap-on accounts for intersegment sales and transfers based primarily on standard costs with reasonable mark-ups established between the segments. Identifiable assets by segment are those assets used in the
respective reportable segment’s operations. Corporate assets consist of cash and cash equivalents (excluding cash held at Financial Services), deferred income taxes and certain other assets. All significant intersegment amounts are eliminated
to arrive at Snap-on’s consolidated financial results.

excluding $18.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased $102.0 million or 9.5%. The organic sales increase primarily reflects a double-digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries and a mid
single-digit sales increase in the segment’s European-based hand tools business.

Segment gross profit of $449.7 million
in 2014 increased $30.2 million from 2013 levels. Gross margin of 38.3% in 2014 decreased 20 bps from 38.5% last year as benefits from increased sales, savings from RCI initiatives and lower restructuring costs were more than offset by higher
expenses, including $10.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Restructuring costs included in gross profit were $1.0 million and $2.5 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Segment operating expenses of $291.1 million in 2014 increased $8.9 million from 2013 levels primarily due to higher volume-related and
other expenses. The operating expense margin of 24.8% in 2014 improved 110 bps from 25.9% last year primarily due to sales volume leverage. Restructuring costs included in operating expenses were $0.4 million in both years.

As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings of $158.6 million in 2014, including $6.3 million of unfavorable foreign
currency effects, increased $21.3 million from 2013 levels. Operating margin (segment operating earnings as a percentage of segment net sales) for the Commercial & Industrial Group of 13.5% in 2014 improved 90 bps from 12.6% last year.

decreases in gross margin were partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives. Restructuring costs included in gross profit were $4.7 million and $1.7 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.

SNAP-ON INCORPORATED


Liquidity and Capital Resources

Snap-on’s

growth has historically been funded by a combination of cash provided by operating
activities and debt financing. Snap-on believes that its cash from operations and collections of finance receivables, coupled with its sources of borrowings and available cash on hand, are sufficient to fund its currently anticipated requirements
for payments of interest and dividends, new receivables originated by our financial services businesses, capital expenditures, working capital, restructuring activities, the funding of pension plans, and funding for share repurchases and
acquisitions, as they arise. Due to

Snap-on’s

credit rating over the years, external funds have been available at an acceptable cost. As of the close of business on February 6, 2015,

Snap-on’s

long-term debt and commercial paper were rated, respectively, A3 and P-2 by Moody’s Investors Service; A- and

A-2

by Standard & Poor’s; and
A- and F2 by Fitch Ratings.

Snap-on

believes that its current credit arrangements are sound and that the strength of its balance sheet affords the company the financial flexibility to respond to both internal
growth opportunities and those available through acquisitions. However, Snap-on cannot provide any assurances of the availability of future financing or the terms on which it might be available, or that its debt ratings may not decrease.

The following discussion focuses on information included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

As of 2014 year end, working capital (current assets less current liabilities) of $1,139.9 million increased $59.1 million from $1,080.8
million as of 2013 year end.

The following represents the company’s working capital position as of 2014 and 2013 year end:

Cash and cash equivalents of $132.9 million as of 2014 year end decreased $84.7 million from 2013
year-end levels primarily as a result of the March 2014 repayment of $100.0 million of 5.85% unsecured notes (the “2014 Notes”) at maturity. In addition to the repayment of the 2014 Notes, the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents also
includes the impacts of (i) funding $746.2 million of new finance receivables; (ii) dividend payments to shareholders of $107.6 million; (iii) funding $80.6 million of capital expenditures; (iv) repurchasing 680,000 shares of the
company’s common stock for $79.3 million; and (v) the acquisition of Pro-Cut for a cash purchase price of $41.3 million. These decreases in cash and cash equivalents were partially offset by (i) $591.4 million of cash from collections
of finance receivables; (ii) $397.9 million of cash generated from operations; (iii) $43.5 million of cash from a net increase in notes payable, primarily due to $37.0 million of commercial paper borrowings; and (iv) $33.0 million of
cash proceeds from stock purchase and option plan exercises.

Of the $132.9 million of cash and cash equivalents as of 2014
year end, $121.9 million was held outside of the United States. Snap-on maintains non-U.S. funds in its foreign operations to (i) provide adequate working capital; (ii) satisfy various regulatory requirements; and/or (iii) take
advantage of business expansion opportunities as they arise. The repatriation of cash from certain foreign subsidiaries could have adverse net tax consequences on the company should Snap-on be required to pay and record U.S. income taxes and foreign
withholding taxes on such funds. Alternatively, the repatriation of cash from certain other foreign subsidiaries could result in favorable net tax consequences for the company.

Snap-on

periodically evaluates
its cash held outside the United States and may pursue opportunities to repatriate certain foreign cash amounts to the extent that it does not incur unfavorable net tax consequences.

2014 ANNUAL REPORT



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(continued)

Trade and other accounts receivable – net of $550.8 million as of 2014 year end
increased $19.2 million from 2013 year-end levels; excluding $24.4 million of currency translation impacts, trade and other accounts receivable – net increased $43.6 million, largely due to higher sales, including higher sales and receivables
related to Pro-Cut. Days sales outstanding (trade and other accounts receivable – net as of the respective period end, divided by the respective trailing 12 months sales, times 360 days) was 61 days at 2014 year end and 62 days at 2013 year
end.

The current portions of net finance and contract receivables of $476.9 million as of 2014 year end compared to $443.0
million at 2013 year end. The long-term portions of net finance and contract receivables of $892.5 million as of 2014 year end compared to $777.7 million at 2013 year end. The combined $148.7 million increase in net current and long-term finance and
contract receivables over 2013 year-end levels is primarily due to continued growth of the company’s financial services portfolio; excluding $12.9 million of currency translation impacts, the combined increase for these receivables over 2013
year-end levels was $161.6 million.

Inventories of $475.5 million as of 2014 year end increased $41.1 million from 2013
year-end levels; excluding $23.9 million of currency translation impacts, inventories increased $65.0 million primarily to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions, as well as inventories related to Pro-Cut. As of 2014
and 2013 year end, inventory turns (trailing 12 months of cost of goods sold, divided by the average of the beginning and ending inventory balance for the trailing 12 months) were 3.7 turns and 3.8 turns, respectively. Inventories accounted for
using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method as of 2014 and 2013 year end approximated 58% and 60%, respectively, of total inventories. All other inventories are accounted for using the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method. The company’s
LIFO reserve as of both 2014 and 2013 year end was $72.6 million.

Notes payable of $56.6 million as of 2014 year end included
$37.0 million of commercial paper borrowings and $19.6 million of other notes; there were no current maturities of long-term debt as of 2014 year end. Notes payable and current maturities of long-term debt of $113.1 million as of 2013 year end
included $100.0 million of 2014 Notes and $13.1 million of other notes; no commercial paper was outstanding as of 2013 year end. Snap-on repaid the 2014 Notes at maturity with available cash and commercial paper borrowings.

Average notes payable outstanding were $45.4 million in 2014 and $13.4 million in 2013. The weighted-average interest rate on notes
payable was 5.42% in 2014 and 10.85% in 2013. As of 2014 and 2013 year end, the weighted-average interest rate on outstanding notes payable was 4.86% and 12.73%, respectively. The lower weighted-average interest rates in 2014 primarily reflect the
impact of lower interest rates on commercial paper borrowings; no commercial paper was outstanding during 2013. The weighted-average interest rates in both years reflect local borrowings in emerging growth markets where interest rates are generally
higher.

Accounts payable of $145.0 million as of 2014 year end decreased $10.6 million from 2013 year-end levels; excluding
$5.7 million of currency translation impacts, accounts payable decreased $4.9 million primarily due to the timing of payments.

Other accrued liabilities of $298.3 million as of 2014 year end increased $54.6 million from prior-year levels primarily due to
(i) an $18.0 million increase in income and other tax accruals, including as a result of the timing of estimated income tax payments; (ii) $12.7 million of higher accruals for in-transit inventories; (iii) a $9.1 million increase in
accruals for foreign currency forward contracts; (iv) a $7.5 million increase in deferred subscription revenue; and (v) a $2.5 million increase in accruals for exit and disposal activities. Excluding $10.0 million of currency translation
impacts, other accrued liabilities increased $64.6 million from 2013 year-end levels.

Pension liabilities of $217.9 million
as of 2014 year end increased $82.1 million from prior-year levels; excluding $6.8 million of currency translation impacts, pension liabilities increased $88.9 million primarily due to changes in actuarial assumptions, including a 100 bps decline in
the company’s worldwide weighted-average discount rate assumption (4.1% in 2014 compared to 5.1% in 2013) and increases in life expectancy assumptions. These pension liability increases were partially offset by higher-than-anticipated
investment returns in 2014 on pension plan assets. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on pension plans.

Long-term debt of $862.7 million as of 2014 year end consisted of (i) $150 million of unsecured 5.50% notes that mature in 2017; (ii) $250 million of unsecured 4.25% notes that mature in 2018;
(iii) $200 million of unsecured 6.70% notes that mature in 2019; (iv) $250 million of unsecured 6.125% notes that mature in 2021; and (v) $12.7 million of other long-term debt, including fair value adjustments related to interest rate
swaps.


SNAP-ON INCORPORATED


Snap-on has a five-year, $700 million multi-currency revolving credit facility that
terminates on September 27, 2018 (the “Credit Facility”); no amounts were outstanding under the Credit Facility as of 2014 year end. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at varying rates based on Snap-on’s
then-current, long-term debt ratings. The Credit Facility’s financial covenant requires that Snap-on maintain, as of each fiscal quarter end, either (i) a ratio not greater than 0.60 to 1.00 of consolidated net debt (consolidated debt net
of certain cash adjustments) to the sum of such consolidated net debt plus total equity and less accumulated other comprehensive income or loss; or (ii) a ratio not greater than 3.50 to 1.00 of such consolidated net debt to earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and certain other adjustments for the preceding four fiscal quarters then ended. As of 2014 year end, the company’s actual ratios of 0.27 and 1.15, respectively, were both within the permitted ranges
set forth in this financial covenant.

Snap-on’s Credit Facility and other debt agreements also contain certain usual and
customary borrowing, affirmative, negative and maintenance covenants. As of 2014 year end, Snap-on was in compliance with all covenants of its Credit Facility and other debt agreements.

Snap-on believes it has sufficient available cash and access to both committed and uncommitted credit facilities to cover its expected
funding needs on both a short-term and long-term basis. Snap-on manages its aggregate short-term borrowings so as not to exceed its availability under the revolving Credit Facility. If the need were to arise,

Snap-on

believes that it could access short-term debt markets, predominantly through commercial paper issuances and existing lines of credit, to fund its short-term requirements and to ensure near-term
liquidity. Snap-on regularly monitors the credit and financial markets and, in the future, may take advantage of what it believes are favorable market conditions to issue long-term debt to further improve its liquidity and capital resources. Near
term liquidity requirements for Snap-on include payments of interest and dividends, funding to support new receivables originated by our financial services businesses, capital expenditures, working capital, restructuring activities, the funding of
pension plans, and funding for share repurchases and acquisitions, as they arise. Snap-on intends to make contributions of $7.1 million to its foreign pension plans and $2.0 million to its domestic pension plans in 2015, as required by law.
Depending on market and other conditions, Snap-on may make discretionary cash contributions to its pension plans in 2015.

Snap-on’s long-term financing strategy is to maintain continuous access to the debt markets to accommodate its liquidity needs,
including the potential use of commercial paper, additional fixed-term debt and/or securitizations.

The following discussion focuses on
information included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities of $397.9 million in 2014 compared to $392.6 million in 2013. The $5.3 million increase in net
cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects higher 2014 net earnings, partially offset by net changes in operating assets and liabilities, which included $9.5 million of higher cash contributions to the company’s pension plans.
Snap-on made cash contributions to its pensions plans totaling $44.8 million, $35.3 million and $87.5 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Depreciation expense was $54.8 million in 2014, $51.2 million in 2013 and $50.2 million in 2012. Amortization expense was $24.7 million in 2014, $25.5 million in 2013 and $26.5 million in 2012. See Note 6
to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on goodwill and other intangible assets.

Investing Activities

Net cash used by investing activities of $273.2 million in 2014 included additions to, and collections of, finance receivables of $746.2
million and $591.4 million, respectively. Net cash used by investing activities of $250.4 million in 2013 included additions to, and collections of, finance receivables of $651.3 million and $508.8 million, respectively. Net cash used by investing
activities of $173.1 million in 2012 included additions to, and collections of, finance receivables of $569.6 million and $445.5 million, respectively, as well as $27.0 million of proceeds from the sale of a non-strategic equity investment at book
value. Finance receivables are comprised of extended-term installment payment contracts to both technicians and independent shop owners (i.e., franchisees’ customers) to enable them to purchase tools and diagnostic and equipment products on an
extended-term payment plan, generally with expected average payment terms of three years.

2014 ANNUAL REPORT



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(continued)

Capital expenditures in 2014, 2013 and 2012 totaled $80.6 million, $70.6 million and
$79.4 million, respectively. Capital expenditures in all three years included investments to support the company’s execution of its Value Creation Processes and strategic growth initiatives. The company also invested in (i) new product,
efficiency, safety and cost reduction initiatives to expand and improve its manufacturing capabilities worldwide; (ii) new production and machine tooling to enhance manufacturing operations, as well as ongoing replacements of manufacturing and
distribution equipment, particularly in the United States; (iii) the ongoing replacement and enhancement of the company’s global enterprise resource planning (ERP) management information systems; and (iv) improvements in the
company’s corporate headquarters and research and development facilities in Kenosha, Wisconsin. In 2012, the company also completed the construction of a fourth factory in Kunshan, China. Snap-on believes that its cash generated from
operations, as well as its available cash on hand and funds available from its credit facilities will be sufficient to fund the company’s capital expenditure requirements in 2015.

Net cash used by investing activities in 2014 also included $41.3 million for the May 2014 acquisition of Pro-Cut. Net cash used by
investing activities in 2013 included $38.2 million for the May 2013 acquisition of Challenger. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on acquisitions.

Financing Activities

Net cash used by financing activities was $206.9
million in 2014, $137.8 million in 2013 and $127.0 million in 2012. Net cash used by financing activities of $206.9 million in 2014 included the $100.0 million repayment of the 2014 Notes at maturity, partially offset by $45.0 million of proceeds
from a net increase in short-term borrowings.

Proceeds from stock purchase and option plan exercises totaled $33.0 million in
2014, $29.2 million in 2013 and $46.8 million in 2012.

Snap-on

has undertaken stock repurchases from time to time to offset dilution created by shares issued for employee and franchisee stock purchase plans,
stock options and other corporate purposes. In 2014, Snap-on repurchased 680,000 shares of its common stock for $79.3 million under its previously announced share repurchase programs. As of 2014 year end,

Snap-on

had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $210.9 million in common stock pursuant to its Board of Directors’ (the “Board”) authorizations. The purchase of

Snap-on

common stock is at the company’s discretion, subject to prevailing financial and market conditions. Snap-on repurchased 926,000 shares of its common stock for $82.6 million in 2013, and Snap-on
repurchased 1,180,000 shares of its common stock for $78.1 million in 2012. Snap-on believes that its cash generated from operations, available cash on hand, and funds available from its credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund the
company’s share repurchases, if any, in 2015.

Snap-on has paid consecutive quarterly cash dividends, without
interruption or reduction, since 1939. Cash dividends paid in 2014, 2013 and 2012 totaled $107.6 million, $92.0 million and $81.5 million, respectively. On November 6, 2014, the company announced that its Board increased the quarterly cash
dividend by 20.5% to $0.53 per share ($2.12 per share per year). Quarterly dividends declared in 2014 were $0.53 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.44 per share in the first three quarters ($1.85 per share for the year). Quarterly dividends
declared in 2013 were $0.44 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.38 per share in the first three quarters ($1.58 per share for the year). Quarterly dividends declared in 2012 were $0.38 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.34 per share in the
first three quarters ($1.40 per share for the year).

Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements

Except as included below in the section labeled “Contractual Obligations and Commitments” and Note 15 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, the company had no off-balance-sheet arrangements as of 2014 year end.


SNAP-ON INCORPORATED


Contractual Obligations and Commitments

A summary of Snap-on’s future contractual obligations and commitments as of 2014 year end are as follows:

Snap-on intends to make contributions of $7.1 million to its foreign pension plans and $2.0 million to
its domestic pension plans in 2015, as required by law. Depending on market and other conditions, Snap-on may elect to make discretionary cash contributions to its pension plans in 2015. Snap-on has not presented estimated pension and
postretirement funding contributions in the table above as the funding can vary from year to year based upon changes in the fair value of the plan assets and actuarial assumptions; see Notes 11 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
information on the company’s benefit plans and payments.

Due to the uncertainty of the timing of settlements
with taxing authorities, Snap-on is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of unrecognized tax benefits for its remaining uncertain tax liabilities. As a result, $6.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits have
been excluded from the table above; see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on income taxes.

Environmental
Matters

Snap-on is subject to various federal, state and local government requirements regulating the discharge of
materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Snap-on’s policy is to comply with these requirements and the company believes that, as a general matter, its policies, practices and procedures are
properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with its business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in some of Snap-on’s operations and products,
as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses.

Snap-on is and has been engaged in the handling, manufacture,
use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies. Snap-on believes that, as a general matter, its handling, manufacture, use and disposal of these substances are in accordance with environmental
laws and regulations. It is possible, however, that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could
bring into question the company’s handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these substances.

Affordable Care Act

The Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”), which was adopted in 2010 and is being phased in over several years, significantly affects
the provision of both health care services and benefits in the United States; the ACA may impact our cost of providing our employees and retirees with health insurance and/or benefits, and may also impact various other aspects of our business. The
ACA did not have a material impact on our fiscal 2014, 2013 or 2012 financial results.

New Accounting Standards

See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on new accounting standards.

2014 ANNUAL REPORT



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(continued)

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to management’s discussion and
analysis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are generally based on
historical experience, current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that
are not readily available from other sources, as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

In addition to the company’s significant accounting policies described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,

Snap-on

considers the following policies and estimates to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements and the
uncertainties that could impact the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Impairment of
Goodwill and Other Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets:

Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired.
Annual impairment tests are performed by the company in the second quarter of each year.

Snap-on

evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows
of the businesses to which the goodwill relates. Estimated cash flows and related goodwill are grouped at the reporting unit level. The company has determined that its reporting units for testing goodwill impairment are its operating segments or
components of an operating segment that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results. Within its four reportable operating segments, the company
has identified 11 reporting units.

Snap-on

evaluates the recoverability of goodwill
by utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows of the reporting units to which the goodwill relates. The future projections, which are based on both past performance and the projections and
assumptions used in the company’s operating plans, are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. This approach reflects management’s internal outlook at the reporting units, which management believes
provides the best determination of value due to management’s insight and experience with the reporting unit. Significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on
expected growth rates, price increases, working capital levels, expected benefits from RCI initiatives, and a weighted-average cost of capital that reflects the specific risk profile of the reporting unit being tested. The company’s
methodologies for valuing goodwill are applied consistently on a year-over-year basis; the assumptions used in performing the second quarter 2014 impairment calculations were evaluated in light of then-current market and business conditions. Snap-on
continues to believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ projections of future operating results and cash flows and replicates how
market participants would value the company’s reporting units in an orderly transaction.

In the event the fair value of
a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, including goodwill, the company would then perform an additional assessment that would compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill. The determination of implied
fair value of goodwill would require management to compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit; if necessary, the company may consult with valuation
specialists to assist with the assessment of the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss would be recorded.

Snap-on

also evaluates the recoverability of its indefinite-lived trademarks by utilizing an
income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows of each of its trademarks. The future projections, which are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in the company’s operating
plans, are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. Significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on expected growth and royalty
rates, expected synergies, and a weighted-average cost of capital that reflects the specific risk profile of the trademark being tested. The company’s methodologies for valuing trademarks are applied consistently on a year-over-year basis; the


SNAP-ON INCORPORATED


assumptions used in performing the second quarter 2014 impairment calculations were evaluated in light of then-current market and business conditions. Snap-on continues to believe that the future
discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the trademarks’ projected future cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the company’s trademarks in an
orderly transaction.

Inherent in fair value determinations are significant judgments and estimates, including material
assumptions about future revenue, profitability and cash flows, the company’s operational plans and its interpretation of current economic indicators. Should the operations of the businesses with which goodwill or other indefinite-lived
intangible assets are associated incur significant declines in profitability and cash flow due to significant and long-term deterioration in macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, the loss of key customers, changes in technology or markets,
significant changes in key personnel or litigation, a significant and sustained decrease in share price and/or other events, including effects from the sale or disposal of a reporting unit, some or all of the recorded goodwill or other
indefinite-lived intangible assets could be subject to impairment and could result in a material adverse effect on Snap-on’s financial position or results of operations.

Snap-on

completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets in the second quarter of 2014, the results of which did not
result in any impairment. As of 2014 year end, the company has no accumulated impairment losses. Although the company consistently uses the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations, such
estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results. In performing its annual impairment testing the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the material assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation models for each of
its 11 reporting units. Based on the company’s second quarter 2014 impairment testing and assuming a hypothetical 10% decrease in the estimated fair values of each of its 11 reporting units, the hypothetical fair value of each of the
company’s 11 reporting units would have been greater than its carrying value. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about goodwill and other intangible assets.

Impairment of Long-lived and Amortized Intangible Assets:

Snap-on performs impairment evaluations of its long-lived assets,
including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives, whenever business conditions or events indicate that those assets may be impaired. When the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets are
less than the carrying value of the long-lived assets, the assets are written down to fair market value and a charge is recorded to current operations.

Significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances, such as significant declines in profitability and cash flow due to significant and long-term deterioration in macroeconomic, industry and market
conditions, the loss of key customers, changes in technology or markets and/or other events, including effects from the sale or disposal of a reporting unit, could require a provision for impairment in a future period.

Excess and Obsolete Inventory:

Snap-on records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated
future demand and market conditions. Allowances for raw materials are largely based on an analysis of raw material age and actual physical inspection of raw material for fitness for use. As part of evaluating the adequacy of allowances for
work-in-progress and finished goods, management reviews individual product stock-keeping units (SKUs) by product category and product life cycle. Cost adjustments for each product category/product life-cycle state are generally established and
maintained based on a combination of historical experience, forecasted sales and promotions, technological obsolescence, inventory age and other actual known conditions and circumstances. Should actual product marketability and raw material fitness
for use be affected by conditions that are different from management estimates, further adjustments to inventory allowances may be required.

Pension Benefits:

The pension benefit obligation and related pension expense are calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions. Changes in these
assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of

Snap-on’s

control and can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements.

Snap-on

believes that the two most critical assumptions are (i) the expected return on plan assets; and (ii) the assumed discount rate.

Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases. Lowering the expected rate of return assumption for
Snap-on’s domestic pension plan assets by 50 bps would have increased Snap-on’s 2014 domestic pension expense by approximately $4.2 million. Snap-on uses a three-year, market-related value asset method of amortizing the difference between
actual and expected returns on its domestic plans’ assets.

2014 ANNUAL REPORT



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(continued)

The objective of Snap-on’s discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which
the pension benefits could be effectively settled. In making this determination, the company takes into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans. The domestic discount rate as of 2014 and 2013 year
end was selected based on a cash flow matching methodology developed by the company’s outside actuaries and which incorporates a review of current economic conditions. This methodology matches the plans’ yearly projected benefit cash flows
to those of hypothetical bond portfolios using high-quality, AA rated or better, corporate bonds from either Moody’s Investors Service or Standard & Poor’s credit rating agencies available at the measurement date. This
technique calculates bond portfolios that produce adequate cash flows to pay the plans’ projected yearly benefits and then selects the portfolio with the highest yield and uses that yield as the recommended discount rate.

The selection of the 4.2% weighted-average discount rate for Snap-on’s domestic pension plans as of 2014 year end represents the
single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments. Lowering Snap-on’s domestic discount rate assumption by 50 bps would have increased

Snap-on’s

2014 domestic pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately $6.0 million and $63.4 million, respectively. As of 2014 year end,

Snap-on’s

domestic projected benefit obligation comprised
approximately 82% of Snap-on’s worldwide projected benefit obligation. The weighted-average discount rate for Snap-on’s foreign pension plans of 3.3% represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the
estimated benefit plan payments. Lowering Snap-on’s foreign discount rate assumption by 50 bps would have increased

Snap-on’s

2014 foreign pension expense and projected benefit obligation by
approximately $1.9 million and $22.7 million, respectively.

Actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater
of the projected benefit obligation or market-related value of assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average remaining life expectancy for plans with primarily
inactive participants. Prior service costs and credits resulting from plan amendments are amortized in equal annual amounts over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average remaining life expectancy for plans with
primarily inactive participants. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on pension plans.

Income Taxes:

Snap-on records deferred income tax assets and liabilities for differences between the book basis and tax basis of
the related net assets. Snap-on records a valuation allowance, when appropriate, to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. While the company has
considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the company may be required to adjust its valuation
allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made.

In
addition, the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new
developments in each matter. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on income taxes.

Outlook

In 2015, Snap-on expects to make continued progress along its defined runways for coherent growth, leveraging
capabilities already demonstrated in the automotive repair arena and developing and expanding its professional customer base, not only in automotive repair, but in adjacent markets, additional geographies and other areas, including in critical
industries, where the cost and penalties for failure can be high. Through continued deployment of its Snap-on Value Creation Processes, Snap-on also anticipates making further progress in 2015 in the areas of safety, quality, customer connection,
innovation and rapid continuous improvement. In pursuit of these initiatives, Snap-on expects that capital expenditures in 2015 will be in a range of $80 million to $90 million. Snap-on also anticipates that its full year 2015 effective income tax
rate will be at or below its 2014 full year rate.

Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market, Credit and Economic Risks

Market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments.

Snap-on

is exposed to market risk from
changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.

Snap-on

is also exposed to market risk associated with the stock-based portion of its deferred compensation plans. Snap-on monitors its exposure
to these risks and attempts to manage the underlying economic exposures through the use of financial instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swap agreements, treasury lock agreements and prepaid equity forward
agreements (“equity forwards”). Snap-on does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Snap-on’s broad-based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related
areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole.

Snap-on’s

management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative
and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks.

Foreign Currency Risk Management

Snap-on

has significant international operations and is subject to certain risks
inherent with foreign operations that include currency fluctuations. Foreign exchange risk exists to the extent that

Snap-on

has payment obligations or receipts denominated in currencies other than the
functional currency, including intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies. To manage these exposures,

Snap-on

identifies naturally offsetting positions and then purchases hedging instruments to
protect the residual net exposures. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on foreign currency risk management.

Interest Rate Risk Management

Snap-on aims to control funding costs by managing the exposure created by the differing maturities and interest rate structures of Snap-on’s borrowings through the use of interest rate swap
agreements. Treasury lock agreements are used from time to time to manage potential changes in interest rates in anticipation of the issuance or sale of certain financial instruments. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
information on interest rate risk management.

Snap-on utilizes a Value-at-Risk (“VAR”) model to determine the
potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate and foreign exchange-sensitive financial instruments from adverse changes in market factors. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence
level. Snap-on’s computations are based on the inter-relationships among movements in various currencies and interest rates (variance/co-variance technique). These inter-relationships were determined by observing interest rate and foreign
currency market changes over the preceding quarter.

The estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated
using the VAR model, as of 2014 and 2013 year end was $1.2 million and $1.0 million, respectively, on interest rate-sensitive financial instruments, and $0.4 million and $0.5 million, respectively, on foreign currency-sensitive financial
instruments. The VAR model is a risk management tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by

Snap-on,

nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable
changes in market factors.

Stock-based Deferred Compensation Risk Management

Snap-on aims to manage market risk associated with the stock-based portion of its deferred compensation plans through the use of equity
forwards. Equity forwards are used to aid in offsetting the potential mark-to-market effect on stock-based deferred compensation from changes in Snap-on’s stock price. Since stock-based deferred compensation liabilities increase as the
company’s stock price rises and decrease as the company’s stock price declines, the equity forwards are intended to mitigate the potential impact on compensation expense that may result from such mark-to-market changes. See Note 10 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on stock-based deferred compensation risk management.

2014 ANNUAL REPORT



Credit Risk

Credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer’s failure to make payments according to contract terms. Prior to extending credit, each customer is evaluated, taking into consideration the
customer’s financial condition, collateral, debt-servicing ability, past payment experience, credit bureau information, and other financial and qualitative factors that may affect the customer’s ability to repay. Credit risk is also
monitored regularly through the use of internal proprietary, custom scoring models used to evaluate each transaction at the time of the application for credit and by periodically updating those credit scores for ongoing monitoring purposes. Snap-on
evaluates credit quality through the use of an internal proprietary measuring system that provides a framework to analyze finance and contract receivables on the basis of risk factors of the individual obligor as well as transaction specific risk.
The finance and contract receivables are typically monitored through an asset quality review process that closely monitors past due accounts and initiates a progressive collection action process when appropriate.

Counterparty Risk

Snap-on

is exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to its various financial agreements, including its foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swap agreements and
prepaid equity forward agreements.

Snap-on

does not obtain collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk, but monitors the credit standing of the counterparties and
generally enters into agreements with financial institution counterparties with a credit rating of A- or better. Snap-on does not anticipate non-performance by its counterparties, but cannot provide assurances.

Economic Risk

Economic
risk is the possibility of loss resulting from economic instability in certain areas of the world.

Snap-on

continually monitors its exposure in these markets. Inflation has not had a significant impact on the
company.

As a result of the above market, credit and economic risks, net earnings and revenues in any particular period may
not be representative of full-year results and may vary significantly from year to year.

Commodity Risk

Snap-on

is a purchaser of certain commodities such as steel, natural gas and electricity. The
company is also a purchaser of components and parts that are integrated into the company’s end products, as well as the purchaser of certain finished goods, all of which may contain various commodities including steel, aluminum and
others.

Snap-on’s

supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers.

The principal raw material used in the manufacture of the company’s products is steel, which the company purchases in competitive, price-sensitive markets. To meet Snap-on’s high quality
standards, the company’s steel needs range from specialized alloys, which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers, to commodity types of alloys. These raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality.
Some of these materials have been, and in the future may be, in short supply, particularly in the event of a general economic recovery, mill shutdowns or production cut backs. As some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures,

Snap-on

could experience inventory shortages if it were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice. Additionally, unexpected price increases for raw materials could result in higher prices to

Snap-on’s

customers or an erosion of the margins on its products.

Snap-on

believes its ability to sell product is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road, the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles. These factors affect the frequency, type and amount
of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians, and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians, the prosperity of the technicians and, subsequently, the demand technicians have for the company’s tools, other products
and services, and the value technicians place on those products and services. To the extent that the prices of gasoline and other petroleum-based fuels increase, as they have at times in recent years, consumers may turn to other methods of
transportation, including more frequent use of public transportation, which could result in a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles. A decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for the
company’s products.

To the extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm pricing agreements
with its suppliers, the company may experience margin declines to the extent that it is not able to increase the selling prices of its products.

Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

The financial statements and schedules are listed on page 59 and are incorporated by reference into this Item 8.

Item 9: Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A: Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Snap-on

maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures that is designed to provide reasonable assurance that material information relating to the company and its consolidated subsidiaries is timely
communicated to the officers who certify

Snap-on’s

financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board, as appropriate.

In accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), the company’s management
evaluated, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act) as of January 3, 2015. Based upon their evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
January 3, 2015, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the Securities
and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its
principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Changes in Internal Control

There has not been any change in
the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended January 3, 2015, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the company’s internal control over financial reporting
(as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)).

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in

Internal Control — Integrated
Framework (2013)

. Based on this assessment, the company’s management believes that, as of January 3, 2015, our internal control over financial reporting was effective at a reasonable assurance level. The company’s internal control
over financial reporting as of January 3, 2015, has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report, which is included herein.

Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our internal control over
financial reporting will prevent all error or fraud. Because of inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, because of
changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time.

2014 ANNUAL REPORT



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Snap-on Incorporated:

We have
audited the internal control over financial reporting of Snap-on Incorporated and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of January 3, 2015, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework
(2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or
fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our
opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 3, 2015, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework
(2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended January 3, 2015, and our report dated February 12, 2015,
expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

2014 ANNUAL REPORT



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Snap-on Incorporated:

We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Snap-on Incorporated and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of January 3, 2015, and December 28, 2013, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive
income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 3, 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of

Snap-on

Incorporated and subsidiaries as of January 3, 2015, and December 28, 2013, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 3, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 3, 2015, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1: Summary of Accounting Policies

Principles of consolidation and presentation:

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of

Snap-on

Incorporated and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries (collectively, “Snap-on” or “the company”).

Snap-on

accounts for investments in unconsolidated affiliates where

Snap-on

has a greater than 20% but less than 50%
ownership interest under the equity method of accounting. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates of $13.3 million and $14.2 million as of year-end 2014 and 2013, respectively, are included in “Other assets” on the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets. In 2012, Snap-on sold its equity investment in a non-strategic, unconsolidated affiliate for $32.0 million, including $27.0 million of cash and a five year, $5.0 million note; there was no gain or loss on the sale. No
equity investment dividends were received in any period presented. In the normal course of business, the company may purchase products or services from unconsolidated affiliates; purchases from unconsolidated affiliates were $15.6 million, $16.0
million and $15.2 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Consolidated Financial Statements do not include the accounts of the company’s independent franchisees.

Snap-on’s

Consolidated
Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Fiscal year accounting period:

Snap-on’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday that is on or nearest to December 31. The 2014
fiscal year ended on January 3, 2015 (“2014”) and contained 53 weeks of operating results, with the extra week occurring in the fourth quarter. The impact of the additional week of operations was not material to Snap-on’s 2014
net sales or net earnings. The 2013 and 2012 fiscal years each contained 52 weeks of operating results and ended on December 28, 2013 (“2013”), and December 29, 2012 (“2012”), respectively.

Use of estimates:

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Financial instruments:

The fair value of the company’s
derivative financial instruments is generally determined using quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities. The carrying value of the company’s non-derivative financial instruments either approximates fair value, due to
their short-term nature, or the amount disclosed for fair value is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis or quoted market values. See Note 10 for further information on financial instruments.

Revenue recognition:

Snap-on recognizes revenue from the sale of tools and diagnostic and equipment products when contract terms
are met, the price is fixed or determinable, collectability is reasonably assured and a product is shipped or risk of ownership has been transferred to and accepted by the customer. For sales contingent upon customer acceptance, revenue recognition
is deferred until such obligations are fulfilled. Estimated product returns are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale based upon historical product return experience and gross profit margin adjusted for known trends.
Provisions for customer volume rebates, discounts and allowances are also recorded as a reduction of reported revenues at the time of sale based on historical experience and known trends. Revenue related to maintenance, extended warranty and
subscription agreements is recognized over the terms of the respective agreements.

Snap-on also recognizes revenue related to
multiple element arrangements, including sales of hardware, software and software-related services. When a sales arrangement contains multiple elements, such as hardware and software products and/or services,

Snap-on

uses the relative selling price method to allocate revenues between hardware and software elements. For software elements that are not essential to the hardware’s functionality and related
software post-contract customer support, vendor specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value is used to further allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value and, when necessary, the residual method is used to
assign value to the delivered elements when VSOE only exists for the undelivered elements. The amount assigned to the products or services is recognized when the product is delivered and/or when the services are performed. In instances where the
product and/or services are performed over an extended period, as is the case with subscription agreements or the providing of ongoing support, revenue is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement, which generally
ranges from 12 to 60 months.


SNAP-ON INCORPORATED


Franchise fee revenue, including nominal, non-refundable initial fees, is recognized
upon the granting of a franchise, which is when the company has performed substantially all initial services required by the franchise agreement. Franchise fee revenue also includes ongoing monthly fees (primarily for sales and business training as
well as marketing and product promotion programs) that are recognized as the fees are earned. Franchise fee revenue totaled $12.1 million, $11.9 million and $9.9 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Financial services revenue:

Snap-on also generates revenue from various financing programs that include (i) installment sales
and lease contracts arising from franchisees’ customers and

Snap-on’s

industrial and other customers for the purchase or lease of tools and diagnostic and equipment products on an extended-term
payment plan; and (ii) business loans and vehicle leases to franchisees. These financing programs are offered through

Snap-on’s

wholly owned finance subsidiaries. Financial services revenue consists
primarily of interest income on finance and contract receivables and is recognized over the life of the contracts, with interest computed on the average daily balances of the underlying contracts.

The decision to finance through

Snap-on

or another financing entity is solely at the election of
the customer. When assessing customers for potential financing, Snap-on considers various factors regarding ability to pay including customers’ financial condition, collateral, debt-servicing ability, past payment experience and credit bureau
information. For finance and contract receivables,

Snap-on

assesses these factors through the use of credit quality indicators consisting primarily of customer credit risk scores combined with internal credit
risk grades, collection experience and other internal metrics.

Financial services lease arrangements:

for its financial services leases as direct financing or sales-type leases. The company determines the gross investment in the lease as the present value of the minimum lease payments using the interest rate implicit in the lease, net of amounts, if
any, included therein for executor costs to be paid by

Snap-on,

together with any profit thereon. The difference between the gross investment in the lease and the related undiscounted minimum lease payments
for the leased property is reported as unearned finance charges. Unearned finance charges are amortized to income over the life of the contract. The default covenants included in the lease arrangements are usual and customary, consistent with
industry practice, and do not impact the lease classification. Except in circumstances where the company has concluded that a lessee’s financial condition has deteriorated, the other default covenants under Snap-on’s lease arrangements are
objectively determinable.

Research and engineering:

Snap-on

incurred research
and engineering costs of $52.4 million, $48.4 million and $44.8 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Research and engineering costs are included in “Operating expenses” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Internally developed software:

Costs incurred in the development of software that will ultimately be sold are
capitalized from the time technological feasibility has been attained and capitalization ceases when the related product is ready for general release. During 2014, 2013 and 2012, Snap-on capitalized $19.0 million, $19.0 million and $23.0 million,
respectively, of such costs. Amortization of capitalized software development costs, which is included in “Cost of goods sold” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings, was $13.6 million in 2014, $14.9 million in 2013 and
$14.3 million in 2012. Unamortized capitalized software development costs of $50.2 million as of 2014 year end and $45.1 million as of 2013 year end are included in “Other intangibles – net” on the accompanying Consolidated Balance
Sheets.

Internal-use software:

Costs that are incurred in creating software solutions and enhancements to those
solutions are capitalized only during the application development stage of the project.

Shipping and handling:

Amounts
billed to customers for shipping and handling are included as a component of sales. Costs incurred by Snap-on for shipping and handling are included as a component of cost of goods sold when the costs relate to manufacturing activities. In 2014,
2013 and 2012, Snap-on incurred shipping and handling charges of $40.3 million, $37.9 million and $37.1 million, respectively, that were recorded in “Cost of goods sold” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Shipping and
handling costs incurred in conjunction with selling or distribution activities are included as a component of operating expenses. In 2014, 2013 and 2012, Snap-on incurred shipping and handling charges of $78.5 million, $72.7 million and $65.4
million, respectively; these charges were recorded in “Operating expenses” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

2014 ANNUAL REPORT



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Advertising and promotion:

Production costs of future media advertising are
deferred until the advertising occurs. All other advertising and promotion costs are expensed when incurred. For 2014, 2013 and 2012, advertising and promotion expenses totaled $51.4 million, $49.9 million and $50.1 million, respectively.
Advertising and promotion costs are included in “Operating expenses” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Warranties:

Snap-on provides product warranties for specific product lines and accrues for estimated future warranty costs in the period in which the sale is recorded. See Note 15 for information
on warranties.

Foreign currency:

The financial statements of

Snap-on’s

foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at current rates of exchange, and income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rate for the period. The resulting
translation adjustments are recorded directly into “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Foreign exchange transactions, net of foreign currency hedges, resulted in pretax losses of $1.5
million, $4.4 million and $0.7 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses are reported in “Other income (expense) – net” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Income taxes:

Current tax assets and liabilities are based upon an estimate of taxes refundable or payable for
each of the jurisdictions in which the company is subject to tax. In the ordinary course of business, there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying income tax positions. Snap-on assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years
subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting dates. For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained,

Snap-on

records the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those
income tax positions where it is not more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements. When applicable, associated interest and penalties are recognized as a component of income tax
expense. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax asset or liability on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences arising from differences in bases of assets and liabilities for tax and financial reporting purposes. Deferred income taxes are recorded
on temporary differences using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that
includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. See Note 8 for further
information on income taxes.

Per share data:

Basic earnings per share calculations were computed by dividing net
earnings attributable to

Snap-on

Incorporated by the corresponding weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The dilutive effect of the potential exercise of outstanding options and
stock-settled stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) to purchase common shares is calculated using the treasury stock method. As of January 3, 2015 and December 28, 2013, there were no options or SARs outstanding that were
anti-dilutive. Options to purchase 296,643 shares of

Snap-on

common stock as of 2012 year end were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share as the exercise prices of the options were
greater than the average market price of the common stock and, as a result, the effect on earnings per share would have been anti-dilutive. Performance-based equity awards do not affect the diluted earnings per share calculation until it is
determined that the applicable performance metrics have been met. Snap-on had dilutive securities totaling 921,050 shares, 881,381 shares and 669,503 shares, as of the end of 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. See Note 13 for further information on
equity awards.

Stock-based compensation:

Snap-on recognizes the cost of employee services in exchange for awards of
equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards. That cost, based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period during which the employee is required to
provide the service in exchange for the award. No compensation cost is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite service. The grant date fair value of employee stock options and similar instruments is estimated using the
Black-Scholes valuation model.

The Black-Scholes valuation model requires the input of subjective assumptions,
including the expected life of the stock-based award and stock price volatility. The assumptions used are management’s best estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if
other assumptions had been used, the recorded stock-based compensation expense could have been materially different from that depicted in the financial statements. See Note 13 for further information on stock-based compensation.


SNAP-ON INCORPORATED


Derivatives:

Snap-on utilizes derivative financial instruments, including foreign
currency forward contracts, interest rate swap agreements, treasury lock agreements and prepaid equity forward agreements to manage its exposures to foreign currency exchange rate risks, interest rate risks, and market risk associated with the
stock-based portion of its deferred compensation plans. Snap-on accounts for its derivative instruments at fair value. Snap-on does not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. See Note 10 for further information on
derivatives.

Cash equivalents:

Snap-on considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three
months or less to be cash equivalents. As of 2014 and 2013 year end, cash equivalents primarily consisted of money market funds of $2.5 million and $91.6 million, respectively. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates market value,
and are considered to be Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.

Receivables and allowances for doubtful accounts:

All
trade, finance and contract receivables are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their outstanding principal balance adjusted for any charge-offs and net of allowances for doubtful accounts. Finance and contract receivables also include
accrued interest and contract acquisition costs, net of contract acquisition fees.

Snap-on maintains allowances for doubtful
accounts to absorb probable losses inherent in its portfolio of receivables. The allowances for doubtful accounts represent management’s estimate of the losses inherent in the company’s receivables portfolio based on ongoing assessments
and evaluations of collectability and historical loss experience. In estimating losses inherent in each of its receivable portfolios (trade, finance and contract receivables), Snap-on uses historical loss experience rates by portfolio and applies
them to a related aging analysis. Determination of the proper level of allowances by portfolio requires management to exercise significant judgment about the timing, frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the provision
for credit losses and, therefore, net earnings. The allowances for doubtful accounts takes into consideration numerous quantitative and qualitative factors, by receivable type, including historical loss experience, collection experience, delinquency
trends, economic conditions and credit risk quality as follows:

•

Snap-on

evaluates the collectability of receivables based on a combination of various financial and
qualitative factors that may affect the customers’ ability to pay. These factors may include customers’ financial condition, collateral, debt-servicing ability, past payment experience and credit bureau information.

•

For finance and contract receivables, Snap-on assesses quantitative and qualitative factors through the use of credit quality indicators consisting
primarily of collection experience and other internal metrics as follows:

•

Collection experience – Snap-on conducts monthly reviews of credit and collection performance for each of its finance and contract receivable
portfolios focusing on data such as delinquency trends, non-performing assets, and charge-off and recovery activity. These reviews allow for the formulation of collection strategies and potential collection policy modifications in response to
changing risk profiles in the finance and contract receivable portfolios.

•

Other internal metrics – Snap-on maintains a system that aggregates credit exposure by customer, risk classification and geographical area,
among other factors, to further monitor changing risk profiles.

Management performs detailed reviews of its
receivables on a monthly and/or quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowances based on historical and current trends and other factors affecting credit losses and to determine if any impairment has occurred. A receivable is impaired when
it is probable that all amounts related to the receivable will not be collected according to the contractual terms of the agreement. Additions to the allowances for doubtful accounts are maintained through adjustments to the provision for credit
losses, which are charged to current period earnings; amounts determined to be uncollectable are charged directly against the allowances, while amounts recovered on previously charged-off accounts increase the allowances. Net charge-offs include the
principal amount of losses charged-off as well as charged-off interest and fees. Recovered interest and fees previously charged-off are recorded through the allowances for doubtful accounts and increase the allowances. Finance receivables are
assessed for charge-off when an account becomes 120 days past due and are charged-off typically within 60 days of asset repossession. Contract receivables related to equipment leases are generally charged-off when an account becomes 150 days past
due, while contract receivables related to franchise finance and van leases are generally charged-off up to 180 days past the asset return date. For finance and contract receivables, customer bankruptcies are generally charged-off upon notification
that the associated debt is not being reaffirmed or, in any event, no later than 180 days past due.

2014 ANNUAL REPORT



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Snap-on does not believe that its trade accounts, finance or contract receivables
represent significant concentrations of credit risk because of the diversified portfolio of individual customers and geographical areas. See Note 3 for further information on receivables and allowances for doubtful accounts.

Other accrued liabilities:

Supplemental balance sheet information for “Other accrued liabilities” as of 2014 and 2013
year end is as follows:

Inventories:

Snap-on values its inventory at the lower of cost or market and adjusts for the value
of inventory that is estimated to be excess, obsolete or otherwise unmarketable. Snap-on records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions. Allowances for raw materials are
largely based on an analysis of raw material age and actual physical inspection of raw material for fitness for use. As part of evaluating the adequacy of allowances for work-in-progress and finished goods, management reviews individual product
stock-keeping units (SKUs) by product category and product life cycle. Cost adjustments for each product category/product life-cycle state are generally established and maintained based on a combination of historical experience, forecasted sales and
promotions, technological obsolescence, inventory age and other actual known conditions and circumstances. Should actual product marketability and raw material fitness for use be affected by conditions that are different from management estimates,
further adjustments to inventory allowances may be required.

Snap-on adopted the “last-in, first-out”
(“LIFO”) inventory valuation method in 1973 for its U.S. locations. Snap-on’s U.S. inventories accounted for on a LIFO basis consist of purchased product and inventory manufactured at the company’s heritage U.S. manufacturing
facilities (primarily hand tools and tool storage). As Snap-on began acquiring businesses in the 1990’s, the company retained the “first-in, first-out” (“FIFO”) inventory valuation methodology used by the predecessor
businesses prior to their acquisition by

Snap-on;

the company does not adopt the LIFO inventory valuation methodology for new acquisitions. See Note 4 for further information on inventories.

Property and equipment:

Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and
amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives. Major repairs that extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized, while routine maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software included in
property and equipment reflects costs related to internally developed or purchased software for internal use and is amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment when events or
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived asset may not be recoverable. See Note 5 for further information on property and equipment.

Goodwill and other intangible assets:

Goodwill and other indefinite-lived assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets
might be impaired. Annual impairment tests are performed by the company in the second quarter of each year. Snap-on evaluates the existence of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment on the basis of whether the assets are fully
recoverable from projected, discounted cash flows of the related reportable unit or asset. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives using straight-line and accelerated methods depending on the nature of the
particular asset. See Note 6 for further information on goodwill and other intangible assets.


SNAP-ON INCORPORATED


New accounting standards

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

In May 2014, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

, which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from
contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The ASU is based on the principle that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to
customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue
and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to fulfill a contract. Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or a
modified retrospective approach for the adoption of this standard. The ASU becomes effective for Snap-on at the beginning of its 2017 fiscal year; early adoption is not permitted. The company is currently assessing the impact that this
standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.

Note 2: Acquisitions

On May 28, 2014, Snap-on acquired substantially all of the assets of Pro-Cut International, Inc.
(“Pro-Cut”) for a cash purchase price of $41.3 million. Pro-Cut designs, manufactures and distributes on-car brake lathes, related equipment and accessories used in brake servicing by automotive repair facilities. The acquisition of the
Pro-Cut product line complemented and increased

Snap-on’s

existing undercar equipment product offering, broadened its established capabilities in serving vehicle repair facilities and expanded the
company’s presence with repair shop owners and managers. For segment reporting purposes, the results of operations and assets of Pro-Cut have been included in the Repair Systems & Information Group since the date of acquisition. Pro
forma financial information has not been presented as the net effects of the Pro-Cut acquisition were neither significant nor material to Snap-on’s results of operations or financial position.

On May 13, 2013, Snap-on acquired Challenger Lifts, Inc. (“Challenger”) for a cash purchase price of $38.2
million. Challenger designs, manufactures and distributes a comprehensive line of vehicle lifts and accessories to a diverse customer base in the automotive repair sector. The acquisition of the Challenger vehicle lift product line
complemented and increased Snap-on’s existing undercar equipment product offering, broadened its established capabilities in serving vehicle repair facilities and expanded the company’s presence with repair shop owners and
managers. For segment reporting purposes, the results of operations and assets of Challenger have been included in the Repair Systems & Information Group since the date of acquisition. Pro forma financial information has not been
presented as the net effects of the Challenger acquisition were neither significant nor material to Snap-on’s results of operations or financial position.

Note 3: Receivables

Trade and Other Accounts Receivable

Snap-on’s trade and other accounts receivable primarily arise from the sale of tools and diagnostic and equipment products to a broad range of industrial and commercial customers and to

Snap-on’s

independent franchise van channel on a non-extended-term basis with payment terms generally ranging from 30 to 120 days.

The components of Snap-on’s trade and other accounts receivable as of 2014 and 2013 year end are as follows:

Snap-on’s

industrial and other customers;

Snap-on’s

foreign finance subsidiaries provide similar financing internationally. Interest income on finance and contract receivables is included in “Financial services revenue” on the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

2014 ANNUAL REPORT



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Snap-on’s finance receivables are comprised of extended-term installment payment
contracts to both technicians and independent shop owners (i.e., franchisees’ customers) to enable them to purchase tools and diagnostic and equipment products on an extended-term payment plan, generally with expected average payment terms of
approximately three years. Contract receivables, with payment terms of up to 10 years, are comprised of extended-term installment payment contracts to a broad base of industrial and other customers worldwide, including shop owners, both independents
and national chains, for their purchase of tools and diagnostic and equipment products. Contract receivables also include extended-term installment loans to franchisees to meet a number of financing needs including working capital loans, loans to
enable new franchisees to fund the purchase of the franchise and van leases. Finance and contract receivables are generally secured by the underlying tools and/or diagnostic or equipment products financed and, for installment loans to franchisees,
other franchisee assets.

The components of Snap-on’s current finance and contract receivables as of 2014 and 2013 year
end are as follows:

The components of

Snap-on’s

finance and contract receivables
with payment terms beyond one year as of 2014 and 2013 year end are as follows:


SNAP-ON INCORPORATED


Long-term finance and contract receivables installments, net of unearned finance
charges, as of 2014 and 2013 year end are scheduled as follows:

Delinquency is the primary indicator of credit quality for finance and contract receivables. Receivable
balances are considered delinquent when contractual payments become 30 days past due.

Finance receivables are generally
placed on nonaccrual status (nonaccrual of interest and other fees) (i) when a customer is placed on repossession status; (ii) upon receipt of notification of bankruptcy; (iii) upon notification of the death of a customer; or
(iv) in other instances in which management concludes collectability is not reasonably assured. Finance receivables that are considered nonperforming include receivables that are on nonaccrual status and receivables that are generally more than
90 days past due.

Contract receivables are generally placed on nonaccrual status (i) when a receivable is more than 90
days past due or at the point a customer’s account is placed on terminated status regardless of its delinquency status; (ii) upon notification of the death of a customer; or (iii) in other instances in which management concludes
collectability is not reasonably assured. Contract receivables that are considered nonperforming include receivables that are on nonaccrual status.

The accrual of interest and other fees is resumed when the finance or contract receivable becomes contractually current and collection of all remaining contractual amounts due is reasonably assured.
Finance and contract receivables are evaluated for impairment on a collective basis. A receivable is impaired when it is probable that all amounts related to the receivable will not be collected according to the contractual terms of the applicable
agreement. Impaired receivables are covered by the company’s finance and contract allowances for doubtful accounts reserves and are charged-off against the reserves when appropriate. As of 2014 and 2013 year end, there were $15.5 million and
$15.2 million, respectively, of impaired finance receivables, and there were $1.5 million and $1.0 million, respectively, of impaired contract receivables.

It is the general practice of Snap-on’s financial services business to not engage in contract or loan modifications. In limited instances, Snap-on’s financial services business may modify
certain impaired receivables in troubled debt restructurings. The amount and number of restructured finance and contract receivables as of 2014 and 2013 year end were immaterial to both the financial services portfolio and the company’s results
of operations and financial position.

The aging of finance and contract receivables as of 2014 and 2013 year end is as
follows:

Note 4: Inventories

Inventories by major classification as of 2014 and 2013 year end are as follows:

Inventories accounted for using the FIFO method as of 2014 and 2013 year end approximated 58% and 60%,
respectively, of total inventories. The company accounts for its non-U.S. inventory on the FIFO method. As of 2014 year end, approximately 31% of the company’s U.S. inventory was accounted for using the FIFO method and 69% was accounted for
using the LIFO method. There were no LIFO inventory liquidations in 2014, 2013 or 2012.

Note 5: Property and Equipment

Snap-on’s property and equipment values (which are carried at cost) as of 2014 and 2013 year end are as follows:

The estimated service lives of property and equipment are principally as follows:

Buildings and improvements

2014 ANNUAL REPORT



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Note 6: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment for 2014 and 2013 are as follows:

Goodwill of $810.7 million as of 2014 year end includes $13.2 million of tax-deductible goodwill from the
purchase accounting related to the Pro-Cut acquisition and $24.8 million of non-tax-deductible goodwill from the purchase accounting related to the Challenger acquisition. See Note 2 for additional information on acquisitions.

Additional disclosures related to other intangible assets as of 2014 and 2013 year end are as follows:

The gross carrying values of customer relationships and non-amortized trademarks as of 2014 year end
include $7.4 million and $13.8 million, respectively, related to the Pro-Cut acquisition. The gross carrying values of customer relationships and non-amortized trademarks as of both 2014 and 2013 year end include $5.2 million and $3.2 million,
respectively, related to the Challenger acquisition.

Significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances, such as declines
in profitability and cash flow due to significant and long-term deterioration in macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, the loss of key customers, changes in technology or markets, significant changes in key personnel or litigation, a
significant and sustained decrease in share price and/or other events, including effects from the sale or disposal of a reporting unit, could require a provision for impairment of goodwill and/or other intangible assets in a future period. As of
2014 year end, the company has no accumulated impairment losses.


SNAP-ON INCORPORATED


The weighted-average amortization periods related to other intangible assets are as
follows:

Snap-on is amortizing its customer relationships on both an accelerated and straight-line basis over a 15
year weighted-average life; the remaining intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis. The weighted-average amortization period for all amortizable intangibles on a combined basis is 12 years.

The company’s customer relationships generally have contractual terms of three to five years and are typically renewed without
significant cost to the company. The weighted-average 15 year life for customer relationships is based on the company’s historical renewal experience. Intangible asset renewal costs are expensed as incurred.

The aggregate amortization expense for 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $24.7 million, $25.5 million and $26.5 million, respectively. Based on
current levels of amortizable intangible assets and estimated weighted-average useful lives, estimated annual amortization expense is expected to be $24.3 million in 2015, $19.5 million in 2016, $16.1 million in 2017, $13.4 million in 2018, and
$12.8 million in 2019.

Note 7: Exit and Disposal Activities

Snap-on recorded costs associated with exit and disposal activities of $6.5 million and $6.4 million during 2014 and
2013, respectively. The 2014 and 2013 costs associated with exit and disposal activities by operating segment are as follows:

2014 ANNUAL REPORT



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Costs associated with exit and disposal activities in 2014 primarily related to
headcount reduction and facility consolidation initiatives. Costs associated with exit and disposal activities in 2013 primarily related to headcount reductions from the ongoing optimization of the company’s cost structure in Europe and various
other management and realignment actions. All $6.5 million of exit and disposal costs incurred in 2014 qualified for accrual treatment. Of the $6.4 million of exit and disposal costs incurred in 2013, $6.0 million qualified for accrual treatment.

Snap-on’s exit and disposal accrual activity related to 2014 and 2013 actions is as follows:

Snap-on

reduced headcount by approximately 80 employees in 2014
as part of its restructuring actions. The exit and disposal accrual of $6.5 million as of 2014 year end is expected to be fully utilized in 2015.

Snap-on

expects to fund the remaining cash requirements of its exit and disposal activities with available cash on hand, cash flows from operations and borrowings
under the company’s existing credit facilities. The estimated costs for the exit and disposal activities were based on management’s best business judgment under prevailing circumstances.

Note 8: Income Taxes

The source of earnings before income taxes and equity earnings consisted of the following:


SNAP-ON INCORPORATED


The following is a reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to Snap-on’s effective
tax rate:

2014 ANNUAL REPORT



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

As of 2014 year end, Snap-on had tax net operating loss carryforwards totaling $305.3 million as
follows:

A valuation allowance totaling $34.8 million, $45.4 million and $43.9 million as of 2014, 2013 and 2012
year end, respectively, has been established for deferred income tax assets primarily related to certain subsidiary loss carryforwards that may not be realized. Realization of the net deferred income tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient
taxable income prior to their expiration. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more-likely-than-not that the net deferred income tax assets will be realized. The amount of the net deferred income tax assets considered
realizable, however, could change in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period fluctuate.

The following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits for 2014, 2013 and 2012:

Of the $6.4 million, $4.6 million and $6.8 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of 2014, 2013 and 2012
year end, respectively, approximately $6.4 million, $4.6 million and $4.1 million, respectively, would impact the effective income tax rate if recognized.

Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in income tax expense. During 2014 and 2013, the company reversed a net $0.4 million and $0.6 million, respectively, of interest
and penalties to income associated with unrecognized tax benefits. As of 2014, 2013 and 2012 year end, the company has provided for $0.5 million, $0.9 million and $1.6 million, respectively, of accrued interest and penalties related to
unrecognized tax benefits. The unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest and penalties are included in “Other long-term liabilities” on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Snap-on and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the United States and in various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. It is
reasonably possible that certain unrecognized tax benefits may either be settled with taxing authorities or the statutes of limitations for such items may lapse within the next 12 months, causing Snap-on’s gross unrecognized tax benefits to
decrease by a range of zero to $0.9 million. Over the next 12 months, Snap-on anticipates taking certain tax positions on various tax returns for which the related tax benefit does not meet the recognition threshold. Accordingly, Snap-on’s
gross unrecognized tax benefits may increase by a range of zero to $0.7 million over the next 12 months for uncertain tax positions expected to be taken in future tax filings.

With few exceptions,

Snap-on

is no longer subject to U.S. federal and state/local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2009, and Snap-on is
no longer subject to non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2007.

The undistributed earnings of all non-U.S. subsidiaries totaled $619.1 million, $556.0
million and $492.2 million as of 2014, 2013 and 2012 year end, respectively. Snap-on has not provided any deferred taxes on these undistributed earnings as it considers the undistributed earnings to be permanently invested. Determination of the
amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable.

Note 9: Short-term and Long-term Debt

Short-term and long-term debt as of 2014 and 2013 year end consisted of the following:

*

Includes fair value adjustments related to interest rate swaps.

Notes payable of $56.6 million as of 2014 year end included $37.0 million of commercial paper borrowings and $19.6 million of other
notes; there were no current maturities of long-term debt as of 2014 year end. Notes payable and current maturities of long-term debt of $113.1 million as of 2013 year end included $100.0 million of 5.85% unsecured notes due March 2014 (the
“2014 Notes”) and $13.1 million of other notes; no commercial paper was outstanding as of 2013 year end. Snap-on repaid the 2014 Notes at maturity with available cash and commercial paper borrowings.

The annual maturities of Snap-on’s long-term debt and notes payable over the next five years are $56.6 million in 2015, no
maturities in 2016, $150.0 million in 2017, $250.0 million in 2018 and $200.0 million in 2019.

Average notes payable
outstanding were $45.4 million in 2014 and $13.4 million in 2013. The weighted-average interest rate on notes payable was 5.42% in 2014 and 10.85% in 2013. As of 2014 and 2013 year end, the weighted-average interest rate on outstanding notes payable
was 4.86% and 12.73%, respectively. The lower weighted-average interest rates in 2014 primarily reflect the impact of lower interest rates on commercial paper borrowings; no commercial paper was outstanding during 2013. The weighted-average interest
rates in both years reflect local borrowings in emerging growth markets where interest rates are generally higher.

Snap-on
has a five-year, $700 million multi-currency revolving credit facility that terminates on September 27, 2018 (the “Credit Facility”); no amounts were outstanding under the Credit Facility as of 2014 year end. Borrowings under the
Credit Facility bear interest at varying rates based on Snap-on’s then-current, long-term debt ratings. The Credit Facility’s financial covenant requires that Snap-on maintain, as of each fiscal quarter end, either (i) a ratio not
greater than 0.60 to 1.00 of consolidated net debt (consolidated debt net of certain cash adjustments) to the sum of such consolidated net debt plus total equity and less accumulated other comprehensive income or loss; or (ii) a ratio not
greater than 3.50 to 1.00 of such consolidated net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and certain other adjustments for the preceding four fiscal quarters then ended. As of 2014 year end, the company’s actual
ratios of 0.27 and 1.15, respectively, were both within the permitted ranges set forth in this financial covenant.

Snap-on’s Credit Facility and other debt agreements also contain certain usual and customary borrowing, affirmative, negative and
maintenance covenants. As of 2014 year end, Snap-on was in compliance with all covenants of its Credit Facility and other debt agreements.

2014 ANNUAL REPORT



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Note 10: Financial Instruments

Derivatives:

All derivative instruments are reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements at fair
value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in earnings or on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, depending on whether the derivative is designated and effective as part of a hedged transaction. Gains
or losses on derivative instruments recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“Accumulated OCI”) must be reclassified to earnings in the period in which earnings are affected by the underlying hedged item and the
ineffective portion of all hedges must be recognized in earnings in the period that such portion is determined to be ineffective.

The criteria used to determine if hedge accounting treatment is appropriate are (i) the designation of the hedge to an underlying exposure; (ii) whether or not overall risk is being reduced; and
(iii) if there is a correlation between the value of the derivative instrument and the underlying hedged item. On the date a derivative contract is entered into,

Snap-on

designates the derivative as a
fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, or a natural hedging instrument whose change in fair value is recognized as an economic hedge against changes in the value of the hedged item. Snap-on does not
use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes.

The company is exposed to global market risks, including the
effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and the company’s stock price, and therefore uses derivatives to manage financial exposures that occur in the normal course of business. The primary risks managed by using
derivative instruments are foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and stock-based deferred compensation risk.

Foreign
currency risk management:

Snap-on has significant international operations and is subject to certain risks inherent with foreign operations that include currency fluctuations. Foreign currency exchange risk exists to the extent that Snap-on has
payment obligations or receipts denominated in currencies other than the functional currency, including intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies. To manage these exposures, Snap-on identifies naturally offsetting positions and then
purchases hedging instruments to protect the residual net exposures. Snap-on manages most of these exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows for netting of certain exposures to take advantage of natural offsets. Foreign currency forward
contracts (“foreign currency forwards”) are used to hedge the net exposures. Gains or losses on net foreign currency hedges are intended to offset losses or gains on the underlying net exposures in an effort to reduce the earnings
volatility resulting from fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. Snap-on’s foreign currency forwards are typically not designated as hedges. The fair value changes of these contracts are reported in earnings as foreign exchange gain or
loss, which is included in “Other income (expense) – net” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

As of 2014 year end, Snap-on had $140.4 million of net foreign currency forward buy contracts outstanding comprised of buy contracts including $81.5 million in euros, $34.8 million in Australian dollars,
$22.1 million in Swedish kronor, $16.3 million in British pounds, $10.1 million in Singapore dollars, $5.7 million in South Korean won, $4.5 million in Mexican pesos, $3.6 million in Hong Kong dollars, and $0.5 million in other currencies, and sell
contracts comprised of $16.8 million in Canadian dollars, $10.9 million in Japanese yen, $3.3 million in Danish kroner, and $7.7 million in other currencies. As of 2013 year end,

Snap-on

had $197.1 million of
net foreign currency forward buy contracts outstanding comprised of buy contracts including $89.1 million in euros, $64.3 million in Swedish kronor, $33.8 million in Australian dollars, $26.2 million in British pounds, $12.7 million in Singapore
dollars, $7.8 million in Hong Kong dollars, $5.5 million in South Korean won, and $4.7 million in Mexican pesos, and sell contracts comprised of $25.6 million in Canadian dollars, $12.2 million in Japanese yen, $4.8 million in Danish kroner, and
$4.4 million in other currencies.

Interest rate risk management:

Snap-on aims to control funding costs by managing the
exposure created by the differing maturities and interest rate structures of Snap-on’s borrowings through the use of interest rate swap agreements.

Snap-on enters into interest rate swap agreements (“interest rate swaps”) to manage risks associated with changing interest rates related to the company’s fixed rate borrowings. Interest
rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges. The differentials paid or received on interest rate swaps are recognized as adjustments to “Interest expense” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The effective
portion of the change in fair value of the derivative is recorded in “Long-term debt” on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, while any ineffective portion is recorded as an adjustment to “Interest expense” on the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding and designated as fair value hedges was $100.0 million as of both 2014 and 2013 year end.


SNAP-ON INCORPORATED


Snap-on enters into treasury lock agreements (“treasury locks”) from time to
time to manage the potential change in interest rates in anticipation of issuing fixed rate debt. Treasury locks are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The effective differentials paid or received on treasury locks related to the anticipated
issuance of fixed rate debt are recognized as adjustments to “Interest expense” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. There were no treasury locks outstanding as of 2014 or 2013 year end, and no treasury locks were
settled in 2014 or 2013.

Stock-based deferred compensation risk management:

Snap-on aims to manage market risk
associated with the stock-based portion of its deferred compensation plans through the use of prepaid equity forward agreements (“equity forwards”). Equity forwards are used to aid in offsetting the potential mark-to-market effect on
stock-based deferred compensation from changes in Snap-on’s stock price. Since stock-based deferred compensation liabilities increase as the company’s stock price rises and decrease as the company’s stock price declines, the equity
forwards are intended to mitigate the potential impact on deferred compensation expense that may result from such mark-to-market changes. As of 2014 and 2013 year end, Snap-on had equity forwards in place intended to manage market risk with respect
to 112,800 shares and 105,800 shares, respectively, of Snap-on common stock associated with its deferred compensation plans.

Fair value measurements:

Snap-on has derivative assets and liabilities related to interest rate swaps, foreign currency forwards
and equity forwards that are measured at Level 2 fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of derivative instruments included within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of 2014 and 2013 year end are as follows:

As of 2014 and 2013 year end, the fair value adjustment to long-term debt related to the interest rate
swaps was $14.0 million and $10.1 million, respectively.

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between participants at the measurement date. Level 2 fair value measurements for derivative assets and liabilities are measured using quoted prices in active markets for similar assets
and liabilities. Interest rate swaps are valued based on the six-month LIBOR swap rate for similar instruments. Foreign currency forwards are valued based on exchange rates quoted by domestic and foreign banks for similar instruments. Equity
forwards are valued using a market approach based primarily on the company’s stock price at the reporting date. The company did not have any derivative assets or liabilities measured at Level 1 or Level 3, nor did it implement any changes in
its valuation techniques as of and for its 2014 and 2013 years ended.

2014 ANNUAL REPORT



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

The effect of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges as included in the
Consolidated Statements of Earnings is as follows:

The effect of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges as included in Accumulated OCI on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets and the Consolidated Statements of Earnings is as follows:

The effects of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments as included in the
Consolidated Statements of Earnings are as follows:

Snap-on’s foreign currency forwards are typically not designated as hedges for financial reporting
purposes. The fair value changes of foreign currency forwards not designated as hedging instruments are reported in earnings as foreign exchange gain or loss in “Other income (expense) – net” on the accompanying Consolidated
Statements of Earnings. The $19.3 million derivative loss recognized in 2014 was partially offset by transaction gains on net exposures of $17.8 million, resulting in a net foreign exchange loss of $1.5 million. The $1.9 million derivative gain
recognized in 2013 was more than offset by transaction losses on net exposures of $6.3 million, resulting in a net foreign exchange loss of $4.4 million. The $11.0 million derivative gain recognized in 2012 was more than offset by transaction losses
on net exposures of $11.7 million, resulting in a net foreign exchange loss of $0.7 million. The resulting net foreign exchange losses are included in “Other income (expense) – net” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Earnings. See Note 16 for additional information on “Other income (expense) – net.”

Snap-on’s equity
forwards are not designated as hedges for financial reporting purposes. Fair value changes of both the equity forwards and related stock-based (mark-to-market) deferred compensation liabilities are reported in “Operating expenses” on
the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The $3.6 million derivative gain recognized in 2014 was offset by $3.6 million of mark-to-market deferred compensation expense. The $3.3 million derivative gain recognized in 2013 was more
than offset by $3.7 million of mark-to-market deferred compensation expense. The company did not utilize equity forwards to manage risk associated with the stock-based portion of its deferred compensation plans prior to 2013.

As of 2014 year end, the maximum maturity date of any fair value hedge was seven years. During the next 12 months,

Snap-on

expects to reclassify into earnings net gains from Accumulated OCI of approximately $0.2 million after tax at the time the underlying hedge transactions are realized.


SNAP-ON INCORPORATED


See the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for additional
information on changes in comprehensive income.

Counterparty risk:

Snap-on is exposed to credit losses in the event of
non-performance by the counterparties to its various financial agreements, including its foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swap agreements and prepaid equity forward agreements. Snap-on does not obtain collateral or other security to
support financial instruments subject to credit risk, but monitors the credit standing of the counterparties and generally enters into agreements with financial institution counterparties with a credit rating of A- or better. Snap-on does not
anticipate non-performance by its counterparties, but cannot provide assurances.

Fair value of financial instruments:

The fair values of financial instruments that do not approximate the carrying values in the financial statements as of 2014 and 2013 year end are as follows:

The following methods and assumptions were used in estimating the fair value of financial instruments:

•

Finance and contract receivables include both short-term and long-term receivables. The fair value estimates of finance and contract receivables are
derived utilizing discounted cash flow analyses performed on groupings of receivables that are similar in terms of loan type and characteristics. The cash flow analysis considers recent pre-payment trends where applicable. The cash flows are
discounted over the average life of the receivables using a current market discount rate of a similar term adjusted for credit quality. Significant inputs to the fair value measurements of the receivables are unobservable and, as such, are
classified as Level 3.

•

Fair value of long-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt was estimated, using Level 2 fair value measurements, based on quoted market
values of Snap-on’s publicly traded senior debt. The carrying value of long-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt includes adjustments related to fair value hedges. The fair value of notes payable approximates such
instruments’ carrying value due to their short-term nature.

•

The fair value of all other financial instruments, including cash equivalents, trade and other accounts receivable, accounts payable and other
financial instruments, approximates such instruments’ carrying value due to their short-term nature.

Note 11: Pension Plans

Snap-on

has several non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering
most U.S. employees and certain employees in foreign countries. Snap-on also has foreign contributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain foreign employees. Retirement benefits are generally provided based on employees’ years of
service and average earnings or stated amounts for years of service. Normal retirement age is 65, with provisions for earlier retirement. In 2012, the company settled a Canadian pension plan following the 2011 closure of its Newmarket, Canada,
facility.

2014 ANNUAL REPORT



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

The objective of Snap-on’s discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which
the pension benefits could be effectively settled. In making this determination, the company takes into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans. The domestic discount rate as of 2014 and 2013 year
end was selected based on a cash flow matching methodology developed by the company’s outside actuaries and which incorporates a review of current economic conditions. This methodology matches the plans’ yearly projected benefit cash flows
to those of hypothetical bond portfolios using high-quality, AA rated or better, corporate bonds from either Moody’s Investors Service or Standard & Poor’s credit rating agencies available at the measurement date. This technique
calculates bond portfolios that produce adequate cash flows to pay the plans’ projected yearly benefits and then selects the portfolio with the highest yield and uses that yield as the recommended discount rate.

The weighted-average discount rate for Snap-on’s domestic pension plans of 4.2% represents the single rate that produces the same
present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments. Lowering Snap-on’s domestic discount rate assumption by 50 basis points (100 basis points (“bps”) equals 1.0 percent) would have increased Snap-on’s 2014
domestic pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately $6.0 million and $63.4 million, respectively. As of 2014 year end, Snap-on’s domestic projected benefit obligation comprised approximately 82% of

Snap-on’s

worldwide projected benefit obligation. The weighted-average discount rate for Snap-on’s foreign pension plans of 3.3% represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash
flows as the estimated benefit plan payments. Lowering Snap-on’s foreign discount rate assumption by 50 bps would have increased Snap-on’s 2014 foreign pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately $1.9 million and
$22.7 million, respectively.

Actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit
obligation or market-related value of assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average remaining life expectancy for plans with primarily inactive participants. Prior
service costs and credits resulting from plan amendments are amortized in equal annual amounts over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average remaining life expectancy for plans with primarily inactive
participants.

Snap-on

uses the last day of its fiscal year end as the measurement
date for its plans. Snap-on funds its pension plans as required by governmental regulation and may consider discretionary contributions as conditions warrant. Snap-on intends to make contributions of $7.1 million to its foreign pension plans and
$2.0 million to its domestic pension plans in 2015, as required by law. Depending on market and other conditions,

Snap-on

may elect to make discretionary cash contributions to its pension plans in 2015.

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are expected to be paid as follows:

Snap-on’s

domestic pension plans have a long-term investment
horizon and a total return strategy that emphasizes a capital growth objective. The long-term investment performance objective for

Snap-on’s

domestic plans’ assets is to achieve net of expense
returns that meet or exceed the 7.6% domestic long-term, rate-of-return-on-assets assumption used for reporting purposes.

Snap-on

uses a three-year, market-related value asset method of amortizing the
difference between actual and expected returns on its domestic plans’ assets.


SNAP-ON INCORPORATED


The basis for determining the overall expected long-term, rate-of-return-on-assets
assumption is a nominal returns forecasting method. For each asset class, future returns are estimated by identifying the premium of riskier asset classes over lower risk alternatives. The methodology constructs expected returns using a
“building block” approach to the individual components of total return. These forecasts are stated in both nominal and real (after inflation) terms. This process first considers the long-term historical return premium based on the longest
set of data available for each asset class. These premiums are then adjusted based on current relative valuation levels and macro-economic conditions.

For risk and correlation assumptions, the actual experience for each asset class is reviewed for the longest time period available. Expected relationships for a 10 to 20 year time horizon are determined
based upon historical results, with adjustments made for material changes.

Investments are diversified to attempt to minimize
the risk of large losses. Since asset allocation is a key determinant of expected investment returns, assets are periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation to correct significant deviations from the asset allocation policy that are caused by
market fluctuations and cash flow. Asset/liability studies are conducted periodically to determine if any revisions to the strategic asset allocation policy are necessary.

Snap-on’s

domestic pension plans’ target allocation and actual weighted-average asset allocation by asset category and fair value of plan assets as of
2014 and 2013 year end are as follows:

The fair value measurement hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy
gives the highest priority (“Level 1”) to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and the lowest priority (“Level 3”) to unobservable inputs. Fair value measurements primarily based on
observable market information are given a “Level 2” priority.

Shares of certain equity and debt securities valued
at quoted market prices for which an official close or last trade pricing on an active exchange is available are categorized as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Shares of commingled equity securities, corporate bonds, commingled multi-strategy
funds and insurance contracts are valued at the net asset value (“NAV”), as reported by the fund managers, based on the value of the underlying assets less liabilities, with each NAV divided by the respective number of units outstanding.
The resulting unit price is quoted on a private market and is based on the value of the underlying investment, which is primarily based on observable inputs; such investments are categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Private equity
partnership funds, hedge funds, and real estate and other real assets, all of which have redemption restrictions, are stated at estimated fair value (based on the estimated fair market value of the underlying investments) as reported by the fund
manager and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The company regularly reviews fund performance directly with its investment advisor and the fund managers, and performs qualitative analysis to corroborate the reasonableness of the
reported net asset values. For Level 3 funds for which the company did not receive a year-end net asset value, the company recorded an estimate of the change in fair value for the latest period based on return estimates and other fund activity
obtained from the fund managers.

The following is a summary, by asset category, of the fair value and the level within
the fair value hierarchy of

Snap-on’s

domestic pension plans’ assets as of 2013 year end:

The following is a summary of the 2013 changes in fair value of the domestic plans’ assets with Level 3 inputs:

Snap-on’s

primary investment objective for its foreign
pension plans’ assets is to meet the projected obligations to the beneficiaries over a long period of time, and to do so in a manner that is consistent with the company’s risk tolerance. The foreign asset allocation policies consider the
company’s financial strength and long-term asset class risk/return expectations, since the obligations are long term in nature. The company believes the foreign pension plans’ assets, which are managed locally by professional investment
firms, are well diversified.

The expected long-term rate of return on foreign plans’ assets reflects management’s
expectations of long-term average rates of return on funds invested to provide benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. The expected return is based on the outlook for inflation, fixed income returns and equity returns, asset
allocation and investment strategy. Differences between actual and expected returns on foreign pension plans’ assets are recorded as an actuarial gain or loss and amortized accordingly.

Snap-on has several 401(k) plans covering certain U.S. employees. Snap-on’s employer match to the
401(k) plans is made with cash contributions. For 2014, 2013 and 2012, Snap-on recognized $6.5 million, $5.9 million and $5.7 million, respectively, of expense related to its 401(k) plans.

Note 12: Postretirement Plans

Snap-on

provides health care benefits for certain retired U.S. employees.
Employees retiring prior to 1989 were eligible for retiree medical coverage upon reaching early retirement age, with no retiree contributions required. Benefits are paid based on deductibles and percentages of covered expenses and take into
consideration payments made by Medicare and other insurance coverage.

Since 1989, U.S. retirees have been eligible for
comprehensive major medical plans. Benefits are paid based on deductibles and percentages of covered expenses, and plan provisions allow for benefit and coverage changes. Most retirees are required to pay the entire cost of the coverage, but Snap-on
may elect to subsidize the cost of coverage under certain circumstances.

Snap-on

has
a Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association (“VEBA”) trust for the funding of existing postretirement health care benefits for certain non-salaried retirees in the United States; all other retiree health care plans are unfunded.

The status of Snap-on’s U.S. postretirement health care plans as of 2014 and 2013 year end is as follows:

2014 ANNUAL REPORT



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of 2014 and 2013 year end are as follows:

The methodology for selecting the year-end 2014 and 2013 weighted-average discount rate for the
company’s domestic postretirement plans was to match the plans’ yearly projected cash flows to those of hypothetical bond portfolios using high-quality, AA rated or better, corporate bonds from either Moody’s Investors Service or
Standard & Poor’s credit rating agencies available at the measurement date.

The actuarial calculation assumes a
health care cost trend rate of 7.2% in 2015, decreasing gradually to 4.5% in 2028 and thereafter. As of 2014 year end, a one-percentage-point increase in the health care cost trend rate for future years would increase the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation by approximately $0.9 million and the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components by less than $0.1 million. Conversely, a one-percentage-point decrease in the health care cost trend rate for future years would
decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $0.8 million and the aggregate of the service cost and interest rate components by less than $0.1 million.


SNAP-ON INCORPORATED


The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are expected to be paid as
follows:

The objective of the VEBA trust is to achieve net of expense returns that meet or exceed the 6.8%
long-term, rate-of-return-on-assets assumption used for reporting purposes. Investments are diversified to attempt to minimize the risk of large losses. Since asset allocation is a key determinant of expected investment returns, assets are

category and fair value of plan assets as of 2014 and 2013 year end are as follows:

The fair value measurement hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy
gives the highest priority (Level 1) to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and the lowest priority (Level 3) to unobservable inputs. Fair value measurements primarily based on observable market
information are given a Level 2 priority.

Shares of debt securities, certain equity securities and real estate and other real
assets valued at quoted market prices for which an official close or last trade pricing on an active exchange is available are categorized as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Certain other equity securities are valued at the net asset value
(“NAV”), as reported by the fund manager, based on the value of the underlying assets less liabilities, with this NAV divided by the number of units outstanding. The resulting unit price is quoted on a private market and is based on the
value of the underlying investment, which is primarily based on observable inputs; such investments are categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Hedge funds, which have redemption restrictions, are stated at estimated fair value (based on
the estimated fair market value of the underlying investments) as reported by the fund manager and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The company regularly reviews fund performance directly with its investment advisor and
the fund managers, and performs qualitative analysis to corroborate the reasonableness of the reported net asset values. For Level 3 funds for which the company did not receive a year-end net asset value, the company recorded an estimate of the
change in fair value for the latest period based on return estimates and other fund activity obtained from the fund managers.

Note 13: Stock-based Compensation and Other Stock Plans

The 2011 Incentive Stock and Awards Plan (the “2011 Plan”) provides for the grant of stock options,
performance awards, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) and restricted stock awards (which may be designated as “restricted stock units” or “RSUs”). No further grants are being made under its predecessor, the 2001
Incentive Stock and Awards Plan (the “2001 Plan”), although outstanding awards under the 2001 Plan will continue until exercised, forfeited or expired. As of 2014 year end, the 2011 Plan had 1,884,063 shares available for future grants.
The company uses treasury stock to deliver shares under both the 2001 and 2011 Plans.

Net stock-based compensation expense
was $38.1 million in 2014, $38.5 million in 2013 and $32.1 million in 2012. Cash received from stock purchase and option plan exercises was $33.0 million in 2014, $29.2 million in 2013 and $46.8 million in 2012. The tax benefit realized from both
the exercise and vesting of share-based payment arrangements was $22.3 million in 2014, $18.3 million in 2013 and $15.4 million in 2012.

Stock Options

Stock
options are granted with an exercise price equal to the market value of a share of Snap-on’s common stock on the date of grant and have a contractual term of ten years. Stock option grants vest ratably on the first, second and third
anniversaries of the date of grant.

The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes valuation model. The company uses historical data regarding stock option exercise behaviors for different participating groups to estimate the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. Expected volatility is
based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock for the length of time corresponding to the expected term of the option. The expected dividend yield is based on the company’s historical dividend payments. The risk-free interest
rate is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve on the grant date for the expected term of the option. The following weighted-average assumptions were used in calculating the fair value of stock options granted during 2014, 2013 and 2012, using the
Black-Scholes valuation model:

A summary of stock option activity during 2014 is presented below:

*

Weighted-average

The weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted was $20.19 in 2014, $17.36 in 2013 and $15.46 in 2012. The intrinsic value of options exercised was $24.6 million in 2014, $14.1 million in
2013 and $23.0 million in 2012. The fair value of stock options vested was $9.6 million in 2014, $7.9 million in 2013 and $5.8 million in 2012.

2014 ANNUAL REPORT



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

As of 2014 year end there was $13.2 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to
non-vested stock options that is expected to be recognized as a charge to earnings over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years.

Performance Awards

Performance awards, which are granted as performance share units and performance-based RSUs, are earned and expensed using the fair value
of the award over a contractual term of three years based on the company’s performance. Vesting of the performance awards is dependent upon performance relative to pre-defined goals for revenue growth and return on net assets for the applicable
performance period. For performance achieved above a certain level, the recipient may earn additional shares of stock, not to exceed 100% of the number of performance awards initially granted.

The performance share units have a three-year performance period based on the results of the consolidated financial metrics of the
company. The performance-based RSUs have a one-year performance period based on the results of the consolidated financial metrics of the company followed by a two-year cliff vesting schedule, assuming continued employment.

The fair value of performance awards is calculated using the market value of a share of Snap-on’s common stock on the date of grant.
The weighted-average grant date fair value of performance awards granted during 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $102.11, $77.33 and $60.00, respectively. Vested performance share units approximated 131,000 shares as of 2014 year end, 148,000 shares as of
2013 year end and 213,000 shares as of 2012 year end. Performance share units of 146,313 shares, 213,459 shares and 53,990 shares were paid out in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Earned performance share units are generally paid out following the
conclusion of the applicable performance period upon approval by the Organization and Executive Compensation Committee of the company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”).

Based on the company’s 2014 performance, 78,585 RSUs granted in 2014 were earned; assuming continued employment, these RSUs will
vest at the end of fiscal 2016. Based on the company’s 2013 performance, 84,413 RSUs granted in 2013 were earned; assuming continued employment, these RSUs will vest at the end of fiscal 2015. Based on the company’s 2012 performance,
95,047 RSUs granted in 2012 were earned; these RSUs vested as of fiscal 2014 year end and were paid out shortly thereafter.

The changes to
the company’s non-vested performance awards in 2014 are as follows:

*

Weighted-average

As of 2014 year end there was approximately $15.1 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested performance awards that is expected to be recognized as a charge to earnings over a
weighted-average period of 1.6 years.

Stock Appreciation Rights (“SARs”)

The company also issues cash-settled and stock-settled SARs to certain key non-U.S. employees. SARs have a contractual term of ten years
and vest ratably on the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant. SARs are granted with an exercise price equal to the market value of a share of Snap-on’s common stock on the date of grant.

Cash-settled SARs provide for the cash payment of the excess of the fair market value of Snap-on’s common stock price on the date of
exercise over the grant price. Cash-settled SARs have no effect on dilutive shares or shares outstanding as any appreciation of Snap-on’s common stock value over the grant price is paid in cash and not in common stock.


SNAP-ON INCORPORATED


The company began issuing stock-settled SARs in 2013. Stock-settled SARs are accounted
for as equity instruments and provide for the issuance of Snap-on common stock equal to the amount by which the company’s stock has appreciated over the exercise price. Stock-settled SARs have an effect on dilutive shares and shares outstanding
as any appreciation of Snap-on’s common stock value over the exercise price will be settled in shares of common stock.

The fair value of cash-settled SARs is revalued (mark-to-market) each reporting period using the Black-Scholes valuation model based on
Snap-on’s period-end stock price. The fair value of stock-settled SARs is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The company uses historical data regarding SARs exercise behaviors for different participating
groups to estimate the expected term of the SARs granted based on the period of time that similar instruments granted are expected to be outstanding. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock for the
length of time corresponding to the expected term of the SARs. The expected dividend yield is based on the company’s historical dividend payments. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect as of the
reporting date (for cash-settled SARs) or grant date (for stock-settled SARs) for the length of time corresponding to the expected term of the SARs.

The following weighted-average assumptions were used in calculating the fair value of cash-settled SARs granted during 2014, 2013 and 2012 using the Black-Scholes valuation model:

The intrinsic value of cash-settled SARs exercised was $5.5 million in 2014, $4.4 million in 2013 and
$5.4 million in 2012. The fair value of cash-settled SARs vested during 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $5.9 million, $5.7 million and $3.5 million, respectively.

Changes to the company’s non-vested cash-settled SARs in 2014 are as follows:

*

Weighted-average

As of 2014 year end there was $3.2 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested cash-settled SARs that is expected to be recognized as a charge to earnings over a weighted-average
period of 0.3 years.

The following weighted-average assumptions were used in calculating the fair value of stock-settled SARs
granted during 2014 and 2013 using the Black-Scholes valuation model:

2014 ANNUAL REPORT



Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

A summary of stock-settled SARs activity in 2014 is presented below:

*

Weighted-average

The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock-settled SARs granted during 2014 and 2013 was $19.55 and $17.47, respectively. The intrinsic value of stock-settled SARs exercised during 2014 and 2013
was $0.1 million and zero, respectively. The fair value of stock-settled SARs vested during 2014 and 2013 was $0.6 million and zero, respectively.

As of 2014 year end there was $2.4 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock-settled SARs that is expected to be recognized as a charge to earnings over a weighted-average
period of 1.7 years.

Restricted Stock Awards – Non-employee Directors

The company awarded non-employee directors 10,398 shares and 13,437 shares of restricted stock in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The
company awarded non-employee directors 17,811 shares of non-performance-based RSUs in 2012. The fair value of the restricted stock awards is expensed over the one year vesting period based on the fair value on the date of grant. All
restrictions for the restricted stock generally lapse upon the earlier of the first anniversary of the grant date, the recipient’s death or disability or in the event of a change in control, as defined in the 2011 Plan. If termination of
the recipient’s service occurs prior to the first anniversary of the grant date for any reason other than death or disability, the shares of restricted stock would be forfeited, unless otherwise determined by the Board. The fair value of
the non-performance-based RSUs granted in 2012 was expensed in full on the date of grant at the grant date fair value. All restrictions on the non-performance-based RSUs will lapse upon the recipient’s termination of service as a director or in
the event of a change in control. At the time of grant, directors had the opportunity to elect to defer receipt of all or part of the non-performance-based RSUs upon the lapsing of restriction provisions.

Directors’ Fee Plan

Under the Directors’ 1993 Fee Plan, as amended, non-employee directors may elect to receive up to 100% of their fees and retainer in
shares of

Snap-on’s

common stock. Directors may elect to defer receipt of all or part of these shares. In addition, directors may elect to defer receipt of all or part of their non-performance-based RSUs
into the Directors’ Fee Plan upon the lapsing of restriction provisions. For 2014, 2013 and 2012, issuances under the Directors’ Fee Plan totaled 21,533 shares, 2,313 shares and 11,025 shares, respectively, of which 20,483 shares, 1,021
shares and 9,278 shares, respectively, were deferred. As of 2014 year end, shares reserved for issuance to directors under this plan totaled 146,944 shares.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Substantially all Snap-on employees in the
United States and Canada are eligible to participate in an employee stock purchase plan. The purchase price of the company’s common stock to participants is the lesser of the mean of the high and low price of the stock on the beginning date
