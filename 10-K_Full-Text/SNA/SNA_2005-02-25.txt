PART I

Item 1: Business

Snap-on Incorporated
(“Snap-on” or “the company”) was incorporated under the laws of the
state of Wisconsin in 1920 and reincorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in
1930. Snap-on is a leading global innovator, manufacturer and marketer of high-quality
tool, diagnostic and equipment solutions for professional tool and equipment users.
Product lines include a broad range of hand and power tools, tool storage, saws and
cutting tools, pruning tools, vehicle service diagnostics equipment, vehicle service
equipment, including wheel service, safety testing and collision repair equipment, vehicle
service information, business management systems, equipment repair services, and other
tool and equipment solutions. Snap-on’s customers include automotive technicians,
vehicle service centers, manufacturers, industrial tool and equipment users, and those
involved in commercial applications such as construction, electrical and agriculture.

Snap-on markets its products and
brands through multiple distribution sales channels in more than 110 countries.
Snap-on’s largest geographic markets include the United States, Australia, Canada,
France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The
originator of the mobile dealer van tool distribution channel in the automotive repair
segment, Snap-on also reaches its customers through company direct, distributor and
Internet channels.

Snap-on’s business segments are
based on the organization structure used by management for making operating and investment
decisions and for assessing performance. Snap-on’s reportable business segments
include: (i) the Snap-on Dealer Group, (ii) the Commercial and Industrial Group, (iii) the
Diagnostics and Information Group and (iv) Financial Services. The Snap-on Dealer Group
consists of Snap-on’s business operations serving the worldwide franchised dealer van
channel. The Commercial and Industrial Group consists of the business operations providing
tools and equipment products and equipment repair services to a broad range of industrial
and commercial customers worldwide through direct, distributor and other non-franchised
distribution channels. The Diagnostics and Information Group consists of the business
operations providing diagnostics equipment, vehicle service information, business
management systems and other solutions for customers in the worldwide vehicle service and
repair marketplace. Financial Services is a new business segment, beginning in fiscal
2004, consisting of the business operations of Snap-on Credit LLC (“SOC”), a
consolidated 50%-owned joint venture between Snap-on and The CIT Group, Inc.
(“CIT”), and Snap-on’s wholly owned finance subsidiaries in those
international markets where Snap-on has dealer operations. For additional information
about Snap-on’s business segments, customers, domestic and international operations,
and products and services, see Note 18 entitled “Segments” on pages 56 through
58 of Snap-on’s 2004 Annual Report, incorporated herein by reference.

The

tools

product
category

is comprised of hand tools, power tools and tool storage
products. Hand tools include wrenches, screwdrivers, sockets, pliers, ratchets, saws and
cutting tools, pruning tools and other similar products. Power tools include pneumatic
(air), cordless (battery) and corded (electric) tools such as impact wrenches, ratchets,
chisels, drills, sanders, polishers and similar products. Tool storage units include tool
chests, roll cabinets and other similar products. The majority of products are
manufactured by Snap-on, and in completing the product line, other items are purchased from
external manufacturers.

The

equipment

product category
is comprised of solutions for the diagnosis and service of automotive and industrial
equipment. Products include engine analyzers, air conditioning service equipment, brake
service equipment, fluid exchange equipment, wheel balancing and alignment equipment,
transmission troubleshooting equipment, safety testing equipment, battery chargers, lifts
and hoists, diagnostics equipment, and service and collision repair equipment. Also
included are service and repair information products, diagnostic services, business
management systems, point-of-sale systems, integrated systems for vehicle service shops,
equipment repair services and purchasing facilitation services. Snap-on supports the sale
of its diagnostics and vehicle service shop equipment by offering training programs for
its customers, primarily focusing on the technologies and the application of specific
products developed and marketed by Snap-on.

Tools and equipment are marketed
under a number of brand names and trademarks, many of which are well known in the vehicle
service and industrial markets served. Some of the major trade names and trademarks
and the products and services with which they are associated include the following:

Snap-on also derives income from
financing its products through SOC, a 50%-owned financial services joint venture, and
through Snap-on’s wholly owned finance subsidiaries. Snap-on utilizes various
financing programs to facilitate the sales of its products.

Snap-on established SOC in January
1999 with Newcourt Financial USA Inc., now The CIT Group, Inc. (“CIT”). SOC
provides financial services to Snap-on’s U.S. dealer and customer network and to
Snap-on’s industrial and other customers. Beginning in 2004, Snap-on began
consolidating SOC on a prospective basis as a result of the January 4, 2004, adoption of
the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Interpretation No. 46R,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (an interpretation of ARB No. 51).”
Additional information about SOC is provided in Note 9 entitled “Snap-on Credit LLC
Joint Venture” on pages 45 and 46 of Snap-on’s 2004 Annual Report, incorporated
herein by reference.

SOC originates loans primarily in
three ways. First, extended-term contracts are offered to technicians to enable them to
purchase tools and equipment on an extended-term payment plan, generally with an average
term of 32 months. Second, lease financing is offered to shop owners and managers, both
independent and national chains, who purchase equipment items. The duration of lease
contracts is often two to five years. Third, financing options are also available to
dealers to meet a number of financing needs, including van and truck leases, working
capital loans, and loans to enable new dealers to fund the purchase of the franchise. The
duration of these contracts can be up to 10 years. The above contracts are generally
secured by the underlying tools or equipment financed and other dealer assets.

Currently, the majority of finance
income is derived from the vehicle service industry in North America. Internationally,
Snap-on continues to provide financing directly to its dealer and customer networks
through its wholly owned finance subsidiaries.

Sales and Distribution

Snap-on markets and distributes its
products and related services principally to professional

tool and
equipment users around the world. The two largest market sectors are the vehicle service
and repair sector and the industrial sector.

Vehicle Service and
Repair Sector

The vehicle service and repair sector
has three main customer groups: professional technicians who purchase tools and equipment
for themselves; vehicle service and repair shop owners and managers — including
independent shops, national chains and automotive dealerships — who purchase
equipment for use by multiple technicians within a service or repair facility; and vehicle
manufacturers.

Snap-on provides innovative tool and
equipment solutions, as well as technical sales support and training, to meet
technicians’ evolving needs. Snap-on’s franchised dealer van distribution system
offers technicians the convenience of purchasing quality tools with minimal disruption of
their work routine. Snap-on also provides owners and managers of shops, where technicians
work, with tools, diagnostics equipment, repair and service information, and shop
management products. Snap-on provides vehicle manufacturers with products and services
including tools, consulting services and facilitation services. Snap-on’s
facilitation services include product procurement, distribution and administrative support
to customers for their dealership equipment programs.

Major challenges for Snap-on and the
vehicle service and repair sector include the increasing rate of technological change
within motor vehicles and the resulting impact on the businesses of both our suppliers and
customers that is necessitated by such change. Snap-on believes it is a meaningful
participant in the market sector for vehicle service and repair.


Industrial Sector

Snap-on markets its products to a
wide variety of industrial customers including industrial maintenance and repair
operations; manufacturing and assembly facilities; government facilities; schools; and
original equipment manufacturers that require instrumentation or service tools and
equipment for their products.

Major challenges in the industrial
sector include a highly competitive, cost-conscious environment, and a trend toward
customers making all of their tool purchases through one integrated supplier. Snap-on
believes it is a meaningful participant in the market sector for industrial tools and
equipment.

Distribution Channels

Snap-on serves customers primarily
through three channels of distribution: the mobile dealer van channel
(“dealers”), including the company’s technical representatives (“tech
rep”) organization, company direct sales and distributors. The following discussion
represents Snap-on’s general approach in each channel, and is not intended to be
all-inclusive.

Dealers and Technical
Representatives

In the United States, the majority of
sales to the vehicle service and repair sector are conducted through Snap-on’s
dealers and its tech rep organization. Snap-on’s dealers primarily cover vehicle
service technicians and vehicle service shop owners, generally providing weekly contact at
the customer’s place of business. Dealers’ sales are concentrated in hand and
power tools, tool storage units and small diagnostic and shop equipment, which can easily
be transported in a van and demonstrated during a brief sales call. Dealers purchase
Snap-on’s products at a discount from suggested retail prices and resell them at
prices established by the dealer. Although some dealers have sales areas defined by other
methods, most

U.S. dealers are provided a list of places of business
that serves as the basis of the dealer’s sales route.

Since 1991, new U.S. dealers, and a
majority of the pre-1991 U.S. dealers, have been enrolled as franchisees of Snap-on.
Snap-on also provides certain franchisees the opportunity to add vans to their franchise
or to add a limited number of franchises. Snap-on charges nominal initial and ongoing
monthly license fees. Through SOC, financing is available to franchised dealers, which
includes van and truck leases, working capital loans, and loans to enable new dealers to
fund the purchase of the franchise. At year-end 2004, approximately 95%, or 3,726 of U.S.
dealers were enrolled as franchisees, or employed by franchisees, as compared with
approximately 95%, or 4,032 at year-end 2003.

Snap-on has replicated its U.S.
dealer van method of distribution in certain other countries, including Australia, Canada,
Germany, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. In many of
these markets, as in the United States, purchase decisions are generally made or
influenced by professional vehicle service technicians and shop owners. Snap-on markets
products in certain other countries through its subsidiary, Snap-on Tools International,
Ltd., which sells to foreign distributors under license or contract with Snap-on.
Internationally, Snap-on offers financing to its franchised dealer and customer networks
through its wholly owned finance subsidiaries.

Snap-on supports its dealers with a
field organization of branch offices, sales and field managers, and service and
distribution centers. Snap-on also provides sales and business training, customer and
dealer financing programs through SOC and through its wholly owned international finance
operations, and marketing and product promotion programs designed to strengthen dealer
sales. In the United States and Canada, the National Dealer Advisory Council and the
Snap-on Tools Canadian Dealer Advisory Council, both of which are composed of dealers that
are elected by dealers, assist Snap-on in identifying and implementing enhancements to the
franchise program.

In the United States, dealers are
supported by the tech rep sales force. Tech reps are specialists who demonstrate and sell
higher-price-point diagnostics and shop equipment, as well as vehicle service shop
management information systems. Tech reps work independently and with dealers to identify
and generate sales leads among vehicle service shop owners and managers. Tech reps are
Snap-on employees who are compensated primarily on the basis of commission; a dealer
receives a brokerage fee from certain sales made by the tech reps to the dealer’s
customers. Most products sold through the dealer and tech rep organization are sold under
the

Snap-on

,

Blue-Point,

Sun

and

ShopKey

brand names.

Company Direct Sales

In the United States, a growing
proportion of shop equipment sales under the

Sun, John Bean, Wheeltronic, White and
Blackhawk

brands and information products under the

Mitchell1

brand

are
made by a direct sales force that has responsibility for national accounts. As the vehicle
service and repair sector consolidates (with more business conducted by national chains,
automotive dealerships and franchised service centers), these larger organizations can be
serviced most effectively by sales people who can demonstrate and sell the full line of
equipment and diagnostic products and services. Snap-on also sells these products and
services directly to vehicle manufacturers.


To enhance its existing direct sales
distribution network the company formed, in 2003, the Technical Automotive Group, a
factory-direct sales force aimed at distributing equipment to repair service operations.

John Bean, White and Blackhawk

brands are sold directly to end customers primarily
through sales leads generated from dealers and Tech reps.

Snap-on

brand tools and
equipment are marketed to industrial and governmental customers in the United States
through both industrial sales representatives, who are employees, and independent
industrial distributors. In most markets outside the United States, industrial sales are
conducted through independent distributors. The sales representatives focus on industrial
customers whose main purchase criteria are quality and service. At the end of 2004,
Snap-on had industrial sales representatives in the United States, Australia, Canada,
Japan, Mexico, Puerto Rico and some European countries, with the United States
representing the majority of Snap-on’s total industrial sales.

Distributors

Sales of certain tools and equipment
are made through independent vehicle service and industrial distributors who purchase the
items from Snap-on and resell them to the end users. Products supplied by Bahco, under the

Bahco, Fish and Hook

(design)

, Belzer, Pradines

and

Lindstrom

brands
and trade names, for example, are sold through distributors in Europe, North and South
America, Asia and certain other parts of the world. Wheel service and other vehicle
service equipment are sold through distributors primarily under brands including

Hofmann

and

Kansas Jack

. Hand tools under the

Irimo, Palmera

and

Acesa

brands and power tools under the

Sioux

brand, are differentiated from
those products sold through the dealer, tech rep and direct sales channels.

Sun

-branded equipment is marketed through distributors in South America and
Asia

,

and through both a direct sales force and distributors in
Europe.

E-commerce

Snap-on’s e-commerce development
initiatives allow Snap-on to combine the capabilities of the Internet with Snap-on’s
existing brand sales and distribution strengths to reach new and under-served customer
segments. Snap-on began selling

Snap-on

brand products through the Internet in 2000
to offer both current and prospective customers online, around-the-clock access to
purchase

Snap-on

and

Blue-Point

products through its public website at

www.snapon.com

. The site features an online catalog containing nearly 14,000
products, including

Snap-on

hand tools, power tools, tool storage units and
diagnostic equipment available to consumers and professionals in the United States, the
United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. At the end of 2004, Snap-on had more than 210,000
registered users, including approximately 25,000 industrial accounts. E-commerce, as well
as other system enhancement initiatives that are currently under development, are designed
to further leverage the one-on-one relationships and service Snap-on has with its current
and prospective customers. Through the development of its business-to-business and
business-to-consumer capabilities, Snap-on and its dealers are enhancing communications
with customers on a real-time, 24-hour, 7-days a week basis.

Competition

Snap-on competes on the basis of its
product quality and performance, service, brand awareness and technological innovation.
While no single company competes with Snap-on across all of its product lines and
distribution channels, various companies compete in one or more product categories and/or
distribution channels.

Snap-on believes that it is a leading
manufacturer and distributor of professional tools and equipment, offering the broadest
line of these products to the vehicle service industry. The major competitors selling to
professional technicians in the vehicle service and repair sector through the mobile van
channel include MAC Tools (The Stanley Works) and Matco (Danaher Corporation). Snap-on
also competes with companies that sell through non-mobile van distributors including Facom
(Fimalac), Sears, Roebuck and Co. and The Stanley Works. Within the power tools category,
Snap-on’s major competitors include Atlas Copco, Ingersoll-Rand, Cooper Industries,
Inc., Black & Decker Corporation, Bosch, and Makita Corporation. In the industrial
sector, major competitors include Armstrong (Danaher Corporation), Cooper Industries, Inc.
and Proto (The Stanley Works). The major competitors selling diagnostics

and shop equipment to shop owners and managers in the vehicle service and
repair sector include Corghi S.p.A., Facom (Fimalac), Hennessy (Danaher Corporation),
Hunter Engineering, OTC and Robinair (SPX Corporation), and Rotary and Chief Automotive
(Dover Corporation).

Research and Engineering

Research and engineering expenses
totaled $60.8 million, $59.8 million and $57.1 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002.


Raw Materials and
Purchased Product

In general, Snap-on’s supply of
raw materials and purchased components are readily available from numerous suppliers.
During 2004, Snap-on experienced availability and pricing issues related to certain grades
and alloys of steel. While we believe that steel prices will continue to remain high for
2005, as of the date of this Form 10-K, we do not anticipate experiencing any significant
availability issues with regards to 2005 steel purchases.

Approximately 69% of 2004
consolidated net sales consisted of products manufactured by Snap-on, while the remaining
31% consisted of products purchased from outside suppliers. No single supplier’s
products accounted for a material portion of 2004 consolidated net sales.

Patents, Trademarks and
Other Intellectual Property

Snap-on vigorously pursues and relies
on patent protection to protect its intellectual property and its position in its markets.
As of January 1, 2005, Snap-on and its subsidiaries held over 900 active and pending
patents in the United States and over 1,700 active and pending patents outside of the
United States. No sales relating to any single patent represented a material portion of
Snap-on’s revenues in 2004 or 2003.

Examples of products that have
features or designs that benefit from patent protection include wheel alignment systems,
wheel balancers, sealed ratchets, electronic torque instruments, ratcheting screwdrivers,
emissions-sensing devices, diagnostic equipment, and air conditioning equipment.

Much of the technology used in the
manufacture of vehicle service tools and equipment is in the public domain. Snap-on relies
primarily on trade secret protection to protect proprietary processes used in
manufacturing. Methods and processes are patented when appropriate. Copyright protection
is also utilized when appropriate.

Trademarks used by Snap-on are of
continuing importance to Snap-on in the marketplace. Trademarks have been registered in
the United States and more than 100 other countries, and additional applications for
trademark registrations are pending. Snap-on vigorously polices proper use of its
trademarks. Snap-on’s right to manufacture and sell certain products is dependent
upon licenses from others; however, these products under license do not represent a
material portion of Snap-on’s sales.

Domain names have become a valuable
corporate asset for companies around the world, including Snap-on. Domain names often
contain a trademark or service mark or even a corporate name and are often considered
intellectual property. The recognition and value of the Snap-on name, trademark, and
domain name are core strengths of the company. Snap-on has undertaken an initiative to
centralize the administration of all domestic and international domain names, including
all registrations and renewals. Snap-on also monitors new developments in top-level
domains and country-code domains in order to preserve Snap-on’s right to relevant
domain names.

Working Capital

Because most of Snap-on’s
business is not seasonal and its inventory needs are relatively constant, no unusual
working capital needs arise during the year. Snap-on does not have a significant backlog
of orders at January 1, 2005.

Snap-on’s financial condition
and use of working capital are discussed in “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” on pages 29 through 32 of Snap-on’s 2004 Annual Report, incorporated
herein by reference.

Neither Snap-on nor any of its
segments, except Financial Services, depend on any single customer, small group of
customers or government for any material part of its revenues. As a result of SOC’s
relationship with CIT, Snap-on’s Financial Services business segment depends on CIT
for more than 10% of its revenues.

Environment

Snap-on is subject to various
environmental laws, ordinances, regulations, and other requirements of government
authorities in the United States and other nations. At Snap-on, these environmental
liabilities are managed through the Snap-on
Environmental, Hygiene, and Safety Management System (“EH & SMS”), which is
applied worldwide. The system is based upon continual improvement and is certified to
ISO 14001:1996 and OHSAS 18001:1999, verified through Det
Norske Veritas (DNV) Certification, Inc.


Snap-on believes that it complies
with applicable environmental control requirements in its operations. Expenditures on
environmental matters through EH & SMS have not had, and Snap-on does not for the
foreseeable future expect them to have, a material effect upon Snap-on’s capital
expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

Employees

At the end of February 2005, Snap-on
employed approximately 11,500 people compared to approximately 12,400 people at the end of
February 2004. The year-over-year reduction primarily reflects the impact of
restructuring-related eliminations.

Approximately 3,440 employees, or 30%
of Snap-on’s worldwide workforce, are represented by unions and / or covered under
collective bargaining agreements. Of these, approximately 1,580 are covered under various
European national union agreements that are renewed on an annual basis. Approximately
1,730 employees are covered under agreements expiring in 2005, including approximately 980
covered under various European national union agreements. In recent years, Snap-on has not
experienced any significant work slow-downs, stoppages or other labor disruptions.

The number of covered union employees
whose contracts expire within the next five years is approximately 1,730 in 2005, 450 in
2006, 710 in 2007, 500 in 2008 and 360 in 2009.

There can be no assurance that future
contracts with Snap-on’s unions will be renegotiated upon terms acceptable to
Snap-on.

Item 2: Properties

Snap-on maintains both leased and
owned manufacturing, warehouse, distribution and office facilities throughout the world.
Snap-on believes that its facilities currently in use are suitable and have adequate
capacity to meet its present and foreseeable future demand. Snap-on’s facilities in
the United States occupy approximately 3.9 million square feet, of which 74% is owned,
including its corporate and general offices located in Pleasant Prairie and Kenosha,
Wisconsin. Snap-on’s facilities outside the United States contain approximately 3.8
million square feet, of which 66% is owned. Several of Snap-on’s facilities are
leased through operating lease agreements. For information on operating leases, see Note
17 entitled “Commitments and Contingencies” on pages 55 and 56 of Snap-on’s
2004 Annual Report, incorporated herein by reference. Snap-on management continually
monitors the company’s capacity needs and makes adjustments as dictated by market and
other conditions.

The company phased out production at
its Mt. Carmel, Illinois, and Kenosha, Wisconsin, facilities during March 2004.

The following table provides
information about each of Snap-on’s principal manufacturing locations and
distribution centers (exceeding 50,000 square feet) as of January 1, 2005:

Item 3: Legal Proceedings

On July 23, 2004, Snap-on reached an
agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice to resolve the government audit, previously
discussed in the Company’s 2003 Annual Report and Form 10-K, relating to two
contracts with the U.S. General Services Administration (“GSA”). Snap-on agreed
to settle the claims over the interpretation and application of the price reduction and
billing provisions of these two contracts for sales from March 1996 through the July 23,
2004, settlement date for $10.0 million. Snap-on incurred a pretax charge of $3.6 million,
or $0.04 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2004 for costs not previously
accrued. Snap-on remitted the $10.0 million cash settlement to the U.S. Department of
Justice on August 5, 2004. On February 8, 2005, the GSA requested information from Snap-on
to evaluate possible administrative action.

Snap-on held over 2,600 active or
pending patents as of year-end 2004, and Snap-on vigorously prosecutes its claims and
defends its patents in the ordinary course of business.

Snap-on is also involved in various other legal matters,
including those where claimants have asserted class representation on behalf of franchised dealers, that are
being defended and handled in the ordinary course of business. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of these
other legal matters, management believes that the results will not have a material adverse effect
on Snap-on’s financial statements.

of shareholders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended January 1, 2005.

Directors that follows the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, which is ordinarily held in
April each year, and at such other times as new positions are created or vacancies must be
filled.

Snap-on has paid quarterly cash
dividends without interruption or decline, since 1939. In the fourth quarter of 2004,
Snap-on’s Board of Directors declared a $0.25 per share quarterly dividend on its
common stock. Cash dividends paid in 2004, 2003, and 2002 totaled $57.7 million, $58.2
million and $56.5 million. Snap-on’s Board of Directors monitors and evaluates the
company’s dividend practice quarterly and the Board may elect to increase, decrease
or not pay a dividend on Snap-on Common stock based upon the company’s financial
condition, results of operations, cash requirements and future prospects of Snap-on and
other factors deemed relevant by the Board.


The following chart discloses
information regarding the shares of Snap-on’s common stock repurchased by the company
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, all of which were purchased pursuant to Board of
Directors’ authorizations that the company has publicly announced. Snap-on has
undertaken stock repurchases from time to time to offset dilution created by shares issued
for employee and dealer stock purchase plans, stock options, and other corporate purposes,
as well as to repurchase shares when the company believes market conditions are favorable.
The repurchase of Snap-on common stock is at the company’s discretion, subject to
prevailing financial and market conditions.

Subject
to further adjustment pursuant to the 1996 Authorization described           below, as of
January 1, 2005, the approximate value of shares that may yet be           purchased
pursuant to the three outstanding Board of Directors’          authorizations
discussed below is $127.9 million.

•

In
its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 1996, the company
disclosed that the company’s Board authorized the company to repurchase shares of
the company’s common stock from time to time in the open market or in privately
negotiated transactions (the “1996 Authorization”). The 1996 Authorization
allows the repurchase of up to the number of shares issued or delivered from treasury
from time to time under the various plans the company has in place that call for the
issuance of the company’s common stock. Because the number of shares that are
purchased pursuant to the 1996 Authorization will change from time to time as (i) the
company issues shares under its various plans and (ii) shares are repurchased pursuant to
this authorization, the number of shares authorized to be repurchased will vary from time
to time. The 1996 Authorization will expire when terminated by the company’s Board.
When calculating the approximate value of shares that the company may yet purchase under
the 1996 Authorization, the company assumed a price of $29.38, $31.28 and $34.36 per
share of common stock as of the end of the fiscal 2004 months ended October 30, November
27 and January 1 respectively.

•

By
press release dated June 29, 1998, the company announced that the company’s Board
authorized the repurchase of an aggregate of $100 million of the company’s common
stock (the “1998 Authorization”). The 1998 Authorization will expire when the
aggregate repurchase price limit is met, unless terminated earlier by the company’s
Board.

•

By
press release dated February 3, 1999, the company announced that the company’s Board
authorized the repurchase of an aggregate of $50 million of the company’s common
stock (the “1999 Authorization”). The 1999 Authorization will expire when the
aggregate repurchase price limit is met, unless terminated earlier by the company’s
Board.

During 2004, the company repurchased
1,200,000 shares of common stock. On September 28, 2004, Snap-on publicly announced that
it may exceed the fiscal 2004 repurchase target of 1,000,000 shares that had been
publicly announced by press release dated January 21,   2004.

Item 9A: Controls and
Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures

Snap-on maintains a system of
disclosure controls and procedures that is designed to provide reasonable assurance that
material information relating to the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries is timely
communicated to the officers who certify Snap-on’s financial reports and to other
members of senior management and the Board of Directors, as appropriate.

Under the supervision and with the
participation of management, including Snap-on’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of this system of disclosure controls
and procedures as of January 1, 2005. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) are effective to ensure that the information required to
be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified by the SEC.

Changes in Internal
Control

There were no changes in internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended January 1, 2005,
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
Snap-on’s internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in

Internal Control
– Integrated Framework

. Based on our evaluation under this framework, management
has concluded that, as of January 1, 2005, our internal control over financial reporting
was effective.

Management’s assessment of the
effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2005, has
been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting
firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.

Our management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our internal control
over financial reporting will prevent all error or fraud. Because of inherent limitations,
a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable
assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, because of changes in
conditions, effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time.


Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and
Shareholders of

Snap-on Incorporated

We have audited management’s
assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting, that Snap-on Incorporated and subsidiaries (the “Company”)
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2005,
based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The
Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing
similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations
of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may
not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are
subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s
assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of January 1, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of January 1, 2005, based on the criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended January 1, 2005 of the
Company and our report dated February 24, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial statements and includes an explanatory paragraph relating to the adoption of
FASB Interpretation 46R and the change in reportable segments.

Beginning in 2004, in conjunction
with the consolidation of Snap-on Credit LLC (“SOC”), financial services
revenue consists of SOC’s sales of originated contracts and  service fee income, as
well as installment contract revenue and dealer loan receivable revenue derived from SOC
and Snap-on’s wholly owned international finance  operations.           As Snap-on
consolidated SOC on a prospective basis, previously issued financial           statements
have not been restated to reflect the consolidation of SOC.   Refer to Notes 2 and 9 of
the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the consolidation of SOC.

2002 results include a $2.8 million
pretax gain ($2.8 million after tax or $0.05 per diluted share) for the cumulative effect
of a change in accounting principle for  goodwill.           Snap-on ceased amortizing
goodwill and certain other intangible assets in 2002           in accordance with the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting  Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets."  Pretax goodwill amortization totaled $13.9 million, $14.5 million
and $11.8 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999.

2001 results include a $4.1 million
pretax loss ($2.5 million after tax or $0.04 per diluted share) for the cumulative effect
of a change in accounting principle for  derivatives.

2000 results include a $41.3 million
pretax gain ($25.4 million after tax or $0.43 per diluted share) for the cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle for  pensions.


Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition

Snap-on Incorporated
(“Snap-on” or “the company”) was incorporated under the laws of the
state of Wisconsin in 1920 and reincorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in
1930. Snap-on is a leading global innovator, manufacturer and marketer of high-quality
tool, diagnostic and equipment solutions for professional tool and equipment users.
Product lines include a broad range of hand and power tools, tool storage, saws and
cutting tools, pruning tools, vehicle service diagnostics equipment, vehicle service
equipment, including wheel service, safety-testing and collision repair equipment, vehicle
service information, business management systems, equipment repair services, and other
tool and equipment solutions. Snap-on’s customers include automotive technicians,
vehicle service centers, manufacturers, industrial tool and equipment users, and those
involved in commercial applications such as construction, electrical and agriculture.
Products are sold through Snap-on’s franchised dealer van, company-direct,
distribution and Internet sales channels.

Major challenges for Snap-on and the
vehicle service and repair sector include the increasing rate of technological change
within motor vehicles and the resulting impact on the businesses of both the
company’s suppliers and customers that is necessitated by such change. Snap-on
believes that it is a meaningful participant in the market sector for vehicle service and
repair.

Snap-on also markets its products to
a wide variety of industrial customers including industrial maintenance and repair
operations, manufacturing and assembly facilities, government facilities, schools, and
original equipment manufacturers that require instrumentation or service tools and
equipment for their products. Major challenges in the industrial sector include a highly
competitive, cost-conscious environment, and a trend toward customers making all of their
tools purchases through one integrated supplier. Snap-on believes that it is a meaningful
participant in the market sector for industrial tools and equipment.

Snap-on’s products are known for
their quality workmanship and superior product performance, and customers readily
recognize the Snap-on family of brand names. Innovation, marketplace knowledge and
customer relationships are Snap-on competencies that support its position as a leading
provider of professional tool and equipment solutions. Snap-on’s mission is to
delight its customers – professional tool and equipment users worldwide – by
providing innovative, productivity-enhancing products, services and solutions.

Management Overview

Net sales in 2004 increased $95.9
million over 2003 levels, including $86.6 million from currency translation. This positive
currency translation effect at the sales level was largely offset by corresponding
unfavorable translation on cost of goods sold and operating expenses, and together with
unfavorable net foreign currency transaction losses, resulted in a minimal impact to
full-year 2004 operating earnings.

In 2004, we experienced higher sales
of diagnostics tools, including sales from new product introductions, higher sales of
equipment in North America and higher sales of tools in both Europe and Asia, as well as
increased sales in the international dealer businesses. These increases were largely
offset by lower sales in the North American dealer businesses and by lower sales of
industrial tools in North America. Additionally, the 2004 fiscal year included one less
week than 2003. Given the current and expected global economic climate affecting our major
businesses and markets, sales growth in 2005 is expected to be in the low to
mid-single-digit percentage range, including the impact of planned pricing actions.

Gross profit (defined as net sales
less cost of goods sold) margin in 2004 improved slightly over 2003 levels, reflecting
gains from currency translation and savings from productivity and other cost reduction
measures, including benefits from prior-year consolidation and realignment activities,
particularly in our Diagnostics and Information businesses. Over the last several years,
significant actions have been taken to reduce costs companywide and improve manufacturing
processes and operational performance through the application of Lean business tools. The
benefits from these improvements, however, were largely offset by the impact of higher
worldwide steel prices and production inefficiencies at certain facilities. We incurred
steel price increases of $11.3 million in 2004, particularly in the second half; and we
believe that steel prices will continue to remain high for most of 2005. While Snap-on
realized cost savings as a result of the March 2004 closure of two of our U.S. hand-tool
plants, we also experienced $10.2 million in higher costs associated with production
inefficiencies and other manufacturing variances in the integration of production from
these plants into other existing Snap-on facilities. In 2004, we invested in new equipment
and processes, with dedicated teams to address manufacturing inefficiencies.

Operating expenses increased $86.7
million in 2004, largely due to the inclusion of $44.0 million from the consolidation of
Snap-on Credit LLC (“SOC”), our 50%-owned joint venture with The CIT Group, Inc.
(“CIT”), previously accounted for under the equity method, and Snap-on’s
wholly owned financial services subsidiaries. Currency translation contributed $25.9
million. Other operating expense increases included $3.6 million in costs associated with
the settlement of two government contract audits, $3.5 million in higher year-over-year
start-up costs related to the expansion of our distribution system and operating presence
in emerging markets, and $3.3 million of costs related to the resignation of our former
chief executive officer in November 2004.


A significant portion of our
operating expenses relate to people – salaries, wages, pension, medical and other
associated costs. In 2004, we offset the upward pressure on these costs with productivity
improvements and savings from our previous cost reduction initiatives. Sales per employee
improved 11% year over year on an approximate 6% decline in workforce. We expect to
experience additional productivity improvements in 2005.

In the Snap-on Dealer Group, sales in
the U.S. dealer business were down year over year, primarily reflecting a lower average
number of dealer vans in operation in 2004. In 2004, Snap-on tightened both the
eligibility requirements for franchise dealer expansion and the recruitment standards for
new prospective dealers, in an effort to improve its franchised dealer network. This
resulted in a slower rate of new dealer additions than experienced in prior years.
Nonetheless, we believe end-market demand for Snap-on’s tools and tool storage
products has increased in the U.S. dealer market at a low-single-digit percentage rate
year over year. In Snap-on’s international dealer businesses, sales were up year over
year, with strong increases shown in the Japanese and U.K. markets.

In the Commercial and Industrial
Group, we experienced improving sales of commercial and industrial tools in Europe and
Asia, particularly with our Bahco® brand, as well as increased sales of equipment in
North America following the 2003 mid-year launch of the Technical Automotive Group
(“TAG”) distribution channel. In our North American industrial business, we
experienced a year-over-year decline in industrial hand and power tool sales, due in part
to order-fill issues, and in Europe, sales of vehicle service equipment were also down. In
2004, we continued to expand our distribution and operating presence in emerging markets.
While still early, we believe these markets have significant long-term potential for sales
of tools and vehicle repair diagnostics and equipment.

In our Diagnostics and Information
Group segment, revenue increased 11.2% year over year, largely attributable to the growth
in handheld diagnostics tools sold through the U.S. dealer businesses. The growth
primarily reflects the success of the new Snap-on® SOLUS™ Scanner™
diagnostic tool, launched mid-year 2004, as well as the success of the programmable
cartridges that support the large installed base of existing

Scanner

products.

Financial Services operating earnings
were $34.1 million in 2004, compared to net finance income of $43.8 million in 2003,
reflecting lower originations and higher market interest rates. The decline in loan
originations is believed to have resulted from a change in the Snap-on Dealer Group’s
sales mix combined with a reduced level of dealer borrowings and the introduction of the
extended trial franchise program in 2004.

The new product introductions in the
Diagnostics and Information Group discussed above represent only a few of the successful
new products launched throughout our businesses during the year. New product sales,
defined as sales from products introduced during the last three years, across all segments
contributed approximately 30% of 2004 total net sales. We filed 100 new patent
applications in connection with our product development activities in 2004, resulting in
more than 2,600 active or pending patents at year end. In 2004, we spent $60.8 million in
research and engineering activities to maintain our focus on new product innovation and
market leadership. This compares with research and engineering expenditures of $59.8
million in 2003 and $57.1 million in 2002. Research and engineering costs for the
development of new and improved products and process improvements are included in
operating expenses and do not include certain software development costs that qualify for
capitalization.

In 2004, we continued our emphasis on
improving cash flow. Cash on hand at the end of 2004 was $150.0 million, as compared to
$96.1 million at year-end 2003. In 2004, we used our cash flow to, in part, pay dividends
totaling $57.7 million and to repurchase 1.2 million shares of Snap-on common stock for
$38.2 million. We also made a $63.6 million voluntary pension contribution to our major
domestic pension plans, bringing them into a fully funded status on both an accumulated
and projected benefit obligation basis.

Over the last several years, we have
been focused on improving asset utilization by making more effective use of our investment
in certain working capital items. We use the “working investment” measure to
assess management’s operating performance and effectiveness relative to those
components of working capital that are more directly impacted by operational decisions. At
January 1, 2005, working investment (defined as accounts receivable — net of
allowances plus inventories less accounts payable) of $689.0 million was down from $708.2
million at year-end 2003 and $755.2 million at year-end 2002. In 2004, we also made
considerable progress in our efforts to reduce days sales outstanding and to improve
inventory turnover. At the end of 2004, our days sales outstanding improved to 81 days
from 88 days at year-end 2003, and our inventory turns (defined as cost of goods sold
divided by inventories) improved to 3.9 turns, as compared to 3.6 turns at year-end 2003.

On November 13, 2004, Mr. Jack D.
Michaels was appointed Snap-on’s chairman, president and chief executive officer. Mr.
Michaels, who has been a member of Snap-on’s Board of Directors since 1998, brings a
proven track record of improving operating efficiencies and driving growth. As we look to
2005, our near-term priorities are to improve operating efficiencies, respond to customer
needs and market changes more quickly, address performance issues in our commercial and
industrial businesses, and generally accelerate the pace of change towards improving
long-term profitable growth. Information developed in this process may result in the
company reevaluating the long-term performance and strategic importance of selected
operations.

For 2005, Snap-on has two priorities
that are expected to lead to higher levels of operating income and improved shareholder
value.


The first priority is to improve
customer service and responsiveness. By providing better levels of customer service and
driving customer responsiveness to new levels, we believe we will achieve higher sales and
improve our market position. By placing renewed emphasis on customer responsiveness, while
maintaining our strong heritage of product performance, quality and innovation, we will
also further strengthen our brands’ global appeal. We believe that Snap-on has a
strong global customer base and a dedicated dealer organization. In the growing service
economies of the world that place a premium on productivity solutions, we believe there is
a robust demand for the product performance, productivity and value for which our many
global brands are known.

Near term, our emphasis is focused on
improving our operating effectiveness, in particular, at our U.S. hand-tool plants.
Significant actions are directed at improving manufacturing efficiencies, product line
changeover capabilities and customer service. We will continue our emphasis on the use of
Lean tools as a methodology for improving processes from a customer value-added point of
view. The use of Lean tools will help identify and eliminate waste and improve
productivity to enhance responsiveness to the customer and further strengthen marketplace
competitiveness. We expect these actions will lead to new, higher levels of order-fill
rates and complete and on-time deliveries for our dealers and customers. We will also
focus on strengthening and growing our U.S. dealer van franchise system. The franchised
dealer organization is a powerful direct distribution network that provides dealers with
an opportunity for weekly contact with their customers — vehicle service technicians
and vehicle service shop owners — at the customer’s place of business.

The second priority is to take
complexity out of our organization structure and aggressively remove unnecessary costs.
Despite the progress to date with our Lean manufacturing initiatives, we believe there is
still considerable excess cost throughout the company. We are committed to taking out such
costs while maintaining our dedication to product quality, performance and value —
our heritage and brand promise will not be compromised. We expect that we will incur costs
of approximately $20 million to $25 million throughout 2005, including approximately $10
million to $12 million in the first quarter of 2005, for a number of anticipated actions,
primarily for staffing and other cost reduction actions. By reducing complexity and costs,
and driving increased accountability and initiative throughout the organization, we
believe we will improve operating effectiveness and contribute toward long-term
shareholder value.

Results of Operations

Fiscal 2004 vs. Fiscal

The Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued interpretation (“FIN”) No. 46R,
“

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (an interpretation of ARB No.
51)

” in December 2003, which became effective for Snap-on at the beginning of its
2004 fiscal year. FIN No. 46R provides consolidation guidance regarding the identification
of variable interest entities for which control is achieved through means other than
through voting rights.

Based on the company’s analysis
of FIN No. 46R, the company concluded that Snap-on would consolidate SOC as of January 4,
2004, the beginning of Snap-on’s 2004 fiscal year. Snap-on previously accounted for
SOC, a 50%-owned joint venture, using the equity method. Snap-on has consolidated SOC on a
prospective basis and, as such, has not restated previously issued financial statements.
The impact of the consolidation of SOC on Snap-on’s consolidated balance sheet was
not significant. As a result of the consolidation of SOC in fiscal 2004, Snap-on is
reporting the results of its finance operations as a new business segment, “Financial
Services.” Refer to Notes 9 and 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for
further discussion of SOC and Snap-on’s business segments.


Highlights of Snap-on’s results
of operations for the fiscal years ended January 1, 2005 (fiscal 2004), and January 3,
2004 (fiscal 2003), are as follows:

Snap-on’s 2004 fiscal year
contained 52 weeks of operating results. Snap-on’s 2003 fiscal year contained 53
weeks of operating results, with the additional week occurring in the fourth quarter. The
impact of the additional week of operations on full-year 2003 operating earnings was not
material.

Total revenue in 2004 increased
$174.0 million, or 7.8%, over prior-year levels. Of the year-over-year increase, $86.6
million was attributable to currency translation, and $78.1 million resulted from the
consolidation of SOC, previously accounted for under the equity method, and Snap-on’s
wholly owned financial services subsidiaries. The year-over-year revenue increase also
includes higher sales of handheld diagnostics tools, increased sales in the international
dealer businesses, higher sales of equipment in North America, and higher sales of
commercial and industrial tools in both Europe and Asia. These revenue increases were
partially offset by lower sales in the U.S. dealer businesses and by lower sales of
industrial tools in North America.

Gross profit in 2004 increased $44.6
million, or 10 basis points (100 basis points equals 1.0 percent) to 43.3% of net sales.
The year-over-year improvement in gross profit reflects the impact of the higher sales,
$31.1 million of currency translation, $9.6 million of net savings from Lean and other
cost reduction initiatives and $8.9 million in lower year-over-year restructuring costs.
These improvements in gross profit were partially offset by $11.3 million in increased
year-over-year steel costs, $10.2 million of higher expenses from production
inefficiencies and other manufacturing variances associated with the relocation of
production from the closure of two U.S. hand-tool plants in March 2004, and lower
LIFO benefits (LIFO inventory liquidations of $1.9 million and $15.1 million
during 2004 and 2003) and other inventory costs totaling $7.6 million.

Operating expenses in 2004 increased
$86.7 million, or 90 basis points as a percentage of total revenue, from prior-year
levels, including $44.0 million from the consolidation of SOC, previously accounted for
under the equity method, and Snap-on’s wholly owned financial services subsidiaries.
Foreign currency translation contributed $25.9 million to the year-over-year operating
expense increase. Operating expenses in 2004 were also impacted by the higher sales, $3.6
million in costs associated with the settlement of two U.S. General Services
Administration (“GSA”) contract audits and $3.5 million of higher freight costs,
reflecting increased freight rates and smaller, but more frequent, shipments to dealers.
In addition, operating expenses in 2004 included $3.5 million of higher start-up costs
associated with the company’s expansion of its distribution system and operating
presence in emerging markets and $3.3 million for severance costs related to the November
2004 resignation of the company’s former chairman, president and chief executive
officer.

Interest expense was $23.0 million in
2004, down $1.4 million from $24.4 million in 2003. The year-over-year decline primarily
reflects lower interest paid on dealer deposits.

Other income (expense) – net was
income of $1.1 million in 2004, as compared to an expense of $9.0 million in 2003. This
line item includes the impact of all non-operating items such as interest income, minority
interest, hedging and currency exchange rate transaction gains and losses, and other
miscellaneous non-operating items. The year-over-year change in other income (expense)
includes $6.0 million of lower foreign exchange losses and $1.1 million of lower minority
interests, along with higher interest and other income. Minority interests for 2004 and
2003 were $2.0 million and $3.1 million.

Snap-on’s effective tax rates of
32.1% in 2004 and 32.6% in 2003 benefited from the conclusion of prior-year tax matters in
both years.


Exit or Disposal
Activities

For a discussion of Snap-on’s
exit and disposal activities, refer to Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Segment Results

Snap-on’s business segments are
based on the organization structure used by management for making operating and investment
decisions and for assessing performance. Snap-on’s reportable business segments
include: (i) the Snap-on Dealer Group; (ii) the Commercial and Industrial Group; (iii) the
Diagnostics and Information Group; and (iv) Financial Services. The Snap-on Dealer Group
consists of Snap-on’s business operations serving the worldwide franchised dealer van
channel. The Commercial and Industrial Group consists of the business operations providing
tools and equipment products and equipment repair services to a broad range of industrial
and commercial customers worldwide through direct, distributor and other non-franchised
distribution channels. The Diagnostics and Information Group consists of the business
operations providing diagnostics equipment, vehicle service information, business
management systems and other solutions for vehicle service to customers in the worldwide
vehicle service and repair marketplace. Financial Services is a new business segment,
beginning in fiscal 2004, consisting of the business operations of SOC and Snap-on’s
wholly owned finance subsidiaries in those international markets where Snap-on has dealer
operations. Prior-year segment disclosures have not been restated to include the Financial
Services segment due to the prospective adoption of FIN No. 46R. See Notes 2 and 9 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of SOC and the company’s
adoption of FIN No. 46R.

During the third quarter of 2004,
Snap-on realigned certain of its business units within its reportable business segments.
The primary realignments included Snap-on’s Equipment Solutions (facilitation)
business moving from the Commercial and Industrial Group to the Diagnostics and
Information Group, and Snap-on’s EquiServ (equipment services) business moving from
the Diagnostics and Information Group to the Commercial and Industrial Group. Prior-year
financial data by segment has been restated to reflect these reportable business segment
realignments.

Snap-on evaluates the performance of
its operating segments based on segment revenues and operating earnings. Segment revenues
are defined as total revenues, including both external customer revenue and intersegment
revenue. Segment operating earnings are defined as segment revenues less cost of goods
sold and operating expenses. Snap-on accounts for intersegment sales and transfers based
primarily on standard costs with reasonable mark-ups established between the segments.
Snap-on allocates shared services expenses to those segments that utilize the services
based on a percentage of either cost of goods sold or segment revenues, as appropriate.

Snap-on Dealer Group

Total segment revenue in 2004
increased $10.9 million, or 1.0%, over prior-year levels due to $22.7 million of currency
translation partially offset by a sales decrease of $11.8 million. In the United States,
sales were 3.3% lower year over year. The average number of U.S. dealer vans in operation
during 2004 was down 4% from year-end 2003, primarily due to a lower level of new dealer
additions in 2004. During the first quarter of 2004, Snap-on tightened eligibility
requirements for its franchise dealer expansion and enhancement initiative and the
recruitment standards for prospective dealers, aimed at improving the strength of its
franchised dealer network. In the company’s non-North American dealer businesses, segment
revenue increased $36.7 million year over year, including $22.7 million from currency translation.

Segment gross profit in 2004
decreased $10.5 million, or 140 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue,
from last year, reflecting the impact of lower sales and $8.6 million of higher costs
associated with production inefficiencies and other manufacturing variances related to the
relocation of production from the two U.S. hand-tool plants. Segment gross profit in 2004
was also impacted by $3.2 million of lower year-over-year LIFO benefits and other
inventory costs and by $7.7 million from increased steel costs. These higher costs were
partially offset by $8.4 million of currency translation, $10.4 million in lower
year-over-year restructuring costs and $1.3 million of lower pension, postretirement and
other insurance costs. Operating expenses for the Snap-on Dealer Group decreased $2.3
million year over year, down 60 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue. The
$2.3 million decrease includes the operating expense impact from lower sales, as well as
$8.0 million of lower bad debt expense and $2.0 million in lower year-over-year
restructuring costs. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by $6.8
million of currency translation and $3.4 million of higher freight expense, reflecting
increased freight rates and smaller, but more frequent, shipments to dealers. As a result
of these factors, segment operating earnings in 2004 decreased $8.2 million, or 80 basis
points as a percentage of total segment revenue, as compared to the prior year.


Commercial and
Industrial Group

Total segment revenue in 2004
increased $75.5 million, or 7.2%, over prior-year levels due to $56.3 million of currency
translation and $19.2 million in higher sales. Demand for tools improved in both North
America and Europe in 2004, despite lower sales of industrial tools in
North America. In addition, higher sales of vehicle service equipment were achieved in
North America through the company’s TAG distribution channel, which was launched
mid-year 2003.

Segment gross profit in 2004
increased $22.1 million, but decreased 30 basis points as a percentage of total segment
revenue. Benefits realized from higher sales, $19.5 million of currency translation and
$2.7 million from Lean and other cost reduction initiatives were partially offset by $5.1
million of lower LIFO benefits and other inventory costs, $4.4 million of higher
year-over-year restructuring costs, $3.1 million of increased steel costs, $2.3 million of
increased freight costs, and $1.6 million in higher expenses from production
inefficiencies and other manufacturing variances associated with the relocation of
production from the two U.S. hand-tool plants. Operating expenses for the Commercial and
Industrial Group increased $36.6 million, or 110 basis points as a percentage of total
segment revenue. The increase in operating expenses reflects the impact of higher sales,
$16.2 million of currency translation, $6.3 million in higher bad debt expense, $3.6
million of costs associated with the GSA contract audits settlement and a $3.4 million
year-over-year increase in restructuring costs, partially offset by $2.9 million of
benefits from Lean and other cost reduction initiatives and a $2.9 million year-over-year
increase in gains on the sales of facilities. Operating expenses were also impacted by
$3.5 million of start-up costs associated with the company’s investment to expand its
distribution and operating presence in emerging markets. As a result, segment operating
earnings in 2004 decreased $14.5 million as compared to 2003.


Diagnostics and
Information Group

Total segment revenue in 2004
increased $44.2 million, or 11.2%, over prior-year levels primarily due to $34.2 million
in higher sales, principally of handheld diagnostics, as well as $10.0 million of currency
translation.

Segment gross profit in 2004
increased $33.0 million, or 420 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue,
from prior year, largely reflecting the growth in sales of handheld diagnostics and
information products, $8.1 million of benefits from Lean initiatives and $3.2 million of
currency translation. Segment gross profit also benefited from $2.9 million in lower
year-over-year costs for restructuring, primarily reflecting the absence of costs incurred
in 2003 for the closure of the segment’s large-platform diagnostics facility.
Operating expenses for the Diagnostics and Information Group increased $8.4 million, but
decreased 90 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue, reflecting $2.8
million of currency translation, $2.5 million from the absence of gains realized from the
sale of facilities in 2003 and $2.1 million of higher bad debt expense. As a result,
segment operating earnings in 2004 increased $24.6 million, or 510 basis points as a
percentage of total segment revenue, as compared to the prior year.

Segment operating earnings in 2004
were $34.1 million. Net finance income was $43.8 million in 2003. Operating earnings for
2004 decreased year over year primarily due to lower loan originations and higher market
interest rates. Snap-on believes that the decline in loan originations is primarily due to
sales mix in the Snap-on Dealer Group and a reduced level of dealer borrowings as a result
of the strengthening fiscal health of dealers, combined with the tightening of both the
eligibility requirements for franchise dealer expansion and the recruitment standards for
new prospective dealers. See Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for
SOC’s 2003 summarized financial information.


Fourth Quarter

Highlights of Snap-on’s results
of operations for the quarters ended January 1, 2005, and January 3, 2004, are as follows:

Total revenue in the fourth quarter
of 2004 increased $10.7 million, or 1.8%, over prior-year levels. Lower sales of $28.8
million were offset by $21.3 million of currency translation and $18.2 million from the
consolidation of SOC, previously accounted for under the equity method, and Snap-on’s
wholly owned financial services subsidiaries. The decline in sales primarily reflects
fewer selling days in the fourth quarter of 2004. The 2003 fiscal year contained 53 weeks,
with the extra week occurring in the fourth quarter.

Gross profit increased $13.3 million,
or 280 basis points to 44.7% of net sales. The impact of $8.6 million in lower
year-over-year restructuring costs, $8.1 million of benefits from Lean initiatives, $6.9
million of currency translation and $4.8 million from lower net inventory costs was
partially offset by the impact of lower sales, increased steel costs of $7.2 million, and
$3.3 million of costs associated with production inefficiencies and other manufacturing
variances associated with the relocation of production from the two U.S. hand-tool plants.

Operating expenses in the fourth
quarter of 2004 increased $16.7 million, or 200 basis points as a percentage of total
revenue, from the fourth quarter of 2003, including $12.0 million from the consolidation
of SOC, previously accounted for under the equity method, and Snap-on’s wholly owned
financial services subsidiaries. Foreign currency translation contributed $6.1 million to
the year-over-year operating expense increase. Operating expenses during the fourth
quarter of 2004 were impacted by $3.3 million for severance costs related to the November
2004 resignation of the company’s former chairman, president and chief executive
officer, $3.1 million in higher bad debt expense, $1.5 million of lower year-over-year
gains on the sales of facilities and $1.0 million in higher restructuring costs. These
increases in operating expenses were partially offset by the impact of lower sales, $2.8
million of benefits from Lean and other cost reduction initiatives and $2.0 million in
lower pension, postretirement and other insurance costs.

Interest expense was $5.6 million in
the fourth quarter of 2004, down $0.6 million from $6.2 million in the fourth quarter of
2003. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the impact of an additional week of
business in the fourth quarter of 2003.

Other income (expense) – net was
income of $4.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2004, as compared to an expense of $2.5
million in the comparable prior-year period. This line item includes the impact of all
non-operating items such as interest income, minority interest, hedging and currency
exchange rate transaction gains and losses, and other miscellaneous non-operating items.
Other expense decreased $7.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 over the prior year
largely due to the effects of minority interest and lower foreign exchange transaction
losses.

Snap-on’s effective tax rate was
35.3% and 35.0% for the fourth quarter of 2004 and 2003, respectively.


Snap-on Dealer Group

Total segment revenue in the fourth
quarter of 2004 decreased $9.6 million, or 3.5%, from prior-year levels due to a $14.4
million decrease in worldwide sales, partially offset by $4.8 million of currency
translation. In the United States, sales were 12.0% lower year over year partially
reflecting the fewer selling days in the current-year period. The average number of U.S.
dealer vans in operation during the fourth quarter of 2004 was down year over year
primarily due to a lower level of new dealer additions in 2004. Lower U.S. sales were
partially offset by sales gains in Japan and the United Kingdom.

Segment gross profit for the fourth
quarter of 2004 decreased $7.0 million, or 100 basis points as a percentage of total
segment revenue, from the same period last year primarily due to lower sales, $4.2 million
of higher steel costs and $2.8 million of higher expenses from production inefficiencies
and other manufacturing variances associated with the relocation of production from the
two U.S. hand-tool plants, partially offset by $5.4 million in lower year-over-year
restructuring costs and $1.6 million of currency translation. Operating expenses for the
Snap-on Dealer Group decreased $6.3 million, or 90 basis points as a percentage of total
segment revenue. The $6.3 million decrease in operating expenses primarily reflects the
impact of lower sales, a $2.5 million reduction in bad debt expense, $1.9 million in lower
pension, postretirement and other insurance costs, and $0.9 million in lower freight
costs, partially offset by $1.4 million of currency translation. As a result of these
factors, segment operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2004 decreased $0.7 million,
or 10 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue, as compared to the fourth
quarter of 2003.

Commercial and
Industrial Group

Total segment revenue in the fourth
quarter of 2004 increased $1.6 million, or 0.6%, over prior-year levels due to $14.5
million of currency translation partially offset by a $12.9 million decrease in sales, due
principally to one less week in the current fiscal year. During the fourth quarter of
2004, improving sales of commercial and industrial tools in Europe and Asia, particularly
with the

BAHCO

brand, as well as increased North American sales of equipment were
more than offset by a decline in industrial tools sales in North America and lower sales
of vehicle service equipment in Europe.

Segment gross profit for the fourth
quarter of 2004 increased $6.9 million, or 220 basis points as a percentage of total
segment revenue, from the same period last year primarily due to $5.5 million in benefits
from Lean initiatives, $4.6 million of currency translation and $3.4 million of lower net
inventory costs, partially offset by lower sales and $3.1 million in higher steel costs.
Operating expenses for the Commercial and Industrial Group increased $2.9 million, or 80
basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue. The increase in operating expenses
reflects $4.1 million of currency translation, $2.3 million in higher bad debt expense and
$1.5 million in higher year-over-year restructuring costs, partially offset by the impact
of lower sales, $2.9 million of benefits from Lean initiatives, $1.2 million in higher
year-over-year gains from the sales of facilities and $1.0 million in lower pension,
postretirement and other insurance costs. As a result, segment operating earnings in the
fourth quarter of 2004 increased $4.0 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2003.


Diagnostics and
Information Group

Total segment revenue in the fourth
quarter of 2004 increased $11.5 million, or 11.4%, over prior-year levels primarily due to
$8.5 million in higher sales, primarily attributable to growth in

Snap-on

handheld
diagnostics tools through the U.S. dealer businesses. Currency translation of $3.0 million
also contributed to the year-over-year increase in segment revenue.

Segment gross profit for the fourth
quarter of 2004 increased $13.2 million, or 860 basis points as a percentage of total
segment revenue, from the same period last year, largely reflecting increased sales, $3.8
million of benefits from Lean and other cost reduction initiatives, $3.5 million in lower
restructuring costs and $2.2 million of lower net inventory costs. Operating expenses for
the Diagnostics and Information Group increased $7.9 million, or 440 basis points as a
percentage of total segment revenue, primarily due to $3.2 million of higher bad debt
expense and a $2.5 million year-over-year decrease in gains on sales of facilities. As a
result, segment operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2004 increased $5.3 million,
or 420 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue, as compared to the fourth
quarter of 2003.

year primarily due to lower loan originations and higher market interest rates. The
decline in loan originations is primarily due to reduced levels of dealer borrowings
resulting from the strengthening fiscal health of dealers and the introduction of the
extended trial franchise program.


Fiscal 2003 vs. Fiscal

Highlights of Snap-on’s results
of operations for 2003 and 2002 are as follows:

Net sales in 2003 were $2.233
billion, up 5.9% from the $2.109 billion reported in 2002. The $124.1 million increase in
year-over-year net sales was primarily driven by $111.8 million, or 5.3%, of currency
translation and a 0.6% increase in sales, including 0.5% from acquisitions.

Snap-on reported gross profit of
$964.7 million in 2003, as compared to $964.9 million in 2002. Gross profit in 2003
benefited from net currency impacts of $33.0 million and savings from restructuring and
Lean initiatives of $15.6 million. Gross profit in 2003 was negatively impacted by $25.8
million of costs for restructuring activities, including costs of $19.5 million related to
the closure of the two U.S. hand-tool plants and costs of $3.5 million for the closure of
the company’s U.S. facility that assembled large-platform diagnostics. The
combination of unfavorable sales mix and lower sales volumes, particularly in the
Commercial and Industrial Group, partially offset by benefits from favorable net pricing
and sales of new products across all business segments, reduced gross profit by
approximately $6.8 million in 2003. Unfavorable manufacturing cost absorption and
inventory-related costs, net of LIFO benefits realized of $14.0 million in 2003, also
lowered full-year 2003 gross profit by $7.9 million. Gross profit in 2003 was also
adversely impacted by higher year-over-year pension, other retirement and insurance costs
of $7.3 million and by plant inefficiencies of $1.0 million incurred in the fourth quarter
associated with the closure of the two hand-tool facilities.

Operating expenses were $858.4
million in 2003 compared to $804.3 million in 2002. The $54.1 million, or 6.7%, increase
in year-over-year operating expenses primarily includes net currency impacts of $35.7
million, higher pension, other retirement and insurance costs of $14.9 million, $1.7
million of higher costs for the company’s dealer expansion and enhancement
initiative, higher research and development spending of $2.7 million, and increased
catalog and freight costs of $7.0 million. The year-over-year increase in freight costs
largely reflects the impact of inflationary cost increases and a trend towards a higher
number of smaller product shipments to improve customer responsiveness. Operating expenses
in 2003 also included costs for restructuring activities of $4.3 million, inflationary
health care cost increases of $4.3 million, $4.3 million in higher advertising and
promotion expense reflecting increased catalog and racing promotion costs, costs of $2.4
million to terminate certain life insurance programs, and $2.2 million in costs related to
a change in long-term incentive compensation to reflect a higher percentage of restricted
stock. The year-over-year operating expense comparison was also impacted by the inclusion,
in 2003, of $5.1 million in operating expenses for the prior-year acquisition of two
business operations. These year-over-year increases were partially offset by savings of
$16.2 million from Snap-on’s restructuring and Lean initiatives, gains of $2.8
million from the sales of facilities, and lower bad debt expense of $5.7 million,
including the absence of $2.6 million incurred in 2002 for the write-down of a receivable
related to the closure of auto service centers associated with a major retailer’s
bankruptcy. In addition, the year-over-year operating expense comparison benefited from
the absence of costs incurred in 2002 that included $3.0 million related to the
resignation of Snap-on’s former chief financial officer. Operating expenses in 2002
included $4.0 million for employee and equipment relocation costs and professional fees to
finalize the company’s fiscal 2001 restructuring actions and a net $4.6 million
benefit from the favorable resolution of a patent infringement matter partially offset by
a provision for certain contractual matters.


Snap-on reported net earnings in
2003 of $78.7 million, or $1.35 per diluted share, as compared to net earnings of $106.0
million, or $1.81 per diluted share, in 2002. Snap-on’s earnings in 2003 included
$30.1 million in pretax charges for the company’s 2003 restructuring activities, as
well as higher year-over-year pension, other retirement and insurance costs of $22.2
million pretax.  Snap-on’s earnings in 2003 also included pretax savings generated
from its restructuring and Lean initiatives of $31.8 million partially offset by
unfavorable manufacturing cost absorption and net inventory-related costs of $7.9 million
pretax and unfavorable sales mix and lower sales volumes. Snap-on recorded a cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle transition adjustment that increased net
earnings in 2002 by $2.8 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, from the recognition of
negative goodwill as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”

For information on
Snap-on’s adoption of SFAS No. 142, refer to Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Net finance income consists of
royalty and management fees paid to Snap-on by SOC, a 50%-owned joint venture, based on
the volume of contracts originated by SOC and 50% of any residual profit or loss of SOC
after operating expenses, including royalty and management fees, interest costs and credit
loss provisions. Net finance income also consists of installment contract income and
dealer financing income, net of administrative expenses, derived from Snap-on’s
wholly owned international financial services subsidiaries.

Net finance income was $43.8 million
in 2003, up $6.1 million from $37.7 million in 2002. Higher credit originations and a more
favorable interest-rate environment contributed to the year-over-year increase. SOC’s
credit originations in 2003 increased 3.2% from prior year.

Interest expense for 2003 was $24.4
million, compared with $28.7 million in 2002. The decline in interest expense reflects the
impact of both lower average interest rates and significantly lower average debt levels
due to strong cash flow from operating activities.

In 2003, other income (expense)
— net was an expense of $9.0 million, compared to an expense of $8.4 million in 2002.
This income statement line item includes the impact of all non-operating items such as
interest income, minority interests, hedging and exchange rate transaction gains and
losses, and other miscellaneous non-operating items. Minority interests for 2003 and 2002
were $3.1 million and $3.4 million.

Snap-on’s effective income tax
rate was 32.6% in 2003 and 35.4% in 2002. Snap-on’s effective tax rate in 2003 was
reduced by 2.5 percentage points from the conclusion of certain prior-years’ tax
matters. For income tax information, refer to Note 12 of the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Segment Results

Snap-on Dealer Group

Total segment revenue in 2003
increased $26.7 million, or 2.6%, over prior-year levels, primarily due to $26.5 million
of currency translation. Increases from sales of new products and gains from higher
pricing were largely offset by lower sales volumes. Higher year-over-year sales in the
North American franchised dealer operations and in the Snap-on Dealer Group’s
international markets, were partially offset by significantly lower sales of large
platform-based diagnostics through the company’s technical representatives
(“tech rep”) organization. The sales growth in the North American franchised
dealer operations in 2003 reflects sales gains by dealers to their customers –
automotive technicians and mechanics. In the Snap-on Dealer Group’s international
markets, sales were up $17.7 million year over year, including $16.3 million from currency
translation.


Segment gross profit in 2003 of
$484.2 million decreased $3.8 million, or 150 basis points as a percentage of total
segment revenue, from prior-year levels. Costs of $18.7 million for restructuring
activities, increased costs for pension, other retirement and insurance of $4.5 million,
and higher year-over-year freight costs of $2.5 million, lowered segment gross profit in
2003. Production inefficiencies, as well as expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of
2003 associated with the relocation of production from the closure of two hand-tool
plants, and inventory-related costs, adversely impacted 2003 operating earnings by $7.1
million. In 2003, benefits from favorable net pricing and the success of new products,
partially offset by the impact of lower sales of large-platform diagnostics sold through
the tech rep organization and inflationary cost increases, contributed $10.6 million to
segment gross profit. Segment gross profit in 2003 also benefited from currency
translation of $6.9 million, productivity and cost savings of $5.3 million and LIFO
benefits of $6.1 million from lower inventory levels. Gross profit in 2002 also included
$0.3 million of restructuring-related costs to complete 2001 restructuring initiatives.

Segment operating expenses in 2003
increased $15.2 million, or 50 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue. The
$15.2 million increase in operating expenses includes $8.2 million of currency
translation, $6.6 million for higher pension, other retirement and insurance costs, and
higher freight and catalog expenses of $2.5 million and $2.0 million, respectively. In
2003, the Snap-on Dealer Group also incurred costs for restructuring activities of $2.2
million and higher year-over-year costs of $1.7 million for continued investment in the
company’s dealer expansion and enhancement initiative. Costs incurred for this
initiative generally included higher dealer turnover costs to address low-performing
dealers, as well as higher costs for new dealer training, recruiting and other dealer
expansion costs. These increases in 2003 operating expenses were partially offset by
productivity and cost savings of $3.2 million and lower bad debt expense of $3.1 million.
Operating expenses in 2002 included a net benefit of $2.5 million from the favorable
resolution of a patent infringement matter and also included $1.6 million of costs to
complete 2001 restructuring initiatives. As a result of these factors, segment operating
earnings in 2003 decreased $19.0 million, or 200 basis points as a percentage of total
segment revenue, as compared to 2002.

Commercial and
Industrial Group

Total segment revenue in 2003
increased $67.6 million, or 6.9%, over prior-year levels, including $82.0 million of
currency translation. In 2003, higher sales of equipment for the European vehicle service
marketplace, reflecting the success of new product introductions over the past three
years, were offset by sales declines in industrial tools, principally in such sectors as
aerospace, aviation, general manufacturing and non-residential construction, and lower
sales of power tools to the Snap-on Dealer Group. In addition, lower sales of equipment in
North America, reflecting the sustained weak economic conditions in the manufacturing and
capital goods marketplace and the disruption caused by the launch of the TAG direct sales
organization in the second quarter of 2003, also impacted the year-over-year sales
comparisons.

Segment gross profit in 2003 of
$351.8 million was up $3.5 million from 2002 levels, but decreased 200 basis points as a
percentage of total segment revenue. Benefits realized from currency translation of $22.3
million, primarily due to the sourcing of a significant portion of tool and equipment
products from Sweden and Canada, and savings from restructuring and Lean initiatives of
$8.5 million, were partially offset by $11.5 million from lower sales, general cost
increases and unfavorable sales mix (primarily lower sales of high-margin industrial tools
and equipment), including the impact related to the start-up of the new TAG organization.
In 2003, segment gross profit was lowered by $9.3 million of unfavorable manufacturing
absorption and inventory-related costs, net of LIFO benefits of $6.1 million from lower
inventory levels. Segment gross profit in 2003 was also lowered by $3.6 million of costs
for restructuring activities, including $2.6 million related to the closure of the two
U.S. hand-tool facilities, and by $3.0 million in higher year-over-year costs for pension,
other retirement and insurance.


Segment operating expenses in 2003
increased $32.1 million, or 100 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue. The
increase in operating expenses includes $24.9 million of currency translation and $7.8
million in general cost increases, including costs associated with the TAG start-up. The
increase in 2003 operating expenses also includes $2.0 million of costs for restructuring
activities, $6.5 million in higher year-over-year costs for pension, other retirement and
insurance, and $1.9 million for increased health care costs and costs to terminate certain
life insurance programs. Savings of $8.3 million from restructuring activities offset
these increases in year-over-year operating expenses. Operating expenses in 2002 included
$4.9 million of costs to complete restructuring actions initiated in 2001. Operating
expenses in 2002 also included a net benefit of $2.1 million from the favorable resolution
of a patent infringement matter partially offset by a provision for certain contractual
matters. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings in 2003 decreased $28.6
million, or 300 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue, as compared to
2002.

Diagnostics and
Information Group

Total segment revenue in 2003
increased $2.1 million over prior-year levels, including $9.0 million of currency
translation. Incremental sales from the acquisition of NEXIQ Technologies, and higher
year-over-year sales to new vehicle dealerships under facilitation agreements, in which
Snap-on provides product procurement, distribution and administrative support to customers
for their dealerships’ equipment programs, were offset by a decline in sales of
equipment and large platform-based diagnostics in North America, primarily in products
sold through the Snap-on Dealer Group’s tech rep organization. In addition, the
Diagnostics and Information Group transferred production of certain European equipment
products to the Commercial and Industrial Group, which reduced its intersegment sales for
these products.

Segment gross profit of $128.7
million in 2003 was up $0.1 million, but decreased 10 basis points as a percentage of
total segment revenue. The increase in year-over-year gross profit includes $3.5 million
of benefits primarily from the realignment of production capabilities in certain European
equipment lines and $3.2 million from currency translation. These increases, along with
benefits from favorable net pricing, new product sales and LIFO benefits of $1.8 million
from lower inventory levels, were partially offset by the combined net impact of a shift
in product mix that included lower year-over-year sales of higher margin equipment and
large-platform diagnostics and higher year-over-year sales in the lower margin
facilitation business. Gross profit in 2003 was also adversely impacted by lower
manufacturing cost absorption and $3.6 million in costs for restructuring activities,
including $3.5 million of costs incurred in the fourth quarter of 2003 associated with the
closing of the large-platform diagnostics facility.

Segment operating expenses in 2003
increased $6.8 million, or 170 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue. The
increase in operating expenses in 2003 included $9.3 million from new product sales
expenses and expenses associated with the increased sales in the facilitation business, as
well as $2.9 million of currency translation. In addition, year-over-year segment
operating expenses included $1.6 million for higher pension, other retirement and
insurance costs. These increases in 2003 operating expenses were partially offset by $3.8
million of benefits primarily from the realignment of production capabilities in certain
European equipment lines and by $2.5 million from the fourth-quarter 2003 sales of certain
facilities. Operating expenses in 2002 included $2.6 million for the write-down of a
receivable related to the closure of auto service centers associated with a major
retailer’s bankruptcy. Segment operating expenses in 2002 were also lowered by $1.9
million from the reversal of excess restructuring accruals. As a result of these factors,
segment operating earnings in 2003 decreased $6.7 million, or 180 basis points as a
percentage of total segment revenue, as compared to 2002.


Financial Condition

Liquidity

Snap-on’s growth has
historically been funded by a combination of cash provided by operating activities and
debt financing. Snap-on believes that its cash from operations, coupled with its sources
of borrowings, are sufficient to fund its anticipated requirements for working capital,
capital expenditures and restructuring activities, acquisitions, common stock repurchases,
scheduled debt repayments and dividend payments. Due to Snap-on’s credit rating over
the years, external funds have been available at a reasonable cost. As of the date of the
filing of this Form 10-K, Snap-on’s long-term debt and commercial paper was rated A2
and P-1 by Moody’s Investors Service and A and A-1 by Standard & Poor’s.
Snap-on believes that the strength of its balance sheet affords the company the financial
flexibility to respond to both internal growth opportunities and those available through
acquisitions.

The following discussion focuses on
information included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Snap-on has been focused on improving
asset utilization by making more effective use of its investment in certain working
capital items. Termed “working investment,” the company uses this measure to
assess management’s operating performance and effectiveness relative to those
components of working capital that are more directly impacted by operational decisions. As
of January 1, 2005, working investment of $689.0 million was down $19.2 million from
$708.2 million at year-end 2003. The following represents the company’s working
investment position as of January 1, 2005, and January 3, 2004:

Accounts receivable at the end of
2004 was $542.0 million, down $4.8 million from year-end 2003 levels, notwithstanding an
increase of $22.0 million from currency translation. At the end of 2004, days sales
outstanding improved to 81 days from 88 days at January 3, 2004.

Inventories totaled $341.9 million at
the end of 2004, down $9.2 million from year-end 2003 levels, including an increase of
$17.5 million from currency translation. Inventories accounted for using the FIFO cost
method as of January 1, 2005, and January 3, 2004, approximated 65% and 69% of total
inventories. All other inventories are generally accounted for using the LIFO cost method.
The company’s LIFO reserve declined from $81.8 million at January 3, 2004, to $76.3
million at January 1, 2005. Inventory turns at January 1, 2005, were 3.9 turns, as
compared to 3.6 turns at year-end 2003.

Total notes payable and long-term
debt was $331.0 million at the end of 2004, as compared to $333.2 million at year-end
2003. Cash and cash equivalents were $150.0 million as of January 1, 2005, and $96.1
million at the end of fiscal 2003. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily
due to cash flows from operating activities.

In August 2001, Snap-on issued $200
million of unsecured notes pursuant to a $300 million shelf registration statement filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1994. In October 1995, Snap-on issued $100
million of unsecured notes to the public under this shelf registration. The August 2001
notes require semiannual interest payments at the rate of 6.25% and mature in their
entirety on August 15, 2011. The October 1995 notes require semiannual interest payments
at a rate of 6.625% and mature in their entirety on October 1, 2005.

Notes payable to banks under bank
lines of credit totaled $2.5 million and $4.9 million at the end of 2004 and 2003. At the
end of 2004 and 2003, Snap-on had commercial paper outstanding of $25.0 million. The
company currently anticipates that it will continue to have positive cash flow and debt
reduction for the foreseeable future and, as a result, commercial paper borrowings are
included in “Notes payable and current maturities of long-term debt” on the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

At January 1, 2005, Snap-on had a
$400 million multi-currency revolving credit facility that terminates on July 27, 2009.
This $400 million facility replaced Snap-on’s $408 million of multi-currency
revolving credit facilities. The $400 million multi-currency revolving credit
facility’s financial covenant requires that Snap-on maintain a ratio of debt to the
sum of total debt plus shareholders’ equity of not greater than 0.60 to 1.00. As of
the date of this document, Snap-on believes it is in compliance with all covenants of this
revolving credit facility.

At January 1, 2005, Snap-on also had
$20 million of unused committed bank lines of credit, of which $10 million expires on July
31, 2005, and $10 million expires on August 31, 2005. At January 1, 2005, Snap-on had
approximately $395 million of unused available debt capacity under the terms of its
revolving credit facility and committed bank lines of credit.


Snap-on maintains sufficient
committed lines of credit and liquidity facilities to cover its expected funding needs on
both a short-term and long-term basis. Snap-on manages its aggregate short-term borrowings
so as not to exceed its availability under its revolving credit facility and committed
lines of credit. The company accesses short-term debt markets, predominantly through
commercial paper issuances, to fund its short-term requirements and to ensure near-term
liquidity. Near-term liquidity requirements for Snap-on in 2005 include $100.3 million in
scheduled debt repayments, funding of its restructuring activities, investments in capital
expenditures, payments of dividends and share repurchases. As funding needs are determined
to be of a longer-term nature, Snap-on could access medium- and long-term debt markets, as
appropriate, to refinance short-term borrowings and, thus, replenish its short-term
liquidity. Snap-on’s long-term financing strategy is to maintain continuous access to
the debt markets to accommodate its liquidity needs. For additional information on
Snap-on’s debt and credit facilities, refer to Note 10 of the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

The following discussion focuses on
information included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Cash flow from operating activities was
$146.8 million in 2004, including a $63.6 million voluntary U.S. pension contribution and
a $10.0 million payment to the U.S. Department of Justice pursuant to an agreement to
resolve a government audit relating to two contracts with the GSA, partially offset by a
$10.7 million income tax refund, primarily resulting from a $78.2 million voluntary U.S.
pension contribution made in the fourth quarter of 2003. Cash flow from operating
activities in 2003 was $177.0 million, including $92.2 million in pension plan
contributions. Cash flow from operating activities in 2002 was $224.1 million. The
consolidation of SOC as of January 4, 2004, did not have a material impact on cash flow.

Depreciation in 2004 was $58.5
million, compared with $58.2 million in 2003 and $49.9 million in 2002. Amortization
expense was $2.5 million in 2004, $2.1 million in 2003 and $1.8 million in 2002.

Capital expenditures in 2004 were
$38.7 million, compared to $29.4 million in 2003 and $45.8 million in 2002. The declines
in capital expenditures since 2002 reflect focused capital spending on investments in
growth projects and the benefits of Lean initiatives and other cost reduction activities
that have reduced the manufacturing footprint. Capital expenditures in all three years
reflect new product, quality and cost-reduction capital investments, as well as ongoing
replacements and upgrades of manufacturing and distribution facilities and equipment.
Snap-on anticipates that 2005 capital expenditures will approximate $40 million to $45
million, of which two-thirds is expected to be used for investments relating to new
products, quality enhancement or cost reduction. Snap-on believes that its cash generated
from operations, as well as the funds available from its credit facilities, will be
sufficient to fund the company’s capital expenditure requirements in 2005.

In the second quarter of 2004,
Snap-on sold, at book value, its 70% interest in Texo s.r.l., a European manufacturer and
developer of vehicle lifts, for approximately $0.6 million.

Snap-on has undertaken stock
repurchases from time to time to offset dilution created by shares issued for employee and
dealer stock purchase plans, stock options, and other corporate purposes, as well as to
repurchase shares when the company believes market conditions are favorable. In 2004,
Snap-on repurchased 1,200,000 shares of common stock for $38.2 million under its
previously announced share repurchase programs. As of January 1, 2005, Snap-on has
remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $127.9 million in common stock
pursuant to the Board of Directors’ authorizations. The purchase of Snap-on common
stock is at the company’s discretion, subject to prevailing financial and market
conditions. Snap-on repurchased 450,000 shares of common stock for $12.5 million in 2003
and 405,000 shares of common stock for $12.2 million in 2002. Snap-on believes that its
cash generated from operations, as well as the funds available from its credit facilities,
will be sufficient to fund the company’s share repurchases in 2005.

In June 2003, Snap-on received
proceeds of $5.1 million for the termination of a $25 million interest rate swap that was
a fair value hedge for a portion of its $200 million, 6.25% long-term notes. The $5.1
million is being amortized to income using the effective interest rate method over the
remaining life of the notes, which mature on August 15, 2011. At the same time, Snap-on
entered into a new $25 million interest rate swap to hedge that same portion of these
notes.

Snap-on has paid quarterly cash
dividends, without interruption or decline, since 1939. Cash dividends paid in 2004, 2003
and 2002 totaled $57.7 million, $58.2 million and $56.5 million.

see Notes 9, 10 and 17 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Environmental Matters

Snap-on is subject to various
federal, state and local government requirements regulating the discharge of materials
into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment.
Snap-on’s policy is to comply with these requirements, and the company believes that,
as a general matter, its policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to
prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability,
in connection with its business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent
in some of Snap-on’s operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged
in similar businesses.

Snap-on is and has been engaged in
the handling, manufacture, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous or
toxic by one or more regulatory agencies. The company believes that, as a general matter,
its handling, manufacture, use and disposal of these substances are in accordance with
environmental laws and regulations. It is possible, however, that future knowledge or
other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or
increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could bring
into question the company’s handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these
substances.

Consolidated Joint
Venture

SOC, a 50%-owned joint venture
between Snap-on and CIT, provides a broad range of financial services to Snap-on’s
U.S. dealer and customer network and to Snap-on’s industrial and other customers.
Snap-on began consolidating SOC as of January 4, 2004, the beginning of Snap-on’s
2004 fiscal year, as a result of the adoption of FIN No. 46R. Snap-on previously accounted
for SOC using the equity method. Snap-on and CIT have identical voting and participation
rights and responsibilities in SOC. Refer to Notes 2 and 9 of the Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information.

By establishing SOC, Snap-on
effectively outsourced its domestic captive credit function to SOC. Snap-on receives
royalty and management fee income from SOC based on the volume of financings originated by
SOC. Snap-on also shares ratably with CIT in any residual net profit or loss of the joint
venture after operating expenses, including royalty and management fees, interest costs
and credit loss provisions. Snap-on provides extended-term financing internationally
through its wholly owned finance subsidiaries.

SOC sells substantially all of its
originated contracts on a limited recourse basis to CIT, net of certain fees. SOC
continues to service these contracts for an estimated market-rate servicing fee. In 2004,
SOC originated contracts totaling $481.2 million, compared to $522.4 million in 2003 and
$506.3 million in 2002.


Financial information regarding SOC
loan originations is as follows:

Snap-on has credit risk exposure for
certain SOC-originated contracts with recourse provisions against Snap-on (primarily for
dealer van loans). At January 1, 2005, and January 3, 2004, $14.8 million and $14.1
million of loans, with terms ranging from six months to ten years, have a primary recourse
provision to Snap-on if the loans become more than 90 days past due. The asset value of
the collateral underlying these recourse loans would serve to mitigate Snap-on’s loss
in the event of default. The estimated fair value of the guarantees for all loan
originations with recourse as of January 1, 2005, was not material.

CIT and Snap-on have agreed to lend
funds to support SOC’s working capital requirements on a 50/50 basis, with a combined
maximum borrowing limit not to exceed $24 million. As of January 1, 2005, SOC owed both
Snap-on and CIT $0.5 million each pursuant to this agreement.

Snap-on’s exposure related to
SOC as of January 1, 2005, was its $6.1 million investment and the $0.5 million working
capital loan plus the recourse obligations on customer financings, both discussed above.
CIT’s investment in SOC of $6.1 million as of January 1, 2005, is included in
“Other long-term liabilities” on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Market, Credit and
Economic Risks

Market risk is the potential economic
loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments.
Snap-on is exposed to market risk from changes in both foreign currency exchange rates and
interest rates. Snap-on monitors its exposure to these risks and attempts to manage the
underlying economic exposures through the use of financial instruments such as forward
exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements. Snap-on does not use derivative
instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Snap-on’s broad-based business
activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related
areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole. Snap-on’s management takes an
active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that
require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification,
assessment and control of various risks.

Foreign Currency Risk
Management

Snap-on has significant international
operations and is subject to certain risks inherent with foreign operations that include
currency fluctuations and restrictions on movement of funds. Foreign exchange risk exists
to the extent that Snap-on has payment obligations or receipts denominated in currencies
other than the functional currency. To manage these exposures, Snap-on identifies
naturally offsetting positions and then purchases hedging instruments to protect the
residual net anticipated exposures. Snap-on’s financial position and results of
operations have not been materially affected by such events to date. For additional
information, refer to Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Interest Rate Risk
Management

Snap-on’s interest rate risk
management policies are designed to reduce the potential volatility of earnings that could
arise from changes in interest rates. Through the use of interest rate swaps, Snap-on aims
to stabilize funding costs by managing the exposure created by the differing maturities
and interest rate structures of Snap-on’s assets and liabilities. For additional
information, refer to Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.


Snap-on utilizes a Value-at-Risk
(“VAR”) model to determine the potential one-day loss in the fair value of its
interest rate and foreign exchange-sensitive financial instruments from adverse changes in
market factors. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a
95% confidence level. Snap-on’s computations are based on the inter-relationships
among movements in various currencies and interest rates (variance/co-variance technique).
These inter-relationships were determined by observing interest rate and foreign currency
market changes over the preceding quarter.

The estimated maximum potential
one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the VAR model, at January 1, 2005, was

$0.6 million on interest rate-sensitive financial instruments and $0.7 million on
foreign currency-sensitive financial instruments. The VAR model is a risk management tool
and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by
Snap-on, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors.

Credit Risk

Credit risk is the possibility of
loss from a customer’s failure to make payments according to contract terms. Prior to
granting credit, each customer is evaluated, taking into consideration the borrower’s
financial condition, collateral, debt-servicing capacity, past payment experience, credit
bureau information and other financial and qualitative factors that may affect the
borrower’s ability to repay. Specific credit reviews and standard industry credit
scoring models are used in performing this evaluation. Loans that have been granted are
typically monitored through an asset-quality-review process that closely monitors past due
accounts and initiates collection actions when appropriate. In addition to its direct
credit risk exposure, Snap-on also has credit risk exposure for certain SOC loan
originations with recourse provisions against Snap-on (primarily for dealer van loans). At
January 1, 2005, $14.8 million of loans originated by SOC have a recourse provision to
Snap-on if the loans become more than 90 days past due. For additional information on SOC,
refer to the section entitled “Consolidated Joint Venture” in this
Management’s Discussion and Analysis and to Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Economic Risk

Economic risk is the possibility of
loss resulting from economic instability in certain areas of the world. Snap-on
continually monitors its exposure in these markets. Snap-on’s Commercial and
Industrial Group includes a hand-tool manufacturing facility in Argentina with net assets
of approximately $11 million as of January 1, 2005. Due to economic instability in
Argentina, Snap-on resized its operations there in 2001 and will continue to assess
Argentina’s economic situation to determine if any future actions or impairment
write-downs are warranted.

As a result of the above market,
credit and economic risks, net income and revenues in any particular period may not be
representative of full-year results and may vary significantly from year to year and from
quarter to quarter. Inflation has not had a significant impact on the company.

Other Matters

Acquisitions

In 2002, Snap-on acquired full
ownership of two business operations for $7.9 million. The purchase price paid plus the
liabilities assumed exceeded the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired
by approximately $3.7 million. Each of the acquisitions provided Snap-on with a
complementary product line, new customer relationships, access to additional distribution
and/or an extended geographic reach. Pro forma financial information has not been
presented, as the effects of these businesses, individually and in the aggregate, were not
material.

Government Contract
Matters

On July 23, 2004, Snap-on reached an agreement
with the U.S. Department of Justice to resolve the government audit, previously discussed
in the company’s 2003 Annual Report and Form 10-K, relating to two contracts with the
GSA. Snap-on agreed to settle the claims over the interpretation and application of the
price reduction and billing provisions of these two contracts for sales from March 1996
through the July 23, 2004, settlement date for $10.0 million. Snap-on incurred a pretax
charge of $3.6 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2004 for
costs not previously accrued. Snap-on remitted the $10.0 million cash settlement to the
U.S. Department of Justice on August 5, 2004. On February 8, 2005, the GSA requested information
from Snap-on to evaluate possible administrative action.

Accounting Pronouncements

For a discussion of recent accounting
pronouncements, see Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.


Critical Accounting
Policies

The consolidated financial statements
and related notes contain information that is pertinent to management’s discussion
and analysis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These
estimates are generally based on historical experience, current conditions and on various
other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily available from other sources, as well as identifying and
assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. Snap-on considers the following policies to be
the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of
the company’s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could
impact the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Allowances for Doubtful
Accounts:

Snap-on’s accounts receivable are reported net of estimated bad debt
allowances, which are regularly evaluated by management for adequacy. The evaluations take
into consideration various financial and qualitative factors that may affect
customers’ ability to pay. These factors may include customers’ financial
condition, collateral, debt-servicing capacity, past payment experience and credit bureau
information. Snap-on regularly reviews the estimation process and adjusts the allowances
as appropriate. It is possible, however, that the accuracy of Snap-on’s estimation
process could be adversely impacted if the financial condition of its customers were to
deteriorate. We do not believe Snap-on’s accounts receivable represent significant
concentrations of credit risk because of the diversified portfolio of individual customers
and geographical areas.

Inventory Valuation:

Snap-on
values its inventory at the lower of cost or market and adjusts for the value of inventory
that is estimated to be excess, obsolete or otherwise unmarketable. Inventory adjustments
for raw materials are largely based on analysis of raw material age and actual physical
inspection of raw material for fitness for use. As part of evaluating work-in-progress and
finished goods, management reviews individual product SKUs by product category and product
life cycle. Cost adjustments for each product category/product life-cycle state are
generally established and maintained based on a combination of historical experience,
forecasted sales and promotions, technological obsolescence, inventory age and other
actual known conditions and circumstances. Should actual product marketability and raw
material fitness for use be affected by conditions that are different from management
estimates, further adjustments to inventory allowances may be required.

Warranty Accruals:

Snap-on
provides product warranties for specific product lines and accrues for estimated future
warranty costs in the period in which the sale is recorded. Snap-on calculates its accrual
requirements based on historic warranty loss experience that is periodically adjusted for
recent actual experience, including the timing of claims during the warranty period and
actual costs incurred. For additional information on Snap-on’s warranty accrual,
refer to Note 17 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Pension Benefits:

The
calculation of Snap-on’s pension expense and projected benefit obligation requires
the use of a number of assumptions. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced
by factors outside of Snap-on’s control and can have a significant effect on the
amounts reported in the financial statements. Snap-on believes that the two most critical
assumptions are the expected return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate.

For a discussion of the development
of Snap-on’s expected return on plan assets assumption, refer to Note 13 of the
Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension expense increases as the expected rate of
return on plan assets decreases. Lowering the expected rate of return assumption for
Snap-on’s domestic pension plan assets by 0.5% would increase Snap-on’s 2005
domestic pension expense by approximately $3 million. At year-end 2004, Snap-on’s
domestic plan assets comprised approximately 90% of Snap-on’s worldwide pension plan
assets.

Snap-on establishes the discount rate
using the current rates earned on long-term bonds with a Moody’s Aa rating. Pension
expense and projected benefit obligation both increase as the discount rate is reduced.
Lowering Snap-on’s domestic discount rate assumption by 0.5% would increase
Snap-on’s 2005 domestic pension expense and projected benefit obligation by
approximately $3 million and $43 million, respectively. At year-end 2004, Snap-on’s
domestic projected benefit obligation comprised approximately 84% of Snap-on’s
worldwide projected benefit obligation.

Income Taxes:

The company
records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than
not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. While the
company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax
strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and
assumptions change in the future, the company may be required to adjust its valuation
allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such
determination is made.

In addition, the company operates
within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The
company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may
change in the future due to new developments in each matter.


Outlook

Substantial transformation has
already occurred in reducing plant redundancies and improving manufacturing processes
through the application of Lean business tools in the last few years. This transformation
provides a solid foundation to build upon for the future. Through its ongoing commitment
to the use of Lean tools, Snap-on anticipates further strengthening its marketplace
competitiveness and enhancing customer responsiveness.

In 2005, as part of longer-term
ongoing initiatives, Snap-on expects to focus efforts on improving customer service
levels, particularly those relating to production issues in our U.S. hand-tool plants,
reducing complexities and associated costs throughout our organization, strengthening and
growing our U.S. dealer van franchise system, delivering continued improvements in our
global Commercial and Industrial businesses, and further enhancing our leading marketplace
position for diagnostics and information products.

There will be costs associated with a
number of these actions anticipated to occur throughout 2005. Primarily as a result of the
accelerated pace for staffing and other cost reduction efforts, we expect first-quarter
2005 results to include charges of approximately $10 million to $12 million. For all of
2005, we expect restructuring costs to total approximately $20 million to $25 million.
These costs notwithstanding, we expect earnings in 2005 to show an improving trend and to
exceed full-year 2004 earnings.

Safe Harbor

Statements in this document that are
not historical facts, including statements (i) that include the words “expects,”
“targets,” “plans,” “intends,” “estimates,”
“believes,” “anticipates,” or similar words that reference Snap-on or
its management; (ii) specifically identified as forward-looking; or (iii) describing
Snap-on’s or management’s future outlook, plans, estimates, objectives or goals,
are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. Snap-on or its representatives may also make similar forward-looking
statements from time to time orally or in writing. Snap-on cautions the reader that any
forward-looking statements included in this document that are based upon assumptions and
estimates were developed by management in good faith and that management believes such
assumptions and estimates to be reasonable as of the date of this document. However, these
statements are subject to risks, uncertainties or other factors, including some events
that may not be within the control of the company, that could cause (and in some cases
have caused) actual results to differ materially from those described in any such
statement. Some of these factors are discussed below, as well as elsewhere in this
document, and in other Snap-on Securities and Exchange Commission filings.

These risks and uncertainties
include, without limitation, uncertainties related to estimates, assumptions and
projections generally, and the timing and progress with which Snap-on can attain savings
from cost reduction actions, including its ability to implement and complete planned
reductions in workforce, achieve improvements in the company’s manufacturing
footprint, successfully manage relationships with suppliers, achieve improvements in
supply chain efficiencies, and enhance machine maintenance, plant productivity, and
manufacturing line set-up and change-over practices, any or all of which could result in
production inefficiencies, higher cost and lost revenues. These risks also include
uncertainties related to Snap-on’s capability to retain and attract dealers, capture
new business, introduce successful new products, as well as its ability to withstand
disruption arising from planned facility closures, or other labor interruptions, and
external negative factors including terrorist disruptions on business; potential changes
in trade, monetary and fiscal policies, regulatory reporting requirements, laws and
regulations, or other activities of governments or their agencies, including military
actions and such aftermath that might occur; the absence of significant changes in the
current competitive environment, inflation and other monetary fluctuations, interest
rates, legal proceedings, and energy and raw material supply and pricing (including
steel), supplier and contract manufacturer disruptions, the amount of Snap-on’s
general and administrative expenses (e.g. health care and/or pension costs) or the
material worsening of economic situations around the world, particularly in North America
and/or Europe, its ability to increase prices due to higher raw material costs, and the
effect of new accounting standards and/or legislation. In addition, investors should be
aware that accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
prescribe when a company should reserve for particular risks, including litigation
exposures. Accordingly, results for a given reporting period could be significantly
affected if and when an accrual is established for a major contingency. Reported results,
therefore, may appear to be volatile in certain accounting periods.

These factors may not constitute all
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in any
forward-looking statement. Snap-on operates in a continually changing business environment
and new factors emerge from time to time. Snap-on cannot predict such factors nor can it
assess the impact, if any, of such factors on Snap-on’s financial position or its
results of operations. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon
as a prediction of actual results or regarded as a representation by the company or its
management that the projected results will be achieved. Snap-on disclaims any
responsibility to update any forward-looking statement provided in this document.

Note 1: Nature of
Operations

Snap-on Incorporated
(“Snap-on” or “the company”) was incorporated under the laws of the
state of Wisconsin in 1920 and reincorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in
1930. Snap-on is a leading global innovator, manufacturer and marketer of high-quality
tool, diagnostic and equipment solutions for professional tool and equipment users.
Product lines include a broad range of hand and power tools, tool storage, saws and
cutting tools, pruning tools, vehicle service diagnostics equipment, vehicle service
equipment, including wheel service, safety testing and collision repair equipment, vehicle
service information, business management systems, equipment repair services, and other
tool and equipment solutions. Snap-on’s customers include automotive technicians,
vehicle service centers, manufacturers, industrial tool and equipment users, and those
involved in commercial applications such as construction, electrical and agriculture.
Products are sold through Snap-on’s franchised dealer van, company-direct,
distributor and Internet sales channels.

Note 2: Summary of
Accounting Policies

Principles of consolidation and
presentation:

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Snap-on,
its majority-owned subsidiaries and, beginning in 2004, Snap-on Credit LLC
(“SOC”), a 50%-owned joint venture with The CIT Group, Inc. (“CIT”).
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain
prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation.

In December 2003, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Interpretation (“FIN”) No.
46R, “

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (an interpretation of ARB No.
51),

” which became effective for Snap-on at the beginning of its 2004 fiscal
year. FIN No. 46R provides consolidation guidance regarding the identification of variable
interest entities (“VIE”) for which control is achieved through means other than
through voting rights. FIN No. 46R provides guidance in determining if a business
enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a VIE and whether or not that business enterprise
should consolidate the VIE for financial reporting purposes. Based on the company’s
analysis of FIN No. 46R, the company concluded that Snap-on would consolidate SOC as of
January 4, 2004, the beginning of Snap-on’s 2004 fiscal year. Snap-on previously
accounted for SOC using the equity method. As Snap-on consolidated SOC on a prospective
basis, previously issued financial statements have not been restated to reflect the
consolidation of SOC. The impact of the consolidation of SOC on Snap-on’s
consolidated balance sheet was not significant. Refer to Note 9 for additional
information. In addition, as a result of the consolidation of SOC in fiscal 2004, Snap-on
is reporting the results of its finance operations as a new business segment,
“Financial Services.” Refer to Note 18 for additional information.

Financial services:

Beginning
in 2004, financial services revenue consists of SOC’s sales of originated contracts
and service fee income, as well as installment contract revenue and dealer loan receivable
revenue derived from SOC and Snap-on’s wholly owned international finance operations.
Administrative expenses from Snap-on’s financial services business are included in
“Operating expenses” on the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Earnings.

Net finance income:

In 2003
and 2002, prior to the consolidation of SOC, net finance income consisted of royalty and
management fees received from SOC based on the volume of financings originated by SOC, as
well as installment contract revenue and dealer loan receivable revenue derived from
Snap-on’s wholly owned international finance operations, net of administrative
expenses. Administrative expenses related to Snap-on’s wholly owned international
finance operations totaled $13.4 million in 2003 and $9.5 million in 2002.

Fiscal year accounting period:

Snap-on’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest December 31. The 2004 and 2002
fiscal years each contained 52 weeks and ended on January 1, 2005, and December 28, 2002.
Snap-on’s 2003 fiscal year contained 53 weeks and ended on January 3, 2004.

Use of estimates:

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

Revenue recognition:

Snap-on
recognizes revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) the price is fixed or determinable; (iii)
collectibility is reasonably assured; and (iv) delivery has occurred or services have been
rendered. Snap-on establishes an accrual for estimated future product returns in the
period in which the sale is recorded. Estimated returns are based upon past experience and
include assumptions of the expected return period, gross profit margin, and volume of
sales returns. Franchise fee revenue is recognized as the fees are earned; such revenue
was not material in any year. Subscription revenue is deferred and recognized over the
life of the subscription.

Research and engineering:

Research and engineering costs are charged to expense in the year incurred. For 2004, 2003
and 2002, research and engineering costs totaled $60.8 million, $59.8 million and $57.1
million.


Shipping and handling:

Amounts
billed to customers for shipping and handling are included as a component of sales. Costs
incurred by Snap-on for shipping and handling are generally included as a component of
cost of goods sold when the costs relate to manufacturing activities. In 2004, 2003 and
2002, Snap-on incurred shipping and handling charges of $17.0 million, $15.9 million and
$15.7 million that were recorded in “Cost of goods sold” on the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Shipping and handling costs incurred in conjunction
with selling or distribution activities are generally included as a component of operating
expenses. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, Snap-on incurred shipping and handling charges of $57.8
million, $50.3 million and $44.3 million that were recorded in “Operating
expenses” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Advertising and promotion:

Production costs of future media advertising are deferred until the advertising occurs.
All other advertising and promotion costs are generally expensed when incurred. For 2004,
2003 and 2002, advertising and promotion expense totaled $49.8 million, $51.0 million and
$46.7 million.

Warranties:

Snap-on provides
product warranties for specific product lines and accrues for estimated future warranty
costs in the period in which the sale is recorded. Refer to Note 17 for additional
information.

Foreign currency translation:

The financial statements of Snap-on’s foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S.
dollars in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 52,

“Foreign Currency Translation.”

Assets and liabilities of foreign
subsidiaries are translated at current rates of exchange, and income and expense items are
translated at the average exchange rate for the period. The resulting translation
adjustments are recorded directly into “Accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss)” in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Foreign exchange
transactions resulted in pretax losses of $0.7 million in 2004, $6.6 million in 2003 and
$4.4 million in 2002. Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses are reported in
“Other income (expense) — net” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements
of Earnings.

Income taxes:

Deferred income
taxes are provided for temporary differences arising from differences in bases of assets
and liabilities for tax and financial reporting purposes. Deferred income taxes are
recorded on temporary differences at the tax rate expected to be in effect when the
temporary differences reverse. Refer to Note 12 for additional information.

Minority interest:

Minority
interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries for 2004, 2003 and 2002 totaled $2.0
million, $3.1 million and $3.4 million and is included in “Other income (expense)
– net” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. At the end of
2004 and 2003, minority interest in subsidiaries totaled $22.3 million and $16.0 million
and is included in “Other long-term liabilities” on the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Derivatives:

Snap-on utilizes
derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps and foreign exchange
contracts, to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate
risks. Snap-on accounts for its derivatives in accordance with SFAS No. 133,

“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,”

as
amended by SFAS No. 138 and SFAS No. 149. Snap-on does not hold or issue financial
instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Refer to Note 11 for additional
information.

Per share data:

Basic earnings
per share calculations were computed by dividing net earnings by the corresponding
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The dilutive effect
of the potential exercise of outstanding options to purchase common shares is calculated
using the treasury stock method. Snap-on had dilutive shares as of year-end 2004, 2003 and
2002, of 448,098 shares, 171,395 shares and 271,051 shares. Options to purchase 2,352,111
shares, 3,694,950 shares and 2,668,711 shares of Snap-on common stock at year-end 2004,
2003 and 2002 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share as the
exercise prices of the options were greater than the average market price of the common
stock for the respective year and, as a result, the effect on earnings per share would be
anti-dilutive.

Stock-based employee compensation
arrangements:

Snap-on has various stock-based employee compensation plans. Snap-on
accounts for its stock-based employee compensation under Accounting Principles Board
(“APB”) Opinion No. 25,

“Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees.”

Refer to Note 15 for additional information.

In December 2004, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 123R, “

Share-Based Payment

.” Refer to “Accounting
pronouncements” below for additional information.

Concentrations:

Snap-on is
exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to its
interest rate swap and foreign exchange contracts. Snap-on does not obtain collateral or
other security to support its financial instruments subject to credit risk, but monitors
the credit standing of the counterparties and enters into agreements only with financial
institution counterparties with a credit rating of A- or better. Snap-on does not
anticipate non-performance by its counterparties.

Snap-on’s accounts receivable do
not represent significant concentrations of credit risk because of the diversified
portfolio of individual customers and geographic areas.


Approximately 3,400 employees, or 29%
of Snap-on’s worldwide workforce, are represented by unions and/or covered under
collective bargaining agreements. Of these, approximately 1,580 are covered under various
European national union agreements that are renewed on an annual basis. Approximately
1,730 employees are covered under agreements expiring in 2005, including approximately 980
covered under various European national union agreements. In recent years, Snap-on has not
experienced any significant work slow-downs, stoppages or other labor disruptions.

Cash equivalents:

Snap-on
considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less
to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates market
value.

Inventories:

Inventories
consist of manufactured products and merchandise for resale. Manufactured products include
the costs of materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. Most of Snap-on’s
inventories are valued at the lower of cost, on the “first-in, first-out”
(“FIFO”) basis, or market. Remaining inventories are generally valued at cost,
on the “last-in, first-out” (“LIFO”) basis. Inventories accounted for
using the FIFO basis represented 65% and 69% of total gross inventories on January 1,
2005, and January 3, 2004. Refer to Note 6 for additional information.

Property and equipment:

Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over estimated useful
lives. Major repairs that extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized, while
routine maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software included in
property and equipment reflects costs related to internally developed or purchased
software for internal use and is amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated
useful lives. Development costs for computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise
marketed externally are also capitalized once technological feasibility has been achieved
and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Capitalized
software is subject to an ongoing assessment of recoverability based upon anticipated
future revenues and identified changes in hardware and software technologies. Long-lived
assets are evaluated for impairment in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144,
“

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

.” Refer
to Note 7 for additional information.

Goodwill and other intangible
assets:

Snap-on adopted SFAS No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets,”

at the beginning of its 2002 fiscal year. SFAS No. 142 requires the
testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, at least
annually, as compared to the past method of amortizing such assets to expense on a
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Snap-on evaluates annually, and
when significant changes in expected long-term performance or other events arise, the
existence of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment on the basis of
whether the assets are fully recoverable from projected, discounted cash flows of the
related business unit. Refer to Note 8 for additional information.

Cumulative effect of changes in
accounting principles:

Snap-on recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle transition adjustment that increased net earnings in the first quarter of 2002
by $2.8 million, on both a pretax and after-tax basis, from the recognition of negative
goodwill as prescribed by SFAS No. 142. Refer to Note 8 for additional information.

Accounting pronouncements:

In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, “

Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets an
amendment of APB Opinion No. 29,

” which eliminates the exception from fair value
measurements for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with
an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange
has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change
significantly as a result of the exchange. SFAS No. 153 is effective for nonmonetary asset
exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005, with earlier adoption
permitted. Snap-on will adopt SFAS No. 153 on July 3, 2005, the beginning of its fiscal
2005 third quarter. The company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS No. 153 will
have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

In December 2004, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 123R, “

Share-Based Payment

.” SFAS No. 123R eliminates the
alternative to use Opinion No. 25‘s intrinsic value method of accounting that was
provided in SFAS No. 123 as originally issued. SFAS No. 123R requires entities to
recognize the cost of employee services in exchange for awards of equity instruments based
on the grant-date fair value of those awards (with limited exceptions). That cost will be
recognized over the period during which the employee is required to provide the service in
exchange for the award. No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for
which employees do not render the requisite service. SFAS No. 123R requires entities to
initially measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of
liability instruments based on its current fair value; the fair value of the award will be
remeasured at each reporting date through the settlement date. Changes in fair value
during the requisite service period will be recognized as compensation cost over that
period. The grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will
be estimated using option-pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those
instruments. SFAS No. 123R is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual
reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005. Snap-on will adopt SFAS No. 123R on July
3, 2005, the beginning of its fiscal 2005 third quarter. The company is currently
assessing the impact the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will have on the company’s
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In November 2004, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 151, “

Inventory Costs an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4,

”
which requires idle facility expenses, excessive spoilage, and double freight and
rehandling costs to be treated as current period charges and also requires that the
allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal
capacity of the production facilities. Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43,
“

Inventory Pricing,

” previously required such expenses to be treated as
current period expenses only if they meet the criterion of “so abnormal,” which
was not a defined term. SFAS No. 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during
fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005, with earlier adoption permitted. Snap-on will
adopt SFAS No. 151 on January 1, 2006. The company does not believe that the adoption of
SFAS No. 151 will have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial
position or results of operations.


In December 2003, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003),

“Employer’s Disclosures about Pensions and Other
Postretirement Benefits,”

that revises employer’s disclosures about pension
plans and other postretirement benefit plans. SFAS No. 132 does not change the measurement
or recognition of those plans. Refer to Notes 13 and 14 for additional information.

Note 3: Acquisitions and
Divestitures

In 2004, Snap-on disposed of a
business for $0.6 million. In 2002, Snap-on acquired full ownership of two businesses for
$7.9 million. The purchase price paid plus the liabilities assumed for these two
acquisitions exceeded the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired by
approximately $3.7 million. The purchase accounting for the two acquisitions was finalized
in 2003. Pro forma financial information has not been presented as the effects of these
businesses, individually and in the aggregate, were not material.

Note 4: Exit or Disposal
Activities

During 2004, Snap-on recorded costs
associated with exit and disposal activities of $21.7 million, including charges of $16.0
million that are included in “Cost of goods sold” and charges of $5.7 million
that are included in “Operating expenses” on the accompanying Consolidated
Statements of Earnings. Of the $21.7 million in costs incurred for exit and disposal
activities in 2004, $10.7 million qualified for accrual treatment. Costs associated with
exit and disposal activities incurred in 2004 primarily related to the phase out of
production at two U.S. hand-tool manufacturing facilities; closure of a German hand-tool
plant that was consolidated into the company’s Spanish operation; the elimination of
one plant in Spain through further consolidation; the movement of production of certain
saw products from the United Kingdom to Eastern Europe; and management realignment actions
at various other Snap-on facilities.

2005.

Snap-on expects to fund the remaining
cash requirements of its 2004 and 2003 exit and disposal activities with cash flows from
operations and borrowings under the company’s existing credit facilities. The
estimated costs for the exit and disposal activities were based on management’s best
business judgment under prevailing circumstances.

Snap-on recorded a cumulative effect
of a change in accounting principle transition adjustment that increased net earnings in
the first quarter of 2002 by $2.8 million, on both a pretax and after-tax basis, from the
recognition of negative goodwill as prescribed by SFAS No. 142.

Note 9: Snap-on Credit
LLC Joint Venture

SOC, a 50%-owned joint venture
between Snap-on and CIT, provides a broad range of financial services to Snap-on’s
U.S. dealer and customer network and to Snap-on’s industrial and other customers.
Snap-on began consolidating SOC as of January 4, 2004, the beginning of Snap-on’s
2004 fiscal year, as a result of the adoption of FIN No. 46R. Snap-on previously accounted
for SOC using the equity method. Snap-on and CIT have identical voting and participation
rights and responsibilities in SOC. Refer to Note 2 for additional information.

By establishing SOC, Snap-on
effectively outsourced its domestic captive credit function to SOC. Snap-on receives
royalty and management fee income from SOC based on the volume of financings originated by
SOC. Snap-on also shares ratably with CIT in any residual net profit or loss of the joint
venture after operating expenses, including royalty and management fees, interest costs
and credit loss provisions. Snap-on provides extended-term financing internationally
through its wholly owned finance subsidiaries.

SOC sells substantially all of its
originated contracts on a limited recourse basis to CIT, net of certain fees. SOC
continues to service these contracts for an estimated market-rate servicing fee. In 2004,
SOC originated contracts totaling $481.2 million, compared to $522.4 million in 2003 and
$506.3 million in 2002.

Snap-on has credit risk exposure for
certain SOC-originated contracts with recourse provisions against Snap-on (primarily for
dealer van loans). At January 1, 2005, and January 3, 2004, $14.8 million and $14.1
million of loans, with terms ranging from six months to ten years, have a primary recourse
provision to Snap-on if the loans become more than 90 days past due. The asset value of
the collateral underlying these recourse loans would serve to mitigate Snap-on’s loss
in the event of default. The estimated fair value of the guarantees for all loan
originations with recourse as of January 1, 2005, was not material.

CIT and Snap-on have agreed to lend
funds to support SOC’s working capital requirements on a 50/50 basis, with a combined
maximum borrowing limit not to exceed $24 million. As of January 1, 2005, SOC owed both
Snap-on and CIT $0.5 million each pursuant to this agreement.

Snap-on’s exposure related to
SOC as of January 1, 2005, was its $6.1 million investment and the $0.5 million working
capital loan plus the recourse obligations on customer financings, both discussed above.
CIT’s investment of $6.1 million as of January 1, 2005, is included in “Other
long-term liabilities” on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Prior to fiscal 2004, SOC was
accounted for by Snap-on under the equity method, as such, the following summarized
financial information of SOC as of December 31, 2003, and for the year then ended is
presented:


Note 10: Short-term and
Long-term Debt

Notes payable to banks under bank
lines of credit totaled $2.5 million and $4.9 million at the end of 2004 and 2003. At the
end of 2004 and 2003, Snap-on had commercial paper outstanding of $25.0 million. The
company currently anticipates that it will continue to have positive cash flow and debt
reduction for the foreseeable future and, as a result, commercial paper borrowings are
included in “Notes payable and current maturities of long-term debt” on the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

At January 1, 2005, Snap-on had a
$400 million multi-currency revolving credit facility that terminates on July 27, 2009.
This $400 million facility replaced Snap-on’s $408 million of multi-currency
revolving credit facilities. The $400 million multi-currency revolving credit
facility’s financial covenant requires that Snap-on maintain a ratio of debt to the
sum of total debt plus shareholders’ equity of not greater than 0.60 to 1.00. As of
January 1, 2005, Snap-on was in compliance with all covenants of this revolving credit
facility. At January 1, 2005, Snap-on also had $20 million of unused committed bank lines
of credit of which $10 million expires on July 31, 2005, and $10 million expires on August
31, 2005. At January 1, 2005, Snap-on had approximately $395 million of unused available
debt capacity under the terms of its revolving credit facility and committed bank lines of
credit.

Average commercial paper and bank
notes outstanding were $29.1 million in 2004 and $66.6 million in 2003. The
weighted-average interest rate on these instruments was 2.12% in 2004 and 1.95% in 2003.
As of January 1, 2005, and January 3, 2004, commercial paper and bank notes outstanding
had a weighted-average interest rate of 2.37% and 2.88%.


In August 2001, Snap-on issued $200
million of unsecured notes pursuant to a $300 million shelf registration statement filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1994. In October 1995, Snap-on issued $100
million of unsecured notes to the public under this shelf registration. The August 2001
notes require semiannual interest payments at the rate of 6.25% and mature in their
entirety on August 15, 2011. The October 1995 notes require semiannual interest payments
at a rate of 6.625% and mature in their entirety on October 1, 2005.

Snap-on’s long-term debt as of
fiscal year-end 2004 and 2003 consisted of the following:

Note 11: Financial
Instruments

Snap-on accounts for its hedging
activities under SFAS No. 133,

“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,”

as amended by SFAS No. 138 and SFAS No. 149. These standards require
that all derivative instruments be reported in the consolidated financial statements at
fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are to be recorded each period in
earnings or on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in “Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss),” depending on the type of hedged transaction and whether
the derivative is designated and effective as part of a hedged transaction. Gains or
losses on derivative instruments reported in “Accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss)” must be reclassified as earnings in the period in which earnings are affected
by the underlying hedged item and the ineffective portion of all hedges must be recognized
in earnings in the current period.

Snap-on uses derivative instruments
to manage well-defined interest rate and foreign currency exposures. Snap-on does not use
derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. The criteria used to determine
if hedge accounting treatment is appropriate are (i) the designation of the hedge to an
underlying exposure, (ii) whether or not overall risk is being reduced, and (iii) if there
is a correlation between the value of the derivative instrument and the underlying
obligation. On the date a derivative contract is entered into, Snap-on designates the
derivative as either a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, a hedge of a net investment in
a foreign operation, or a natural hedging instrument whose change in fair value is
recognized as an economic hedge against changes in the values of the hedged item.

Foreign Currency Derivative
Instruments

: Snap-on has operations in a number of countries that have transactions
outside their functional currencies and, as a result, is exposed to changes in foreign
currency exchange rates. In addition, Snap-on hedges the anticipated repayment of
intercompany loans to foreign subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies. Snap-on
manages most of these exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows for netting of
certain exposures to take advantage of natural offsets. Forward exchange contracts are
used to hedge the net exposures. Gains or losses on net foreign currency hedges are
intended to offset losses or gains on the underlying net exposures in an effort to reduce
the earnings volatility resulting from fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates.

At January 1, 2005, Snap-on had net
outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts to sell $11.3 million comprised of buy
contracts of $78.0 million in Swedish kronor, $19.3 million in Canadian dollars, $15.2
million in Australian dollars, $1.9 million in Taiwan dollars and $1.5 million in Swiss
francs and sell contracts of $73.3 million in euros, $29.7 million in British pounds,
$12.3 million in Singapore dollars, $3.2 million in Danish kronor, $2.9 million in
Hungarian forints, $2.1 million in Norwegian kroner, $1.0 million in Japanese yen, $0.8
million in Polish zlotys, $0.6 million in Mexican pesos, $0.6 million in New Zealand
dollars and $0.7 million in other currencies. At January 3, 2004, Snap-on had net
outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts to sell $84.0 million comprised of buy
contracts of $72.8 million in Swedish kronor, $3.2 million in Taiwan dollars and $0.6
million in other currencies and sell contracts of $72.8 million in euros, $43.3 million in
British pounds, $11.8 million in Canadian dollars, $10.2 million in Japanese yen, $8.9
million in Singapore dollars, $5.7 million in Danish kronor, $4.3 million in Norwegian
kroner, $2.3 million in Mexican pesos and $1.3 million in Australian dollars.

The majority of Snap-on’s
forward exchange contracts are not designated as hedges under SFAS No. 133. The fair value
changes of these contracts are reported in earnings as foreign exchange gain or loss,
which is included in “Other income (expense) – net” on the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Forward exchange contracts that qualify for hedge
accounting treatment are accounted for as cash flow hedges where the effective portion of
the changes in fair value of the derivative is recorded in “Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss).” When the hedged item is realized in income, the gain or
loss included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” is reclassified
to income in the same financial statement caption as the hedged item. For all cash flow
hedges qualifying for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, the net accumulated derivative
gain at January 1, 2005, was $0.5 million. At January 1, 2005, the maximum maturity date
of any cash flow hedge was approximately 14 months. During the next 12 months, Snap-on
expects to reclassify into earnings net gains from “Accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss)” of approximately $0.4 million after tax at the time the underlying
hedged transactions are realized. The ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the
cash flow hedges are reported in earnings as foreign exchange gain or loss, which is
included in “Other income (expense) – net” and which were not material.


Non-Derivative Instruments
Designated in Hedging Relationships:

Snap-on uses non-U.S. dollar financing
transactions as net investment hedges of long-term investments in the corresponding
foreign currency. Hedges that meet the effectiveness requirements are accounted for under
net investment hedging rules. The effective portion of the net investment hedge of a
foreign operation is recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)”
as a cumulative translation adjustment. When applicable, the ineffective portion of the
net investment hedge is recorded in earnings as foreign exchange gain or loss, which is
included in “Other income (expense) – net” and which were not material. At
January 1, 2005, net losses of $0.4 million arising from effective hedges of net
investments have been reflected in the cumulative translation adjustment account as a
component of “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).”

Interest Rate Swap Agreements:

Snap-on enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest costs and risks
associated with changing interest rates. Interest rate swap agreements are accounted for
as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges. The differentials paid or received on
interest rate swap agreements are recognized as adjustments to interest expense. For fair
value hedges, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative is
recorded in “Long-term debt” on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets,
while any ineffective portion is recorded as an adjustment to interest expense. For cash
flow hedges, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative is
recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” while any
ineffective portion is recorded as an adjustment to interest expense. The notional amount
of interest rate swaps was $75 million at January 1, 2005, and included $50 million of
fair value hedges and $25 million of cash flow hedges. The notional amount of interest
rate swaps was $75 million at both January 1, 2005, and January 3, 2004, and included $50
million of fair value hedges and $25 million of cash flow hedges.

In June 2003, Snap-on received
proceeds of $5.1 million for the termination of a $25 million interest rate swap that was
a fair value hedge for a portion of its $200 million, 6.25% long-term notes. The $5.1
million is being amortized to income using the effective interest rate method over the
remaining life of the notes, which mature on August 15, 2011. At the same time, Snap-on
entered into a new $25 million interest rate swap to hedge that same portion of these
notes.

For all cash flow hedges qualifying
for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, the net accumulated derivative loss at January 1,
2005, was $0.2 million, after tax, and is reflected in “Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss).” Changes in the fair value of derivative financial
instruments qualifying for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, are reflected as
derivative assets or liabilities with the corresponding gains or losses reflected in
earnings in the period of change. An offsetting gain or loss is also reflected in earnings
based upon the changes of the fair value of the debt instrument being hedged. For all fair
value hedges qualifying for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, the net accumulated
derivative loss at January 1, 2005, was $1.0 million. At January 1, 2005, the maximum
maturity date of any cash flow hedge and fair value hedge was approximately three months
and seven years, respectively. During the next 12 months, Snap-on expects to reclassify
into earnings net losses from “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” of
approximately $0.2 million after tax at the time the underlying hedged transactions are
realized. During the year ended January 1, 2005, cash flow hedge and fair value hedge
ineffectiveness was not material.

Fair Value of Financial
Instruments:

SFAS No. 107,

“Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
Instruments,”

requires Snap-on to disclose the fair value of financial
instruments for both on- and off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities for which it is
practicable to estimate that value. The following methods and assumptions were used in
estimating the fair value of financial instruments:

Installment Contracts: A discounted
cash flow analysis was performed over the average life of a contract using a discount rate
currently available to Snap-on adjusted for credit quality, cost and profit factors. As of
January 1, 2005, and January 3, 2004, the fair value was approximately $117 million and
$114 million, versus a book value of $101.9 million and $97.0 million.

Long-term Debt: The fair value of
long-term debt, including current maturities, was estimated using a discounted cash flow
analysis based on quoted market rates for similar instruments. As of January 1, 2005, and
January 3, 2004, the fair value was approximately $323 million and $330 million, versus a
book value of $303.5 million and $303.3 million.

All Other Financial Instruments: The
carrying amounts of all cash equivalents, interest rate swaps and forward exchange
contracts approximate fair value based upon quoted market prices or discounted cash flows.
The fair value of trade accounts receivables, accounts payable and other financial
instruments approximates carrying value due to their short-term nature.

A valuation allowance totaling $43.5
million, $37.8 million and $28.7 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002 has been established for
deferred income tax benefits related to certain subsidiary loss carryforwards that may not
be realized. Approximately $4 million of the increase in the valuation allowance and the
net operating losses for 2004 is attributable to the impact of foreign currency exchange.
Realization of the net deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable
income prior to their expiration. Although realization is not assured, management believes
it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be realized. The amount of
the net deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near
term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced.

The undistributed earnings of all
non-U.S. subsidiaries totaled $241.2 million, $214.7 million and $180.0 million at the end
of 2004, 2003 and 2002. Snap-on has not provided any deferred taxes on these undistributed
earnings as it considers the undistributed earnings to be permanently invested. On October
22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act (“the AJCA”) was signed into law. The
AJCA includes a deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated back to
the United States, as defined in the AJCA. The company may elect to apply this provision
to qualifying earnings repatriations in 2005. The company has started an evaluation of the
effects of the repatriation provision; however, the company does not expect to be able to
complete this evaluation until after Congress or the Treasury Department provides
additional clarifying language on key elements of the provision. The company expects to
complete its evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision within a reasonable
period of time following the publication of the additional clarifying language. The range
of possible amounts that the company is considering for repatriation under this provision
is between zero and $200 million. The related potential range of income tax is between
zero and $10 million.


Note 13: Pension Plans

Snap-on has several non-contributory
defined benefit pension plans covering most U.S. employees and certain employees in
foreign countries. Snap-on also has foreign contributory defined benefit pension plans
covering certain foreign employees. Retirement benefits are generally provided based on
employees’ years of service and average earnings or stated amounts for years of
service. Normal retirement age is 65, with provisions for earlier retirement. Snap-on
recognizes retirement plan expenses in accordance with SFAS No. 87,

“Employers’ Accounting for Pensions.”

Snap-on’s domestic pension plans
have a long-term investment horizon and a total return strategy that emphasizes a capital
growth objective. The long-term investment performance objective for Snap-on’s
domestic plan assets is to achieve net of expense returns that meet or exceed the 8.5%
domestic long-term rate-of-return-on-assets assumption used for reporting purposes.

The basis for determining the overall
expected long-term rate-of-return-on-assets assumption applies a nominal returns
forecasting method. For each asset class, future returns are estimated by identifying the
premium of riskier asset classes over lower risk alternatives. The methodology constructs
expected returns using a “building block” approach to the individual components
of total return. These forecasts are stated in both nominal and real (after inflation)
terms. This process first considers the long-term historical return premium based on the
longest set of data available for each asset class. These premiums are then adjusted based
on current relative valuation levels and macro-economic conditions.


For risk and correlation assumptions,
the actual experience for each asset class is reviewed for the longest time period
available. Expected relationships for a 10 to 20 year time horizon are determined based
upon historical results, with adjustments made for material changes. For example, expected
correlations for international equities relative to U.S. equities are higher than
historical averages due to the integration of the global economy.

Investments are broadly diversified
to attempt to minimize the risk of large losses. Since asset allocation is a key
determinant of expected investment returns, assets are periodically rebalanced to the
targeted allocation to correct significant deviations from the asset allocation policy
that are caused by market fluctuations and cash flows.

Snap-on has adopted a strategic asset
allocation policy that is intended to offer the highest probability of achieving the
long-term investment return goal with the lowest level of risk. Asset/liability studies
are conducted periodically to determine if any revisions to the strategic asset allocation
policy are indicated.

Snap-on’s foreign pension
plans’ weighted-average asset allocation by asset category and fair value of plan
assets at December 31, 2004, are as follows:

Snap-on’s primary investment
objective for its foreign pension plan assets is to meet the projected obligations to the
beneficiaries over a long period of time, and to do so in a manner that is consistent with
the company’s risk tolerance. The foreign asset allocation policies consider the
company’s financial strength and long-term asset class risk/return expectations since
the obligations are long term in nature. The assets are well diversified and are managed
locally by professional investment firms.

The expected long-term rate of return
on foreign plan assets reflects management’s expectations of long-term average rates
of return on funds invested to provide benefits included in the projected benefit
obligations. The expected return is based on the outlook for inflation, fixed income
returns and equity returns, while also considering historical returns, asset allocation
and investment strategy.

Snap-on has several 401(k) plans
covering certain U.S. employees. Snap-on’s employer match to the 401(k) plans is made
in Snap-on common stock, which is funded through the Grantor Stock Trust or with cash
contributions. Employees have the opportunity to diversify the employer match made in
Snap-on common stock once they have three years of service with Snap-on. For 2004, 2003
and 2002, Snap-on recognized $2.3 million, $12.4 million and $2.0 million of expense
related to its 401(k) plans. Included in Snap-on’s 2003 401(k) plan expense is $10.2
million related to the closure of the two U.S. hand-tool facilities, which is disclosed in
Note 4 above.

Note 14: Retiree Health
Care

Snap-on provides certain health care
benefits for most retired U.S. employees. The majority of Snap-on’s U.S. employees
become eligible for those benefits if they reach early retirement age while working for
Snap-on; however, the age and service requirements for eligibility under the plans have
been increased for certain employees hired on and after specified dates since 1992.
Generally, most plans pay stated percentages of covered expenses after a deductible is
met. There are several plan designs, with more recent retirees being covered under a
comprehensive major medical plan. In determining benefits, the plans take into
consideration payments by Medicare and other insurance coverage.

For employees retiring under the
comprehensive major medical plans, retiree contributions are required, and these plans
contain provisions allowing for benefit and coverage changes. The plans require retirees
to contribute either the full cost of the coverage or amounts estimated to exceed a capped
per-retiree annual cost commitment by Snap-on. Most employees hired since 1994 are
required to pay the full cost. Snap-on does not fund the retiree health care plans.

Snap-on recognizes postretirement
health care expense in accordance with SFAS No. 106,

“Employers’ Accounting
for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions.”

The actuarial calculation assumes a
health care cost trend rate of 9.0% in 2004, decreasing gradually to 6.0% in 2009 and
thereafter. As of January 1, 2005, a one-percentage-point increase in the health care cost
trend rate for future years would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation by $1.1 million and the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost
components by $0.1 million. Conversely, a one-percentage-point decrease in the health care
cost trend rate for future years would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation by $1.0 million and the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost
components by $0.1 million.

On December 8, 2003, the Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Act”) was
signed into law. The Act includes a prescription drug benefit under Medicare Part D as
well as a federal subsidy beginning in 2006 to sponsors of retiree health care plans that
provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent, as defined in the Act, to
Medicare Part D. In accordance with FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) Financial
Accounting Standards (“FAS”) 106-1, “

Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act
of 2003

,” the company elected to defer the recognition of the effects of this Act
on the consolidated financial statements until authoritative guidance on the federal
subsidy was issued by the FASB. The final FASB guidance, FSP FAS 106-2, was issued May 19,
2004, and the company adopted the guidance prospectively in the third quarter of 2004.
Based on the adoption of this guidance the company believes its retiree health care plans
are at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D and eligible for the federal
subsidy. The cash flow the company expects to receive from the subsidy, when it becomes
effective in 2006, is estimated to be approximately $0.1 million annually. Treating the
provision of the Act as an actuarial experience gain as required by FSP FAS 106-2 resulted
in a decrease in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of approximately $1.2
million.

Note 15: Stock Options
and Purchase Plans

Snap-on has various stock award and
purchase plans for directors, officers and key employees.

2001 Incentive Stock and Awards
Plan:

On April 27, 2001, Snap-on’s shareholders approved the 2001 Incentive Stock
and Awards Plan (“2001 Plan”). This plan reserved five million shares of common
stock for issuance, of which 1,741,681 shares were available for future grants at January
1, 2005. There are no shares available for future grants under the predecessor plan. Stock
options outstanding under the 2001 Plan and the predecessor plan have expiration dates
ranging from 2005 to 2014 and vesting periods ranging from immediate to three years. The
plans provide that options be granted at exercise prices equal to market value on the date
the option is granted. Stock option activity under the 2001 Plan and predecessor plans was

Snap-on grants shares of restricted
stock to certain executive officers and other key employees under the 2001 Plan. Vesting
of the shares of restricted stock will be dependent upon performance relative to
pre-defined goals for revenue growth and return on net assets employed before interest and
taxes for fiscal years 2004 through 2005. Based on Snap-on’s performance relative to
these goals, the recipient can earn up to 100% of the restricted stock award. For
performance achieved above a certain level, the recipient will earn performance units in
addition to the restricted stock, not to exceed 50% of the number of shares of restricted
stock initially awarded. In 2004, Snap-on granted 225,700 shares of restricted stock, of
which 223,100 are outstanding as of January 1, 2005. Performance units related to the 2004
award grant represent the right to receive in cash $33.45, which was the fair market value
of a share of Snap-on’s common stock on April 5, 2004. Based on the grant performance
criteria, Snap-on recorded $1.1 million of compensation expense in 2004 for the 2004 award
grant. In 2003, Snap-on granted 423,300 shares of restricted stock, of which 408,800 are
outstanding as of January 1, 2005. Performance units related to the 2003 award grant
represent the right to receive in cash $24.49, which was the fair market value of a share
of Snap-on’s common stock on March 14, 2003. Based on the grant performance criteria,
Snap-on was not required to recognize any compensation expense in 2004 or 2003 for the
2003 award grant.

As of January 1, 2005, and January 3,
2004, Snap-on also had 5,600 restricted stock grants outstanding under the 2001 Plan whose
vesting is not dependent on performance. Compensation expense is being recognized on a
straight-line basis over the respective service period. Snap-on recognized compensation
expense of $0.1 million in 2004 and $1.0 million in each of 2003 and 2002 related to
non-performance restricted shares.

As of January 1, 2005, Snap-on had
632,825 stock appreciation rights outstanding that were granted to certain key non-U.S.
employees with an average grant price of $30.31 per unit. These performance units expire
ten years after date of grant and have vesting periods that range from two to three years.
The performance units provide for the cash payment of the excess of the fair market value
of Snap-on’s common stock price on the date of exercise over the grant price, and
Snap-on accrues compensation expense based upon the current market price for its common
stock and the number of performance units outstanding. The performance share units have no
effect on dilutive shares or shares outstanding as any appreciation of Snap-on’s
common stock value over the grant price is paid in cash and not in common stock.

Directors’ Fee Plan:

Under the Directors’ Fee Plan, non-employee directors receive a mandatory minimum
of 50% and an elective maximum of up to 100% of their fees and retainer in shares of
Snap-on’s common stock. Directors may elect to defer receipt of all or part of these
shares. For 2004, 2003 and 2002, issuances under the Directors’ Fee Plan totaled
5,776 shares, 4,236 shares and 4,750 shares. Additionally, receipt of 10,668 shares,
11,130 shares and 11,865 shares was deferred in 2004, 2003 and 2002. At January 1, 2005,
shares reserved for issuance to directors under this plan totaled 163,187 shares.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan:

Employees of Snap-on are eligible to participate in an employee stock purchase plan. The
employee purchase price of the common stock is the lesser of the mean of the high and low
price of the stock on the beginning date (May 15) or ending date (May 14) of each plan
year. For 2004, 2003 and 2002, issuances under the employee stock ownership plan totaled
36,512 shares, 36,428 shares and 53,142 shares. At January 1, 2005, shares reserved for
issuance to employees under this plan totaled 417,774 and Snap-on held contributions of
approximately $0.7 million for the purchase of common stock by employees.

Dealer Stock Purchase Plan:

Franchised dealers are eligible to participate in a dealer stock purchase plan. The
dealer purchase price of the common stock is the lesser of the mean of the high and low
price of the stock on the beginning date (May 15) or ending date (May 14) of each plan
year. For 2004, 2003 and 2002, issuances under the dealer stock purchase plan totaled
49,290 shares, 49,923 shares and 76,381 shares. At January 1, 2005, shares reserved for
issuance to franchised dealers under this plan totaled 115,330 and Snap-on held dealer
contributions of approximately $1.0 million for the purchase of common stock. Compensation
expense for plan participants in 2004, 2003 and 2002 was not material.


Dividend Reinvestment and Stock
Purchase Plan:

Under this plan, participating shareholders may invest the cash
dividends from all or a portion of their common stock to buy additional shares. The
program also permits new investors and current shareholders to make additional
contributions. For 2004, 2003 and 2002, issuances under the dividend reinvestment and
stock purchase plan totaled 42,881 shares, 54,504 shares and 45,649 shares. At January 1,
2005, shares available for purchase under this plan totaled 1,665,252 shares.

SFAS No. 148 Disclosure:

Snap-on accounts for its stock-based employee compensation plans under the recognition
and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25. In accordance with the provisions of APB
Opinion No. 25, no compensation expense was recorded for stock options as all options
granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on
the measurement date. For restricted stock and stock appreciation rights awards, Snap-on
recorded compensation expense in the respective periods as appropriate.

The following table illustrates the
effect on net earnings and earnings per share as if Snap-on had applied the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to stock-based employee compensation using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

Note 16: Capital Stock

Snap-on has undertaken repurchases of
Snap-on common stock from time to time to offset dilution created by shares issued for
employee and dealer stock purchase plans, stock options, and other corporate purposes, as
well as to repurchase shares when market conditions are favorable. Snap-on repurchased
1,200,000 shares in 2004, following the repurchase of 450,000 shares in 2003 and 405,000
shares in 2002. As of the end of 2004, Snap-on has remaining availability to repurchase up
to an additional $127.9

million in common stock pursuant to the Board of
Directors’ authorizations. The purchase of Snap-on common stock is at the
company’s discretion, subject to prevailing financial and market conditions. In 2004,
Snap-on’s average common stock repurchase price was approximately $31.78 per share.

In August 1997, the Board of
Directors declared a dividend distribution of one preferred stock purchase right for each
share of Snap-on’s outstanding common stock. The rights are exercisable only if a
person or group acquires 15% or more of Snap-on’s common stock (“Acquiring
Person”) or publicly announces a tender offer to become an Acquiring Person. Each
right may then be exercised to purchase one one-hundred-and-fiftieth of a share of Series
A Junior Preferred Stock for $190, but if a person or group becomes an Acquiring Person,
then each right entitles the holder (other than an Acquiring Person) to acquire common
stock of Snap-on having a market value equivalent to two times the current purchase price.
If Snap-on is acquired in a merger or other business combination not approved by the Board
of Directors, then each holder of a right will be entitled to purchase common stock of the
surviving company having a market value equivalent to two times the current purchase
price. The effect of the rights is to cause ownership dilution to a person or group
attempting to acquire Snap-on without approval of Snap-on’s Board of Directors. The
rights expire on November 3, 2007, and may be redeemed by Snap-on at a price of $0.01 per
right under certain circumstances.


Snap-on created a Grantor Stock Trust
(“GST”) in 1998 that was subsequently amended. In conjunction with the formation
of the GST, Snap-on sold 7.1 million shares of treasury stock to the GST. The sale of
these shares had no net impact on shareholders’ equity or on Snap-on’s
Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The GST is a funding mechanism for certain benefit
programs and compensation arrangements, including the 2001 Incentive Stock and Awards Plan
and employee and dealer stock purchase plans. The Northern Trust Company, as trustee of
the GST, votes the common stock held by the GST based on the terms set forth in the GST
Agreement as amended. The GST is recorded as “Grantor stock trust at fair market
value” on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Shares owned by the GST are
accounted for as a reduction to shareholders’ equity until used in connection with
employee benefits. Each period, the shares owned by the GST are valued at the closing
market price, with corresponding changes in the GST balance reflected in additional
paid-in capital. At January 1, 2005, the GST held 4,278,561 shares of common stock.

Note 17: Commitments and
Contingencies

Snap-on leases facilities and office
equipment under non-cancelable operating leases that extend for varying amounts of time.
Snap-on’s future minimum lease commitments under these leases, net of sub-leases,

$32.3 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002.

Snap-on has $6.3 million of remaining
purchase commitments with one of its suppliers.

CIT and Snap-on have agreed to lend
funds to support SOC’s working capital requirements on a 50/50 basis, with a combined
maximum borrowing limit not to exceed $24 million. As of January 1, 2005, SOC owed both
Snap-on and CIT $0.5 million each pursuant to this agreement. Refer to Note 9 for
additional information.

Snap-on has credit risk exposure for
certain SOC-originated contracts with recourse provisions against Snap-on (primarily for
dealer van loans). At January 1, 2005, and January 3, 2004, $14.8 million and $14.1
million of loans, with terms ranging from six months to ten years, have a primary recourse
provision to Snap-on if the loans become more than 90 days past due. The asset value of
the collateral underlying these recourse loans would serve to mitigate Snap-on’s loss
in the event of default. The estimated fair value of the guarantees for all loan
originations with recourse as of January 1, 2005, was not material. Refer to Note 9 for
additional information.

Snap-on provides product warranties
for specific product lines and accrues for estimated future warranty cost in the period in
which the sale is recorded. Snap-on calculates its accrual requirements based on historic
warranty loss experience that is periodically adjusted for recent actual experience. The
following summarizes Snap-on’s product warranty accrual activity for fiscal-year 2004
and 2003:

Snap-on has government contracts with
federal departments and agencies, two of which were under audit by the U.S. General
Services Administration (“GSA”). The two contracts involve sales from March 1996
through February 2001, and sales since February 2001. The primary focus of these audits
concerns the interpretation and application of the price reduction provisions of these
contracts. On July 23, 2004, Snap-on reached an agreement with the U.S. Department of
Justice to resolve the government audit relating to two contracts with the GSA. Snap-on
agreed to settle the claims over the interpretation and application of the price reduction
and billing provisions of these two contracts for sales from March 1996 through the July
23, 2004, settlement date for $10.0 million. Snap-on incurred a pretax charge of $3.6
million, or $0.04 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2004 for costs not
previously accrued. Snap-on remitted the $10.0 million cash settlement to the U.S.
Department of Justice on August 5, 2004. On February 8, 2005, the GSA requested information from Snap-on
to evaluate possible administrative action.

Snap-on held more than 2,600 active
or pending patents as of year-end 2004, and Snap-on vigorously prosecutes its claims and
defends its patents in the ordinary course of business. In February 1998, Snap-on filed a
complaint alleging infringement of certain of Snap-on’s patents by Hunter Engineering
Company (“Hunter”). Hunter counterclaimed, alleging infringement of certain of
its patents and one trademark. In April 2002, the court set a trial date of October 14,
2002, for various patents. In May 2002, Hunter alleged infringement of two additional
patents for which a March 2003 trial date was later set. That trial date was vacated when
the case was consolidated with the above litigation in October 2002.

The October 14, 2002, trial date was
later postponed by the court to October 30, 2002. On October 22, 2002, a settlement was
reached between Snap-on and Hunter for all of the above-mentioned matters, and in the
fourth quarter of 2002, a final, comprehensive agreement was reached in Snap-on’s
favor for $10.8 million, net of related legal expenses incurred in the year.

In 1996, Snap-on filed a complaint
against SPX Corporation (“SPX”) alleging infringement of Snap-on’s patents
and asserting claims relating to SPX’s hiring of the former president of Sun
Electric, a subsidiary of Snap-on acquired in 1992. SPX filed a counterclaim alleging
infringement of certain SPX patents. These patents, which related to engine analyzer
products first introduced in the 1980s, have expired. As part of a binding arbitration
process in 2001, the arbitrator ruled in favor of SPX and Snap-on was ordered to pay $44
million in damages to SPX. This obligation was paid in January 2002 and was recorded in
operating expenses in 2001.

Snap-on is also involved in various legal
matters, including those where claimants have asserted class representation on behalf of
franchised dealers, that are being defended and handled in the ordinary course of
business. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of these other legal
matters, management believes that the results will not have a material
adverse effect on Snap-on’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Note 18: Segments

Snap-on’s business segments are
based on the organization structure used by management for making operating and investment
decisions and for assessing performance. Snap-on’s reportable business segments
include: (i) the Snap-on Dealer Group; (ii) the Commercial and Industrial Group; (iii) the
Diagnostics and Information Group; and (iv) Financial Services. The Snap-on Dealer Group
consists of Snap-on’s business operations serving the worldwide franchised dealer van
channel. The Commercial and Industrial Group consists of the business operations providing
tools and equipment products and equipment repair services to a broad range of industrial
and commercial customers worldwide through direct, distributor and other non-franchised
distribution channels. The Diagnostics and Information Group consists of the business
operations providing diagnostics equipment, vehicle service information, business
management systems and other solutions for vehicle service to customers in the worldwide
vehicle service and repair marketplace. Financial Services is a new business segment,
beginning in fiscal 2004, consisting of the business operations of SOC, a consolidated
50%-owned joint venture between Snap-on and CIT, and Snap-on’s wholly owned finance
subsidiaries in those international markets where Snap-on has dealer operations.
Prior-year segment disclosures have not been restated to include the Financial Services
segment due to the prospective adoption of FIN No. 46R. See Notes 2 and 9 for further
discussion of SOC and the company’s adoption of FIN No. 46R.

During the third quarter of 2004,
Snap-on realigned certain of its business units within its reportable business segments.
The primary realignments included Snap-on’s Equipment Solutions (facilitation)
business moving from the Commercial and Industrial Group to the Diagnostics and
Information Group, and Snap-on’s EquiServ (equipment services) business moving from
the Diagnostics and Information Group to the Commercial and Industrial Group. Prior-year
financial data by segment has been restated to reflect these reportable business segment
realignments.

Snap-on evaluates the performance of
its operating segments based on segment revenues and operating earnings. Segment revenues
are defined as total segment revenues, including both external customer revenue and
intersegment revenue. Segment operating earnings are defined as revenues less cost of
goods sold and operating expenses. Snap-on accounts for intersegment sales and transfers
based primarily on standard costs with reasonable mark-ups established between the
segments. Snap-on allocates shared services expenses to those segments that utilize the
services based on a percentage of either cost of goods sold or segment revenues, as
appropriate.

Neither Snap-on nor any of its
segments, except Financial Services, depend on any single customer, small group of
customers or government for more than 10% of its revenues. As a result of SOC’s
relationship with CIT, Snap-on’s Financial Services business segment depends on CIT
for more than 10% of its revenues. Refer to Note 9 for additional information.


Financial data by segment is as
follows:

The following is a reconciliation of
Snap-on’s segment operating earnings to earnings before income taxes:



Geographic Regions:  Geographic data
is as follows:

*  Revenue is attributed to countries
based on the origin of the sale.

**  Long-lived assets consist of
Property and equipment — net plus Goodwill plus Other intangibles — net.

Products and Services: Snap-on
derives net sales from a broad line of products and complementary services that are
grouped into two categories: tools and equipment. The tools category is comprised of
Snap-on’s hand tools, power tools, tool storage units, saws, and cutting and pruning
tools product offerings. The equipment category is comprised of vehicle service
diagnostics equipment, vehicle service equipment, vehicle service information, business
management systems and equipment repair service product offerings. Snap-on also derives
revenue from financing its products through SOC and through its wholly owned finance
subsidiaries. Snap-on utilizes various financing programs to facilitate the sales of its
products. Refer to Notes 2 and 9 for additional information. Further product line
information is not presented, as it is not practicable to do so. The following table shows
the consolidated net sales of these product groups in the last three years:

Beginning in 2004, in conjunction
with the consolidation of SOC, financial services revenue consists of SOC's sales of
originated contracts and service fee income, as well as installment contract revenue and
dealer loan  receivable revenue derived from SOC and Snap-on's wholly owned international
finance operations.  As  Snap-on consolidated SOC on a prospective basis, previously
issued financial statements have not been restated to reflect the consolidation of SOC.
Refer to Notes 2 and 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for  further  discussion
of the consolidation of SOC.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors
and Shareholders of

Snap-on Incorporated

We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of Snap-on Incorporated and subsidiaries (the
“Company”) as of January 1, 2005 and January 3, 2004, and the related
consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 1, 2005. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Snap-on Incorporated and subsidiaries as of January 1, 2005 and January 3, 2004, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended January 1, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
January 1, 2005, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission and our report dated February 24, 2005, expressed an unqualified opinion on
management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

As discussed in Note 2 to the
consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation 46R,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

, and, accordingly, began consolidating
Snap-on Credit LLC as of January 4, 2004, and, as discussed in Note 18 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company changed its reportable segments in 2004.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors
and Shareholders of

Snap-on Incorporated

We have audited management’s
assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting, that Snap-on Incorporated and subsidiaries (the “Company”)
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2005,
based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The
Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing
similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations
of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may
not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are
subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s
assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of January 1, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of January 1, 2005, based on the criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended January 1, 2005 of the
Company and our report dated February 24, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial statements and includes an explanatory paragraph relating to the adoption of
FASB Interpretation 46R and the change in reportable segments.
