diagnostics and vehicle service shop equipment by offering training programs for its
customers, primarily focusing on the technologies and the application of specific products
developed and marketed by Snap-on.

Tools and equipment are marketed

Snap-on also derives income from
financing its products through a 50%-owned financial services joint venture and through
Snap-on’s wholly owned credit subsidiaries. Snap-on utilizes various financing
programs to facilitate the sales of its products.

Snap-on established a joint venture
in January 1999 with Newcourt Financial USA Inc., now The CIT Group, Inc.
(“CIT”). The joint venture, Snap-on Credit LLC (“SOC”), is a 50%-owned
joint venture that provides financial services to Snap-on’s U.S. dealer and customer
network and to Snap-on’s industrial and other customers. Additional information about
SOC is provided in Note 9 entitled “Snap-on Credit LLC Joint Venture” on pages
47 and 48 of Snap-on’s 2003 Annual Report, incorporated herein by reference.

SOC originates loans primarily in
three ways. First, extended-term contracts are offered to technicians to enable them to
purchase tools and equipment on an extended-term payment plan, generally with an average
term of 32 months. Second, lease financing is offered to shop owners and managers, both
independent and national chains, who purchase equipment items. The duration of lease
contracts is often two to five years. Third, financing options are also available to
dealers to meet a number of financing needs, including van and truck leases, working
capital loans, and loans to enable new dealers to fund the purchase of the franchise. The
duration of these contracts can be up to 10 years. The above contracts are generally
secured by the underlying tools or equipment financed and other dealer assets.

Currently, the majority of finance
income is derived from the vehicle service industry in North America. Internationally,
Snap-on continues to provide financing directly to its dealer and customer networks
through its wholly owned credit subsidiaries.


Sales and Distribution

Snap-on markets and distributes its
products and related services principally to professional

tool and
equipment users around the world. The two largest market sectors are the vehicle service
and repair sector and the industrial sector.

Vehicle Service and
Repair Sector

The vehicle service and repair sector
has three main customer groups: professional technicians who purchase tools and equipment
for themselves; vehicle service and repair shop owners and managers — including
independent shops, national chains and automotive dealerships — who purchase
equipment for use by multiple technicians within a service or repair facility; and vehicle
manufacturers.

Snap-on provides innovative tool and
equipment solutions, as well as technical sales support and training, to meet
technicians’ evolving needs. Snap-on’s franchised dealer van distribution system
offers technicians the convenience of purchasing quality tools with minimal disruption of
their work routine. Snap-on also provides owners and managers of shops, where technicians
work, with tools, diagnostics equipment, repair and service information, and shop
management products. Snap-on provides vehicle manufacturers with products and services
including tools, consulting services and facilitation services. Snap-on’s
facilitation services include product procurement, distribution and administrative support
to customers for their dealership equipment programs.

Major challenges for Snap-on and the
vehicle service and repair sector include the increasing rate of technological change
within motor vehicles and the resulting impact on the businesses of both our suppliers and
customers that is necessitated by such change. Snap-on believes it is a meaningful
participant in the market sector for vehicle service and repair.

Industrial Sector

Snap-on markets its products to a
wide variety of industrial customers including industrial maintenance and repair
operations; manufacturing and assembly facilities; government facilities; schools; and
original equipment manufacturers that require instrumentation or service tools and
equipment for their products.

Major challenges in the industrial
sector include a highly competitive, cost-conscious environment, and a trend toward
customers making all of their tool purchases through one integrated supplier. Snap-on
believes it is a meaningful participant in the market sector for industrial tools and
equipment.

Distribution Channels

Snap-on serves customers primarily
through three channels of distribution: the mobile dealer van channel
(“dealers”), including the company’s technical representatives (“tech
rep”) organization, company direct sales and distributors. The following discussion
represents Snap-on’s general approach in each channel, and is not intended to be
all-inclusive.

Dealers and Technical
Representatives

In the United States, the majority of
sales to the vehicle service and repair sector are conducted through Snap-on’s
dealers and its tech rep organization. Snap-on’s dealers primarily cover vehicle
service technicians and vehicle service shop owners, providing weekly contact at the
customer’s place of business. Dealers’ sales are concentrated in hand and power
tools, tool storage units and small diagnostic and shop equipment, which can easily be
transported in a van and demonstrated during a brief sales call. Dealers purchase
Snap-on’s products at a discount from suggested retail prices and resell them at
prices established by the dealer. Although some dealers have sales areas defined by other
methods, most

U.S. dealers are provided a list of places of business
that serves as the basis of the dealer’s sales route.

Since 1991, new U.S. dealers, and a
majority of the pre-1991 U.S. dealers, have been enrolled as franchisees of Snap-on.
Snap-on also provides certain franchisees the opportunity to add vans to their franchise
or to add a limited number of franchises through the company’s “More Feet on the
Street” dealer expansion and enhancement initiative launched nationally in 2000.
Snap-on charges nominal initial and ongoing monthly license fees. Through SOC, financial
assistance is available to franchised dealers, which includes van and truck leases,
working capital loans, and loans to enable new dealers to fund the purchase of the
franchise. At year-end 2003, approximately 95% or 4,032 of U.S. dealers were enrolled as
franchisees, or employed by franchisees, versus approximately 94% or 3,945 at year-end
2002.


Snap-on has replicated its U.S.
dealer van method of distribution in certain other countries, including Australia, Canada,
Germany, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. In many of
these markets, as in the United States, purchase decisions are generally made or
influenced by professional vehicle service technicians and shop owners. Snap-on markets
products in certain other countries through its subsidiary, Snap-on Tools International,
Ltd., which sells to foreign distributors under license or contract with Snap-on.

Snap-on supports its dealers with an
extensive field organization of branch offices, sales and field managers, and service and
distribution centers. Snap-on also provides sales and business training, customer and
dealer financing programs through SOC and through its wholly owned international credit
operations, and marketing and product promotion programs designed to strengthen dealer
sales. In the United States and Canada, the National Dealer Advisory Council and the
Snap-on Tools Canadian Dealer Advisory Council, both of which are composed of dealers that
are elected by dealers, assist Snap-on in identifying and implementing enhancements to the
franchise program.

In the United States, dealers are
supported by the tech rep sales force. Tech reps are specialists who demonstrate and sell
higher-price-point diagnostics and shop equipment, as well as vehicle service shop
management information systems. Tech reps work independently and with dealers to identify
and generate sales leads among vehicle service shop owners and managers. Tech reps are
Snap-on employees who are compensated primarily on the basis of commission; a dealer
receives a brokerage fee from certain sales made by the tech reps to the dealer’s
customers. Most products sold through the dealer and tech rep organization are sold under
the

Snap-on

,

Blue-Point, Sun

and

ShopKey

brand names.

Company Direct Sales

In the United States, a growing
proportion of shop equipment sales under the

Sun, John Bean, Wheeltronic, White and
Blackhawk

brands

and information products under the

Mitchell1

brand

are made by direct sales force that has responsibility for national accounts. As the
vehicle service and repair sector consolidates (with more business conducted by national
chains, automotive dealerships and franchised service centers), these larger organizations
can be serviced most effectively by sales people who can demonstrate and sell the full
line of equipment and diagnostic products and services. Snap-on also sells these products
and services directly to vehicle manufacturers.

To enhance its existing direct sales
distribution network, in 2003, the company formed the Technical Automotive Group, a
factory-direct sales force aimed at distributing equipment to repair service operations.

John Bean, White and Blackhawk

brands are sold directly to end customers primarily
through sales leads generated from dealers and Tech reps.

Snap-on

brand tools and
equipment are marketed to industrial and governmental customers in the United States
through both industrial sales representatives, who are employees, and independent
industrial distributors. In most markets outside the United States, industrial sales are
conducted through independent distributors. The sales representatives focus on industrial
customers whose main purchase criteria are quality and service. At the end of 2003,
Snap-on had industrial sales representatives in the United States, Australia, Canada,
Japan, Mexico, Puerto Rico and some European countries, with the United States
representing the majority of Snap-on’s total industrial sales.

Distributors

Sales of certain tools and equipment
are made through independent vehicle service and industrial distributors who purchase the
items from Snap-on and resell them to the end users. Products supplied by Bahco, under the

Bahco, Fish and Hook

(design)

, Belzer, Pradines

and

Lindstrom

brands
and trade names, for example, are sold through distributors in Europe, North and South
America, Asia and certain other parts of the world. Wheel service and other vehicle
service equipment are sold through distributors primarily under brands including

Hofmann,

and

Kansas Jack

. Hand tools under the

Irimo, Palmera

and

Acesa

brands and power tools under the

Sioux

brand, are differentiated from
those products sold through the dealer, tech rep and direct sales channels.

Sun

-branded equipment is marketed through distributors in South America and
Asia

,

and through both a direct sales force and distributors in
Europe.


E-commerce

Snap-on’s e-commerce development
initiatives allow Snap-on to combine the capabilities of the Internet with Snap-on’s
existing brand sales and distribution strengths and to reach new and under-served customer
segments. Snap-on began selling

Snap-on

brand products through the Internet in 2000
as part of its “Store Without Walls” vision, which offers both current and
prospective customers online, around-the-clock access to purchase

Snap-on

and

Blue-Point

products through its public Website at

www.snapon.com

. The site
features an online catalog containing nearly 14,000 products, including

Snap-on

hand tools, power tools, tool storage units and diagnostic equipment available to
consumers and professionals in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and
Australia. At the end of 2003, Snap-on had more than 165,000 registered users, including
approximately 19,000 industrial accounts. In addition to its public Website, Snap-on began
to host individual dealer Websites in 2002 to help franchised dealers extend their
industry-leading service. These initiatives, as well as other system enhancement
initiatives that are currently under development, are designed to further leverage the
one-on-one relationships and service Snap-on has with its current and prospective
customers. Through the development of its business-to-business and business-to-consumer
capabilities, Snap-on and its dealers are enhancing communications with customers on a
real-time, 24-hour, 7-days a week basis.

Competition

Snap-on competes on the basis of its
product quality and performance, service, brand awareness and technological innovation.
While no single company competes with Snap-on across all of its product lines and
distribution channels, various companies compete in one or more product categories and/or
distribution channels.

Snap-on believes that it is a leading
manufacturer and distributor of professional tools and equipment, offering the broadest
line of these products to the vehicle service industry. The major competitors selling to
professional technicians in the vehicle service and repair sector through the mobile van
channel include MAC Tools (The Stanley Works) and Matco (Danaher Corporation). Snap-on
also competes with companies that sell through non-mobile van distributors including Facom
(Fimalac), Sears, Roebuck and Co. and The Stanley Works. Within the power tools category,
Snap-on’s major competitors include Atlas Copco, Ingersoll-Rand, Cooper Industries,
Inc., Black & Decker Corporation, Bosch, and Makita Corporation. In the industrial
sector, major competitors include Armstrong (Danaher Corporation), Cooper Industries, Inc.
and Proto (The Stanley Works). The major competitors selling diagnostics

and shop equipment to shop owners and managers in the vehicle service and
repair sector include Corghi S.p.A., Facom (Fimalac), Hennessy (Danaher Corporation),
Hunter Engineering, OTC and Robinair (SPX Corporation), and Rotary and Chief Automotive
(Dover Corporation).

Research and Engineering

Research and engineering expenses
totaled $59.8 million, $57.1 million and $54.6 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001.

Raw Materials and
Purchased Product

Snap-on’s supply of raw
materials (including various grades and alloys of steel bars and sheets) and purchased
components are readily available from numerous suppliers.

Approximately 77% of 2003
consolidated net sales consisted of products manufactured by Snap-on, while the remaining
23% consisted of products purchased from outside suppliers. No single supplier’s
products accounted for a material portion of 2003 consolidated net sales.

Patents, Trademarks and
Other Intellectual Property

Snap-on vigorously pursues and relies
on patent protection to protect its intellectual property and its position in its markets.
As of January 3, 2004, Snap-on and its subsidiaries held almost 1,000 active and pending
patents in the United States and over 2,000 active and pending patents outside of the
United States. No sales relating to any single patent represented a material portion of
Snap-on’s revenues in 2003 or 2002.


Examples of products that have
features or designs that benefit from patent protection include wheel alignment systems,
wheel balancers, sealed ratchets, electronic torque instruments, ratcheting screwdrivers,
emissions-sensing devices, diagnostic equipment, and air conditioning equipment.

Much of the technology used in the
manufacture of vehicle service tools and equipment is in the public domain. Snap-on relies
primarily on trade secret protection to protect proprietary processes used in
manufacturing. Methods and processes are patented when appropriate. Copyright protection
is also utilized when appropriate.

Trademarks used by Snap-on are of
continuing importance to Snap-on in the marketplace. Trademarks have been registered in
the United States and more than 100 other countries, and additional applications for
trademark registrations are pending. Snap-on vigorously polices proper use of its
trademarks. Snap-on’s right to manufacture and sell certain products is dependent
upon licenses from others; however, these products under license do not represent a
material portion of Snap-on’s sales.

Domain names have become a valuable
corporate asset for companies around the world, including Snap-on. Domain names often
contain a trademark or service mark or even a corporate name and are often considered
intellectual property. The recognition and value of the Snap-on name, trademark, and
domain name are core strengths of the company. Snap-on has undertaken an initiative to
centralize the administration of all domestic and international domain names, including
all registrations and renewals. Snap-on also monitors new developments in top-level
domains and country-code domains in order to preserve Snap-on’s right to relevant
domain names.

Working Capital

Because most of Snap-on’s
business is not seasonal and its inventory needs are relatively constant, no unusual
working capital needs arise during the year.

Snap-on’s financial condition
and use of working capital are discussed in “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis,” on pages 28 through 31 of Snap-on’s 2003 Annual Report, incorporated
herein by reference.

Snap-on does not depend on any single
customer, small group of customers or government for any material part of its sales, and
has no significant backlog of orders.

Environment

Snap-on is subject to various
environmental laws, ordinances, regulations, and other requirements of government
authorities in the United States and other nations. At Snap-on, these environmental
liabilities are managed, controlled, and minimized through the Snap-on Environmental,
Hygiene, and Safety Management System (“EH & SMS”), which is applied
worldwide. The system is based upon continual improvement and world-class performance and
is certified to ISO 14001:1996 and OHSAS 18001:1999, verified through Det Norske Veritas
(DNV) Certification, Inc.

Snap-on complies with applicable
environmental control requirements in its operations. Expenditures on environmental
matters through EH & SMS have not had, and Snap-on does not for the foreseeable future
expect them to have, a material effect upon Snap-on’s capital expenditures, earnings
or competitive position.

Employees

At the end of February 2004, Snap-on
employed approximately 12,400 people compared to approximately 12,900 people at the end of
February 2003. The year-over-year reduction primarily reflects the impact of
restructuring-related eliminations.

Approximately 4,400 employees, or 35%
of Snap-on’s worldwide workforce, are represented by unions and / or covered under
collective bargaining agreements. Of these, approximately 2,900 employees are covered
under an agreement expiring in 2004 including approximately 400 covered employees affected
by the planned closure of two of the company’s domestic hand tool plants in 2004. In
recent years, Snap-on has not experienced any significant work slow-downs, stoppages or
other labor disruptions.


The number of covered union employees
whose contracts expire within the next five years is approximately 2,900 in 2004, 800 in
2005, 500 in 2006, 0 in 2007 and 200 in 2008.

There can be no assurance that future
contracts with Snap-on’s unions will be renegotiated upon terms acceptable to
Snap-on.

Item 2: Properties

Snap-on maintains both leased and
owned manufacturing, warehouse, distribution and office facilities throughout the world.
Snap-on believes that its facilities currently in use are suitable and have adequate
capacity to meet its present and foreseeable future demand. Snap-on’s facilities in
the United States occupy approximately 3.9 million square feet, of which 76% is owned,
including its corporate and general offices located in Pleasant Prairie and Kenosha,
Wisconsin. Snap-on’s facilities outside the United States contain approximately 4.1
million square feet, of which 66% is owned. Several of Snap-on’s facilities are
leased through operating lease agreements. For information on operating leases, see Note
17 entitled “Commitments and Contingencies” on pages 57 and 58 of Snap-on’s
2003 Annual Report, incorporated herein by reference. Snap-on management continually
monitors the company’s capacity needs and makes adjustments as dictated by market and
other conditions.

The following table provides
information about each of Snap-on’s principal manufacturing locations and
distribution centers (exceeding 50,000 square feet) as of January 3, 2004. The company
announced the closing of the Mt. Carmel, Illinois and Kenosha, Wisconsin, manufacturing
facilities, which it expects to complete in the second quarter of 2004:

Item 3: Legal Proceedings

Snap-on has government contracts
with federal departments and agencies, two of which are presently under audit by the U.S.
General Services Administration. The two contracts involve sales from March 1996 through
February 2001, and sales since February 2001. The primary focus of these audits concerns
the interpretation and application of the price reduction provisions of these contracts.

On February 6, 2004, Snap-on received
a letter from the Department of Justice indicating that they were seeking to discuss these
audit findings with Snap-on before taking any further action. On March 2, 2004, the
government provided Snap-on with their claim estimate of approximately $12 million for
billing discrepancies relating to the audited contract periods from July 1997 through May
2002. Additional amounts could be claimed by the government for contract periods not
covered by these audits. Snap-on intends to continue discussions with the government in an
effort to advance its positions with respect to the government’s claims. At this
time, Snap-on cannot predict the period of time any discussions will take, or the outcome
or specific consequences of these matters, which could include settlement, civil
litigation by the government to recover treble damages and other penalties under the False
Claims Act, as well as suspension or debarment from future government business or other
legal or administrative action. Should the government prevail in these matters, the impact
on Snap-on’s results of operations would be material.

Snap-on held about 3,000 active or
pending patents as of year-end 2003, and Snap-on vigorously prosecutes its claims and
defends its patents in the ordinary course of business.

Snap-on is also involved in various
other legal matters that are being defended and handled in the ordinary course of
business. Snap-on maintains accruals for such costs that are expected to be incurred with
regards to these matters. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of these
other legal matters, management believes that the results will not have a material impact
on Snap-on’s financial statements.

INDEPENDENT
AUDITORS’ REPORT

To the Board of Directors and
Shareholders of Snap-on Incorporated:

We have audited the consolidated
financial statements of Snap-on Incorporated and Subsidiaries (the "Company") as of
January 3, 2004 and December 28, 2002, and for each of the years then ended and have
issued our report thereon dated February 3, 2004, (except for Paragraph 7 and 8 of Note
17, to which the date is March 12, 2004) (which expresses an unqualified opinion and
includes explanatory paragraphs relating to the adoption of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” a
revision of prior-period financial statements for the transitional disclosures required
upon adoption of SFAS No. 142 and the change in presentation of its reportable segments);
such financial statements and report are included in your 2003 Annual Report to
Shareholders and are incorporated herein by reference.  Our audits also include the 2003
and 2002 financial statement schedules of the Company, listed in Item 15(d). The 2003 and
2002 financial statement schedules are the responsibility of Company's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion based on our audits.  In our opinion, such 2003
and 2002 financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the 2003 and 2002
basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.  The 2001 schedule was subject to auditing procedures by
other auditors who have ceased operations and whose report dated January 29, 2002, stated
that such information is fairly stated in all material respects when considered in
relation to the basic 2001 financial statements taken as a whole.

The following Report of Independent
Public Accountants is a copy of a report that Arthur Andersen LLP previously issued in
connection with Snap-on’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29,
2001. Effective June 14, 2002, Snap-on dismissed Arthur Andersen LLP as its independent
auditors. Arthur Andersen LLP has not reissued this report in connection with the
preparation of Snap-on’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended January 3,
2003, and December 28, 2002, and the report related only to Snap-on’s financial
statements as of and for the year ended December 29, 2001. See Exhibit 23b for further
discussion.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

ON FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE

We have audited in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, the financial statements
included in Snap-on Incorporated’s (“Snap-on”) Annual Report to
Shareholders, incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, and have issued our report
thereon dated January 29, 2002. Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion
on those statements taken as a whole. The schedule listed on page 28 is the responsibility
of Snap-on’s management and is presented for purposes of complying with the
Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and is not part of the basic financial
statements. This schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the
audit of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly states in all material
respects the financial data required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.
