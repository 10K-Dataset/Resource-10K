PART I

Safe Harbor

Statements in this document that are not historical
facts, including statements (i) that include the words “expects,” “plans,”
“targets,” “estimates,” “believes,” “anticipates,” or similar words that
reference Snap-on Incorporated (“Snap-on” or “the company”) or its management;
(ii) specifically identified as forward-looking; or (iii) describing Snap-on’s
or management’s future outlook, plans, estimates, objectives or goals, are
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Snap-on
cautions the reader that any forward-looking statements included in this
document that are based upon assumptions and estimates were developed by
management in good faith and are subject to risks, uncertainties or other
factors that could cause (and in some cases have caused) actual results to
differ materially from those described in any such statement. Accordingly,
forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual
results or regarded as a representation by the company or its management that
the projected results will be achieved. For those forward-looking statements,
Snap-on cautions the reader that numerous important factors, such as those
listed below, as well as those factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form
10-K and in Snap-on’s Form 8-K/A filed on January 9, 2007, could affect the
company’s actual results and could cause its actual consolidated results to
differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement made
by, or on behalf of, Snap-on.

These risks and uncertainties include, without
limitation, uncertainties related to estimates, statements, assumptions and
projections generally, and the timing and progress with which Snap-on can
attain savings from cost reduction actions, including its ability to implement
reductions in workforce, achieve improvements in the company’s manufacturing
footprint and greater efficiencies in its supply chain, and enhance machine
maintenance, plant productivity and manufacturing line set-up and change-over
practices, any or all of which could result in production inefficiencies,
higher cost and lost revenues.  These
risks also include uncertainties related to Snap-on’s capability to
implement future strategies with respect to its existing businesses, its
ability to refine its brand and franchise strategies, retain and attract
franchisees, further enhance service and value to franchisees and thereby
enhance their sales and profitability, introduce successful new products,
successfully integrate acquisitions (including the company’s November 28, 2006,
acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions), as well as its ability to
withstand disruption arising from natural disasters, planned facility closures
or other labor interruptions, litigation challenges and external negative
factors including significant changes in the current competitive environment,
inflation, interest rates and other monetary and market fluctuations; and the
impact of legal proceedings, energy and raw material supply and pricing
(including steel and gasoline), the amount, rate and growth of Snap-on’s
general and administrative expenses (e.g. health care and/or pension costs),
and terrorist disruptions on business. 
Snap-on disclaims any responsibility to update any forward-looking
statement provided in this document.

In
addition, investors should be aware that generally accepted accounting
principles prescribe when a company should reserve for particular risks,
including litigation exposures. 
Accordingly, results for a given reporting period could be significantly
affected if and when a reserve is established for a major contingency. Reported
results, therefore, may appear to be volatile in certain accounting periods.


Item 1: Business

Snap-on was incorporated
under the laws of the state of Wisconsin in 1920 and reincorporated under the
laws of the state of Delaware in 1930. 
Snap-on is a leading global innovator, manufacturer and marketer of
tools, diagnostics and equipment solutions for professional users.  Product lines include hand and power tools,
tool storage, diagnostics software, information and management systems, shop
equipment and other solutions for vehicle manufacturers, dealerships and repair
centers, as well as customers in industry, government, agriculture and
construction.  Snap-on also derives
income from various financing programs to facilitate the sales of its products.

Snap-on markets its
products and brands through multiple distribution sales channels in more than
125 countries. Snap-on’s largest geographic markets include the United States,
Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands,
Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. 
The originator of the mobile franchise van tool distribution channel in
the automotive repair segment, Snap-on also reaches its customers through
company direct, distributor and Internet channels.

Snap-on’s business
segments are based on the organization structure used by management for making
operating and investment decisions and for assessing performance.

Snap-on’s reportable business segments
include: (i) the Snap-on Tools Group (formerly the Snap-on Dealer Group); (ii)
the Commercial & Industrial Group; (iii) the Diagnostics & Information
Group; and (iv) Financial Services.  In
the first quarter of 2006, the company changed the name of the Snap-on Dealer
Group segment to the Snap-on Tools Group. 
The organization structure used by management did not change and
the segment name change did not impact previously
disclosed segment net sales, operating earnings, identifiable assets
or other amounts or disclosures

.

The
Snap-on Tools Group consists of Snap-on’s business operations serving the
worldwide franchise van channel (“franchisees”). The Commercial &
Industrial Group consists of the business operations providing tools and
equipment products and equipment repair services to a broad range of industrial
and commercial customers worldwide through direct, distributor and other
non-franchise distribution channels. The Diagnostics & Information Group
consists of the business operations providing diagnostics equipment, vehicle
service information, electronic parts catalogs, business management systems,
and other solutions for vehicle service to customers in the worldwide vehicle
service and repair marketplace. The Diagnostics & Information Group
includes, on a prospective basis, the impact of the November 28, 2006,
acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions. 
Financial Services consists of the business operations of Snap-on
Credit LLC (“SOC”), a consolidated, 50%-owned joint venture between Snap-on and
The CIT Group, Inc. (“CIT”), and Snap-on’s wholly owned finance subsidiaries in
those international markets where Snap-on has franchise operations.  See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for information on business segments and foreign operations.  See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for information on the ProQuest Business Solutions acquisition.

Snap-on evaluates
the performance of its operating segments based on segment net sales and
operating earnings, exclusive of financing activities and income taxes.  Segment net sales are defined as total net
sales, including both external customer revenue and intersegment revenue.
Segment operating earnings are defined as segment net sales less cost of goods
sold and operating expenses, including restructuring costs.  Snap-on accounts for intersegment sales and
transfers based primarily on standard costs with reasonable mark-ups
established between the segments. 
Identifiable assets by segment are those assets used in the respective
reportable segment’s operations. 
Intersegment amounts are eliminated to arrive at consolidated financial
results.

On November 28, 2006,
Snap-on acquired the ProQuest Business Solutions business and certain net
assets (collectively “ProQuest Business Solutions” or “business solutions”)
from ProQuest Company for a preliminary purchase price of approximately $516
million (including $8 million of estimated transaction costs) and the
assumption of approximately $19 million of debt.  ProQuest Business Solutions is a world leader
in automotive parts and service information. 
Its products are aimed at helping original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”)
and their dealers enhance their service operations.  Business solutions’ products include
integrated software, services and systems that transform complex technical data
for parts catalogs into easily accessed electronic information (electronic
parts catalogs). Other products and services include warranty management systems
and analytics to help dealerships manage and track performance.  Over 33,000 automotive dealerships around the
world use business solutions’ electronic parts catalogs, which are available in
26 different languages and support 15 automotive manufacturers and 31
brands.  Business solutions’ products are
also sold to over 85,000 dealers in the power equipment and power sports
markets. See Snap-on’s Form 8-K filing dated November 28, 2006 (as amended
January 9, 2007), and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
further information on the ProQuest Business Solutions acquisition.

Snap-on is licensed to use the ProQuest brand and trademark pursuant to the
business solutions purchase agreement.

In
addition to its sales of tool, diagnostic, service and equipment solutions,
Snap-on also generates revenue from various financing activities that
include (i) loans to franchisees; (ii) loans to the franchisees’ customer
network; and (iii) loans to Snap-on’s industrial and other customers for the
purchase of tools and equipment on an extended-term payment plan.

Franchise
fee revenue, including nominal, non-refundable initial and ongoing monthly fees
(primarily for sales and business training and marketing and product promotion
programs), is recognized as the fees are earned.

Sales and Distribution

Snap-on markets and
distributes its products and related services principally to professional

tool and equipment users around the
world.  The two largest market sectors
are the vehicle service and repair sector and the industrial sector.


Vehicle
Service and Repair Sector

The vehicle service and
repair sector has three main customer groups: professional technicians who
purchase tools and equipment for themselves; vehicle service and repair shop
owners and managers - including independent shops, national chains and
automotive dealerships - who purchase equipment for use by multiple technicians
within a service or repair facility; and vehicle manufacturers.

Snap-on provides
innovative tool, equipment solutions and business solutions, as well as
technical sales support and training, to meet technicians’ evolving needs.
Snap-on’s franchise van distribution system offers technicians the convenience
of purchasing quality tools with minimal disruption of their work routine.
Snap-on also provides owners and managers of shops, where technicians work,
with tools, diagnostics equipment, repair and service information, including
electronic parts catalogs, and shop management products. Through its equipment
solutions business, Snap-on provides OEMs with products and services including
tools, consulting services and facilitation services.  Snap-on’s facilitation services include
product procurement, distribution, and administrative support to customers for
their dealership equipment programs.

Major challenges for
Snap-on and the vehicle service and repair sector include the increasing rate
of technological change within motor vehicles, vehicle population growth,
vehicle life and the resulting impact on the businesses of both our suppliers
and customers that is necessitated by such change.  Snap-on believes it is a meaningful
participant in the market sector for vehicle service and repair.

Industrial Sector

Snap-on markets its
products to a wide variety of industrial customers including industrial maintenance
and repair operations; manufacturing and assembly facilities; various
government agencies and facilities; schools; and OEMs that require
instrumentation or service tools and equipment for their products.

Major challenges in the
industrial sector include a highly competitive, cost-conscious
environment, and a trend toward customers making many of their tool purchases
through one integrated supplier. Snap-on believes it is a meaningful
participant in the market sector for industrial tools and equipment.

Distribution
Channels

Snap-on serves customers
primarily through the following channels of distribution: the mobile franchise
van channel,  company direct sales,
distributors and e-commerce.  The following
discussion summarizes Snap-on’s general approach for each channel, and is
not intended to be all-inclusive.

Franchisees

In the United States,
the majority of sales to the vehicle service and repair sector are conducted
through Snap-on’s franchisees. 
Snap-on’s franchisees primarily serve vehicle service technicians and
vehicle service shop owners, generally providing weekly contact at the customer’s
place of business.  Franchisees’ sales
are concentrated in hand and power tools, tool storage units and small
diagnostic and shop equipment, which can easily be transported in a van and
demonstrated during a brief sales call. 
Franchisees purchase Snap-on’s products at a discount from suggested
list prices and resell them at prices established by the franchisee. Although
some franchisees have sales areas defined by other methods, most U.S.
franchisees are provided a list of places of business that serves as the basis
of the franchisee’s sales route.

Since 1991, new U.S.
franchisees, and a majority of the pre-1991 U.S. franchisees, have been
enrolled as franchisees of Snap-on. 
Snap-on began offering, in 2001, a trial franchise option
to potential U.S. franchisees that do not meet the franchise qualification
requirements.  Trial franchisees typically have less upfront investment
and are provided an initial base level of consigned inventory from Snap-on
to assist them in gaining experience and building
equity toward the future purchase of a standard franchise. Snap-on
also provides certain franchisees the opportunity to add vans to their
franchise or to add a limited number of franchises.  Snap-on charges nominal initial and ongoing
monthly license fees.  At 2006 year end,
3,308 U.S. franchisees (approximately 95%) were enrolled as franchisees, or
employed by franchisees, as compared with 3,498 U.S. franchisees (approximately
95%) at year-end 2005.  Through SOC,
financing is available to franchisees, which includes van and truck leases,
working capital loans, and loans to enable new franchisees to fund the purchase
of the franchise.  While Snap-on offers
financing to qualified


franchisees and their
customers through SOC and its wholly owned international finance subsidiaries,
the decision to finance through Snap-on or another financing entity is solely
at the election of the customer.

Snap-on has replicated
its U.S. franchise van distribution model in certain other countries including
Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, South Africa and the United
Kingdom. In many of these markets, as in the United States, purchase decisions
are generally made or influenced by professional vehicle service technicians
and shop owners. Snap-on markets products in certain other countries through
its subsidiary, Snap-on Tools International, LLC, which sells to foreign
distributors under license or contract with Snap-on.  Internationally, Snap-on offers financing to
its franchisees and customer networks through its wholly owned finance
subsidiaries.

Snap-on supports its
franchisees with a field organization of regional offices, franchise
performance support teams, Diagnostic Sales Developers (“DSDs”), service
centers and distribution centers. 
Snap-on also provides sales and business training, and marketing and
product promotion programs, as well as customer and franchisee financing
programs through SOC and its wholly owned international finance operations, all
of which are designed to strengthen franchisee sales.  In the United States and Canada, the National
Franchise Advisory Council and the Snap-on Tools Canadian Franchise Advisory
Council, both of which are composed of franchisees that are elected by
franchisees, assist Snap-on in identifying and implementing enhancements to the
franchise program.

In
the United States, franchisees work closely with DSDs.  The DSD specialists demonstrate and sell
higher-price-point diagnostics and vehicle service shop management information
systems.  DSDs work independently and
with franchisees to identify and generate sales leads among vehicle service
shop owners and managers.  DSDs are
Snap-on employees who are compensated primarily on the basis of commission; a
franchisee receives a brokerage fee from certain sales made by the DSDs to the
franchisee’s customers.  Most products
sold through the franchisee and DSDs are sold under the

Snap-on

,

Blue-Point,

and

Sun

brand
names.

Company Direct Sales

In the United States, a
significant proportion of shop equipment sales under the

Sun, John
Bean and Blackhawk

brands

and
information products under the

Mitchell1

brand are
made by a direct sales force that has responsibility for national accounts. As
the vehicle service and repair sector consolidates (with more business
conducted by national chains, automotive dealerships and franchised service
centers), the company believes these larger organizations can be serviced most
effectively by sales people who can demonstrate and sell the full line of
equipment and diagnostic products and services. 
Snap-on also sells these products and services directly to OEMs.

John Bean and Blackhawk

brands are sold directly to end customers primarily through sales leads
generated from franchisees and DSDs.

Snap-on

brand tools
and equipment are marketed to industrial and governmental customers in the
United States through both industrial sales representatives, who are employees,
and independent industrial distributors. In most markets outside the United
States, industrial sales are conducted through independent distributors. The
sales representatives focus on industrial customers whose main purchase
criteria are quality and service. At the end of 2006, Snap-on had industrial
sales representatives in the United States, Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico,
Puerto Rico and some European countries, with the United States representing
the majority of Snap-on’s total industrial sales.

Business solutions
sells automotive and power equipment products both domestically and
internationally through an internal sales force. Products and services are
marketed to two targeted groups: OEMs and individual dealerships. To
effectively reach the large OEMs, such as General Motors Corporation, DaimlerChrysler
AG, Ford Motor Company, and Toyota Motor Corporation, business solutions has
deployed a team of business development professionals in the world’s principal
automotive centers in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and Japan.
In the United States and Canada, automotive and power equipment products and
services are sold directly to individual dealerships using an experienced sales
force.

Distributors

Sales of certain tools
and equipment are made through independent vehicle service and industrial
distributors who purchase the items from Snap-on and resell them to the end
users.  Hand tools under the

Bahco, Fish and Hook

(design)

, Pradines

and

Lindstrom

brands and trade names, for
example, are sold through distributors in Europe, North and South America, Asia
and certain other parts of the world. 
Wheel


service and other
vehicle service equipment are sold through distributors primarily under brands
including

Hofmann

and

Kansas Jack

.  Hand tools under the

Irimo,
Palmera

and

Acesa

brands
and power tools under the

Sioux

brand,
are differentiated from those products sold through the franchisee, DSD and
direct sales channels.

Sun

-branded
equipment is marketed through distributors in South America and Asia

,

and through both a direct sales force
and distributors in Europe.

E-commerce

Snap-on’s e-commerce
development initiatives allow Snap-on to combine the capabilities of the
Internet with Snap-on’s existing brand sales and distribution strengths to
reach new and under-served customer segments. Snap-on offers current and
prospective customers online, around-the-clock access to purchase

Snap-on

and

Blue-Point

products through its public Internet Web site at www.snapon.com.  The site features an online catalog
containing nearly 14,000 products, including

Snap-on

hand tools, power tools, tool storage units and diagnostic equipment available
to consumers and professionals in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada
and Australia.

At
the end of 2006, Snap-on had more than 370,000 registered users, including
approximately 32,000 industrial accounts. 
E-commerce and certain other system enhancement initiatives are designed
to improve productivity and further leverage the one-on-one relationships and
service Snap-on has with its current and prospective customers. Through
business-to-business and business-to-consumer capabilities, Snap-on and its
franchisees are enhancing communications with customers on a real-time,
24-hour, 7-day a week basis.

Competition

Snap-on competes on the
basis of its product quality and performance, product line breadth and depth,
service, brand awareness and imagery, and technological innovation. While no
single company competes with Snap-on across all of its product lines and
distribution channels, various companies compete in one or more product
categories and/or distribution channels.

Snap-on believes
it is a leading manufacturer and distributor of professional tools, diagnostics
and equipment solutions, offering the broadest line of these products to the
vehicle service industry.  The major
competitors selling to professional technicians in the automotive service and
repair sector through the mobile van channel include MAC Tools (The Stanley
Works), Matco (Danaher Corporation), and Cornwell.  Snap-on also competes with companies that
sell tools and equipment to automotive technicians through non-mobile van
distributors including department stores (such as Sears Holding Corp./Craftsman
Roebuck and Co.), home centers (such as The Home Depot, Inc. and Lowes
Companies, Inc.), auto parts supply outlets (such as NAPA, AutoZone, Inc. and
The Pep Boys), and tool supply warehouses/distributorships (such as Ace Tool,
Stampede and ICN).  Within the power
tools category,       Snap-on’s major competitors
include Ingersoll-Rand Co. Limited, Black & Decker Corp., Robert Bosch Tool
Corp., Makita Corp., Chicago Pneumatic (Atlas Copco), and Milwaukee Electric
(Techtronic Industries Co. Ltd.).  In the
industrial sector, major competitors include Armstrong (Danaher Corporation),
Proto (The Stanley Works), Irwin (Newell Rubbermaid, Inc.), Cooper Industries,
Ltd., and Westward (W.W. Grainger, Inc.). 
The major competitors selling diagnostics and shop equipment and
information to shop owners and managers in the vehicle service and repair
sector include Corghi S.p.A., Fluke and Hennessy (Danaher Corporation),
Robinair and OTC (SPX Corporation), Hunter Engineering, Rotary Lift and Chief
Automotive (Dover Corporation), Car-O-Liner, Lexcom GmbH, Infomedia Ltd.,
Enigma, ALLDATA (AutoZone, Inc.), and the proprietary diagnostic and
information systems of OEMs.

Raw
Materials and Purchased Product

Snap-on’s supply of raw
materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from
numerous suppliers.  During 2005 and
2006, Snap-on experienced higher pricing related to certain grades and alloys
of steel.  Snap-on has secured an ample
supply of both bar and coil steel for the near future to ensure stable supply
to meet material demands.  While Snap-on
believes that steel prices will continue to remain high for 2007, the company
does not anticipate experiencing any significant pricing or availability issues
with regards to 2007 steel purchases.

Patents,
Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property

Snap-on vigorously
pursues and relies on patent protection to protect its intellectual property
and its position in its markets. As of December 30, 2006, Snap-on and its
subsidiaries held over 700 active and pending patents in the United


States and over 1,600
active and pending patents outside of the United States.  Sales relating to any single patent did not
represent a material portion of Snap-on’s revenues in the last three years.

Examples of products
that have features or designs that benefit from patent protection include wheel
alignment systems, wheel balancers, sealed ratchets, electronic torque
instruments, ratcheting screwdrivers, emissions-sensing devices and diagnostic
equipment.

Much of the technology
used in the manufacture of vehicle service tools and equipment is in the public
domain. Snap-on relies primarily on trade secret protection to protect
proprietary processes used in manufacturing. 
Methods and processes are patented when appropriate.  Copyright protection is also utilized when
appropriate.

Trademarks used by
Snap-on are of continuing importance to Snap-on in the marketplace.  Trademarks have been registered in the United
States and more than 100 other countries, and additional applications for
trademark registrations are pending. 
Snap-on vigorously polices proper use of its trademarks.  Snap-on’s right to manufacture and sell
certain products is dependent upon licenses from others; however, these
products under license do not represent a material portion of Snap-on’s
net sales.

Domain names have become
a valuable corporate asset for companies around the world, including Snap-on.  Domain names often contain a trademark or
service mark or even a corporate name and are often considered intellectual
property.  The recognition and value of
the

Snap-on

name, trademark, and domain name
are core strengths of the company. 
Snap-on monitors new developments in top-level domains and country-code
domains in order to preserve Snap-on’s right to relevant domain names.

Snap-on is selectively
and strategically licensing the

Snap-on

brand
to carefully selected manufacturing and distribution companies, including
apparel, work boots and a variety of other goods, in order to further
build equity and market presence for the company’s strongest brand.

Environment

Snap-on is subject to
various environmental laws, ordinances, regulations, and other requirements of
government authorities in the United States and other nations.  At Snap-on, these environmental liabilities
are managed through the Snap-on Environmental, Hygiene, and Safety Management
System (“EH & SMS”), which is applied worldwide.  The system is based upon continual
improvement and is certified to ISO 14001:1996 and OHSAS 18001:1999, verified
through Det Norske Veritas (DNV) Certification, Inc.

Snap-on believes that it
complies with applicable environmental control requirements in its
operations.  Expenditures on
environmental matters through EH & SMS have not had, and Snap-on does not
for the foreseeable future expect them to have, a material effect upon Snap-on’s
capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

Employees

At the end of January
2007, Snap-on employed approximately 12,400 people compared to approximately
11,400 people at the end of January 2006. 
The year-over-year increase in employees primarily reflects the 2006
acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions, partially offset by the impact of
restructuring-related and management realignment actions at various Snap-on
facilities.

Approximately 3,200
employees, or 26% of Snap-on’s worldwide workforce, are represented by unions
and/or covered under collective bargaining agreements.  Approximately 1,560 employees are covered
under agreements expiring in 2007.  In
recent years, Snap-on has not experienced any significant work slow-downs,
stoppages or other labor disruptions.

The number of covered union employees
whose contracts expire within the next five years is approximately 1,560 in
2007; 1,630 in 2008; 20 in 2009; and zero in both 2010 and 2011.

There can be no assurance that future
contracts with Snap-on’s unions will be renegotiated upon terms acceptable to
Snap-on.


Working Capital

As most of Snap-on’s
business is not seasonal and its inventory needs are relatively constant, no
unusual working capital needs arise during the year.  Snap-on does not have a significant backlog
of orders at December 30, 2006.

Snap-on’s financial
condition and use of working capital are discussed in “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Neither Snap-on nor any
of its segments, except Financial Services, depend on any single customer,
small group of customers or government for any material part of its
revenues.  As a result of SOC’s
relationship with CIT, Snap-on’s Financial Services business segment depends on
CIT for more than 10% of its revenues.

Item 1A: Risk
Factors

In evaluating the
company, careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors,
in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form
10-K.  Each of these risk factors could
adversely affect the company’s business, operating results and/or financial
condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in the
company’s common stock. In addition to the following disclosures, please refer
to the other information contained in this report, including the consolidated
financial statements and the related notes.

The
success of Snap-on’s mobile van tool distribution business depends on the
success of its franchisees.

Approximately 41%
of our 2006 revenues were generated by the Snap-on Tools Group, which consists
of Snap-on’s business operations serving the worldwide franchise van
channel. Except in limited circumstances, each of our mobile tool vans is
operated by a franchisee pursuant to a franchise agreement. Snap-on’s success
is dependent on its relationships with franchisees, individually and
collectively, as they are the primary sales and service link between the
company and vehicle service and repair technicians, who are an important class
of end users for Snap-on’s products and services. If our franchisees are not
successful, or if we do not maintain an effective relationship with our
franchisees, the delivery of products, the collection of receivables and/or our
relationship with end users could be adversely affected and thereby negatively
impact our financial results.

In addition, if we
are unable to maintain effective relationships with franchisees, the company or
the franchisees may choose to terminate the relationship, which may result in
(i) open routes in which end-use customers are not provided reliable service;
(ii) litigation resulting from termination; and/or (iii) reduced collections or
increased write-offs of franchisee receivables owed to       Snap-on. 
As Snap-on has over 4,800 franchisees worldwide and most of these
franchise relationships are governed by contract, it is not uncommon for
litigation to result from the termination of these relationships.

The steps
taken to restructure operations, rationalize operating footprint, lower
operating expenses, and achieve greater efficiencies in the supply chain could
disrupt business.

We have taken
steps in the past, and expect to take additional steps in 2007, intended to
improve customer service and to drive further efficiencies and reduce costs,
some of which could be disruptive to our business.  These actions, collectively across our
operating groups, are focused on the following:

·

Continue on the
company’s existing path to improve and transform global manufacturing and the
supply chain into a market-demand-based replenishment system, with lower costs;

·

Continue to
enhance service and value to Snap-on’s franchisees and customers;

·

Continue to
invest in initiatives focused on building a strong sales and operating presence
in emerging growth markets;

·

Continue to
implement rapid continuous improvement (RCI) activities throughout the
organization to drive further efficiencies and reduce costs;

·

Continue to
invest in developing and marketing new, innovative, higher-value-added products
and advanced technologies; and

·

Extend
Snap-on’s products and services into additional markets or to new customers.

Specific
initiatives in each of these areas are underway.  Snap-on believes that by executing on these
focus areas, along with a continued commitment to new innovative products and
rapid continuous improvement to drive lower costs, the company and its
franchisees will realize stronger growth and profitability.  However,


failure to succeed
in the implementation of any or all of these actions could result in our being
unable to achieve our financial goals and could be disruptive to the business.

In addition,
reductions to headcount and other cost reduction measures may result in the
loss of technical expertise that could adversely affect our research and
development efforts and ability to meet product development schedules. Efforts
to reduce components of expense could result in the recording of charges for
inventory and technology-related write-offs, workforce reduction costs or other
charges relating to the consolidation of facilities. If we were to incur a
substantial charge to further these efforts, our earnings (or loss) per share
would be adversely affected in such period. If we are unable to effectively
manage our cost reduction and restructuring efforts, our business, results of
operations and financial condition could be harmed.

Risks
associated with the integration of Snap-on’s acquisition of ProQuest Business
Solutions (or other future acquisitions) could have an adverse impact on
Snap-on’s results of operations and financial position.

We completed the
acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions on November 28, 2006. If our
integration of this business is not successful, it could adversely affect our
earnings, cash flow and share price. The acquisition also involves risks and
uncertainties that include:

·

Retaining the
customers of business solutions and achieving the expected benefits of the
acquisition, including (i) accelerating earnings and cash flows;
(ii) expanding our existing product offerings into the global automotive
OEM dealership segment; and (iii) creating new customer relationships and
product integration opportunities;

·

Losing key
employees of business solutions;

·

Incurring
additional debt, earnings dilution and contingent liabilities;

·

Implementing and
maintaining consistent standards, controls, procedures, policies and
information systems; and

·

Diverting
management’s attention from other business concerns.

ProQuest Company,
the predecessor parent company of ProQuest Business Solutions, is the subject
of an ongoing accounting review by the SEC. 
ProQuest Company has announced that this review will result in the
restatement of previously reported earnings when it files its 2005 Annual
Report on Form 10-K with the SEC. 
In connection with Snap-on’s acquisition of the ProQuest Business
Solutions segment, ProQuest Company prepared financial statements of ProQuest
Business Solutions on a stand-alone basis as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2005. ProQuest Company’s independent auditors audited those
financial statements and Snap-on filed those audited financial statements with
the SEC in a Current Report on Form 8-K/A dated January 9, 2007, which amended
the company’s Current Report on Form 8-K dated November 28, 2006.  Because ProQuest Company’s restated financial
statements are not yet finalized and the ProQuest Company SEC investigation is
ongoing, we cannot assure that when ProQuest Company files its restated results
they will not contain additional information that could impact the ProQuest
Business Solutions’ audited stand-alone financial statements. Snap-on will
evaluate any new information and if it is material, the information could
result in the company’s need to amend its Form 8-K/A filing to restate the
ProQuest Business Solutions’ financial statements.

Information
technology infrastructure is critical to supporting business objectives.

We depend heavily
on information technology infrastructure to achieve our business
objectives.  If a problem occurs that
impairs this infrastructure, the resulting disruption could impede our ability
to record or process orders, manufacture and ship in a timely manner, or
otherwise carry on business in the normal course.  Any such events could cause us to lose
customers or revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to remediate.

In association
with initiatives to better integrate business units, rationalize operating
footprint and improve responsiveness to franchisees and customers, Snap-on is
replacing and enhancing its existing global Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
management information system.  The
integration, implementation and deployment of new information technology
processes and a common information infrastructure, which began in 2006,  is expected to cover a period of several
years.  We could experience disruptions
in our business as we implement the system enhancements, including the
possibility that the new system may not perform as expected, which could have
an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.


The
recognition of impairment charges on goodwill would adversely impact future
financial position and results of operations.

We are required to
perform impairment tests on our goodwill balance annually or at any time when
events occur, which could impact the value of our business segments. Our
determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on a comparison of
each of our reporting units’ fair market value with its carrying value.
Significant and unanticipated changes could require a provision for impairment
in a future period that could substantially affect our reported earnings and
reduce our consolidated net worth and shareholders’ equity.

Business
interruptions for franchisees could adversely impact operating results.

Franchisees have
historically experienced business interruptions due to adverse weather
conditions or other extraordinary events, such as hurricanes in the southern
United States and wild fires in California. To the extent our franchisees
experience future similar events, our operating results may be adversely impacted.

Exposure
to credit risks of customers and resellers may make it difficult to collect
receivables and could adversely affect operating results and financial
condition.

Industry and
economic conditions have the potential to weaken the financial position of some
of our customers. If circumstances surrounding our customers’ financial
capabilities were to deteriorate, such write-downs or write-offs would
negatively affect our operating results for the period in which they occur and,
if large, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and
financial condition.

Failure
to maintain effective distribution of products and services could adversely
impact revenue, gross margin and profitability.

We use a variety
of distribution methods to sell our products and services. Successfully
managing the interaction of our distribution efforts to reach various potential
customer segments for our products and services is a complex process. Moreover,
since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins, our
failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for
our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins
and therefore our profitability.

Risks
associated with the disruption of manufacturing operations could adversely
affect profitability or competitive position.

We manufacture a
significant portion of the products we sell. Any prolonged disruption in the
operations of our existing manufacturing facilities, whether due to technical
or labor difficulties, lack of raw material or component availability,
destruction of or damage to any facility (including natural disasters, use and
storage of hazardous materials or other events), or other reasons, could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

The
inability to provide acceptable financing alternatives to end-user customers
and franchisees could adversely impact operating results.

An integral
component of Snap-on’s business and profitability is its ability to provide
financing alternatives to end-user customers and franchisees which, for its
domestic financing operations, are managed through a joint venture with
CIT.  Historically, CIT has been the
exclusive purchaser of the credit and installment financing arranged by
SOC.  A deterioration of the relationship
between the joint venture partners, or if the joint venture should be
unexpectedly dissolved, could have an adverse impact on Snap-on’s results of
operations and ability to provide financing to end-user customers and
franchisees in the United States. 
Adverse fluctuations in interest rates and/or the ability to provide
competitive financing programs could also have an adverse impact on Snap-on’s
revenue and profitability.

The
global tool and equipment industry is competitive.

We face strong
competition in all of our market segments. 
Price competition in our various industries is intense and pricing
pressures from competitors and customers are increasing. In general, as a
manufacturer and marketer of premium products and services, the expectations of
Snap-on’s customers and its franchisees are high and increasing.  Any inability to maintain customer
satisfaction could diminish Snap-on’s premium image and reputation and could
result in a lessening of its ability to command premium


pricing. We expect
that the level of competition will remain high in the future, which could limit
our ability to maintain or increase market share or profitability.

The
inability to continue to introduce new products that respond to customer needs
and achieve market acceptance could result in lower revenues and reduced
profitability.

Sales from new
products represent a significant portion of our net sales and are expected to
continue to represent a significant component of our future net sales. We may
not be able to compete effectively unless we continue to enhance existing
products or introduce new products to the marketplace in a timely manner.
Product improvements and new product introductions require significant financial
and other resources including significant planning, design, development, and
testing at the technological, product, and manufacturing process
levels. Our competitors’ new products may beat our products to market, be
more effective with more features, be less expensive than our products, and/or
render our products obsolete. Any new products that we develop may not receive
market acceptance or otherwise generate any meaningful net sales or profits for
us relative to our expectations based on, among other things, existing and
anticipated investments in manufacturing capacity and commitments to fund
advertising, marketing, promotional programs, and research and development.

Raw
material and energy price fluctuations and shortages (including steel and various
fuel sources) could adversely affect the ability to obtain needed manufacturing
materials and could adversely affect results of operations.

The principal raw
material used in the manufacture of our products is steel, which we purchase in
competitive, price-sensitive markets. To meet Snap-on’s high quality standards,
our steel needs range from specialized alloys, which are available only from a
limited group of approved suppliers, to commodity types of alloys. These raw
materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality. Some of
these materials have been, and in the future may be, in short supply. As some
steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures, we could experience
inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on
short notice.  Additionally, unexpected
price increases could result in higher prices to our customers or an erosion of
the margins on our products.

We believe our
ability to sell our products is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the
road, the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles. These
factors affect the frequency, type and amount of service and repair performed
on vehicles by technicians, and therefore affect the demand for the number of
technicians, the prosperity of the technicians and, subsequently, the demand technicians
have for our tools, other products and services, and the value technicians
place on those products and services. To the extent that gasoline prices
increase, consumers may turn to other, non-gasoline based, methods of
transportation, including more frequent use of public transportation.  A decrease in the use of gasoline consuming
vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for our products.

Foreign
operations are subject to currency exchange and political risks that could
adversely affect results of operations.

Approximately 44%
of our revenues in 2006 were generated outside of the United States.  Future growth rates and success of our
business depends in large part on continued growth in our
non-U.S. operations, including growth in emerging markets. Numerous risks
and uncertainties affect our non-U.S. operations. These risks and
uncertainties include political, economic and social instability, including
acts of war, civil disturbance or acts of terrorism, local labor conditions,
changes in government policies and regulations, including imposition or
increases in withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by
international subsidiaries, and enforcement of contract and intellectual
property rights. We are also affected by changes in foreign currency exchange
rates, inflation rates and interest rates. Additionally, cash generated in
non-U.S. jurisdictions may be difficult to transfer to the United
States in a tax-efficient manner.

Failure
to adequately protect intellectual property could adversely affect business.

Intellectual
property rights are an important and integral component of our business. We
attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of
patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as licensing
agreements and third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements. Adverse
determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent us from
manufacturing and selling our products or prevent us from stopping others from
manufacturing and selling competing products. Failure to obtain or maintain
adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.


The
inability to successfully defend claims from taxing authorities could adversely
affect operating results and financial position.

We conduct
business in many countries, which requires us to interpret the income tax laws
and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions. Due to the subjectivity of
tax laws between those jurisdictions, as well as the subjectivity of factual
interpretations, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual
payments or assessments. Claims from taxing authorities related to these
differences could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial
position.

Failure
to attract and retain qualified personnel could lead to a loss of revenue
and/or profitability.

Snap-on’s success
depends, in part, on the efforts and abilities of its senior management team
and other key employees.  Their skills,
experience and industry contacts significantly benefit our operations and
administration.  The failure to attract
and retain members of our senior management team and other key employees could
have a negative effect on our operating results.

Failure to
achieve expected investment returns on pension plan assets could adversely
impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flow.

Snap-on sponsors various pension benefit plans. The
assets of the pension plan are broadly
diversified in an attempt to mitigate the risk of a large loss.  The
assets are invested in equity securities, fixed income securities, real estate and other real assets, and
money market instruments. Required
funding for the company’s defined benefit pension plans is determined in
accordance with guidelines set forth in the federal Employee Retirement Income
Security Act (ERISA).  Additional contributions to enhance the funded
status of the pension plans can be made at the company’s discretion.
However, there can be no assurance that the value of the pension plan assets,
or the investment returns on those plan assets, will be sufficient to meet the future benefit obligations of
such plans.  In addition, during periods of adverse investment market
conditions and declining interest rates, the company may be required to make
additional cash contributions to the plans that would reduce our financial
flexibility. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
further information on the company’s pension benefit plans.

Our defined benefit pension plan obligations are
affected by changes in market interest rates.  Significant fluctuations in market interest rates will add volatility to
our pension plan obligations.  Declining market interest rates will
increase our pension plan obligations.  While our plan assets are broadly
diversified, there is inherent market risks associated with investments.
 If adverse market conditions develop, our plan assets could incur a
loss.  The combination of declining market interest rates and plan asset
investment losses may adversely impact our financial position and results of
operations.

The company’s defined benefit pension expense is
calculated by netting five factors: service cost; interest on projected benefit
obligations; the expected return on plan assets; the amortization of prior
service costs; and the effects of actuarial gains and losses. The accounting
for pensions involves the estimation of a number of factors that are highly
uncertain.  Certain factors, such as the
interest cost and the expected return on plan assets are impacted by changes in
market interest rates and the value of plan assets.  A significant
decrease in market interest rates and a decrease in the fair value of plan
assets would increase net pension expense and may adversely affect the company’s
future results of operations.

Item 2: Properties

Snap-on maintains leased and owned manufacturing,
warehouse, distribution and office facilities throughout the world. Snap-on
believes that its facilities currently in use are suitable and have adequate
capacity to meet its present and foreseeable future demand.  Snap-on’s facilities in the United States
occupy approximately 4.2 million square feet, of which 72% is owned, including
its corporate and general office facility located in Kenosha, Wisconsin.  Snap-on’s facilities outside the United States
occupy approximately 4.6 million square feet, of which approximately 70% is
owned.  Certain Snap-on facilities are
leased through operating lease agreements.

See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
information

on the company’s operating
leases.  Snap-on management continually
monitors the company’s capacity needs and makes adjustments as dictated by
market and other conditions.

** Subsequent to year-end 2006, the company announced
that it expects to close the Johnson City manufacturing facility in mid 2007.

The
company announced that it expects to close its Enköping, Sweden, and Johnson
City, Tennessee,  manufacturing
facilities in 2007. The company phased out production at its Mt. Carmel,
Illinois, and Kenosha, Wisconsin, manufacturing facilities in March 2004.  The company’s former corporate office located
in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, is currently leased to a third party with an
option to purchase.  The Mt. Carmel
facility is currently for sale.


Item 3: Legal Proceedings

On May 16, 2006, Snap-on reached an agreement to
settle certain legal matters related to certain then current and former
franchisees on a class basis.

The court
gave its final approval to the class settlement on October 27, 2006.

Under the terms of the settlement, Snap-on agreed to make

pay

ments to

claimants

and class
counsel, plus incur certain other

costs and expenses.  Snap-on recorded a $38.0 million pretax
charge in the second quarter of 2006 representing its best
estimate to settle these legal matters.

Snap-on disbursed funds of approximately $14

million for related legal fees, settlements and other
expenses in the fourth quarter of 2006, and the company expects
to disburse additional amounts, including amounts to the class claimants,
beginning in the first quarter of 2007.  Snap-on has not admitted any
wrongdoing by way of this settlement.

On July 23, 2004, Snap-on reached an agreement
with the U.S. Department of Justice to resolve a government audit relating to
two contracts with the U.S. General Services Administration (“GSA”).  Snap-on agreed to settle the claims over the
interpretation and application of the price reduction and billing provisions of
these two contracts for sales from March 1996 through the July 23, 2004,
settlement date for $10.0 million. 
Snap-on remitted the $10.0 million cash settlement to the U.S.
Department of Justice on August 5, 2004. 
On August 5, 2005, the GSA
notified the company that it would take no administrative action against
Snap-on in connection with the Federal Supply Schedule contracts referred to
above.  The company considers the matter
closed.

Snap-on is also involved in various other legal
matters that are being litigated and/or settled in the ordinary course of
business. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of these other
legal matters, management believes that the results will not have a material
impact on Snap-on’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Snap-on held over 2,300
active or pending patents as of December 30, 2006, and Snap-on vigorously
prosecutes its claims and defends its patents in the ordinary course of
business.

Item 4

million and $57.7 million.  Snap-on’s
Board of Directors monitors and evaluates the company’s dividend practice

Subject to further adjustment pursuant to the
1996 Authorization described below, as of December 30, 2006, the approximate
value of shares that may yet be purchased pursuant to the three outstanding
Board of Directors’ authorizations discussed below is $152.1 million.

·

In its Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 1996, the company disclosed
that the company’s Board authorized the company to repurchase shares of the
company’s common stock from time to time in the open market or in privately
negotiated transactions (the “1996 Authorization”).  The 1996 Authorization allows the repurchase
of up to the number of shares issued or delivered from treasury from time to
time under the various plans the company has in place that call for the
issuance of the company’s common stock. 
Because the number of shares that are purchased pursuant to the 1996
Authorization will change from time to time as (i) the company issues shares
under its various plans and (ii) shares are repurchased pursuant to this
authorization, the number of shares authorized to be repurchased will vary from
time to time.  The 1996 Authorization
will expire when terminated by the company’s Board.  When calculating the approximate value of
shares that the company may yet purchase under the 1996 Authorization, the
company assumed a price of $47.15, $47.74 and $47.64 per share of common stock
as of the end of the fiscal 2006 months ended October 28, November 25 and
December 30, respectively.

·

On June 29, 1998, the company announced that
the company’s Board authorized the repurchase of an aggregate of $100 million
of the company’s common stock (the “1998 Authorization”).  The 1998 Authorization will expire when the
aggregate repurchase price limit is met, unless terminated earlier by the
company’s Board.

·

On February 3, 1999, the company announced
that the company’s Board authorized the repurchase of an aggregate of $50
million of the company’s common stock (the “1999 Authorization”).  The 1999 Authorization will expire when the
aggregate repurchase price limit is met, unless terminated earlier by the
company’s Board.


During 2006, the company repurchased 2,616,618 shares of
common stock.

Item
7:  Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Management Overview

Snap-on continued
implementing its strategic initiatives in 2006 to create long-term value for
the company’s shareholders, associates, franchisees and other distributor
partners across all of its business segments.

During 2006, measurable
progress was realized. Net sales grew 7.1% year over year, driven largely by
growth in the Diagnostics & Information Group’s equipment solutions
business, which provides essential diagnostics and equipment to original
equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and their dealerships, as well as growth in
emerging markets in the Commercial & Industrial Group.  Operating earnings of $164.9 million in 2006
decreased $3.1 million from 2005 levels, largely due to a $38.0 million pretax
franchisee litigation settlement charge recorded in the Snap-on Tools Group;
Snap-on has not admitted any wrongdoing by way of this settlement.  See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for information on the litigation settlement.

On November 28, 2006,
Snap-on acquired the ProQuest Business Solutions business and certain net
assets (hereinafter referred to as “ProQuest Business Solutions” or “business solutions”)
from ProQuest Company for a preliminary purchase price of approximately $516
million (including $8 million of estimated transaction costs) and the
assumption of approximately $19 million of debt.  The acquisition of ProQuest Business
Solutions, a world leader in automotive parts and service information, expanded
the company’s Diagnostics & Information Group’s product offerings.  Business solutions’ products, which are aimed
at helping OEMs and their dealerships enhance their service operations, include
integrated software, services and systems that transform complex technical data
for parts catalogs into easily accessed electronic information in the form of
electronic parts catalogs.  Other
business solutions’ products and services include warranty and management
systems and analytics to help dealerships manage and track performance.  Over 33,000 automotive dealerships worldwide
use business solutions’ electronic parts catalogs, which are available in 26
different languages and support 15 automotive manufacturers and 31 brands.
Business solutions’ products are also sold to over 85,000 dealers in the power
equipment and power sports markets. 
Snap-on believes that the strategic acquisition of ProQuest Business
Solutions positions the company to add value for global OEMs and enhance the
productivity and profitability of OEM dealerships, while affording growth
opportunities for Snap-on’s other customers, associates and shareholders.

While progress in 2006 has been encouraging, the
company believes there is still much more to be done to improve operating
performance and profitability.  The
strategic priorities and plans for 2007 will continue to build on the
improvement initiatives already underway to achieve long-term profitable growth
through increased sales and further lowering of costs.

In the

Snap-on Tools Group

, considerable progress
was made in strengthening its operating and financial performance. Strategic
priorities in 2006 focused on efforts to enhance Snap-on’s responsiveness to
its franchisees and customers and to strengthen the financial and operating
performance of both the franchisees and the company.

Through improvements in the company’s supply chain and
the transition to a market-demand based replenishment system, Snap-on’s
complete and on-time delivery rate for the top 88% of demanded stock keeping
units (“SKUs”) improved to 93% in 2006, with a goal to achieve a 99% complete
and on-time delivery rate on all SKUs by the end of 2007.  The Snap-on Tools Group also completed
the transformation of its field support system to a “team-based” organization
in 2006, which is designed to provide more specialized and focused support to
its franchisees.  The company also
implemented “pull marketing” efforts, such as increased media advertising, van
merchandising and online Web site and e-news, to generate product excitement
and drive increased traffic to the franchisee van.  In addition, the Snap-on Tools Group also
revamped its warehouse distribution program and launched a new mid-tier product
line aimed at capturing additional customers and capitalizing on more purchase
occasions.

Segment net sales in the
Snap-on Tools Group in 2006 were up 3.1% over 2005 levels, primarily due to a
significant fourth-quarter sales increase in the United States, combined with
continued growth in international sales. 
Despite the sales increase and savings realized from Rapid Continuous Improvement
(“RCI”) activities, operating earnings in 2006 of $37.6 million were negatively
impacted by the $38.0 million pretax franchisee litigation settlement charge
discussed above and by $13.3 million of higher planned costs to support the
strategic supply chain and franchise system initiatives.


The Snap-on Tools Group
2007 strategic priorities will continue to build on the progress made in
enhancing the franchise proposition and improving the supply chain, with
specific initiatives focused on the following:

·

Continue to improve franchisee
profitability;

·

Expand pull marketing initiatives;

·

Capture additional customers;

·

Improve service and value to
franchisees and their customers; and

·

Build
on efforts to improve the supply chain through investments in manufacturing and
extensive use of RCI.

By executing on these
focus areas, along with a continued commitment to new, innovative products and
the use of RCI to drive lower costs, Snap-on continues to believe that
the company and its franchisees will continue to realize stronger growth and
profitability.

In the

Commercial & Industrial Group

, progress continues to be
made in improving operating performance.  Segment net sales in 2006 were up 5.6%, while
operating earnings were up 52.6%.  Gross
profit as a percentage of net sales increased 170 basis points (100 basis
points equals 1.0 percent), or $41.2 million, over 2005 levels, reflecting
higher sales and pricing, including sales growth in emerging markets, and
improved productivity and efficiency savings.  
Benefits from ongoing cost reduction and RCI actions, including
increased production and sourcing of materials from lower-cost regions and
facilities, were major contributors to the year-over-year earnings improvement.
As a result of continued sales growth, as well as improved levels of customer
service and savings from productivity, RCI and restructuring activities,
operating earnings as a percentage of net sales in 2006 increased 270 basis
points, or $36.6 million, over 2005 levels.

The Commercial &
Industrial Group will continue to build on the following strategic priorities
in 2007:

·

Continue to invest in emerging market
growth initiatives, such as China, India and Eastern Europe;

·

Increase market share in industrial
tools through continued improvements in fill rates and product innovation, and
by reaching new customers;

·

Continue to invest in
productivity-enhancing products that utilize advanced technology; and

·

Continue
to rationalize the Group’s operating footprint and shift manufacturing
activities to lower cost regions.

In the

Diagnostics & Information Group

,
significant progress continues to be realized from the strategic focus on
creating an integrated “information with instrumentation” business.  The Diagnostics & Information Group’s
focus on RCI has resulted in a solid financial and operating platform.  The recent acquisition of business solutions,
with its ability to consolidate and transform complex manufacturer data from
disparate sources into cohesive, integrated and highly customized systems, was
an important strategic addition for the company.  By integrating the complementary capabilities
of business solutions with Snap-on’s other Diagnostics & Information
product offerings, Snap-on believes that it has enhanced its ability to add
value for global OEMs and their dealerships.

Snap-on acquired ProQuest
Business Solutions for a preliminary purchase price of approximately $516
million (including $8 million of estimated transaction costs) and the
assumption of approximately $19 million of debt.  Snap-on funded the acquisition through the
issuance of approximately $305 million of commercial paper and with available
cash on hand.  The excess of the fair
value of the assets and liabilities acquired resulted in the recording of
$344.6 million of goodwill, on a preliminary basis.  The preliminary purchase price allocation is
based upon the estimated fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired,
and are subject to change upon the completion of the purchase accounting.  The preliminary purchase price is also
subject to a working capital adjustment that is expected to be finalized in the
first six months of 2007.  The Diagnostics
& Information Group includes the impact of the November 28, 2006,
acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions on a prospective basis.

The Diagnostics &
Information Group will build on the following strategic priorities in 2007:

·

Continued growth in the base
businesses and emerging markets;

·

Successfully integrate the ProQuest
Business Solutions acquisition;

·

Leverage the opportunities afforded
from the ProQuest Business Solutions acquisition to drive further innovation
and growth;

·

Continued focus on reducing
complexity and structural costs; and

·

Achieving
faster product-development cycles.


Segment net sales in 2006
were up 21.2% largely due to sales growth in the OEM equipment solutions
business.  Operating earnings in 2006
increased $15.0 million, or 32%, driven by higher year-over-year sales and an
ongoing focus on RCI and cost reduction. 
For the approximate five-week period from the November 28, 2006,
acquisition date through year end, the ProQuest Business Solutions acquisition
contributed $20.4 million to 2006 sales and $4.8 million to operating earnings.

Cash Flows

In 2006, Snap-on
continued to deliver strong cash flow from operations. Cash generated from
operating activities was $203.4 million in 2006.  The company used available cash on hand to
fund, in part, approximately $203 million of the preliminary purchase price of
the ProQuest Business Solutions acquisition, pay dividends totaling $63.6
million, repurchase over 2.6 million shares of Snap-on common stock for $109.8
million, and invest $50.5 million in capital expenditures.  In conjunction with its purchase of ProQuest
Business Solutions, Snap-on also issued approximately $305 million of
commercial paper; these commercial paper borrowings were repaid, in part, with
proceeds from a $300 million long-term debt offering completed by the company
on January 12, 2007.  See Note 2 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the ProQuest
Business Solutions acquisition and Note 10 for additional information on the
commercial paper borrowings and January 2007 debt offering.

Net sales in 2006 increased $164.8
million, or 7.1%, from 2005 levels, including $11.3 million from currency
translation. The increase in net sales includes higher sales in the Diagnostics
& Information Group’s OEM equipment solutions business, and $20.4 million
of sales for the approximate five-week period following the company’s November
28, 2006, acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions.  Sales in the Commercial & Industrial
Group also increased year over year primarily due to higher sales of tools for
U.S. commercial and industrial applications, improved worldwide sales of
equipment products, along with continued growth in emerging markets. Sales in
the Snap-on Tools Group increased $30.5 million, or 3.1%, over 2005 levels,
reflecting sales increases in both the North American and international
franchise

operations.  See Note
2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the ProQuest
Business Solutions acquisition.

Gross profit was $1,085.9 million,
or 43.9% of net sales, in 2006, as compared to $1,019.9 million, or 44.2% of
net sales, in 2005.  The $66.0 million
increase in 2006 gross profit primarily reflects benefits from higher sales and
pricing, as well as benefits from lower costs, including benefits from
efficiency, productivity and cost reduction initiatives of $34.9 million.  The year-over-year increase in gross profit
also includes $11.5 million from the fourth-quarter 2006 acquisition of
ProQuest Business Solutions and $4.2 million of currency translation.  These increases in gross profit were
partially offset by higher year-over-year production costs of $22.6 million,
and “last-in, first-out” (“LIFO”) and other inventory expenses of $11.2
million, including a $1.0 million charge related to LIFO inventories in 2006
versus a comparable $8.8 million benefit in 2005.  Restructuring costs included in “Cost of
goods sold” totaled $12.1 million in 2006, as compared to $3.0 million in 2005.
The 30 basis point (100 basis points equals 1.0 percent) decline in
year-over-year gross profit as a percentage of net sales also reflects the
impact of a shift in product mix that included higher 2006 sales (and lower
relative gross margin) in the OEM equipment solutions business.

Financial services operating
income was $13.0 million on $49.0 million of revenue in 2006, as compared with
$15.7 million of operating income on $53.6 million of revenue in 2005.  The decrease in operating income primarily
reflects the impact of lower net interest spreads, partially offset by higher
levels of originations.

Operating expenses in 2006 were
$934.0 million, as compared to $867.6 million in 2005.  The $66.4 million increase in 2006 operating
expenses is primarily due to the recording of a $38.0 million pretax charge in
the second quarter of 2006 related to the settlement of franchisee litigation
matters.  Operating expenses in 2006 also
included $22.8 million in higher spending for strategic growth initiatives and
$22.0 million of higher stock-based and performance-based incentive
compensation, including $6.3 million in costs associated with the January 1,
2006, adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No.
123(R),

“Share-Based Payment,”

on a prospective
basis.   The year-over-year increase in
2006 operating expenses also includes $6.7 million of operating expenses from
the acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions and $2.7 million of currency
translation. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by
benefits from efficiency and productivity initiatives of $15.3 million, as well
as the absence of $3.0 million of costs incurred in 2005 to terminate a
supplier relationship.   Restructuring
costs included in “Operating expenses” totaled $9.6 million in 2006, as
compared to $15.4 million in 2005.

See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for information on the $38.0 million pretax franchisee litigation
settlement.

Interest
expense of $20.6 million in 2006 was slightly lower than the $21.7 million
incurred in 2005 primarily due to lower average debt levels, including the
October 3, 2005, repayment of $100 million of unsecured 6.625% notes.  The year-over-year decrease in interest
expense was partially offset by the impacts of higher interest rates and $1.8
million of interest expense in 2006 related to the issuance of approximately
$305 million of commercial paper obligations to finance, in part, the November
28, 2006, acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions.  See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for information on the ProQuest Business Solutions acquisition and
Note 10 for information on the commercial paper borrowings.

Other
income (expense) – net was income of $1.6 million in 2006, as compared to income
of $1.7 million in 2005.  This line item
includes the impact of all non-operating items such as interest income,
minority interest, hedging and currency exchange rate transaction gains and
losses, and other miscellaneous non-operating items.  Benefits from higher year-over-year interest
income were offset by foreign exchange losses in 2006, as compared to foreign
exchange gains in 2005.  Minority
interest expense was $3.7 million in 2006, as compared to $3.6 million in 2005.

Snap-on’s
effective tax rate was 31.4% in 2006, as compared with 37.2% in the prior
year.  The lower effective tax rate in
2006 primarily reflects the mix of U.S. and non-U.S. earnings, including the
impacts of the $38.0 million pretax franchisee litigation settlement charge tax
effected at a higher U.S. tax rate, and the reversal of foreign income tax
valuation allowances as a result of foreign restructuring and other
activities.  Snap-on’s effective tax rate
of 37.2% in 2005 included $3.3 million of additional U.S. income tax expense
related to the repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings under the American
Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (“the AJCA”). 
Under the provisions of the AJCA, Snap-on repatriated approximately $93
million of


qualifying
dividends during the second half of 2005. See Note 9 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for further information on income taxes.

Net
earnings in 2006 were $100.1 million, or $1.69 per diluted share, including a
$23.4 million after-tax charge ($0.40 per diluted share) related to the resolution
of the franchisee litigation settlement, as compared with net earnings of $92.9
million, or $1.59 per diluted share, in 2005.

Segment net sales in 2006 increased $30.5 million from
2005 levels including $28.4 million of higher sales and $2.1 million of
currency translation.  Sales in the North
American franchise operations were up 3.1% over 2005 levels, primarily driven
by a significant year-over-year increase in fourth-quarter U.S. sales,
partially offset by a lower average number of U.S. franchisees in 2006.  The average number of U.S. franchisees in
2006 was down 3.0% from 2005 levels.  As the
company continues implementing its strategic initiatives to improve the
franchise system, it anticipates that the decline in the number of U.S.
franchisees will moderate.   In 2006,


international sales were up 3.1% from 2005 levels, largely due to strong
sales growth in the United Kingdom and Australia, and currency translation.

Segment gross profit of
$447.7 million in 2006 was up slightly from $445.6 million in 2005.  The $2.1 million increase in 2006 gross
profit primarily reflects the higher sales and selling prices, as well as lower
costs of $17.3 million from efficiency and productivity initiatives.  These increases were partially offset by
higher production costs, and $10.5 million of increased year-over-year LIFO and
other inventory expenses, including a $1.0 million charge related to LIFO
inventories in 2006, versus a comparable $8.8 million benefit in 2005.  Snap-on also incurred $2.0 million of
higher restructuring costs in 2006 primarily related to the expected mid-2007
closure of its Johnson City, Tennessee, hand tool facility.  Snap-on expects to phase out production at
the Johnson City facility and transfer production to other Snap-on hand tool
facilities and suppliers.  Gross profit
as a percentage of segment sales was 43.7%, down 110 basis points from 44.8% in
the prior year. Operating expenses in 2006 were up $46.7 million from
prior-year levels, primarily due to the $38.0 million pretax franchisee
litigation settlement charge, $13.3 million of higher costs, including $1.7
million of restructuring-related costs, to support strategic supply chain and
franchise system initiatives, and $5.5 million of higher performance-based
incentive compensation.  These increases
were partially offset by $4.6 million of benefits from cost reduction initiatives
and the absence of $3.0 million of costs incurred in 2005 to terminate a
supplier relationship.  As a result of
these factors, segment operating earnings declined $44.6 million from 2005
levels.

Segment net sales in 2006 increased $62.8 million, or
5.6%, from 2005 levels due to $54.9 million of higher sales and $7.9 million of
currency translation.  The $54.9 million
sales increase primarily reflects growth in emerging markets, higher worldwide
equipment and power tool sales, and increased sales of tools for U.S.
commercial and industrial applications.

Segment gross profit of
$435.7 million in 2006 was up $41.2 million, or 170 basis points as a
percentage of segment sales, over 2005 levels. 
The improvement in 2006 gross profit primarily reflects benefits from
increased sales of higher-margin products and improved pricing, savings of
$16.7 million from productivity and efficiency initiatives, including increased
production and sourcing of materials from lower-cost regions and facilities,
and $2.4 million of currency translation. 
These improvements were partially offset by $5.7 million of higher
restructuring costs, primarily related to manufacturing footprint initiatives
in Europe, and $3.7 million of higher material and production costs.  Operating expenses increased $4.6 million,
but decreased 100 basis points as a percentage of segment sales, from 2005
levels.  The operating expense increase
includes higher sales related expenses, $6.7 million of increased spending to
support the expansion of Snap-on’s sales and manufacturing presence in emerging
growth markets and lower-cost regions, higher performance-based incentive
compensation of $2.1 million, and $1.6 million of currency translation.  These increases were partially offset by $6.5
million of benefits from efficiency and productivity initiatives and $3.6
million of lower restructuring costs.  As
a result of these factors, segment operating earnings in 2006 increased $36.6
million over 2005 levels.

Segment net sales of
$524.5 million in 2006 increased $91.8 million, or 21.2%, from 2005 levels,
largely due to higher sales in the OEM equipment solutions business, $20.4
million of incremental sales for the approximate five-week period following the
company’s November 28, 2006, acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions, and
increased sales of Mitchell1

TM

information
products.  Currency translation
contributed $1.8 million to the year-over-year sales increase.

Segment gross profit of
$202.5 million in 2006 was up $22.7 million from 2005 levels primarily due to
the higher sales, including $11.5 million from the ProQuest Business Solutions
acquisition, and $2.2 million of benefits from efficiency and productivity
initiatives, partially offset by $1.4 million of higher restructuring costs. As
a percentage of segment net sales, gross profit margin of 38.6% was down 300
basis points from 2005 levels, reflecting a shift in product mix that included
higher 2006 sales (and lower relative gross margin) in the OEM equipment
solutions business.  Operating expenses
in 2006 of $140.6 million were up $7.7 million from 2005 levels.  The increase in year-over-year operating
expenses primarily includes $6.7 million of operating expenses from the
ProQuest Business Solutions acquisition and $4.5 million of higher spending to
support strategic growth initiatives, partially offset by $3.3 million of
benefits from efficiency and productivity initiatives.  As a result of these factors, segment
operating earnings in 2006 increased $15.0 million over 2005 levels.

million of operating income on $53.6 million of revenue in 2005.  The decrease in operating income primarily
reflects the impact of lower net interest spreads, partially offset by a 2.9%
increase in year-over-year originations.

Corporate

Snap-on’s general
corporate expenses totaled $53.8 million in 2006, up from $46.4 million in
2005, primarily due to $15.2 million of increased stock-based and
performance-based incentive compensation, including $6.3 million from the
January 1, 2006, adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). 
Increased expenses in 2006 also included $4.2 million of higher
insurance and other costs.  These
increases in expenses were partially offset by $9.5 million of benefits from
cost reduction initiatives.

See Note 14 to the Consolidated

Financial Statements for information on the company’s adoption of SFAS No.

Percentage
Disclosure:  Cost of goods sold, Gross
profit and Operating expenses percentages are calculated as a percentage of Net

Operating income from financial services percentages are calculated as a
percentage of Financial services revenue. 
All other income statement line item percentages are calculated as a
percentage of the sum of Net sales and Financial services revenue.

Net sales in
the fourth quarter of 2006 increased $92.6 million, or 16.4%, from 2005 levels,
including $15.9 million from currency translation.  The $92.6 million increase in net sales
includes higher sales in the Diagnostics & Information Group’s OEM
equipment solutions business, and $20.4 million of sales for the approximate
five-week period from the company’s November 28, 2006, acquisition of ProQuest
Business Solutions.  Sales in the
Commercial & Industrial Group also increased year over year primarily due
to higher sales of equipment worldwide, increased sales of professional tools
in Europe, higher sales of power tools, and continued strong sales growth in
emerging markets.  Sales in the Snap-on
Tools Group increased $28.3 million, or 12.1%, over 2005 levels, largely driven
by strong U.S. sales increases in the North American franchise operations and
higher international sales.

Gross profit in
2006 was $284.4 million, or 43.4% of net sales, as compared to $247.2 million,
or 43.9% of net sales, in 2005.  The
$37.2 million improvement in 2006 gross profit primarily reflects benefits from
higher sales and pricing, as well as benefits from lower costs, including
savings from efficiency, productivity and cost reduction initiatives of $11.3
million, and $6.0 million of lower restructuring costs.  The acquisition of ProQuest Business
Solutions contributed $11.5 million to the year-over-year increase in fourth
quarter gross profit, and currency translation contributed $6.2 million.  These increases were partially offset by a
shift in product mix that included higher sales (and lower relative gross
margin) in the OEM equipment solutions business, $4.9 million of increased
production and material costs, and $11.8 million of higher year-over-year LIFO
related inventory expenses (charges of $4.1 million in 2006 and benefits of
$7.7 million in 2005).

Operating
expenses in 2006 were $230.2 million, as compared to $206.4 million in
2005.  The $23.8 million increase
primarily includes $6.7 million of operating expenses from the business
solutions acquisition, $5.5 million in higher costs for strategic growth
initiatives, $4.3 million of currency translation, $2.8 million of higher
stock-based and performance-based incentive compensation, and increased
volume-related expenses.

Interest expense of $7.0
million in 2006 was up $2.4 million from 2005 levels, primarily due to $1.8
million of higher interest expense related to the issuance of approximately
$305 million of commercial paper obligations to finance, in part, the November
28, 2006, acquisition of business solutions, and higher year-over-year interest
rates.  See Note 2 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for further information on the


ProQuest Business
Solutions acquisition and Note 10 for additional information on the commercial
paper borrowings.

Other income (expense) –
net was income of $1.2 million in 2006, as compared to income of $3.9 million
in 2005.  The decrease in other income
(expense) – net is primarily due to unfavorable year-over-year foreign exchange
transaction losses and higher minority interest expense in 2006, partially
offset by higher interest income.

Snap-on’s
effective tax rate was 28.8% in 2006, as compared with 36.1% in the prior
year.  The lower effective tax rate in
2006 primarily reflects the reversal of certain foreign income tax valuation
allowances.  Snap-on’s effective tax rate
of 36.1% in the fourth quarter of 2005 included $0.5 million of additional U.S.
income tax expense as the actual amount of foreign dividends repatriated
under the AJCA during 2005 was approximately $18 million higher
than earlier estimates.  See Note 9
to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on income
taxes.

Segment net sales in the
fourth quarter of 2006 increased $28.3 million, or 12.1%, from 2005 levels,
including $25.6 million of higher sales and $2.7 million of currency
translation.  In North America, sales
increased 11.7% year over year.  Snap-on
believes the $28.3 million sales increase largely reflects the progress being
made in its efforts to improve both the franchise system and order-fill rates
though the global supply chain.  Sales in
the international franchise operations increased 14.0% year over year, largely
due to growth in the United Kingdom and Australia, and currency translation.

Segment gross profit of
$107.1 million in 2006 was up $4.2 million over 2005 levels primarily due to
the higher sales and selling prices, lower costs of $5.9 million from
efficiency and productivity initiatives, and $1.1 million of currency
translation.  These increases were
partially offset by $11.8 million of higher year-over-year LIFO related
inventory expenses (charges of $4.1 million in 2006 and benefits of $7.7
million in 2005), $4.6 million of higher production, material and other costs,
and $2.1 million of increased restructuring costs related to the expected
mid-2007 closure of the company’s Johnson City hand tool facility.  Operating expenses in 2006 were up $9.6
million from prior-year levels primarily due to higher volume-related expenses,
as well as $2.2 million of higher costs to support strategic supply chain and
franchise system initiatives, $1.3 million of increased performance-based
compensation expense, $0.6 million of currency translation, and $0.5 million of
higher year-over-year restructuring costs. 
As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings in the fourth
quarter of 2006 declined $5.4 million from 2005 levels.

Segment net sales in the
fourth quarter of 2006 increased $39.6 million, or 14.2%, from 2005 levels,
including $28.1 million of higher sales and $11.5 million of currency
translation.  The $28.1 million sales
increase primarily reflects higher sales of equipment products worldwide,
increased sales of professional tools in Europe, higher sales of power tools,
and continued strong sales growth in emerging markets.

Segment gross profit of
$116.6 million in 2006 was up $16.5 million over 2005 levels.  The improvement in gross profit primarily
reflects benefits from increased sales of higher-margin products and improved
pricing, savings of $5.4 million from productivity and efficiency initiatives,
including increased production and sourcing of materials from lower-cost
regions and facilities, and $4.4 million of currency translation.  These improvements were partially offset by
$3.9 million of higher restructuring costs, primarily related to manufacturing
footprint initiatives in Europe. 
Operating expenses of $84.4 million were up $7.2 million from 2005
levels, but improved 120 basis points as a percentage of segment sales.  The increase in operating expenses primarily
includes higher volume-related expenses, $3.0 million of currency translation,
and $1.6 million of increased spending to support the expansion of the company’s
sales and manufacturing presence in emerging growth markets and lower
cost-regions.   As a result of these
factors, segment operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2006 increased
$9.3 million over 2005 levels.

Segment net sales of
$144.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 increased $44.0 million, or 43.7%,
from 2005 levels, largely due to higher sales in the OEM equipment solutions
business, $20.4 million of sales

for the approximate five-week period

from the November 28, 2006,
acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions, and increased sales of

Mitchell1

information products.  Currency translation also contributed $2.1
million to the year-over-year sales increase.

Segment
gross profit of $60.7 million in 2006 increased $16.5 million from 2005 levels
primarily due to the higher sales, including $11.5 million from the acquisition
of business solutions.  As a percentage
of segment net sales, the gross profit margin of 41.9% was down 200 basis
points from 2005 levels, reflecting a shift in product mix that included higher
2006 sales (and lower relative gross margin) in the OEM equipment solutions
business, partially offset by the higher relative gross margin impact from
business solutions.  Operating expenses
of $39.4 million were up $7.3 million from 2005 levels.  The increase in operating expenses primarily
reflects $6.7 million of operating expenses for the business solutions
acquisition and $1.7 million of higher strategic growth spending, partially
offset by $1.5 million of benefits


from
efficiency and productivity initiatives. 
As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings in the fourth
quarter of 2006 increased $9.2 million over 2005 levels.

Operating income was $5.0
million on $14.8 million of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2006, as compared
with $2.8 million of operating income on $10.2 million of revenue in 2005.  The increase in operating income primarily
reflects the impacts of reduced loan losses and higher effective yields.   Originations in the fourth quarter of 2006
were essentially flat with prior-year levels.

Corporate

Snap-on’s general
corporate expenses totaled $14.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, down
slightly from the $14.8 million incurred in the fourth quarter of 2005.  The year-over-year decrease in expenses
primarily includes savings of $1.8 million from cost reduction initiatives,
partially offset by $1.6 million of increased stock-based and performance-based
incentive compensation, including $1.1 million from the January 1, 2006, adoption
of SFAS No. 123(R).

Disclosure:  Cost of goods sold, Gross
profit and Operating expenses percentages are calculated as a percentage of Net

All other income statement line item percentages are calculated as a
percentage of the sum of Net sales and Financial services revenue.

Net sales in
2005 decreased $20.5 million, or 0.9%, from 2004 levels due to $33.1 million of
lower sales partially offset by $12.6 million of currency translation.  The $33.1 million sales decline principally
reflects the impact of lower sales in the company’s North American franchise
operations along with lower sales in the OEM


equipment
solutions and worldwide equipment businesses, partially offset by increased
sales of tools for industrial and commercial applications, including growth in
emerging markets, and higher international franchise sales.

Gross profit
was $1,019.9 million, or 44.2% of net sales, in 2005, as compared to $1,009.3
million, or 43.3% of net sales, in 2004. 
The $10.6 million, or 90 basis points as a percentage of net sales,
improvement in year-over-year gross profit primarily reflects benefits from
higher selling prices and lower costs, including benefits from efficiency and
productivity initiatives of $15.4 million, higher LIFO inventory benefits of
$5.6 million, $3.2 million of currency translation, and $2.5 million of lower
pension, postretirement and insurance expenses due, in part, to favorable
demographic changes in the company’s U.S. hourly pension plans, including a
decline in the number of participants. 
These year-over-year improvements in gross profit were partially offset
by the impact of the lower sales volume, higher production costs in U.S.
manufacturing facilities to improve order-fill rates, and $22.3 million of
higher steel costs.  Restructuring costs
included in “Cost of goods sold” totaled $3.0 million in 2005, as compared to
$16.0 million in 2004.

Operating expenses in 2005 decreased $33.5 million, or
110 basis points as a percentage of net sales, from 2004 levels.  The decline in year-over-year operating
expenses primarily reflects benefits of $41.4 million from efficiency and cost
reduction initiatives, $12.7 million of lower bad debt expense and franchise
termination costs, as well as the absence, in 2005, of both the $3.6 million
charge for the U.S. General Services Administration (“GSA”) settlement and $3.3
million of severance costs related to the November 2004 resignation of the
company’s former chairman, president and chief executive officer (“former
officer”).  These decreases were
partially offset by $6.9 million of higher pension, postretirement and
insurance expenses, primarily due to demographic and actuarial assumption
changes in the company’s U.S. salaried pension plans, $5.0 million of higher
freight costs, largely due to fuel surcharges and more frequent shipments to
franchisees, $4.0 million of currency translation, and $3.0 million of costs to
terminate a supplier relationship. 
Restructuring costs included in “Operating expenses” totaled $16.3
million in 2005, as compared to $5.7 million in 2004.

Interest expense of $21.7
million in 2005 was lower than the $23.0 million incurred in 2004 primarily due
to benefits from lower average debt levels, including the fourth-quarter 2005
repayment of $100 million of unsecured 6.625% notes on October 3, 2005,
partially offset by the impact of higher year-over-year interest rates.

Other income (expense) –
net was income of $1.7 million in 2005, as compared to income of $1.1 million
in 2004.  Benefits from higher
year-over-year interest income and foreign exchange gains in 2005, as compared
with foreign exchange losses in 2004, were partially offset by an increase in
minority interest expense.  Minority
interest expense was $3.6 million in 2005, as compared to $2.0 million in 2004.

Snap-on’s effective tax
rate of 37.2% for 2005 included $3.3 million of additional U.S. income tax
expense related to the repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings under the
AJCA.  Under the provisions of the AJCA,
Snap-on repatriated approximately $93 million of qualifying dividends during
the second half of 2005. Snap-on’s effective tax rate of 32.1% in 2004
benefited from the conclusion of prior-year tax matters.

Segment net sales in 2005
decreased $26.1 million, or 2.6%, from 2004 levels.  The year-over-year decrease reflects $30.8
million of lower sales, primarily due to a lower average number of U.S.
franchise vans in operation in 2005, partially offset by higher sales in
international markets and $4.7 million of currency translation.  The number of U.S. franchise vans in
operation at December 31, 2005, was down 5.8% from year-end 2004 levels.

Segment gross profit in
2005 decreased $1.6 million, but increased 100 basis points as a percentage of
segment sales, from 2004 levels.  The
$1.6 million decrease reflects the impact of the lower sales, higher production
costs in U.S. manufacturing facilities to improve order-fill rates and $9.8
million of higher steel costs. These declines were partially offset by benefits
from higher selling prices, an improved mix of higher-margin diagnostics
products, and lower depreciation, largely due to the absence of depreciation
related to two U.S. hand-tool facility closures in 2004.  Gross profit in 2005 also benefited from $5.6
million of higher year-over-year LIFO inventory benefits, $8.5 million in lower
restructuring costs, $2.5 million of currency translation and $2.2 million of
lower pension, postretirement and insurance costs.  Operating expenses decreased $3.4 million
year over year, but increased 60 basis points as a percentage of segment sales.
The year-over-year decrease primarily includes benefits from efficiency and
cost reduction initiatives of $9.1 million, lower bad debt expense and
franchisee termination costs of $4.4 million, and the operating expense impact
from lower sales. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset
by $4.8 million in higher restructuring costs related to 2005 severance
actions, $3.0 million of costs incurred in the first quarter of 2005 to
terminate a supplier relationship, $4.3 million of higher freight costs and
$1.9 million of unfavorable currency translation.  As a result of these factors, segment
operating earnings in 2005 increased $1.8 million, or 40 basis points as a
percentage of segment sales, over prior-year levels.

Segment net sales in 2005
increased $19.0 million, or 1.7%, over 2004 levels.  The year-over-year increase includes $11.1
million from higher sales and $7.9 million of currency translation.  The $11.1 million sales increase primarily
reflects higher sales and pricing of tools for industrial and commercial
applications, including significant growth in emerging markets, and higher
sales as a result of the launch of new power tool products.  These year-over-year increases in sales were
partially offset by lower equipment sales due primarily to a continued soft
European market, the impact from certain discontinued products, and a decline
in equipment servicing revenues.

Segment gross profit in
2005 increased $19.5 million, or 110 basis points as a percentage of segment
sales, over 2004 levels.  Benefits from
higher sales and pricing, as well as lower costs, including benefits from
efficiency and productivity initiatives of $12.5 million and lower
year-over-year restructuring costs of $3.9 million, were partially offset by
$12.5 million of higher steel costs. 
Operating expenses decreased $26.6 million or 300 basis points as a
percentage of segment sales.  The
improvement in year-over-year operating expenses includes benefits from
efficiency and cost reduction initiatives of $20.0 million, lower bad debt
expense of $7.4 million, and the absence of the $3.6 million GSA settlement
charge incurred in 2004.  These
reductions in year-over-year operating expenses were partially offset by $2.2
million of increased freight costs, $2.1 million of unfavorable currency
translation and $1.2 million of lower gains on sales of facilities.  As a result of these factors, segment
operating earnings in 2005 increased $46.1 million over prior-year levels.

Segment net sales in 2005
decreased $54.3 million, or 11.1%, from 2004 levels, including $54.8 million of
lower sales partially offset by $0.5 million of currency translation.  The $54.8 million sales decline primarily
reflects the comparison against the 2004 successful launch of new,

Snap-on

brand diagnostics products, lower sales in the OEM
equipment solutions business and the impact of state emission program updates
that were not repeated in 2005.

Segment gross profit in
2005 decreased $7.3 million, but increased 320 basis points as a percentage of
segment sales, from prior year.  The
impact of lower sales and $1.3 million of higher freight costs was partially
offset by benefits from lower costs, including benefits from efficiency and
productivity initiatives of $4.8 million. Operating expenses decreased $6.9
million, but increased 210 basis points as a percentage of segment sales.  Benefits from continuous improvement actions
of $6.9 million and lower bad debt expense of $2.5 million were partially
offset by $2.7 million of higher year-over-year restructuring costs.  As a result, segment operating earnings in
2005 decreased $0.4 million, but increased 110 basis points as a percentage of
segment sales, from prior-year levels.

Segment revenues and
operating income were $53.6 million and $15.7 million in 2005, down $24.5
million and $18.4 million from prior-year levels, primarily due to the impact
of higher year-over-year interest rates in Snap-on’s domestic financing
business, as well as an 11.4% decline in originations.

Corporate

Snap-on’s general
corporate expenses totaled $46.4 million in 2005, up from $43.0 million in
2004.  Savings realized from cost
reduction initiatives, as well as the absence, in 2005, of

$3.3 million of severance
costs related to the resignation of a former officer,

were more than
offset by higher pension and postretirement costs of $8.8 million primarily due
to demographic and actuarial assumption changes in the company’s U.S. salaried
pension plans, higher mark-to-market and other adjustments on stock-based
incentive and deferred compensation plans of $2.5 million, and higher year-over-year
restructuring costs of $1.3 million.  In
addition, Snap-on’s North-American based Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”)
system became fully depreciated mid 2004, resulting in lower depreciation
expense year over year.

Financial Condition

Snap-on’s growth has historically been funded by a
combination of cash provided by operating activities and debt financing.  Snap-on believes that its cash from
operations, coupled with its sources of borrowings, are sufficient to fund its
anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures,
restructuring activities, acquisitions, common stock repurchases and dividend
payments.  Due to Snap-on’s credit rating
over the years, external funds have been available at a reasonable cost.  As of the close of business on February 16,


2007, Snap-on’s long-term debt and commercial
paper was rated A3 and P-2 by Moody’s Investors Service and A- and A-2 by
Standard & Poor’s.  Snap-on believes
that the strength of its balance sheet, combined with its cash flows from
operating activities, affords the company the financial flexibility to respond
to both internal growth opportunities and those available through acquisitions.

The following discussion focuses on information included
in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Snap-on has been
focused on improving asset utilization by making more effective use of its
investment in certain working capital items. 
The company assesses management’s operating performance and
effectiveness relative to those components of working capital, particularly
accounts receivable and inventories, which are more directly impacted by
operational decisions.

As of December 30, 2006, working capital (current
assets less current liabilities) of $431.2 million was down $135.6 million from
$566.8 million as of December 31, 2005, primarily due to the impacts from the
company’s November 28, 2006, acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions.

The following represents the company’s working capital
position as of December 30, 2006, and December 31, 2005.

Cash at the end of 2006
was $63.4 million, down $107.0 million from year-end 2005 levels.  The decrease in cash from 2005 levels is the
result of disbursing approximately $203 million of available cash on hand to
fund, in part, the acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions.  See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for information on the ProQuest Business Solutions acquisition.

Accounts receivable at
the end of 2006 was $559.2 million, up $73.3 million from year-end 2005 levels,
including $35.0 million from the 2006 business solutions acquisition and $21.0
million of currency translation.  The
year-over-year increase in accounts receivable also reflects the impact of
higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2006, largely driven by increased sales
in the Diagnostic & Information Group’s equipment solutions business.  Days sales outstanding at year-end 2006 was
76 days, as compared with 74 days at year-end 2005.

Inventories totaled
$323.0 million at the end of 2006, up $39.8 million from year-end 2005 levels,
including $15.3 million from currency translation. The year-over-year increase
in inventories primarily reflects the impacts of the company’s decision to
maintain higher inventory levels to better meet customer demand as it proceeds
with implementing its strategic supply chain and other initiatives, and
increased inventory associated with essential equipment and diagnostics
deployments for major OEMs.  Inventories
accounted for using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method as of December 30,
2006, and December 31, 2005, approximated 62% and 63% of total inventories. All
other inventories are accounted for using the LIFO cost method.  The company’s LIFO reserve increased from
$82.1 million at December 31, 2005, to $86.7 million at December 30, 2006.
Inventory turns (full year cost of goods sold divided by the average of the
beginning and ending inventory balances for the year) at December 30, 2006,
were 4.6 turns as compared to 4.1 turns at year-end 2005.


Accounts payable at December
30, 2006, was $178.8 million, up $43.4 million from year-end 2005 levels
primarily due to the timing of payments and higher inventory levels, as well as
$6.3 million from currency translation and $6.1 million from the acquisition of
business solutions.

Notes payable and
long-term debt at December 30, 2006, was $549.2 million, up $322.7 million from
$226.5 million at December 31, 2005, primarily due to the company’s issuance of
approximately $305 million of commercial paper to fund, in part, the company’s
November 28, 2006, acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions.  At December 30, 2006, Snap-on had commercial
paper outstanding of $314.9 million. Snap-on has presented $300.0 million of
the commercial paper as “Long-term debt” on the accompanying December 30, 2006,
Consolidated Balance Sheet.  On January
9, 2007, Snap-on entered into an agreement pursuant to which the company agreed
to sell $300 million of floating and fixed rate notes consisting of $150
million of floating rate notes due in 2010 and $150 million of 5.5% fixed rate
notes due in 2017.  The $300 million
offering of debt securities closed on January 12, 2007.  Snap-on used the net proceeds from the sale
of the notes to repay commercial paper obligations issued to finance the
acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions. As of January 12, 2007, the company
also terminated a $250 million bridge credit agreement that Snap-on established
prior to its acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions.  No commercial paper was outstanding at
December 31, 2005.  Notes payable under
uncommitted lines of credit and other arrangements totaled $28.6 million, at
December 30, 2006, and $20.9 million at December 31, 2005.  Amounts payable to CIT pursuant to a working
capital agreement with SOC totaled $0.1 million at December 30, 2006, and $3.9
million at December 31, 2005. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for information on the company’s acquisition of ProQuest Business
Solutions.

At December 30, 2006,
Snap-on had a $400 million multi-currency revolving credit facility that
terminates on July 27, 2009, and the $250 million bridge credit agreement (discussed
above) that was subsequently terminated on January 12, 2007.  The $400 million credit facility’s financial
covenant requires that Snap-on maintain a ratio of debt to the sum of
total debt plus shareholders’ equity of not greater than 0.60 to 1.00.  As of December 30, 2006, Snap-on believes
that it was in compliance with all covenants of its revolving and bridge credit
facilities.

At December 30, 2006,
Snap-on also had $20 million of unused committed bank lines of credit, of which
$10 million expires on July 29, 2007, and $10 million expires on August 31,
2007.  At December 30, 2006, Snap-on had
approximately $355 million of unused available debt capacity under the terms of
its revolving and bridge credit facilities and its committed bank lines of
credit. As of the close of business on February 16, 2007, Snap-on had
approximately $360 million of unused debt capacity under the terms of its
revolving credit facilities and its committed bank lines of credit.

In August 2001, Snap-on
issued $200 million of unsecured notes that require semiannual interest
payments at the rate of 6.25%; the notes mature in their entirety on August 15,
2011.

Snap-on maintains
sufficient committed lines of credit and liquidity facilities to cover its
expected funding needs on both a short-term and long-term basis.  Snap-on manages its aggregate short-term
borrowings so as not to exceed its availability under its revolving credit
facilities and committed lines of credit. 
The company accesses short-term debt markets, predominantly through
commercial paper issuances, to fund its short-term requirements and to ensure
near-term liquidity.  Near-term liquidity
requirements for Snap-on in 2007 include the funding of its investments in
capital expenditures and restructuring activities, payments for litigation
settlements, payments of dividends, interest and share repurchases.  Snap-on expects to make contributions to its
foreign pension plans in 2007 of $7.5 million; Snap-on is not required to make
a contribution to its domestic pension plans in 2007.  Depending on market and other conditions,
however, Snap-on may elect to make discretionary cash contributions to
its domestic pension plans in 2007.

Snap-on’s long-term
financing strategy is to maintain continuous access to the debt markets to
accommodate its liquidity needs.

See Note 10 to the Consolidated

Financial Statements for further information on Snap-on’s debt and credit
facilities.

The following discussion focuses on information included in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow.


Cash flow provided
from operating activities was $203.4 million in 2006, as compared to $221.1
million in 2005.  The $17.7 million
decrease in cash flow from operating activities in 2006 includes the impacts of
higher levels of accounts receivable, primarily driven by the year-over-year
fourth quarter sales increase, higher inventory levels to better meet customer
demand as the company proceeds with implementing its strategic supply chain and
other initiatives, and increased inventory associated with essential equipment
and diagnostics deployments for major OEMs. 
Cash flow from operating activities in 2004 included a $63.6 million
voluntary U.S. pension contribution and a $10.0 million payment to the U.S.
Department of Justice pursuant to an agreement to resolve a government audit
relating to two contracts with the GSA, partially offset by a $10.7 million
income tax refund, primarily resulting from a fourth-quarter 2003 voluntary
U.S. pension contribution.

Depreciation in 2006 was
$48.5 million, compared with $49.5 million in 2005 and $58.5 million in 2004.
The decline in depreciation from 2004 levels reflects the absence of
depreciation for both the company’s North-American based ERP system, which
became fully depreciated mid-year 2004, and two U.S. hand-tool facilities that
were closed in 2004.  Amortization
expense was $3.4 million in 2006, $2.7 million in 2005 and $2.5 million in
2004.

Capital expenditures in
2006 were $50.5 million, compared to $40.1 million in 2005 and $38.7 million in
2004.  Capital expenditures in all three
years reflect

new
product-related, safety, quality, efficiency and cost-reduction capital
investments, including the installation of new production equipment and machine
tooling to enhance manufacturing and distribution operations, as well as
ongoing replacements of manufacturing and distribution facilities and
equipment.

Capital spending in
2006 included higher levels of spending to support the company’s strategic
supply chain initiatives and for the replacement and enhancement of its
existing global ERP management information system, which began in 2006 and will
continue over a period of several years. 
Snap-on believes that its cash generated from operations, as well as the
funds available from its credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund the
company’s capital expenditure requirements in 2007.

Snap-on has undertaken
stock repurchases from time to time to offset dilution created by shares issued
for employee and dealer stock purchase plans, stock options, and other
corporate purposes, as well as to repurchase shares when the company believes
market conditions are favorable.  In
2006, Snap-on repurchased 2,616,618 shares of common stock for $109.8 million
under its previously announced share repurchase programs.  The cash used to repurchase shares of common
stock was partially offset by $89.5 million of proceeds from stock purchase and
option plan exercises and $10.9 million of related excess tax benefits. As of
December 30, 2006, Snap-on has remaining availability to repurchase up to an
additional $152.1 million in common stock pursuant to the Board of Directors’
authorizations.  The purchase of Snap-on
common stock is at the company’s discretion, subject to prevailing financial
and market conditions.  Snap-on
repurchased 912,100 shares of common stock for $32.1 million in 2005 and
1,200,000 shares of common stock for $38.2 million in 2004.  Snap-on believes that its cash generated from
operations, as well as the funds available from its credit facilities, will be
sufficient to fund the company’s share repurchases in 2007.

On October 3, 2005,
Snap-on repaid its $100 million, 10-year, 6.625% unsecured notes upon their
maturity. The $100 million debt repayment was made with available cash on hand.

Snap-on has paid
consecutive quarterly cash dividends, without interruption or reduction, since
1939.  Cash dividends paid in 2006, 2005
and 2004 totaled $63.6 million, $57.8 million and $57.7 million.  At the beginning of fiscal 2006, the company’s
board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 8% to $0.27 per
share.

$314.9 million in commercial paper borrowings as “Long-term debt” on the
accompanying December 30, 2006, Consolidated Balance Sheet as the company
intended, and had the available debt capacity, to refinance these borrowings on
a long-term basis.  The company has
excluded payments related to its pension and
postretirement benefit plans from the contractual obligation table
above.  See Notes 12 and 13 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the company’s
benefit plans and payments.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The company had no
off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 30, 2006.

Environmental Matters

Snap-on is subject to various federal, state and local government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Snap-on’s policy is to comply with these requirements, and the company believes that, as a general matter, its policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with its business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in some of Snap-on’s operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses.

Snap-on is and has been engaged in the handling, manufacture, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies. The company believes that, as a general matter, its handling, manufacture, use and disposal of these substances are in accordance with environmental laws and regulations. It is possible, however, that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could bring into question the company’s handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these substances.

Consolidated Joint Venture

SOC,
a consolidated, 50%-owned joint venture between Snap-on and CIT, provides a
broad range of financial services to Snap-on’s U.S. franchisee and
customer network and to Snap-on’s industrial and other customers. Snap-on
began consolidating SOC as of the beginning of Snap-on’s 2004 fiscal year, as a
result of the adoption of Financial Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 46R, “

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (an interpretation of ARB
No. 51).”

Prior to fiscal
2004, Snap-on accounted for SOC using the equity method. Snap-on and CIT have
identical voting and participation rights and responsibilities in SOC.

See Notes 1
and 7 to the Consolidated

Financial Statements for further
information on

SOC.

Snap-on
receives royalty and management fee income from SOC based on the volume of
financings originated by SOC.  Snap-on
also shares ratably with CIT in any residual net profit or loss of the joint
venture after operating expenses, including royalty and management fees,
interest costs and credit loss provisions. 
Snap-on provides extended-term financing internationally through its
wholly owned finance subsidiaries.


SOC sells substantially
all of its originated contracts on a limited recourse basis to CIT, net of
certain fees, and SOC continues to service these contracts for an estimated
market-rate servicing fee.  In 2006, SOC
originated contracts totaling $426.8 million, as compared to $413.8 million in
2005 and $481.2 million in 2004.

Other
Matters

Government
Contract Matters

On July 23, 2004, Snap-on reached an agreement
with the U.S. Department of Justice to resolve the government audit relating to
two contracts with the GSA.  Snap-on
agreed to settle the claims over the interpretation and application of the
price reduction and billing provisions of these two contracts for sales from
March 1996 through the July 23, 2004, settlement date for $10.0 million.  Snap-on remitted the $10.0 million cash
settlement to the U.S. Department of Justice on August 5, 2004.  On
August 5, 2005, the GSA notified the company that it would take no
administrative action against Snap-on in connection with the Federal Supply
Schedule contracts referred to above. 
The company considers the matter closed.

Other Legal Matters

On May
16, 2006, Snap-on reached an agreement to settle certain legal matters related
to certain then current and former franchisees on a class basis.

The court
gave its final approval to the class settlement on October 27, 2006.

Under the terms of the
settlement, Snap-on agreed to make

pay

ments
to

claimants

and class
counsel, plus incur certain other

costs and expenses.  Snap-on recorded a
$38.0 million pretax charge in the second quarter of 2006 representing
its best estimate to settle these legal matters.

Snap-on disbursed funds of
approximately $14

million for related legal fees, settlements and other
expenses in the fourth quarter of 2006, and the company expects
to disburse additional amounts, including amounts  to the class
claimants, beginning in the first quarter of 2007.  Snap-on has not
admitted any wrongdoing by way of this settlement.

Snap-on is also involved in various other legal
matters that are being litigated and/or settled in the ordinary course of
business. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of these other
legal matters, management believes that the results will not have a material
impact on Snap-on’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

New Accounting Standards

See Note 1 to the
Consolidated

Financial Statements for information on
new accounting standards.


Critical Accounting Policies

The consolidated financial statements and related notes contain
information that is pertinent to management’s discussion and analysis.  The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  These estimates are generally based on
historical experience, current conditions and on various other assumptions that
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which
form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily available from other sources, as well as identifying
and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and
contingencies.  Actual results could
differ from those estimates.  Snap-on
considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the
judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company’s consolidated
financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company’s
financial position, results of operations and cash flow.

Revenue Recognition:

Snap-on
derives revenue primarily from the sale of tools, diagnostics and equipment
solutions for professional tool and equipment users.  Snap-on markets its products and
services through the worldwide franchise mobile van channel, company direct
sales, and independent distributor and other non-franchise channels, including
its public Internet Web site.  Snap-on
also derives revenue from various financing programs to facilitate the sales of
its products.

Snap-on recognizes revenue from the sale of tools, diagnostics
and equipment solutions when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (i)
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) the price is fixed or
determinable; (iii) collectibility is reasonably assured; and (iv) delivery has
occurred or services have been rendered. 
Delivery generally occurs when the title and the risks and rewards of
ownership have substantially transferred to the customer.  For sales contingent upon customer acceptance
or product installation, revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations
are fulfilled.  As required by SFAS No.
48, “

Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists,”

estimated
product returns are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of
sale based upon historical product return experience and assumptions for the
gross profit margin and volume of future sales returns.  Provisions for customer volume rebates,
discounts and allowances are also recorded as a reduction of reported revenues
at the time of sale based on historical experience and known trends.  Revenue related to maintenance and
subscription agreements is recognized over the term of the agreement.

Financial Services Revenue:

In addition to its sales of tools, diagnostics and equipment solutions,
Snap-on also generates revenue from various financing programs that include
(i) loans to franchisees; and (ii) loans to the franchisees’ customer network
and to Snap-on’s industrial and other customers for the purchase of tools
and equipment on an extended-term payment plan. 
These financing programs are offered through SOC, a consolidated,
50%-owned joint venture with CIT, and the company’s wholly owned international
finance subsidiaries. Financial services revenue consists of SOC’s sales of
originated contracts to CIT and service fee income, as well as installment
contract revenue and franchisee loan receivable revenue derived from SOC and
Snap-on’s wholly owned international finance operations. The decision to
finance through Snap-on or another financing entity is solely at the election
of the customer. When assessing customers for potential financing, Snap-on
considers various factors regarding ability to pay including financial
condition, collateral, debt-servicing ability, past payment experience and
credit bureau information. Contracts originated by SOC and subsequently sold to
CIT are also subject to the underwriting approval of CIT.

Financing revenue from SOC is recognized primarily from the sale of
originated contracts to CIT net of various fees, including securitization,
warehousing, bad debt and prepayment fees. 
SOC continues to service these contracts for an estimated market-rate
servicing fee.  Servicing fees are paid
to SOC by CIT and such revenue is recognized over the contractual term of the
loan, with a portion of the servicing fee recognized at the time of origination.  Financing revenue from originated loans that
are retained is recognized over the life of the contract, with interest
computed on a daily basis.

Snap-on’s wholly owned international finance subsidiaries own all of
the loans originated through their financing programs.  Revenue from interest income is recognized
over the life of the contract, with interest computed on a daily basis.

Franchise fee revenue, including nominal, non-refundable initial and
ongoing monthly fees (primarily for sales and business training and marketing
and product promotion programs), is recognized as the fees are earned.


Allowances for Doubtful Accounts:

Snap-on’s accounts receivable are reported net of estimated bad debt
allowances, which are regularly evaluated by management for adequacy. The
evaluations take into consideration various financial and qualitative factors
that may affect customers’ ability to pay. 
These factors may include customers’ financial condition, collateral,
debt-servicing ability, past payment experience and credit bureau
information.  Snap-on regularly reviews
the allowance estimation process and adjusts the allowances as
appropriate.  It is possible, however,
that the accuracy of Snap-on’s estimation process could be adversely impacted
if the financial condition of its customers were to deteriorate.  The company does not believe that accounts
receivable represent significant concentrations of credit risk because of the
diversified portfolio of individual customers and geographical areas.

Inventory Valuation:

Snap-on values its inventory at the lower of cost or market and adjusts
for the value of inventory that is estimated to be excess, obsolete or
otherwise unmarketable.  Inventory
adjustments for raw materials are largely based on analysis of raw material age
and actual physical inspection of raw material for fitness for use.  As part of evaluating work-in-progress and
finished goods, management reviews individual product SKUs by product category
and product life cycle.  Cost adjustments
for each product category/product life-cycle state are generally established
and maintained based on a combination of historical experience, forecasted
sales and promotions, technological obsolescence, inventory age and other
actual known conditions and circumstances. 
Should actual product marketability and raw material fitness for use be
affected by conditions that are different from management estimates, further
adjustments to inventory allowances may be required.

Warranty Accruals:

Snap-on provides product warranties for specific product lines and accrues for
estimated future warranty costs in the period in which the sale is
recorded.  Snap-on calculates its accrual
requirements based on historic warranty loss experience that is periodically
adjusted for recent actual experience, including the timing of claims during
the warranty period and actual costs incurred.

See Note 16 to the Consolidated

Financial Statements for further information on Snap-on’s warranty accrual.

Pension Benefits:

The
calculation of Snap-on’s pension expense and projected benefit obligation
requires the use of a number of assumptions. 
Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside
of Snap-on’s control and can have a significant effect on the amounts reported
in the financial statements.  Snap-on
believes that the two most critical assumptions are the expected return on plan
assets and the assumed discount rate.

Pension
expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases.  Lowering the expected rate of return
assumption for Snap-on’s domestic pension plan assets by 0.5% would
increase Snap-on’s 2006 domestic pension expense by approximately $3.3
million.  At year-end 2006, Snap-on’s
domestic plan assets comprised approximately 88% of Snap-on’s worldwide pension
plan assets.  See Note 12 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on Snap-on’s pension
plans.

Snap-on
establishes the discount rate using the current rates earned on long-term bonds
with a Moody’s Aa rating.  Pension
expense and projected benefit obligation both increase as the discount rate is
reduced.  Lowering Snap-on’s domestic
discount rate assumption by 0.5% would increase Snap-on’s 2006 domestic pension
expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately $3.8 million and
$40.8 million, respectively.  At year-end
2006, Snap-on’s domestic projected benefit obligation comprised approximately
82% of Snap-on’s worldwide projected benefit obligation.

Income Taxes:

The company
records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more
likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized.  While the company has
considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax
strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these
estimates and assumptions change in the future, the company may be required to
adjust its valuation allowance.  This
could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such
determination is made.

In
addition, the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is
subject to audit in these jurisdictions. 
The company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits,
and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each
matter.

Stock-based Compensation:

Effective January 1, 2006, the company adopted SFAS No. 123(R), “

Share-Based Payment

,” using the modified prospective
method.  SFAS No. 123(R) requires
entities to recognize the cost of employee services in exchange for awards of
equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of those awards (with
limited exceptions).  That cost, based on
the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest, will be recognized
over the period during which the employee is required to provide the service in
exchange for the award.  No compensation
cost is recognized for awards for which employees do


not render the requisite service. 
Upon adoption, the grant-date fair value of employee share options and
similar instruments was estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model.

The Black-Scholes valuation model requires the input of highly
subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the stock-based award
and stock price volatility. The assumptions used are management’s best
estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application
of management judgment. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, the
recorded and pro forma stock-based compensation expense could have been
materially different from that depicted in the financial statements.

Outlook

Snap-on
anticipates operating and earnings improvements in 2007. Snap-on will continue
implementing its strategic and rapid continuous improvement initiatives in
2007, including its focus on product innovation, strengthening the franchise
proposition, enhancing customer service, improving manufacturing and process
effectiveness, lowering administrative costs, and pursuing growth initiatives.

Snap-on
expects to incur approximately $26 million to $30 million of restructuring
costs in 2007, up from $22 million in 2006, as part of its ongoing efforts to
lower its cost structure and improve process effectiveness. Snap-on anticipates
2007 capital expenditures to be in a range of $50 million to $60 million, and
depreciation and amortization expense, including higher levels of intangible
amortization from the business solutions acquisition, to be in a range of $70
million to $75 million. As a result of higher debt levels from the business
solutions acquisition, Snap-on anticipates incurring approximately $18 million
to $20 million of higher year-over-year interest expense in 2007. Snap-on
believes its 2007 effective tax rate will approximate 34.5%.


Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk

Market, Credit and Economic Risks

Market risk is the potential economic loss that may
result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments.  Snap-on is exposed to market risk from
changes in both foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.  Snap-on monitors its exposure to these risks
and attempts to manage the underlying economic exposures through the use of
financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap
agreements.  Snap-on does not use
derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes.  Snap-on’s broad-based business activities
help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related
areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole.  Snap-on’s management takes an active role in
the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that
require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the
identification, assessment and control of various risks.

Foreign Currency Risk Management

Snap-on has significant international operations and is
subject to certain risks inherent with foreign operations that include currency
fluctuations and restrictions on movement of funds. Foreign exchange risk
exists to the extent that Snap-on has payment obligations or receipts
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.  To manage these exposures, Snap-on identifies
naturally offsetting positions and then generally purchases hedging instruments
to protect the residual net anticipated exposures.  Snap-on’s financial position and results of
operations have not been materially affected by such events to date.

See Note 11
to the Consolidated

Financial Statements for further
information on

foreign currency risk management.

Interest Rate Risk Management

Snap-on’s interest rate risk management policies are
designed to reduce the potential earnings volatility that could arise from
changes in interest rates. Through the use of interest rate swaps, Snap-on aims
to stabilize funding costs by managing the exposure created by the differing
maturities and interest rate structures of Snap-on’s assets and
liabilities.

See Note 11 to the Consolidated

Financial Statements for further information on

interest rate risk management.

Snap-on utilizes a Value-at-Risk (“VAR”) model to
determine the potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate and
foreign exchange-sensitive financial instruments from adverse changes in market
factors. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions
and a 95% confidence level. Snap-on’s computations are based on the
inter-relationships among movements in various currencies and interest rates
(variance/co-variance technique). These inter-relationships were determined by
observing interest rate and foreign currency market changes over the preceding
quarter.

The estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair
value, calculated using the VAR model, at December 30, 2006, was $0.3 million
on interest rate-sensitive financial instruments and $0.2 million on foreign
currency-sensitive financial instruments. 
The VAR model is a risk management tool and does not purport to
represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by Snap-on, nor
does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors.

Credit Risk

Credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer’s
failure to make payments according to contract terms.  Prior to granting credit, each customer is
evaluated, taking into consideration the borrower’s financial condition,
collateral, debt-servicing ability, past payment experience, credit bureau
information and other financial and qualitative factors that may affect the
borrower’s ability to repay.  Specific
credit reviews and standard industry credit scoring models are used in
performing this evaluation. Loans that have been granted are typically
monitored through an asset-quality-review process that closely monitors past
due accounts and initiates collection actions when appropriate.  In addition to its direct credit risk
exposure, Snap-on also has credit risk exposure for certain SOC loan
originations with recourse provisions against Snap-on (primarily for franchisee
van loans).  At December 30, 2006, $16.2
million of loans originated by SOC have a recourse provision to Snap-on if the
loans become more than 90 days past due.

For additional information on SOC, refer to the section entitled “Consolidated
Joint Venture” in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Notes 1 and 7
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.


Commodity Risk

The company is a purchaser of certain commodities such
as steel, natural gas and electricity. 
The company is also a purchaser of components and parts that are
integrated into the company’s end products, as well as the purchaser of
certain finished goods, all of which may contain various commodities including
steel, aluminum and others.  Snap-on’s
supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily
available from numerous suppliers.

The principal raw
material used in the manufacture of our products is steel, which we purchase in
competitive, price-sensitive markets. To meet Snap-on’s high quality standards,
our steel needs range from specialized alloys, which are available only from a
limited group of approved suppliers, to commodity types of alloys. These raw
materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality. Some of
these materials have been, and in the future may be, in short supply. As some
steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures, we could experience
inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on
short notice.  Additionally, unexpected
price increases could result in higher prices to our customers or an erosion of
the margins on our products.

We believe our ability to
sell our products is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road, the
number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles. These factors affect
the frequency, type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by
technicians, and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians, the
prosperity of the technicians and, subsequently, the demand the technicians
have for our tools, other products and services, and the value they place on
those products and services. To the extent that gasoline prices increase,
consumers may turn to other, non-gasoline based, methods of transportation,
including more frequent use of public transportation.  A decrease in the use of gasoline consuming
vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for our products.

To the extent that commodity prices increase and the
company does not have firm pricing agreements with its suppliers, the company
may experience margin declines to the extent that it is not able to
increase the selling prices of its products.

Supplementary Data

Item 9:

Disclosure

Item 9A: Controls and Procedures

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Snap on maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures that
is designed to provide reasonable assurance that material information relating
to the company and its consolidated subsidiaries is timely communicated to the
officers who certify Snap on’s financial reports and to other members of senior
management and the Board of Directors, as appropriate.

In accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (the “Exchange Act”), the company’s management evaluated, with the
participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the company’s disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of
December 30, 2006.  Based upon their
evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and
procedures were effective as of December 30, 2006 to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the
time period specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and
forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company
in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and
principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.

Changes in Internal Control

There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that
occurred during the quarter ended December 30, 2006, that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Snap on’s internal
control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).  Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission in

Internal Control –
Integrated Framework

. As permitted by the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board auditing standards, the company’s November 28, 2006,
acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions (which represented 23.7% of total assets
at December 30, 2006, and less than 1% of 2006 net sales) was excluded from the
scope of management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting
as of December 30, 2006.  Based on this
assessment, the company’s management believes that, as of December 30, 2006,
our internal control over financial reporting was effective.

Management’s
assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial
reporting as of December 30, 2006, has been audited by Deloitte & Touche
LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their
report, which is included herein.

Our
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent
all error or fraud.  Because of inherent
limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide
only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Further, because of changes in conditions,
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
of

Snap-on Incorporated:

We have audited management’s assessment,
included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting, that Snap-on Incorporated and subsidiaries (the “Company”)
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
30, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission. As described in Management’s Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its
assessment the internal control over financial reporting at ProQuest Business
Solutions, which was acquired on November 28, 2006, and whose financial
statements constitute 23.7 percent of net assets as of December 30, 2006 and
less than 1 percent of 2006 net sales. Accordingly, our audit did not include
the internal control over financial reporting at ProQuest Business Solutions.
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting.  Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audit
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors,
management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of
internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of
collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements
due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal
control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that
the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment
that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 30, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on
the criteria established in

Internal Control—

Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2006,
based on the criteria established in

Internal
Control

–

Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 30,
2006, of the Company and our report dated February 19, 2007, expressed an
unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an explanatory
paragraph relating to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123(R),

REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Snap-on Incorporated:

We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Snap-on Incorporated and
subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, and
the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders’ equity and
comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 30, 2006. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, such
consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Snap-on Incorporated and subsidiaries as of December 30,
2006 and December 31, 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2006, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.

As described in Notes 1
and 14 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2006, the
Company changed its method of accounting for share-based compensation to adopt
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),

Share-Based
Payment.

As described in Notes 1, 12 and 13 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company recognized the funded status of its benefit
plans in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans

–

an amendment of FASB
Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)

, as of December 30,

We have also audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 30, 2006, based on the criteria established
in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


Note 1:

Summary of Accounting Policies

Principles
of consolidation and presentation:

The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of Snap-on Incorporated (“Snap-on” or “the
company”), its majority-owned subsidiaries, and Snap-on Credit LLC (“SOC”), a
50%-owned joint venture with The CIT Group, Inc. (“CIT”).  The consolidated financial statements do not
include the accounts of the company’s independent franchisees.  Snap-on’s consolidated financial statements
are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). 
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated.  Certain prior-year amounts
on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings have been reclassified to conform to
the current-year presentation.

Fiscal
year accounting period:

Snap-on’s fiscal year ends on the
Saturday nearest December 31. The 2006, 2005 and 2004 fiscal years each
contained 52 weeks and ended on December 30, 2006, December 31, 2005, and
January 1, 2005, respectively.

Use of
estimates:

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue recognition:

Snap-on derives revenue primarily from the sale of tools, diagnostics and
equipment solutions for professional users. 
Snap-on markets its products and services through the worldwide
franchise mobile van channel, company direct sales, and independent distributor
and other non-franchise channels, including its public Internet Web site.  Snap-on also derives revenue from
various financing programs to facilitate the sales of its products.

Snap-on recognizes
revenue from the sale of tools, diagnostics and equipment solutions when all of
the following conditions are satisfied: (i) persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists; (ii) the price is fixed or determinable; (iii)
collectibility is reasonably assured; and (iv) delivery has occurred or
services have been rendered.  Delivery
generally occurs when the title and the risks and rewards of ownership have
substantially transferred to the customer. 
For sales contingent upon customer acceptance or product installation,
revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations are fulfilled.  As required by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 48, “

Revenue Recognition When
Right of Return Exists,”

estimated product returns are recorded as a
reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale based upon historical
product return experience and assumptions for the gross profit margin and
volume of future sales returns. 
Provisions for customer volume rebates, discounts and allowances are
also recorded as a reduction of reported revenues at the time of sale based on
historical experience and known trends. 
Revenue related to maintenance and subscription agreements is recognized
over the term of the agreement.

Financial services revenue:

In addition to its
sales of tools, diagnostics and equipment solutions, Snap-on also
generates revenue from various financing programs that include (i) loans to
franchisees; and (ii) loans to the franchisees’ customer network and to Snap-on’s
industrial and other customers for the purchase of tools and equipment on an
extended-term payment plan.  These financing
programs are offered through SOC and the company’s wholly owned international
finance subsidiaries.  Financial services
revenue consists of SOC’s sales of originated contracts to CIT and service fee
income, as well as installment contract revenue and franchisee loan receivable
revenue derived from SOC and Snap-on’s wholly owned international finance
operations.  The decision to finance
through Snap-on or another financing entity is solely at the election of the
customer.  When assessing customers for
potential financing, Snap-on considers various factors regarding ability to pay
including financial condition, collateral, debt-servicing ability, past payment
experience and credit bureau information. 
Contracts originated by SOC and subsequently sold to CIT are also
subject to the underwriting approval of CIT.

Financing revenue from
SOC is recognized primarily from the sale of originated contracts to CIT net of
various fees, including securitization, warehousing, bad debt and prepayment
fees.  SOC continues to service these
contracts for an estimated market-rate servicing fee.  Servicing fees are paid to SOC by CIT and
such revenue is recognized over the contractual term of the loan, with a
portion of the servicing fee recognized at the time of origination.  Financing revenue from originated loans that
are retained is recognized over the life of the contract, with interest
computed on a daily basis.


Snap-on’s wholly owned
international finance subsidiaries own all of the loans originated through
their financing programs.  Revenue from
interest income is recognized over the life of the contract, with interest
computed on a daily basis.

Franchise fee revenue,
including nominal, non-refundable initial and ongoing monthly fees (primarily
for sales and business training and marketing and product promotion programs),
is recognized as the fees are earned.

Research
and engineering:

Research and engineering costs are charged
to expense in the year incurred. For 2006, 2005 and 2004, research and
engineering costs totaled $45.7 million, $50.0 million and $58.2 million.

Shipping
and handling:

Amounts billed to customers for shipping and
handling are included as a component of sales. 
Costs incurred by Snap-on for shipping and handling are generally
included as a component of cost of goods sold when the costs relate to
manufacturing activities.  In 2006, 2005
and 2004, Snap-on incurred shipping and handling charges of $21.5 million,
$17.9 million and $17.0 million that were recorded in “Cost of goods sold” on
the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  Shipping and handling costs incurred in
conjunction with selling or distribution activities are generally included as a
component of operating expenses.  In
2006, 2005 and 2004, Snap-on incurred shipping and handling charges of $66.3
million, $62.6 million and $57.8 million that were recorded in “Operating
expenses” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Advertising
and promotion:

Production costs of future media advertising
are deferred until the advertising occurs. 
All other advertising and promotion costs are generally expensed when
incurred. For 2006, 2005 and 2004, advertising and promotion expense totaled
$56.4 million, $47.1 million and $49.8 million.

Warranties:

Snap-on provides product warranties for specific product lines and accrues for
estimated future warranty costs in the period in which the sale is
recorded.  See Note 16 for further
information on warranties.

Minority
interest:

Minority interest in income of consolidated
subsidiaries for 2006, 2005 and 2004 totaled $3.7 million, $3.6 million and
$2.0 million and is included in “Other income (expense) – net” on the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. At the end of 2006 and 2005,
minority interest in subsidiaries totaled $16.8 million and $16.4 million and
is included in “Other long-term liabilities” on the accompanying Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

Foreign
currency translation:

The financial statements of Snap-on’s
foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with SFAS
No. 52,

“Foreign Currency Translation.”

Assets and liabilities of foreign
subsidiaries are translated at current rates of exchange, and income and
expense items are translated at the average exchange rate for the period. The
resulting translation adjustments are recorded directly into “Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss)” in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Foreign exchange transactions resulted in a pretax loss of $1.2 million in
2006, a pretax gain of $0.7 million in 2005 and a pretax loss of $0.7 million
in 2004.  Foreign exchange transaction
gains and losses are reported in “Other income (expense) - net” on the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings

.

Income
taxes:

Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary
differences arising from differences in bases of assets and liabilities for tax
and financial reporting purposes. 
Deferred income taxes are recorded on temporary differences at the tax
rate expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. See Note
9 for further information on income taxes.

Per
share data:

Basic earnings per share calculations were
computed by dividing net earnings by the corresponding weighted-average number
of common shares outstanding for the period. The dilutive effect of the
potential exercise of outstanding options to purchase common shares is
calculated using the treasury stock method. 
Snap-on had dilutive shares as of year-end 2006, 2005 and 2004, of
911,697 shares, 584,222 shares  and
448,098 shares.  Options to purchase
23,000 shares, 612,892 shares and 2,352,111 shares of Snap-on common stock at
year-end 2006, 2005 and 2004 were not included in the computation of diluted
earnings per share as the exercise prices of the options were greater than the
average market price of the common stock for the respective year and, as a
result, the effect on earnings per share would be anti-dilutive.

Stock-based compensation:

Effective January 1, 2006, the company adopted SFAS No. 123(R),

“Share-Based Payment,”

using the modified prospective
method.  SFAS No. 123(R) requires
entities to recognize the


cost of employee services
in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value
of those awards (with limited exceptions). 
That cost, based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to
vest, will be recognized over the period during which the employee is required
to provide the service in exchange for the award.  No compensation cost is recognized for awards
for which employees do not render the requisite service.  Upon adoption, the grant-date fair value of
employee share options and similar instruments was estimated using the
Black-Scholes valuation model.

The Black-Scholes
valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including
the expected life of the stock-based award and stock price volatility. The
assumptions used are management’s best estimates, but the estimates involve
inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result,
if other assumptions had been used, the recorded and pro forma stock-based
compensation expense could have been materially different from that depicted in
the financial statements.

Derivatives:

Snap-on utilizes derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps
and foreign exchange contracts, to manage its exposure to interest rate and
foreign currency exchange rate risks. 
Snap-on accounts for its derivatives in accordance with SFAS No. 133,

“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,”

as amended by SFAS No. 138 and SFAS No. 149.  Snap-on does not hold or issue financial
instruments for speculative or trading purposes. See Note 11 for further
information on derivatives.

Concentrations:

Snap-on is exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by the
counterparties to its interest rate swap and foreign exchange contracts.  Snap-on does not obtain collateral or other
security to support its financial instruments subject to credit risk, but monitors
the credit standing of the counterparties and enters into agreements only with
financial institution counterparties with a credit rating of A- or better.  Snap-on does not anticipate non-performance
by its counterparties.

Snap-on’s accounts
receivable do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk because
of the diversified portfolio of individual customers and geographic areas.

Approximately
3,200 employees, or 26% of Snap-on’s worldwide workforce, are represented by
unions and/or covered under collective bargaining agreements.  Approximately 1,560 employees are covered
under agreements expiring in 2007.  In
recent years, Snap-on has not experienced any significant work slow-downs,
stoppages or other labor disruptions.

Cash
equivalents:

Snap-on considers all highly liquid investments
with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash
equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates market value.

Accounts
receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts:

Accounts
receivable are carried at face value less an estimated allowance for doubtful
accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is established and periodically
updated based upon known bad debt risks and estimates of potential
uncollectible accounts receivable based upon past loss history, customer
payment practices and economic conditions. 
Actual collection experience may differ from the current estimate of net
receivables.  A change to the allowance
for doubtful accounts may be required if future events or other changes in
circumstances result in a change in the estimate of the ultimate collectibility
of a specific account or accounts.

Inventories:

Snap-on
adopted the LIFO inventory valuation method in 1973 for its U.S.
locations.  Snap-on’s U.S.
inventories accounted for on LIFO consist of purchased product and inventory
manufactured at the company’s heritage U.S. manufacturing facilities (primarily
hand tools and tool storage).  As Snap-on
began acquiring businesses in the 1990’s, the company retained the FIFO
inventory valuation methodology used by the predecessor businesses prior to
their acquisition by Snap-on; the company does not adopt the LIFO inventory
valuation methodology for new acquisitions. 
See Note 4 for further information on inventories.

Property
and equipment:

Property and equipment is stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are
provided on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives. Major repairs
that extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized, while routine maintenance
and repairs are expensed as incurred. 
Capitalized software included in property and equipment reflects costs
related to internally developed or purchased software for internal use and is
amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No. 144, “

Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

.”  See Note 5 for further information on
property and equipment.


Goodwill
and other intangible assets:

SFAS No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,”

requires the testing
of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, at least
annually. Snap-on evaluates annually, and when significant changes in expected
long-term performance or other events arise, the existence of goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment on the basis of whether the assets
are fully recoverable from projected, discounted cash flows of the related
business unit.  See Note 6 for further
information on goodwill and other intangible assets.

New accounting standards

:

Effective January 1, 2006, the company adopted SFAS No.
123(R) using the modified prospective method. 
See Note 14 for information regarding stock-based compensation.

The
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) released SFAS No. 156, “

Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets

,”
to simplify accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing
liabilities. SFAS No. 156 amends SFAS No. 140, “

Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and
Extinguishments of Liabilities

.” 
SFAS No. 156 permits an entity to choose either the amortization method
or the fair value measurement method for measuring each class of separately
recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities after they have been
initially measured at fair value.  SFAS
No. 156 applies to all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities
acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity’s fiscal year that begins
after September 15, 2006. SFAS No. 156 will be effective for Snap-on as
of December 31, 2006, the beginning of the company’s fiscal-2007 year.  The company does not believe the adoption of
SFAS No. 156 will have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial
position or results of operations.

On
July 13, 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN No. 48”) “

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes: an Interpretation of FASB
Statement No. 109

.”  This
interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
recognized in an entity’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
“

Accounting for Income Taxes

.”  FIN No. 48 prescribes a recognition threshold
and measurement principles for financial statement disclosure of tax positions
taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. 
This interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2006.  Snap-on will adopt
FIN No. 48 in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, effective as of December 31,
2006, the beginning of the company’s 2007 fiscal year.  The company is assessing the impact the
adoption of FIN No. 48 will have on the company’s consolidated financial
position and results of operations.

The
FASB released SFAS No. 157, “

Fair Value Measurements,”

to define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expand
disclosures about fair value measurements. 
SFAS No. 157 will be effective for Snap-on as of December 30, 2007, the
beginning of the company’s fiscal-2008 year. 
The company is assessing the impact the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will
have on the company’s consolidated financial position and results of
operations.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, “

Employers’
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Postretirement Plans: an amendment
of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)

,” which requires an
employer to recognize the over-funded or under-funded status of a
single-employer defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in
its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded
status in comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur.  SFAS No. 158 requires an employer to initially
apply the requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan as of
the end of the employer’s fiscal year ending after December 16, 2006.

In addition, SFAS No. 158 also
requires an employer to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of
the date of the employer’s fiscal year-end statement of financial position for
fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008.   Retrospective application of the recognition
and fiscal year-end measurement date provisions of SFAS No. 158 is not
permitted.

The
amounts recognized in Snap-on’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 30,
2006, before applying SFAS No. 158, including amounts required to recognize
additional minimum pension liability, have been adjusted for gains and losses,
prior service costs and credits, and transition assets that have not yet been
included in net periodic benefit costs as of December 30, 2006.  These amounts are recognized on the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity and Comprehensive
Income as components of the ending balance of accumulated other comprehensive
income, net of tax.


The
incremental effects of the initial application of SFAS No. 158 to Snap-on’s
December 30, 2006, Consolidated Balance Sheet were as follows:

Note 2: Acquisitions

On
November 28, 2006, Snap-on acquired the ProQuest Business Solutions business
and certain net assets (collectively, “ProQuest Business Solutions” or “business
solutions”) from ProQuest Company for a preliminary purchase price of $516
million of cash (including an estimated $8 million of transaction costs) and
the assumption of approximately $19 million of debt.  The preliminary purchase price is subject to
a working capital adjustment that is expected to be finalized in the first six
months of 2007.  ProQuest Business
Solutions is headquartered in Richfield, Ohio, and is a world leader in
automotive parts and service information. Its products are aimed at helping
original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and their dealers enhance their
service operations.  Business solutions’
products include integrated software, services and systems that transform
complex technical data for parts catalogs into easily accessed electronic
information (electronic parts catalogs). 
Other business solutions’ products and services include warranty and
management systems and analytics to help dealerships manage and track
performance.

The
ProQuest Business Solutions acquisition was accounted for using the purchase
method of accounting and, accordingly, its operating results were included in
the company’s accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings from the date of
acquisition. The allocation of the excess purchase price, including acquisition
costs, over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed, amounted to $344.6 million on a preliminary basis and has been
recorded as “Goodwill” on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The
preliminary purchase price allocation is based upon the estimated fair values
of the assets and liabilities acquired, and are subject to change upon the
completion of purchase accounting, including the finalization of preliminary
asset valuations.  All of the ProQuest
Business Solutions goodwill was assigned to the company’s Diagnostic &
Information segment and the company preliminarily expects approximately $325 million
of the goodwill to be deductible for tax purposes.


The
company is performing, or engaging a third party business valuation appraiser
to assist in, the valuation of the assets of the ProQuest Business Solutions
acquisition. The following is a summary of the recorded preliminary fair values
of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of ProQuest Business Solutions
as of the date of the acquisition:

In the
first quarter of 2006, the company also acquired the remaining 45% ownership
interest in a joint venture for $0.9 million.

otal
estimated amortization expense expected for each of the next five fiscal years,
based on current levels of intangible assets, including amortization related to identifiable intangible assets acquired in the
ProQuest Business Solutions acquisition (on a preliminary basis) is
approximately $17 million annually.

Note 7:

Snap-on Credit LLC Joint Venture

SOC provides a broad range of
financial services to Snap-on’s U.S. franchisee and franchisees’ customer
network and to Snap-on’s industrial and other customers.  Snap-on receives royalty and management
fee income from SOC based on the volume of financings originated by SOC.  Snap-on also shares ratably with CIT in
any residual net profit or loss of the joint venture after operating expenses,
including royalty and management fees, interest costs and credit loss
provisions.  Snap-on provides extended-term
financing internationally through its wholly owned finance subsidiaries.

SOC sells substantially all of
its originated contracts on a limited recourse basis to CIT, net of certain
fees.  SOC continues to service these
contracts for an estimated market-rate servicing fee.  In 2006, SOC originated contracts totaling
$426.8 million, compared to $413.8 million in 2005 and $481.2 million in 2004.

Snap-on has credit risk
exposure for certain SOC-originated contracts with recourse provisions against Snap-on
(primarily for franchisee van loans).  At
December 30, 2006, and December 31, 2005, $16.2 million and $19.2 million of
loans, with terms ranging from six months to ten years, have a primary recourse
provision to Snap-on if the loans become more than 90 days past due.  The asset value of the collateral underlying
these recourse loans would serve to mitigate Snap-on’s loss in the event of
default.  The estimated fair value of the
guarantees for all loan originations with recourse as of December 30, 2006, was
not material.


CIT
and Snap-on have agreed to lend funds to support SOC’s working capital
requirements on a 50/50 basis.  As of
December 30, 2006, SOC owed both Snap-on and CIT $0.1 million each pursuant to
this agreement.

In
addition to its $2.0 million investment in SOC, Snap-on’s exposure related to
SOC as of December 30, 2006, included the $0.1 million working capital loan and
the recourse obligations on customer financings, both discussed above.

qualified for accrual treatment.  Costs
associated with exit and disposal activities primarily related to headcount
reductions from (i) the realignment of the franchisee support structure; (ii)
the closure of a facility in the Netherlands; (iii) the closure and lease
termination of a facility in the United States; (iv) the transfer of certain
production activities from Sweden to lower-cost regions and emerging markets;
(v) the expected mid-2007 closure of the Johnson City, Tennessee, hand tool
facility; and (vi) various management realignment actions at other Snap-on
facilities.

Exit and disposal accrual
usage of $14.6 million in 2006 consisted of $12.2 million for severance
payments and $2.4 million for facility consolidation or closure costs.  Of the $6.0 million restructuring accrual
balance at December 30, 2006, Snap-on anticipates that approximately $5.6
million will be utilized by the end of 2007; the remaining exit and disposal
accrual usage of $0.4 million will extend beyond 2007 primarily due to
longer-term lease obligations.

Snap-on expects to fund
the remaining cash requirements of its exit and disposal activities with cash
flows from operations and borrowings under the company’s existing credit
facilities.  The estimated costs for the


exit and disposal
activities were based on management’s best business judgment under prevailing
circumstances.

A valuation allowance
totaling $43.7 million, $42.2 million and $43.5 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004
has been established for deferred income tax benefits related to certain
subsidiary loss carryforwards that may not be realized.  Realization of the net deferred tax assets is
dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration.
Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than
not that the net deferred tax asset will be realized. The amount of the net
deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near
term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are
reduced.

In October 2004 the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “AJCA”) was signed into law. The AJCA
created a one-time tax incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate
accumulated foreign earnings by providing a tax deduction of 85% of qualifying
dividends received from foreign affiliates. 
Under the provisions of the AJCA, Snap-on repatriated
approximately $93 million of qualifying dividends in the second half of 2005,
which resulted in additional income tax expense of $3.3 million for the
year.  The undistributed earnings of all
non-U.S. subsidiaries totaled $247.4 million, $173.6 million and $241.2 million
at the end of 2006, 2005 and 2004. Snap-on has not provided any deferred
taxes on these undistributed earnings as it considers the undistributed
earnings to be permanently invested. 
Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax
liability related to these earnings is not practicable.


Note 10:
Short-term and Long-term Debt

Notes payable and
long-term debt at December 30, 2006, was $549.2 million, up $322.7 million from
$226.5 million at December 31, 2005, primarily due to the company’s issuance of
approximately $305 million of commercial paper to fund, in part, the company’s
November 28, 2006, acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions.  At December 30, 2006, Snap-on had commercial
paper outstanding of $314.9 million. Snap-on has presented $300 million of the
commercial paper as “Long-term debt” on the accompanying December 30, 2006,
Consolidated Balance Sheet.  On January
9, 2007, Snap-on entered into an agreement pursuant to which the company agreed
to sell $300 million of floating and fixed rate notes consisting of $150
million of floating rate notes due in 2010 and $150 million of 5.5% fixed rate
notes due in 2017.  The $300 million
offering of debt securities closed on January 12, 2007.  Snap-on used the net proceeds from the sale
of the notes to repay commercial paper obligations issued to finance the
acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions. As of January 12, 2007, the company
also terminated a $250 million bridge credit agreement that Snap-on established
prior to its acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions.  No commercial paper was outstanding at
December 31, 2005.  Notes payable under
uncommitted lines of credit and other arrangements  totaled $28.6 million, at December 30, 2006,
and $20.9 million at December 31, 2005. 
Amounts payable to CIT pursuant to a working capital agreement with SOC
totaled $0.1 million at December 30, 2006, and $3.9 million at December 31,
2005. See Note 2 for information on the company’s acquisition of ProQuest
Business Solutions.

Average
commercial paper and bank notes outstanding were $55.1 million in 2006 and
$15.5 million in 2005.  The
weighted-average interest rate on these instruments was 5.63% in 2006 and 3.77%
in 2005. As of December 30, 2006, and December 31, 2005, the weighted-average
interest rate on outstanding commercial paper and bank notes was 5.42% and
3.68%.

At December 30, 2006,
Snap-on had a $400 million multi-currency revolving credit facility that
terminates on July 27, 2009.  The $400
million credit facility’s financial covenant requires that Snap-on
maintain a ratio of debt to the sum of total debt plus shareholders’ equity of
not greater than 0.60 to 1.00.  As of
December 30, 2006, Snap-on believes that it was in compliance with all
covenants of its revolving and bridge credit facilities.

At December 30, 2006,
Snap-on also had $20 million of unused committed bank lines of credit, of which
$10 million expires on July 29, 2007, and $10 million expires on August 31,
2007.  At December 30, 2006, Snap-on had
approximately $355 million of unused available debt capacity under the terms of
its revolving and bridge credit facilities and its committed bank lines of
credit.

In August 2001, Snap-on
issued $200 million of unsecured notes that require semiannual interest
payments at the rate of 6.25%; the notes mature in their entirety on August 15,
2011.

Snap-on’s long-term debt

Note 11:
Financial Instruments

Snap-on
accounts for its hedging activities under SFAS No. 133,

“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,”

as amended by SFAS No. 138 and SFAS No. 149.  These standards require that all derivative
instruments be reported in the consolidated financial statements at fair
value.  Changes in the fair value of
derivatives are to be recorded each period in earnings or on the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),”
depending on the type of hedged


transaction
and whether the derivative is designated and effective as part of a hedged
transaction. Gains or losses on derivative instruments reported in “Accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss)” must be reclassified as earnings in the
period in which earnings are affected by the underlying hedged item and the
ineffective portion of all hedges must be recognized in earnings in the current
period.

Snap-on uses derivative
instruments to manage well-defined interest rate and foreign currency
exposures. Snap-on does not use derivative instruments for speculative or
trading purposes.  The criteria used to
determine if hedge accounting treatment is appropriate are (i) the designation
of the hedge to an underlying exposure, (ii) whether or not overall risk is
being reduced, and (iii) if there is a correlation between the value of the
derivative instrument and the underlying obligation.  On the date a derivative contract is entered
into, Snap-on designates the derivative as a fair value hedge, a cash
flow hedge, a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, or a natural
hedging instrument whose change in fair value is recognized as an economic
hedge against changes in the values of the hedged item.

Foreign
currency derivative instruments:

Snap-on has operations in a
number of countries that have transactions outside their functional currencies
and, as a result, is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange
rates.  Snap-on also has intercompany
loans to foreign subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies.  Snap-on manages these exposures on a
consolidated basis, which allows for netting of certain exposures to take
advantage of natural offsets.  Forward
exchange contracts are generally used to hedge the net exposures.  Gains or losses on net foreign currency hedges
are intended to offset losses or gains on the underlying net exposures in an
effort to reduce the earnings volatility resulting from fluctuating foreign
currency exchange rates.

At December 30, 2006,
Snap-on had $80.1 million of net foreign exchange forward buy contracts
outstanding comprised of buy contracts of $31.4 million in Swedish kronor,
$23.1 million in euros, $17.8 million in British pounds, $10.9 million in
Australian dollars, $2.3 million in Japanese yen, $2.1 million in Norwegian
kroner, and $3.4 million in other currencies, and sell contracts of $7.0
million in Canadian dollars and $3.9 million in other currencies.  At December 31, 2005, Snap-on had $38.4
million of net foreign exchange forward buy contracts outstanding comprised of
buy contracts of $50.6 million in Swedish kronor, $3.3 million in Australian
dollars, and $3.0 million in other currencies, and sell contracts of $8.4
million in euros, $5.6 million in Singapore dollars, and $4.5 million in other
currencies.  The majority of Snap-on’s
forward exchange contracts are not designated as hedges under SFAS No.
133.  The fair value changes of these
contracts are reported in earnings as foreign exchange gain or loss, which is
included in “Other income (expense) – net” on the accompanying Consolidated
Statements of Earnings.

Interest
rate swap agreements:

Snap-on enters into interest rate swap
agreements to manage interest costs and risks associated with changing interest
rates. Interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as either cash flow
hedges or fair value hedges. The differentials paid or received on interest
rate swap agreements are recognized as adjustments to interest expense.  For fair value hedges, the effective portion
of the change in fair value of the derivative is recorded in “Long-term debt”
on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, while any ineffective portion
is recorded as an adjustment to interest expense.  For cash flow hedges, the effective portion
of the change in fair value of the derivative is recorded in “Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss),” while any ineffective portion is recorded as an
adjustment to interest expense.  The
notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding and designated as fair value
hedges was $50 million at both December 30, 2006, and December 31, 2005.

Changes in the fair value
of derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting are
reflected as derivative assets or liabilities, with the corresponding gains or
losses reflected in earnings in the period of change.  An offsetting gain or loss is also reflected
in earnings based upon the changes of the fair value of the debt instrument
being hedged.  For all fair value hedges
qualifying for hedge accounting, the net accumulated derivative loss at
December 30, 2006, was $1.9 million.  At
December 30, 2006, the maximum maturity date of any fair value hedge was five
years.  During the years ended December
30, 2006, and December 31, 2005, cash flow hedge and fair value hedge
ineffectiveness was not material.

Fair value
of financial instruments:

SFAS No. 107,

“Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
Instruments,”

requires Snap-on to disclose the fair value of
financial instruments for both on- and off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities
for which it is practicable to estimate that value. The following methods and
assumptions were used in estimating the fair value of financial instruments:

Installment contracts

:
A discounted cash flow analysis was performed over the average life of a
contract using a discount rate currently available to Snap-on adjusted for
credit quality, cost and profit factors. As of December 30, 2006, and December
31, 2005, the fair value was approximately $109 million and $103 million,
versus a book value of $105.0 million and $92.2 million.


Long-term debt

:
The fair value of long-term debt and the $300 million of commercial paper
classified as long term was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis
based on quoted market rates for similar instruments.  As of December 30, 2006, and December 31,
2005, the fair value was approximately $504 million and $211 million, versus a
book value of $500.0 million and $200.0 million.

All other financial instruments

:
The carrying amounts of all cash equivalents, interest rate swaps and forward
exchange contracts approximate fair value based upon quoted market prices or
discounted cash flows.  The fair value of
trade accounts receivable, accounts payable and other financial instruments
approximates carrying value due to their short-term nature.

Note 12: Pension Plans

Snap-on has adopted the
reporting and disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 158 as of December 30,
2006.  Snap-on’s 2005 and 2004
disclosures have not been changed as SFAS No. 158 prohibits retrospective
application.  See Note 1 for further
discussion of SFAS No. 158.

Snap-on has several
non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering most U.S. employees and
certain employees in foreign countries. Snap-on also has foreign contributory
defined benefit pension plans covering certain foreign employees. Retirement
benefits are generally provided based on employees’ years of service and
average earnings or stated amounts for years of service. Normal retirement age
is 65, with provisions for earlier retirement. Snap-on recognizes retirement
plan expenses in accordance with SFAS No. 87, “

Employers’
Accounting for Pensions.

Snap-on’s domestic
pension plans have a long-term investment horizon and a total return strategy
that emphasizes a capital growth objective. 
The long-term investment performance objective for Snap-on’s domestic
plan assets is to achieve net of expense returns that meet or exceed the 8.5%
domestic long-term, rate-of-return-on-assets assumption used for reporting
purposes.

The basis for determining
the overall expected long-term, rate-of-return-on-assets assumption applies a
nominal returns forecasting method.  For
each asset class, future returns are estimated by identifying the premium of
riskier asset classes over lower risk alternatives.  The methodology constructs expected returns
using a “building block” approach to the individual components of total
return.  These forecasts are stated in
both nominal and real (after inflation) terms. 
This process first considers the long-term historical return premium
based on the longest set of data available for each asset class.  These premiums are then adjusted based on
current relative valuation levels and macro-economic conditions.

For risk and correlation
assumptions, the actual experience for each asset class is reviewed for the
longest time period available.  Expected
relationships for a 10 to 20 year time horizon are determined based upon
historical results, with adjustments made for material changes.  For example, expected correlations for
international equities relative to U.S. equities are higher than historical
averages due to the integration of the global economy.

Investments are broadly
diversified to attempt to minimize the risk of large losses.  Since asset allocation is a key determinant
of expected investment returns, assets are periodically rebalanced to the
targeted allocation to correct significant deviations from the asset allocation
policy that are caused by market fluctuations and cash flow.

Snap-on has adopted a
strategic asset allocation policy that is intended to offer the highest
probability of achieving the long-term investment return goal with the lowest
level of risk.  Asset/liability studies
are conducted periodically to determine if any revisions to the strategic asset
allocation policy are indicated.

Snap-on’s foreign pension
plans’ weighted-average asset allocation by asset category and fair value of
plan assets at December 30, 2006, and December 31, 2005, are as follows:

Snap-on’s primary
investment objective for its foreign pension plan assets is to meet the
projected obligations to the beneficiaries over a long period of time, and to
do so in a manner that is consistent with the company’s risk tolerance.  The foreign asset allocation policies
consider the company’s financial


strength and long-term
asset class risk/return expectations, since the obligations are long term in
nature.  The assets are well diversified
and are managed locally by professional investment firms.

The expected long-term
rate of return on foreign plan assets reflects management’s expectations of
long-term average rates of return on funds invested to provide benefits
included in the projected benefit obligations. 
The expected return is based on the outlook for inflation, fixed income
returns and equity returns, while also considering historical returns, asset
allocation and investment strategy.

Snap-on has several
401(k) plans covering certain U.S. employees. 
Snap-on’s employer match to the 401(k) plans is made with cash
contributions.  For 2006, 2005 and 2004,
Snap-on recognized $2.7 million, $2.4 million and $2.3 million of expense
related to its 401(k) plans.

Note 13:
Retiree Health Care

Snap-on has adopted the
reporting and disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 158 as of December 30,
2006.  Snap-on’s 2005 and 2004
disclosures have not been changed as SFAS No. 158 prohibits retrospective
application.  See Note 1 for further
discussion of SFAS No. 158.

Snap-on provides certain
health care benefits for certain retired U.S. employees. The majority of Snap-on’s
U.S. employees become eligible for those benefits if they reach early
retirement age while working for Snap-on; however, the age and service
requirements for eligibility under the plans have been increased for certain
employees hired on and after specified dates since 1992. Generally, most plans
pay stated percentages of covered expenses after a deductible is met. There are
several plan designs, with more recent retirees being covered under a
comprehensive major medical plan. In determining benefits, the plans take into
consideration payments by Medicare and other insurance coverage.

For employees retiring
under the comprehensive major medical plans, retiree contributions are required,
and these plans contain provisions allowing for benefit and coverage changes.
The plans require retirees to contribute either the full cost of the coverage
or amounts estimated to exceed a capped per-retiree annual cost commitment by
Snap-on. Most employees hired since 1994 are required to pay the full cost.
Snap-on does not fund the retiree health care plans.

Effective January 1,
2006, Snap-on established individual, unfunded bookkeeping accounts equal to
the actuarial present value of the capped per-retiree annual cost for certain
U.S. individuals retiring after 1988. 
Retirees are able to self-direct the spending of their account and may
consume, for qualifying medical expenses, the account balance at their discretion.  With the expected reduction in these
individual accounts, liabilities and expense in future years are expected to
decline. This plan change was recognized as a negative plan amendment that
reduced the December 30, 2005, benefit obligation by approximately $2.0
million.  The $2.0 million benefit
obligation reduction is being amortized to income ratably over five years; the
reduction in 2006 and 2005 net periodic benefit cost was less than $0.4 million
and $0.1 million.

Snap-on

one-percentage-point increase in the health care cost trend rate for future
years would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $1.7
million and the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components by
$0.1 million. Conversely, a one-percentage-point decrease in the health care
cost trend rate for future years would decrease the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation by $1.5 million and the aggregate of the service cost and

Note 14: Stock-based Compensation and Other Stock
Plans

Effective January 1,
2006, the company adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective
method. SFAS No. 123(R) requires entities to recognize the cost of employee
services in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant-date
fair value of those awards (with limited exceptions).  That cost, based on the estimated number of
awards that are expected to vest, will be recognized over the period during
which the employee is required to provide the service in exchange for the
award.  No compensation cost is
recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite service.  Upon adoption, the grant-date fair value of
employee share options and similar instruments was estimated using the
Black-Scholes valuation model.

Compensation cost for the
unvested portions of equity-classified awards granted prior to January 1, 2006,
will be recognized in the results of operations over the remaining vesting
periods.  Changes in fair value of
unvested liability instruments during the requisite service period will be
recognized as compensation cost over that service period.  Changes in the fair value of vested liability
instruments during the contractual term will be recognized as an adjustment to
compensation cost in the period of the change in fair value.

Snap-on elected to adopt
the alternative method of calculating the historical pool of windfall tax
benefits as permitted by FASB Staff Position No. FAS123(R)-3, “

Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of
Share-Based Payment Awards

.” 
This is a simplified method to determine the pool of windfall tax
benefits that is used in determining the tax effects of stock compensation in
the results of operations and cash flow reporting for awards that were
outstanding as of the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R).  The realization of tax benefits from
stock-based compensation in excess of amounts recognized for financial
reporting purposes is recognized as a financing activity in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Due to the prospective
adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), results for prior periods have not been
restated.  Snap-on has stock-based
compensation plans under which directors, officers and other eligible employees
receive stock options and other equity-based awards.

Incentive Stock and Awards Plan, as Amended (“2001 Plan”)

The 2001 Plan, which was
approved by shareholders in 2001 and amended and approved by shareholders in
2006, provides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights,
performance share awards and restricted stock awards.  Stock options have also been issued to
nonemployee directors for their services as directors.  As of December 30, 2006, the 2001 Plan has
4,172,256 shares available for future grants. 
Snap-on has undertaken stock repurchases from time to time to
offset dilution created by shares issued for employee and franchisee stock
purchase plans, stock options, and other corporate purposes, as well as to
repurchase shares when market conditions are favorable.

The compensation cost
that has been charged against income for the 2001 Plan at the end of 2006 was
$16.6 million.  The company recorded $5.5
million and $2.4 million of expense related to stock appreciation rights,
performance share awards and restricted stock awards that were valued using the
intrinsic method under Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

,” and related
interpretations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005, and January 1,
2005.  Cash received from option
exercises under all share-based payment arrangements during 2006 was $89.5
million as compared with $31.1 million during 2005 and $23.6 million during
2004.  The tax benefit realized from the
exercise of the share-based payment arrangements were $11.4 million, $3.1
million and $0.2 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004.

Stock
Options

Stock
options are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of
a share of common stock on the date of grant. 
Except for grants to non-employee directors, which vest immediately,
awards generally vest within two years of continuous service and have ten-year
contractual terms from the date of grant. 
The stock option awards granted during 2006 vest in two annual
increments beginning on the first anniversary following the grant date of the
award.

The fair value of each
stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
valuation model.  The company uses
historical data regarding stock option exercise behaviors for different
participating groups to estimate the expected term of options granted (based on
the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding).
Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the company’s
stock for the length of time corresponding to the expected term of the
option.  The expected dividend yield is
based on the company’s historical dividend payments. The risk-free interest
rate is based


on the U.S. treasury
yield curve on the grant date for the expected term of the option.  The following weighted-average assumptions
were used in calculating the fair value of stock options granted during 2006
and 2005, using the Black-Scholes valuation model:

The
weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during 2006, 2005 and
2004 was $10.16, $8.70 and $8.68.  The
intrinsic value of options exercised during 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $29.7
million, $8.5 million and $3.6 million. 
The fair value of stock options vested during 2006, 2005 and 2004 was
$3.5 million, $3.7 million and $2.4 million.

As
of December 30, 2006, there is approximately $3.5 million of unrecognized
compensation cost related to non-vested stock option compensation arrangements
granted under the 2001 Plan that is expected to be recognized as a charge to
earnings over a weighted-average period of 1.1 years.

Performance
Awards

Performance awards
granted under the 2006 long-term incentive award program are earned over a
contractual term of three years.  Vesting
of the performance awards under the 2006 plan will be dependent upon
performance relative to pre-defined goals for revenue growth and return on
assets for the years 2006 through 2008. 
Based on Snap-on’s performance relative to these goals, the
recipient can earn up to 100% of the performance awards.  For performance achieved above a certain
level, the recipient may earn cash awards in addition to the performance
awards, not to exceed 50% of the number of performance awards initially
granted.  Cash awards related to the 2006
restricted performance shares represent the right to receive cash of $39.35 per
unit, which was the fair market value of the performance awards at the date of
grant.

Performance awards
granted under the 2005 long-term incentive award program are earned over a
contractual term of three years.  Vesting
of the performance awards will be dependent upon performance relative to
pre-defined goals for revenue growth and return on assets for the years 2005
through 2007.  Based on Snap-on’s
performance relative to these goals, the recipient can earn up to 100% of the
performance awards with an equal number of cash units that represent the right
to receive cash of $31.73 per unit.  For
performance achieved above a certain level, the recipient may earn additional
cash units, not to exceed 100% of the number of performance awards initially
awarded.  The additional cash units also
represent the right to receive cash of $31.73 per unit, which was the fair
market value of the performance awards at the date of grant.

The fair value of each
performance award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
valuation model.  The company uses the
vesting period of the performance awards as the expected term of performance
awards granted.  Expected volatility is
based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock for the length of
time corresponding to the expected term of the performance award.  The expected dividend yield is based on the
company’s historical dividend payments. 
The risk-free interest rate is based on the


U.S. treasury yield
curve on the grant date for the length of time corresponding to the expected
term of the performance award.  The
following weighted-average assumptions were used in calculating the fair value
of performance awards granted in 2006 and 2005, using the Black-Scholes
valuation model.

non-vested performance share awards granted under the 2001 Plan that is
expected to be recognized as a charge to earnings over a weighted-average
period of 1.8 years.

Stock
Appreciation Rights (“SARs”)

The company also issues SARs to
certain key non-U.S. employees.  SARs are
granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of a share of
common stock on the date of grant and have a contractual term of ten years and
vest in two annual increments beginning on the first anniversary following the
grant date of the award.  SARs provide
for the cash payment of the excess of the fair market value of Snap-on’s
common stock price on the date of exercise over the grant price.  SARs have no effect on dilutive shares or
shares outstanding as any appreciation of Snap-on’s common stock value
over the grant price is paid in cash and not in common stock.

The fair value of each
SAR is remeasured each reporting period using the Black-Scholes valuation
model.  The company uses historical data
regarding SARs exercise behaviors for different participating groups to
estimate the expected term of the SARs granted based on the period of time that
similar instruments granted are expected to be outstanding.  Expected volatility is based on the
historical volatility of the company’s stock for the length of time
corresponding to the expected term of the stock appreciation right.  The expected dividend yield is based on the
company’s historical dividend payments. 
The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in
effect on the grant date for the length of time corresponding to the expected
term of the SARs.  The following
weighted-average assumptions were used in calculating the fair value of SARs
granted during 2006 and 2005, using the Black-Scholes valuation model.

Restricted Stock Awards

The
company granted 17,613 restricted stock awards to the members of the board of
directors during the second quarter ended July 1, 2006.  All restrictions will lapse upon the
recipient’s retirement from the Board, death or a change in control. When the
restrictions lapse, stock certificates will be issued for the shares.

Directors’ Fee Plan:

Under the
Directors’ Fee Plan, non-employee directors may elect up to 100% of their fees
and retainer in shares of Snap-on’s common stock. Directors may elect to defer
receipt of all or part of these shares. For 2006, 2005 and 2004, issuances
under the Directors’ Fee Plan totaled 2,999 shares, 7,289 shares and 5,776
shares. Additionally, receipt of 4,101 shares, 3,923 shares and 10,668 shares
was deferred in 2006, 2005 and 2004. At December 30, 2006, shares reserved for
issuance to directors under this plan totaled 164,846 shares.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan:

Employees
of Snap-on are eligible to participate in an employee stock purchase plan. The
employee purchase price of the common stock is the lesser of the mean of the
high and low price of the stock on the beginning date (May 15) or ending date
(the following May 14) of each plan year. For 2006, 2005 and 2004, issuances
under the employee stock ownership plan totaled 35,227 shares, 30,876 shares
and 36,512 shares. At December 30, 2006, shares reserved for issuance to
employees under this plan totaled 351,671 and Snap-on held contributions of
approximately $0.9 million for the purchase of common stock by employees.  Employees are able to withdraw from the plan
and receive all contributions made during the plan year.  Compensation expense for plan participants in
2006, 2005 and 2004 was not material.

Dealer Stock Purchase Plan:

Franchisees
are eligible to participate in a dealer stock purchase plan. The franchisee
purchase price of the common stock is the lesser of the mean of the high and
low price of the stock on the beginning date (May 15) or ending date (the
following May 14) of each plan year. For 2006, 2005 and 2004, issuances under
the dealer stock purchase plan totaled 48,444 shares, 43,911 shares and 49,290
shares. At December 30, 2006, shares reserved for issuance to franchisees under
this plan totaled 22,975 shares and Snap-on held franchisee contributions of
approximately $0.9 million for the purchase of common stock by
franchisees.  Franchisees are able to
withdraw from the plan and receive all contributions made during the plan
year.  Expense for plan participants in
2006, 2005 and 2004 was not material.

Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan:

Under this
plan, participating shareholders may invest the cash dividends from all or a
portion of their common stock to buy additional shares. The program also
permits new investors and current shareholders to make additional
contributions. For 2006, 2005 and 2004, issuances under the dividend
reinvestment and stock purchase plan totaled 25,279 shares, 30,941 shares and
42,881 shares. At December 30, 2006, shares available for purchase under this
plan totaled 1,608,582 shares.


Fair
Value Disclosures — Prior to Adoption of SFAS No. 123(R)

Prior
to January 1, 2006, the company accounted for its share-based instruments under
the recognition and measurement provisions of APB No. 25 and related
interpretations.  No stock-based employee
compensation costs related to stock options were recognized prior to 2006.  The following table illustrates the effect on
net earnings and earnings per share for the fiscal years ended December 31,

Note 15: Capital Stock

Snap-on
has undertaken repurchases of Snap-on common stock from time to time to offset
dilution created by shares issued for employee and dealer stock purchase plans,
stock options, and other corporate purposes, as well as to repurchase shares
when market conditions are favorable. Snap-on repurchased 2,616,618 shares in
2006, following the repurchase of 912,100 shares in 2005 and 1,200,000 shares
in 2004.  As of the end of 2006, Snap-on
has remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $152.1 million
in common stock pursuant to the Board of Directors’ authorizations.  The purchase of Snap-on common stock is at
the company’s discretion, subject to prevailing financial and market
conditions.  In 2006, Snap-on’s average
common stock repurchase price was approximately $41.98 per share.

In August 1997, the Board
of Directors declared a dividend distribution of one preferred stock purchase
right for each share of Snap-on’s outstanding common stock. The rights are
exercisable only if a person or group acquires 15% or more of Snap-on’s common
stock (“Acquiring Person”) or publicly announces a tender offer to become an
Acquiring Person. Each right may then be exercised to purchase one
one-hundred-and-fiftieth of a share of Series A Junior Preferred Stock for
$190, but if a person or group becomes an Acquiring Person, then each right
entitles the holder (other than an Acquiring Person) to acquire common stock

of Snap-on having a market value equivalent to two
times the current purchase price. If Snap-on is acquired in a merger or other
business combination not approved by the Board of Directors, then each holder
of a right will

be entitled to purchase common stock of the surviving
company having a market value equivalent to two times the current purchase
price. The effect of the rights is to cause ownership dilution to a person or
group attempting to acquire Snap-on without approval of Snap-on’s Board of
Directors. The rights expire on November 3, 2007, and may be redeemed by
Snap-on at a price of $0.01 per right under certain circumstances.

Snap-on
created a Grantor Stock Trust (“GST”) in 1998 that was subsequently amended. In
conjunction with the formation of the GST, Snap-on sold 7.1 million shares of
treasury stock to the GST. The sale of these shares had no net impact on
shareholders’ equity or on Snap-on’s Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The
GST is a funding mechanism for certain benefit programs and compensation
arrangements, including the 2001 Incentive Stock and Awards Plan and employee
and dealer stock purchase plans. The Northern Trust Company, as trustee of the
GST, votes the common stock held by the GST based on the terms set forth in the
GST Agreement as amended. The GST is recorded as “Grantor Stock Trust at fair
market value” on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Shares owned by
the GST are


accounted
for as a reduction to shareholders’ equity until used in connection with
employee benefits. Each period, the shares owned by the GST are valued at the
closing market price, with corresponding changes in the GST balance reflected
in additional paid-in capital.  At
December 30, 2006, the GST held 407,485 shares of common stock.

$16.2 million and $19.2 million of loans, with terms ranging from six months to
ten years, have a primary recourse provision to Snap-on if the loans become
more than 90 days past due.  The asset
value of the collateral underlying these recourse loans would serve to mitigate
Snap-on’s loss in the event of default. 
The estimated fair value of the guarantees for all loan originations
with recourse as of December 30, 2006, was not material.  See Note 7 for further information on SOC.

Snap-on
provides product warranties for specific product lines and accrues for
estimated future warranty cost in the period in which the sale is
recorded.  Snap-on calculates its accrual
requirements based on historic warranty loss experience that is periodically
adjusted for recent actual experience, including the timing of claims during
the warranty period and actual costs incurred. 
The following summarizes Snap-on’s product warranty accrual activity for
fiscal-year 2006 and 2005:

On May
16, 2006, Snap-on reached an agreement to settle certain legal matters related
to certain then current and former franchisees on a class basis.

The court
gave its final approval to the class settlement on October 27, 2006.

Under the terms of the
settlement, Snap-on agreed to make

pay

ments
to

claimants

and class
counsel, plus incur certain other

costs and expenses.  Snap-on recorded a
$38.0 million pretax charge in the second quarter of 2006 representing
its best estimate to settle these legal matters.

Snap-on disbursed funds of
approximately $14

million for related legal fees, settlements and other
expenses in the fourth quarter of 2006, and the company expects to disburse
additional amounts, including amounts  to the class claimants, beginning
in the first quarter of 2007.  Snap-on has not admitted any wrongdoing by
way of this settlement.

On
July 23, 2004, Snap-on reached an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice
to resolve a government audit relating to two contracts with the U.S. General
Services Administration (“GSA”).  Snap-on
agreed to settle the claims over the interpretation and application of the
price reduction and billing


provisions
of these two contracts for sales from March 1996 through the July 23, 2004,
settlement date for $10.0 million. 
Snap-on remitted the $10.0 million cash settlement to the U.S.
Department of Justice on August 5, 2004. 
On August 5, 2005, the GSA
notified the company that it would take no administrative action against
Snap-on in connection with the Federal Supply Schedule contracts referred to
above.  The company considers the matter
closed.

Snap-on is also involved in various other legal
matters that are being litigated and/or settled in the ordinary course of
business. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of these other
legal matters, management believes that the results will not have a material
impact on Snap-on’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Note 17:
Segments

Snap-on’s business
segments are based on the organization structure used by management for making
operating and investment decisions and for assessing performance.  Snap-on’s reportable business segments
include: (i) the Snap-on Tools Group (formerly known as the Snap-on Dealer
Group); (ii) the Commercial & Industrial Group; (iii) the Diagnostics &
Information Group; and (iv) Financial Services. 
The Snap-on Tools Group consists of the business operations serving the
worldwide franchise van channel. The Commercial & Industrial Group consists
of the business operations providing tools and equipment products and equipment
repair services to a broad range of industrial and commercial customers
worldwide through direct, distributor and other non-franchise distribution
channels.  The Diagnostics &
Information Group consists of the business operations providing diagnostics
equipment, vehicle service information, business management systems, and other
solutions for vehicle service to customers in the worldwide vehicle service and
repair marketplace. The Diagnostics & Information Group includes, on a
prospective basis, the impact of the November 28, 2006, acquisition of ProQuest
Business Solutions. Financial Services consists of the business operations of
SOC, and Snap-on’s wholly owned finance subsidiaries in those international
markets where Snap-on has franchise operations. 
See Notes 1 and 7 for information on SOC; see Note 2 for information on
Snap-on’s acquisition of ProQuest Business Solutions.

Snap-on evaluates the
performance of its operating segments based on segment revenues and operating
earnings.  For the Snap-on Tools,
Commercial & Industrial, and Diagnostics & Information Groups, segment
net sales include both external and intersegment sales.  Snap-on accounts for intersegment sales and
transfers based primarily on standard costs with reasonable mark-ups
established between the segments.  Identifiable
assets by segment are those assets used in the respective reportable segment’s
operations.  Intersegment amounts are
eliminated to arrive at consolidated financial results.

Neither Snap-on nor any
of its segments, except Financial Services, depend on any single customer,
small group of customers or government for more than 10% of its revenues.  As a result of SOC’s relationship with CIT,
Snap-on’s Financial Services business segment depends on CIT for more than 10%
of its revenues.

Products and services:

Snap-on derives net sales from a broad line of products and complementary
services that are grouped into two categories: tools and equipment.  The tools category includes Snap-on’s hand
tools, power tools, tool storage units, saws, and cutting and pruning tools
product offerings.  The equipment
category includes vehicle service diagnostics equipment, vehicle service
equipment, vehicle service information, business management systems, equipment
repair service product offerings, and electronic parts catalogs.  Snap-on also derives revenue from financing
its products through SOC and through its wholly owned finance
subsidiaries.  Snap-on utilizes various
financing programs to facilitate the sales of its products.  See Notes 1 and 7 for further information on
SOC.  Further product line information is
not presented as it is not practicable to do so. The following table shows the
consolidated net sales and revenues of these product groups in the last three
years:
