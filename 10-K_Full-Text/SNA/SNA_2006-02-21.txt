PART I

Safe Harbor

Statements in this document that are
not historical facts, including statements (i) that include the words “expects,”
“plans,” “targets,” “estimates,” “believes,”
“anticipates,” or similar words that reference Snap-on Incorporated
(“Snap-on” or “the company”) or its management; (ii) specifically
identified as forward-looking; or (iii) describing Snap-on’s or management’s
future outlook, plans, estimates, objectives or goals, are forward-looking statements
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Snap-on
cautions the reader that any forward-looking statements included in this document that are
based upon assumptions and estimates were developed by management in good faith and are
subject to risks, uncertainties or other factors that could cause (and in some cases have
caused) actual results to differ materially from those described in any such statement.
Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of
actual results or regarded as a representation by the company or its management that the
projected results will be achieved. For those forward-looking statements, Snap-on cautions
the reader that numerous important factors, such as those listed below, as well as those
factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Snap-on’s Form 8-K filing
dated July 27, 2005, could affect the company’s actual results and could cause its
actual consolidated results to differ materially from those expressed in any
forward-looking statement made by, or on behalf of, Snap-on.

These risks and uncertainties
include, without limitation, uncertainties related to estimates, statements, assumptions
and projections generally, and the timing and progress with which Snap-on can attain
savings from cost reduction actions, including its ability to implement reductions in
workforce, achieve improvements in the company’s manufacturing footprint and greater
efficiencies in its supply chain, and enhance machine maintenance, plant productivity and
manufacturing line set-up and change-over practices, any or all of which could result in
production inefficiencies, higher cost and lost revenues. These risks also include
uncertainties related to Snap-on’s capability to implement future strategies with
respect to its existing businesses, refine its brand and franchise strategies, retain and
attract franchisees, further enhance service and value to franchisees and thereby enhance
their sales and profitability, introduce successful new products, as well as its ability
to withstand disruption arising from natural disasters, planned facility closures or other
labor interruptions, litigation challenges and external negative factors including
significant changes in the current competitive environment, inflation, interest rates and
other monetary and market fluctuations; and the impact of legal proceedings, energy and
raw material supply and pricing (including steel and gasoline), the amount, rate and
growth of Snap-on’s general and administrative expenses (e.g. health care and/or
pension costs), and terrorist disruptions on business. Snap-on disclaims any
responsibility to update any forward-looking statement provided in this document.

In addition, investors should be
aware that generally accepted accounting principles prescribe when a company should
reserve for particular risks, including litigation exposures. Accordingly, results for a
given reporting period could be significantly affected if and when a reserve is
established for a major contingency. Reported results, therefore, may appear to be
volatile in certain accounting periods.

Item 1: Business

Snap-on was incorporated under the
laws of the state of Wisconsin in 1920 and reincorporated under the laws of the state of
Delaware in 1930. Snap-on is a leading global innovator, manufacturer and marketer of
high-quality tool, diagnostic, service and equipment solutions for professional tool and
equipment users under various brands and trade names. Product lines include a broad range
of hand and power tools, tool storage, saws and cutting tools, pruning tools, vehicle
service diagnostics equipment, vehicle service equipment, including wheel service, safety
testing and collision repair equipment, vehicle service information, business management
systems, equipment repair services, and other tool and equipment solutions. Snap-on also
derives income from various financing programs to facilitate the sales of its products.
Snap-on’s customers include automotive technicians, vehicle service centers,
manufacturers, industrial tool and equipment users, and those involved in commercial
applications such as construction, electrical and agriculture.

Snap-on markets its products and
brands through multiple distribution sales channels in more than 125 countries.
Snap-on’s largest geographic markets include the United States, Australia, Canada,
China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the United
Kingdom. The originator of the mobile dealer van tool distribution channel in the
automotive repair segment, Snap-on also reaches its customers through company direct,
distributor and Internet channels.


Snap-on’s business segments are
based on the organization structure used by management for making operating and investment
decisions and for assessing performance. Snap-on’s reportable business segments
include: (i) the Snap-on Dealer Group; (ii) the Commercial and Industrial Group; (iii) the
Diagnostics and Information Group; and (iv) Financial Services. The Snap-on Dealer Group
consists of Snap-on’s business operations serving the worldwide franchised dealer van
channel (“franchisees” and/or “dealers”). The Commercial and
Industrial Group consists of the business operations providing tools and equipment
products and equipment repair services to a broad range of industrial and commercial
customers worldwide through direct, distributor and other non-franchised distribution
channels. The Diagnostics and Information Group consists of the business operations
providing diagnostics equipment, vehicle service information, business management systems,
and other solutions for vehicle service to customers in the worldwide vehicle service and
repair marketplace. Financial Services consists of the business operations of Snap-on
Credit LLC (“SOC”), a consolidated, 50%-owned joint venture between Snap-on and
The CIT Group, Inc. (“CIT”), and Snap-on’s wholly owned finance
subsidiaries in those international markets where Snap-on has dealer operations. See Note
17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of segments.

Snap-on evaluates the performance of
its operating segments based on segment revenues and operating earnings, exclusive of
financing activities and income taxes. Segment revenues are defined as total revenues,
including both external customer revenue and intersegment revenue. Segment operating
earnings are defined as segment revenues less cost of goods sold and operating expenses,
including restructuring costs. Snap-on accounts for intersegment sales and transfers based
primarily on standard costs with reasonable mark-ups established between the segments.
Identifiable assets by segment are those assets used in the respective reportable
segment’s operations. Intersegment amounts are eliminated to arrive at consolidated
financial results.

Snap-on realigned its business
segments during the first quarter of fiscal 2005. The primary changes included the
transfer of Snap-on’s technical representative (“tech rep”) support
organization from the Snap-on Dealer Group to the Diagnostics and Information Group and
the segregation of Snap-on’s general corporate expenses from the operating earnings
of the business segments. Prior to fiscal 2005, shared services and general corporate
expenses and corporate assets were allocated to the business segments based on segment
revenues. Beginning in fiscal 2005, the business segments are charged only for those
shared services utilized by the business segment based on an estimate of the value of
services provided; general corporate expenses and corporate assets are not allocated to
the business segments. Corporate assets consist principally of those assets that are
centrally managed including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, pension
assets and income taxes, as well as corporate real estate and related assets. Prior-year
financial data by segment has been restated to reflect these reportable business segment
realignments.

Snap-on also derives income from
financing its products through SOC and through Snap-on’s wholly owned finance
subsidiaries. Snap-on utilizes various financing programs to facilitate the sales of its
products.

Snap-on established SOC in January
1999 with Newcourt Financial USA Inc., now CIT. SOC provides financial services to
Snap-on’s U.S. dealer and customer network and to Snap-on’s industrial and other
customers. Beginning in 2004, Snap-on began consolidating SOC on a prospective basis as a
result of the January 4, 2004, adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s
Interpretation No. 46R,

“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (an
interpretation of ARB No. 51).”

See Notes 2 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for further discussion of SOC.

SOC originates loans primarily in
three ways. First, extended-term contracts are offered to technicians and shop owners to
enable them to purchase tools and equipment on an extended-term payment plan, generally
with an average term of 33 months. Second, lease financing is offered to shop owners and
managers, both independent and national chains, who purchase equipment items. The duration
of lease contracts is often two to five years. Third, financing options are also available
to dealers to meet a number of financing needs, including van and truck leases, working
capital loans, and loans to enable new dealers to fund the purchase of the franchise. The
duration of these contracts can be up to 10 years. The above contracts are generally
secured by the underlying tools or equipment financed and other dealer assets.

The majority of finance income is
derived from the vehicle service industry in North America. Internationally, Snap-on
continues to provide financing directly to its dealer and customer networks through its
wholly owned finance subsidiaries.

Sales and Distribution

Snap-on markets and distributes its
products and related services principally to professional tool and
equipment users around the world. The two largest market sectors are the vehicle service
and repair sector and the industrial sector.


Vehicle Service and
Repair Sector

The vehicle service and repair sector
has three main customer groups: professional technicians who purchase tools and equipment
for themselves; vehicle service and repair shop owners and managers — including
independent shops, national chains and automotive dealerships — who purchase
equipment for use by multiple technicians within a service or repair facility; and vehicle
manufacturers.

Snap-on provides innovative tool and
equipment solutions, as well as technical sales support and training, to meet
technicians’ evolving needs. Snap-on’s franchised dealer van distribution system
offers technicians the convenience of purchasing quality tools with minimal disruption of
their work routine. Snap-on also provides owners and managers of shops, where technicians
work, with tools, diagnostics equipment, repair and service information, and shop
management products. Snap-on provides vehicle manufacturers with products and services
including tools, consulting services and facilitation services. Snap-on’s
facilitation services include product procurement, distribution and administrative support
to customers for their dealership equipment programs.

Major challenges for Snap-on and the
vehicle service and repair sector include the increasing rate of technological change
within motor vehicles and the resulting impact on the businesses of both our suppliers and
customers that is necessitated by such change. Snap-on believes it is a meaningful
participant in the market sector for vehicle service and repair.

Industrial Sector

Snap-on markets its products to a
wide variety of industrial customers including industrial maintenance and repair
operations; manufacturing and assembly facilities; government facilities; schools; and
original equipment manufacturers that require instrumentation or service tools and
equipment for their products.

Major challenges in the industrial
sector include a highly competitive, cost-conscious environment, and a trend toward
customers making all of their tool purchases through one integrated supplier. Snap-on
believes it is a meaningful participant in the market sector for industrial tools and
equipment.

Distribution Channels

Snap-on serves customers primarily
through three channels of distribution: the mobile dealer van channel, including the
company’s tech rep organization, company direct sales and distributors. The following
discussion represents Snap-on’s general approach for each channel, and is not
intended to be all-inclusive.

Dealers and Tech Reps

In the United States, the majority of
sales to the vehicle service and repair sector are conducted through Snap-on’s
dealers and its tech rep organization. Snap-on’s dealers primarily serve vehicle
service technicians and vehicle service shop owners, generally providing weekly contact at
the customer’s place of business. Dealers’ sales are concentrated in hand and
power tools, tool storage units and small diagnostic and shop equipment, which can easily
be transported in a van and demonstrated during a brief sales call. Dealers purchase
Snap-on’s products at a discount from suggested retail prices and resell them at
prices established by the dealer. Although some dealers have sales areas defined by other
methods, most

U.S. dealers are provided a list of places of business
that serves as the basis of the dealer’s sales route.

Since 1991, new U.S. dealers, and a
majority of the pre-1991 U.S. dealers, have been enrolled as franchisees of Snap-on. In
2001 Snap-on began offering a trial franchise option to potential U.S.
dealers that do not meet the franchise qualification requirements.  Trial
franchisees typically have less upfront investment and are provided an initial base
level of consigned inventory from Snap-on to assist them in gaining experience
and building equity toward the future purchase of a standard
franchise.  Snap-on also provides certain franchisees the opportunity to add vans to
their franchise or to add a limited number of franchises. Snap-on charges nominal initial
and ongoing monthly license fees. Through SOC, financing is available to franchised
dealers, which includes van and truck leases, working capital loans, and loans to enable
new dealers to fund the purchase of the franchise. At 2005 year end, 3,498 U.S. dealers
(approximately 95%) were enrolled as franchisees, or employed by franchisees, as compared
with 3,726 U.S. dealers (approximately 95%) at year-end 2004.


Snap-on has replicated its U.S.
dealer van method of distribution in certain other countries, including Australia, Canada,
Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, South Africa and the United Kingdom. In many of these
markets, as in the United States, purchase decisions are generally made or influenced by
professional vehicle service technicians and shop owners. Snap-on markets products in
certain other countries through its subsidiary, Snap-on Tools International, LLC, which
sells to foreign distributors under license or contract with Snap-on. Internationally,
Snap-on offers financing to its franchised dealer and customer networks through its wholly
owned finance subsidiaries.

Snap-on supports its dealers with a
field organization of regional offices, sales managers, service centers and distribution
centers. Snap-on also provides sales and business training, and marketing and product
promotion programs, as well as customer and dealer financing programs through SOC and its
wholly owned international finance operations, all of which are designed to strengthen
dealer sales. In the United States and Canada, the National Franchise Advisory Council and
the Snap-on Tools Canadian Franchise Advisory Council, both of which are composed of
dealers that are elected by dealers, assist Snap-on in identifying and implementing
enhancements to the franchise program.

In the United States, dealers are
supported by the tech rep sales force. Tech reps are specialists who demonstrate and sell
higher-price-point diagnostics and shop equipment, as well as vehicle service shop
management information systems. Tech reps work independently and with dealers to identify
and generate sales leads among vehicle service shop owners and managers. Tech reps are
Snap-on employees who are compensated primarily on the basis of commission; a dealer
receives a brokerage fee from certain sales made by the tech reps to the dealer’s
customers. Most products sold through the dealer and tech rep organization are sold under
the

Snap-on

,

Blue-Point,

Sun

and

ShopKey

brand names.

Company Direct Sales

In the United States, a significant
proportion of shop equipment sales under the

Sun, John Bean, Wheeltronic, White and
Blackhawk

brands

and information products under the

Mitchell1

brand

are made by a direct sales force that has responsibility for national accounts. As the
vehicle service and repair sector consolidates (with more business conducted by national
chains, automotive dealerships and franchised service centers), the company believes these
larger organizations can be serviced most effectively by sales people who can demonstrate
and sell the full line of equipment and diagnostic products and services. Snap-on also
sells these products and services directly to vehicle manufacturers.

John Bean, White
and Blackhawk

brands are sold directly to end customers primarily through sales leads
generated from dealers and tech reps.

Snap-on

brand tools and
equipment are marketed to industrial and governmental customers in the United States
through both industrial sales representatives, who are employees, and independent
industrial distributors. In most markets outside the United States, industrial sales are
conducted through independent distributors. The sales representatives focus on industrial
customers whose main purchase criteria are quality and service. At the end of 2005,
Snap-on had industrial sales representatives in the United States, Australia, Canada,
Japan, Mexico, Puerto Rico and some European countries, with the United States
representing the majority of Snap-on’s total industrial sales.

Distributors

Sales of certain tools and equipment
are made through independent vehicle service and industrial distributors who purchase the
items from Snap-on and resell them to the end users. Hand tools under the

Bahco, Fish
and Hook

(design)

, Belzer, Pradines

and

Lindstrom

brands and trade
names, for example, are sold through distributors in Europe, North and South America, Asia
and certain other parts of the world. Wheel service and other vehicle service equipment
are sold through distributors primarily under brands including

Hofmann

and

Kansas Jack

. Hand tools under the

Irimo, Palmera

and

Acesa

brands and
power tools under the

Sioux

brand, are differentiated from those products sold
through the dealer, tech rep and direct sales channels.

Sun

-branded equipment is
marketed through distributors in South America and Asia

,

and through
both a direct sales force and distributors in Europe.


E-commerce

Snap-on’s e-commerce development
initiatives allow Snap-on to combine the capabilities of the Internet with Snap-on’s
existing brand sales and distribution strengths to reach new and under-served customer
segments. Snap-on offers current and prospective customers online, around-the-clock access
to purchase

Snap-on

and

Blue-Point

products through its public Internet
website at

www.snapon.com

. The site features an online catalog containing nearly
14,000 products, including

Snap-on

hand tools, power tools, tool storage units and
diagnostic equipment available to consumers and professionals in the United States, the
United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. At the end of 2005, Snap-on had more than 314,000
registered users, including approximately 30,000 industrial accounts. E-commerce and
certain other system enhancement initiatives, which are currently under development, are
designed to improve productivity and further leverage the one-on-one relationships and
service Snap-on has with its current and prospective customers. Through
business-to-business and business-to-consumer capabilities, Snap-on and its dealers are
enhancing communications with customers on a real-time, 24-hour, 7-day a week basis.

Competition

Snap-on competes on the basis of its
product quality and performance, product line breadth and depth, service, brand awareness
and imagery, and technological innovation. While no single company competes with Snap-on
across all of its product lines and distribution channels, various companies compete in
one or more product categories and/or distribution channels.

Snap-on believes that it is a leading
manufacturer and distributor of professional tools and equipment, offering the broadest
line of these products to the vehicle service industry. The major competitors selling to
professional technicians in the automotive service and repair sector through the mobile
van channel include MAC Tools (The Stanley Works), Matco (Danaher Corporation), and
Cornwell. Snap-on also competes with companies that sell tools and equipment to automotive
technicians through non-mobile van distributors including department stores (such as
Sears, Roebuck and Co.), home centers (such as Home Depot, Inc. and Lowes Companies,
Inc.), auto supply outlets (such as AutoZone, Inc. and The Pep Boys), and tool supply
warehouses (such as Stampede and ICN). Within the power tools category, Snap-on’s
major competitors include Ingersoll-Rand, Black & Decker Corporation, Bosch, Makita
Corporation, Chicago Pneumatic (Atlas Copco), and Milwaukee Electric (TechTronic
Industries Co. Ltd.). In the industrial sector, major competitors include Armstrong
(Danaher Corporation), Proto (The Stanley Works), Irwin (Newell Rubbermaid), Cooper
Industries, and Westward (W.W. Grainger). The major competitors selling diagnostics and
shop equipment to shop owners and managers in the vehicle service and repair sector
include Corghi S.p.A., Fluke and Hennessy (Danaher Corporation), Robinair (SPX
Corporation), OTC, Hunter Engineering, and Rotary Lift and Chief Automotive (Dover
Corporation).

Research and Engineering

Research and engineering expenses
totaled $50.0 million, $58.2 million and $57.0 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Raw Materials and
Purchased Product

Snap-on’s supply of raw
materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous
suppliers. During 2004 and 2005, Snap-on experienced higher pricing related to certain
grades and alloys of steel. While Snap-on believes that steel prices will continue to
remain high for 2006, the company does not anticipate experiencing any significant pricing
or availability issues with regards to 2006 steel purchases.


Patents, Trademarks and
Other Intellectual Property

Snap-on vigorously pursues and relies
on patent protection to protect its intellectual property and its position in its markets.
As of December 31, 2005, Snap-on and its subsidiaries held over 800 active and pending
patents in the United States and over 1,700 active and pending patents outside of the
United States. Sales relating to any single patent did not represent a material portion of
Snap-on’s revenues in 2005, 2004 or 2003.

Examples of products that have
features or designs that benefit from patent protection include wheel alignment systems,
wheel balancers, sealed ratchets, electronic torque instruments, ratcheting screwdrivers,
emissions-sensing devices, diagnostic equipment and air conditioning equipment.

Much of the technology used in the
manufacture of vehicle service tools and equipment is in the public domain. Snap-on relies
primarily on trade secret protection to protect proprietary processes used in
manufacturing. Methods and processes are patented when appropriate. Copyright protection
is also utilized when appropriate.

Trademarks used by Snap-on are of
continuing importance to Snap-on in the marketplace. Trademarks have been registered in
the United States and more than 100 other countries, and additional applications for
trademark registrations are pending. Snap-on vigorously polices proper use of its
trademarks. Snap-on’s right to manufacture and sell certain products is dependent
upon licenses from others; however, these products under license do not represent a
material portion of Snap-on’s sales.

Domain names have become a valuable
corporate asset for companies around the world, including Snap-on. Domain names often
contain a trademark or service mark or even a corporate name and are often considered
intellectual property. The recognition and value of the

Snap-on

name, trademark,
and domain name are core strengths of the company. Snap-on has undertaken an initiative to
centralize the administration of all domestic and international domain names, including
all registrations and renewals. Snap-on also monitors new developments in top-level
domains and country-code domains in order to preserve Snap-on’s right to relevant
domain names.

Snap-on is selectively and
strategically licensing the

Snap-on

brand to carefully selected manufacturing and
distribution companies, including apparel, work boots and a variety of other goods, in
order to build equity and market presence for the company’s strongest brand.

Environment

Snap-on is subject to various
environmental laws, ordinances, regulations, and other requirements of government
authorities in the United States and other nations. At Snap-on, these environmental
liabilities are managed through the Snap-on Environmental, Hygiene, and Safety Management
System (“EH & SMS”), which is applied worldwide. The system is based upon
continual improvement and is certified to ISO 14001:1996 and OHSAS 18001:1999, verified
through Det Norske Veritas (DNV) Certification, Inc.

Snap-on believes that it complies
with applicable environmental control requirements in its operations. Expenditures on
environmental matters through EH & SMS have not had, and Snap-on does not for the
foreseeable future expect them to have, a material effect upon Snap-on’s capital
expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

Employees

At the end of January 2006, Snap-on
employed approximately 11,400 people compared to approximately 11,600 people at the end of
January 2005. The year-over-year reduction primarily reflects the impact of
restructuring-related and management realignment actions at various Snap-on facilities.


Approximately 3,200 employees, or 28%
of Snap-on’s worldwide workforce, are represented by unions and/or covered under
collective bargaining agreements. Of these, approximately 1,240 are covered under various
European national union agreements that are renewed on an annual basis. Approximately 610
employees are covered under agreements expiring in 2006, including approximately 280
covered under various European national union agreements. In recent years, Snap-on has not
experienced any significant work slow-downs, stoppages or other labor disruptions.

The number of covered union employees
whose contracts expire within the next five years is approximately 610 in 2006; 1,220 in
2007; 1,040 in 2008; 270 in 2009; and zero in 2010.

There can be no assurance that future
contracts with Snap-on’s unions will be renegotiated upon terms acceptable to
Snap-on.

Working Capital

As most of Snap-on’s business is
not seasonal and its inventory needs are relatively constant, no unusual working capital
needs arise during the year. Snap-on does not have a significant backlog of orders at
December 31, 2005.

Snap-on’s financial condition
and use of working capital are discussed in “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Neither Snap-on nor any of its
segments, except Financial Services, depend on any single customer, small group of
customers or government for any material part of its revenues. As a result of SOC’s
relationship with CIT, Snap-on’s Financial Services business segment depends on CIT
for more than 10% of its revenues.

Item 1A: Risk Factors

In evaluating the company, careful
consideration should be given to the following risk factors, in addition to the other
information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Each of these risk factors could
adversely affect the company’s business, operating results and/or financial
condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in the company’s
common stock. In addition to the following disclosures, please refer to the other
information contained in this report, including the consolidated financial statements and
the related notes.

The success of Snap-on’s
mobile van tool distribution business depends on the success of its franchisees.

Approximately 42% of our 2005 net
revenues were generated by the Snap-on Dealer Group, which consists of Snap-on’s
business operations serving the worldwide franchised dealer van channel. Except in limited
circumstances, each of our mobile tool vans is operated by a franchisee pursuant to a
franchise agreement. Snap-on’s success is dependent on its relationships with
franchisees, individually and collectively, as they are the primary sales and service link
between the company and vehicle service and repair technicians, who are an important class
of end users for Snap-on’s products and services. If our franchisees are not
successful, or if we do not maintain an effective relationship with our franchisees, the
delivery of products, the collection of receivables and/or our relationship with end users
could be adversely affected and thereby negatively impact our financial results.

In addition, if we are unable to
maintain effective relationships with franchisees, the company or the franchisees may
choose to terminate the relationship, which may result in (i) open routes in which end-use
customers are not provided reliable service; (ii) litigation resulting from termination;
and/or (iii) reduced collections or increased write-offs of franchisee receivables owed to
Snap-on. As Snap-on has nearly 5,000 franchisees worldwide and most of these franchise
relationships are governed by contract, it is not uncommon for litigation to result from
the termination of these relationships.


The steps taken to restructure
operations, rationalize operating footprint, lower operating expenses, and achieve greater
efficiencies in the supply chain could disrupt business.

In 2006, we expect to take additional
steps to drive further efficiencies and reduce costs, some of which could be disruptive to
our business. These steps include strategic actions to increase the sustainable success,
sales and profitability for Snap-on and its operating segments. These actions,
collectively across our operating groups, are focused on the following:

•

Continue
on the company’s existing path to improve and transform global manufacturing and the
supply chain into a market-demand-based replenishment system, with lower costs;

•

Continue
to enhance service and value to Snap-on's franchisees and customers;

•

Continue
to invest in initiatives focused on building a strong sales and operating presence in
emerging growth markets;

•

Continue
to invest in developing and marketing new, innovative, higher-value-added products and
advanced technologies; and

•

Extend
Snap-on’s products and services into additional markets or to new customers.

Specific initiatives in each of these
areas are underway. Snap-on believes that by executing on these focus areas, along with a
continued commitment to new innovative products and rapid continuous improvement to drive
lower costs, the company and its franchisees will realize stronger growth and
profitability. Failure to succeed in the implementation of any or all of these actions
could result in our being unable to achieve our financial goals and could be disruptive to
the business.

In addition, reductions to headcount
and other cost cutting measures may result in the loss of technical expertise that could
adversely affect our research and development efforts and ability to meet product
development schedules. Efforts to reduce components of expense could result in the
recording of charges for inventory and technology-related write-offs, workforce reduction
costs or other charges relating to the consolidation of facilities. If we were to incur a
substantial charge to further these efforts, our earnings (or loss) per share would be
adversely affected in such period. If we are unable to effectively manage our cost
reduction and restructuring efforts, our business, results of operations and financial
condition could be harmed.

Information technology
infrastructure is critical to supporting business objectives.

We depend heavily on information
technology infrastructure to achieve our business objectives. If a problem occurs that
impairs this infrastructure, the resulting disruption could impede our ability to record
or process orders, manufacture and ship in a timely manner, or otherwise carry on business
in the normal course. Any such events could cause us to lose customers or revenue and
could require us to incur significant expense to remediate.

In association with initiatives to
better integrate business units, rationalize operating footprint and improve
responsiveness to franchisees and customers, Snap-on is replacing and enhancing its
existing global Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) management information
system. The integration, implementation and deployment of new information technology
processes and a common information infrastructure is expected to cover a period of several
years. We could experience disruptions in our business as we implement the system
enhancements, including the possibility that the new system may not perform as expected,
which could have an adverse effect on our business.

The recognition of impairment
charges on goodwill would adversely impact future financial position and results of
operations.

We are required to perform
impairment tests on our goodwill balance annually or at any time when events occur, which
could impact the value of our business segments. Our determination of whether impairment
has occurred is based on a comparison of each of our reporting units’ fair market
value with its carrying value. Significant and unanticipated changes could require a
provision for impairment in a future period that could substantially affect our reported
earnings and reduce our consolidated net worth and shareholders’ equity.


Business interruptions for
franchisees could adversely impact operating results.

Franchisees have historically experienced
business interruptions due to adverse weather conditions or other extraordinary events,
such as hurricanes in the southern United States and wild fires in California. To the
extent our franchisees experience future similar events, our operating results may be
adversely impacted.

Exposure to credit risks of
customers and resellers may make it difficult to collect receivables and could adversely
affect operating results and financial condition.

Industry and economic conditions have
the potential to weaken the financial position of some of our customers. If circumstances
surrounding our customers’ financial capabilities were to deteriorate, such
write-downs or write-offs would negatively affect our operating results for the period in
which they occur and, if large, could have a material adverse effect on our operating
results and financial condition.

Failure to maintain effective
distribution of products and services could adversely impact revenue, gross margin and
profitability.

We use a variety of distribution
methods to sell our products and services. Successfully managing the interaction of our
distribution efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and
services is a complex process. Moreover, since each distribution method has distinct risks
and gross margins, our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery
model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins
and therefore our profitability.

Risks associated with the
disruption of manufacturing operations could adversely affect profitability or competitive
position.

We manufacture a significant portion
of the products we sell. Any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing
manufacturing facilities, whether due to technical or labor difficulties, lack of raw
material or component availability, destruction of or damage to any facility (including
natural disasters, use and storage of hazardous materials or other events), or other
reasons, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

The ability to provide financing
alternatives to end-user customers and franchisees could adversely impact operating
results.

An integral component of
Snap-on’s business and profitability is its ability to provide financing alternatives
to end-user customers and franchisees. Domestic financing operations are managed through a
joint venture with CIT. Historically, CIT has been the exclusive purchaser of the credit
and installment financing arranged by SOC. Deterioration of the relationship between the
joint venture partners, or if the joint venture should be unexpectedly dissolved, could
have an adverse impact on Snap-on’s results of operations and ability to provide
financing to end-user customers and franchisees in the United States. In addition, adverse
fluctuations in interest rates and/or the ability to provide competitive financing
programs to end-user customers and franchisees could negatively affect the level of credit
originations and the relationships with franchisees and end-user customers, all of which
could have an adverse impact on Snap-on’s revenue and profitability. Further, because
of the company’s reliance on the franchised dealer network to generate credit
originations, a decline in the number of dealers and/or the amount of end-user customers
being serviced by dealers could have an adverse impact on the volume of credit
originations and Snap-on’s results of operations.

The global tool and
equipment industry is competitive.

We face strong competition in all of
our market segments. Price competition in our various industries is intense and pricing
pressures from competitors and customers are increasing. In general, as a manufacturer and
marketer of premium products and services, the expectations of Snap-on’s customers
and its franchisees are high and increasing. Any inability to maintain customer
satisfaction could diminish Snap-on’s premium image and its reputation with a
resulting lessening of its ability to command premium pricing. We expect that the level of
competition will remain high in the future, which could limit our ability to maintain or
increase market share or profitability.


The inability to continue to
introduce new products that respond to customer needs and achieve market acceptance could
result in lower revenues and reduced profitability.

Sales from new products represent a
significant portion of our net sales and are expected to continue to represent a
significant component of our future net sales. We may not be able to compete effectively
unless we continue to enhance existing products or introduce new products to the
marketplace in a timely manner. Product improvements and new product introductions require
significant financial and other resources including significant planning, design,
development, and testing at the technological, product, and manufacturing process
levels. Our competitors’ new products may beat our products to market, be more
effective with more features, be less expensive than our products, and/or render our
products obsolete. Any new products that we develop may not receive market acceptance or
otherwise generate any meaningful net sales or profits for us relative to our expectations
based on, among other things, existing and anticipated investments in manufacturing
capacity and commitments to fund advertising, marketing, promotional programs, and
research and development.

Raw material and energy price
fluctuations and shortages (including steel and various fuel sources) could adversely
affect the ability to obtain needed manufacturing materials and could adversely affect
results of operations.

The principal raw material used in
the manufacture of our products is steel, which we purchase in competitive, price-sensitive
markets. To meet Snap-on’s high quality standards, our steel needs range
from specialized alloys, which are available only from a limited group of approved
suppliers, to commodity types of alloys. These raw materials have historically exhibited
price and demand cyclicality. Some of these materials have been, and in the future may be,
in short supply. As some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures, we
could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative
manufacturer on short notice. Additionally, unexpected price increases could result in
higher prices to our customers or an erosion of the margins on our products.

We believe our ability to sell our
products is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road, the number of miles
driven and the general aging of vehicles. These factors affect the frequency, type and
amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians, and therefore affect
the demand for the number of technicians, the prosperity of the technicians and,
subsequently, the demand they have for our tools, other products and services, and the
value they place on those products and services. To the extent that gasoline prices
increase, consumers may turn to other, non-gasoline based, methods of transportation,
including more frequent use of public transportation. A decrease in the use of gasoline
consuming vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for our products.

Foreign operations are subject to
currency exchange and political risks that could adversely affect results of operations.

Approximately 43% of our revenues in 2005
were generated outside of the United States. Future growth rates and success of our
business depends in large part on continued growth in our non-U.S. operations,
including growth in emerging markets. Numerous risks and uncertainties affect our
non-U.S. operations. These risks and uncertainties include political, economic and
social instability, including acts of war, civil disturbance or acts of terrorism, local
labor conditions, changes in government policies and regulations, including imposition or
increases in withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by
international subsidiaries, and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights.
We are also affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, inflation
rates and interest rates. Additionally, cash generated in non-U.S. jurisdictions may
be difficult to transfer to the United States in a tax-efficient manner.


Failure to adequately protect
intellectual property could adversely affect business.

Intellectual property rights are an
important and integral component of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual
property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret
laws, as well as licensing agreements and third-party nondisclosure and assignment
agreements. Adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could
prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or prevent us from stopping others
from manufacturing and selling competing products. Failure to obtain or maintain adequate
protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Compliance with new regulatory and
accounting requirements could adversely impact future financial position and results of
operations.

Compliance with future regulatory and
accounting requirements, including changes related to the accounting for employee stock
option issuances as compensation expense, will have an adverse impact on our operating
results. Changes as a result of proposed legislation to reform the funding and reporting
of pension plan benefits, as well as changes in market conditions that impact the
assumptions used to measure pension liabilities under these plans, could adversely affect
our operating results, financial position and cash flows.

As a result of compliance with the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as changes to listing standards adopted by the New
York Stock Exchange, and the attestation and accounting changes required by the SEC, we
are required to implement additional internal controls, improve our existing internal
controls, and comprehensively document and test our internal controls. In recent years we
have experienced higher costs from additional outside accounting, legal and advisory
services to comply with these requirements. Should Snap-on experience a significant
deterioration in its internal control environment at a financially significant Snap-on
facility or business, the impact of such could adversely affect our financial position and
results of operations.

The inability to successfully
defend claims from taxing authorities could adversely affect operating results and
financial position.

We conduct business in many
countries, which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those
taxing jurisdictions. Due to the subjectivity of tax laws between those jurisdictions, as
well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations, our estimates of income tax
liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments. Claims from taxing authorities
related to these differences could have an adverse impact on our operating results and
financial position.


Failure to attract and retain
qualified personnel could lead to a loss of revenue or profitability.

Snap-on’s success depends, in
part, on the efforts and abilities of its senior management team and other key employees.
Their skills, experience and industry contacts significantly benefit our operations and
administration. The failure to attract and retain members of our senior management team
and other key employees could have a negative effect on our operating results.

Risks associated with acquisition
activities could have an adverse impact on results of operations and financial position.

Acquisitions involve risks and
uncertainties that can include:

•

Difficulties
integrating the acquired company, retaining the acquired business’customers, and
achieving the expected benefits of the acquisition, such as revenue increases, cost
savings, and increases in geographic or product presence;

•

Loss
of key employees of the acquired business;

•

Implementing
and maintaining consistent standards, controls, procedures, policies and information
systems; and

•

Diversion
of management’s attention from other business concerns.

Future acquisitions could cause us to
incur additional debt, earnings dilution, contingent liabilities, increased interest
expense, and amortization expenses related to intangible assets. Impairment losses on
goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life, or restructuring charges, could
also occur as a result of acquisitions.

None.

Item 2: Properties

Snap-on maintains leased and owned
manufacturing, warehouse, distribution and office facilities throughout the world. Snap-on
believes that its facilities currently in use are suitable and have adequate capacity to
meet its present and foreseeable future demand. Snap-on’s facilities in the United
States occupy approximately 3.8 million square feet, of which 70% is owned, including its
corporate and general office facility located in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Snap-on’s
facilities outside the United States also occupy approximately 3.8 million square feet, of
which approximately 66% is owned. Certain Snap-on facilities are leased through operating
lease agreements. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
discussion of operating leases. Snap-on management continually monitors the company’s
capacity needs and makes adjustments as dictated by market and other conditions.

The company phased out production at
its Mt. Carmel, Illinois, and Kenosha, Wisconsin, manufacturing facilities during March
2004. The Mt. Carmel facility, the company’s former corporate office located in
Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, and several former sales offices and branch facilities are
currently for sale.

Item 3: Legal Proceedings

On July 23, 2004, Snap-on reached an
agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice to resolve the government audit, previously
discussed in the company’s 2004 Annual Report on Form 10-K, relating to two contracts
with the U.S. General Services Administration (“GSA”). Snap-on agreed to settle
the claims over the interpretation and application of the price reduction and billing
provisions of these two contracts for sales from March 1996 through the July 23, 2004,
settlement date for $10.0 million. Snap-on remitted the $10.0 million cash settlement to
the U.S. Department of Justice on August 5, 2004.

On February 8, 2005, the GSA
requested information from Snap-on to evaluate possible administrative action against the
company. On May 24, 2005, Snap-on and the GSA discussed Snap-on’s pricing and
contract compliance practices. On August 5, 2005, the GSA notified the company that it
would take no administrative action against Snap-on in connection with the Federal Supply
Schedule contracts referred to above. The company considers the matter closed.

Snap-on is also involved in various
legal matters that are being litigated and/or settled in the ordinary course of
business. In certain matters, former dealers, purportedly on behalf of
current and former franchised dealers, are seeking adjudication of certain claims as a
class within an arbitration proceeding. As an initial step, certain claimants have
successfully asserted in arbitration the right to further proceedings to determine whether
class certification in arbitration would be appropriate. Snap-on will continue to
vigorously assert defenses in these matters, including its belief that class certification
is not appropriate. Snap-on has taken steps in court to maintain its right to
challenge adverse results of the arbitral proceedings. Depending upon future developments
and circumstances in these matters, Snap-on will continue to pursue all available strategies from dispositive
class motions to settlement. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these
legal matters due, in part, to the uncertainty inherent in legal proceedings,
including the absence of precedents and clear procedures regarding class proceedings in
arbitration.

Snap-on held over 2,500 active or
pending patents as of year-end 2005, and Snap-on vigorously prosecutes its claims and
defends its patents in the ordinary course of business.

Item 4: Submission of
Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

No matters were submitted to a vote
of shareholders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005.


PART II

Item 5: Market for Registrant’s
Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

At December 31, 2005, Snap-on had

considered outstanding for purposes of computing earnings per share and an additional
3,204,308 shares held in the Grantor Stock Trust, which are considered outstanding for
voting purposes but not for purposes of computing earnings per share.

Snap-on’s stock is listed on the
New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “SNA.” As of February 15, 2006,
there were 9,290 registered holders of Snap-on common stock.

Snap-on’s common stock high and

Snap-on has paid consecutive
quarterly cash dividends, without interruption or reduction, since 1939. The company has
declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share in each of the last three years. Cash
dividends paid in 2005, 2004 and 2003 totaled $57.8 million, $57.7 million and $58.2
million. On February 1, 2006, Snap-on announced that its Board of Directors approved a
$0.02 per share, or 8%, increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.27 per share.
Snap-on’s Board of Directors monitors and evaluates the company’s dividend
practice quarterly and the Board may elect to increase, decrease or not pay a dividend on
Snap-on common stock based upon the company’s financial condition, results of
operations, cash requirements and future prospects of Snap-on and other factors deemed
relevant by the Board

.

See Note 14 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for further discussion on securities authorized for issuance under
equity compensation plans.


The following chart discloses
information regarding the shares of Snap-on’s common stock repurchased by the company
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, all of which were purchased pursuant to Board of
Directors’ authorizations that the company has publicly announced. Snap-on has
undertaken stock repurchases from time to time to offset dilution created by shares issued
for employee and dealer stock purchase plans, stock options, and other corporate purposes,
as well as to repurchase shares when the company believes market conditions are favorable.
The repurchase of Snap-on common stock is at the company’s discretion, subject to
prevailing financial and market conditions.

Subject
to further adjustment pursuant to the 1996 Authorization described                below,
as of December 31, 2005, the approximate value of shares that may yet be
               purchased pursuant to the three outstanding Board of Directors’               authorizations
discussed below is $136.7 million.

•

In
its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 1996, the company
disclosed that the company’s Board authorized the company to repurchase shares of
the company’s common stock from time to time in the open market or in privately
negotiated transactions (the “1996 Authorization”). The 1996 Authorization
allows the repurchase of up to the number of shares issued or delivered from treasury
from time to time under the various plans the company has in place that call for the
issuance of the company’s common stock. Because the number of shares that are
purchased pursuant to the 1996 Authorization will change from time to time as (i) the
company issues shares under its various plans and (ii) shares are repurchased pursuant to
this authorization, the number of shares authorized to be repurchased will vary from time
to time. The 1996 Authorization will expire when terminated by the company’s Board.
When calculating the approximate value of shares that the company may yet purchase under
the 1996 Authorization, the company assumed a price of $35.89, $37.71 and $37.56 per
share of common stock as of the end of the fiscal 2005 months ended October 29, November
26 and December 31, respectively.

•

On
June 29, 1998, the company announced that the company’s Board authorized the
repurchase of an aggregate of $100 million of the company’s common stock (the “1998
Authorization”). The 1998 Authorization will expire when the aggregate repurchase
price limit is met, unless terminated earlier by the company’s Board.

•

On
February 3, 1999, the company announced that the company’s Board authorized the

Beginning in 2004, in conjunction
with the consolidation of SOC, financial services revenue consists of SOC’s sales of
originated contracts and service fee income, as well as installment contract revenue and
dealer loan receivable revenue derived from SOC and Snap-on’s wholly owned
international finance operations. As Snap-on consolidated SOC on a prospective basis,
previously issued financial statements have not been restated. See Notes 2 and 7 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the consolidation of SOC.

2002 results include a $2.8 million
pretax gain ($2.8 million after tax or $0.05 per diluted share) for the cumulative effect
of a change in accounting principle for goodwill. Snap-on ceased amortizing goodwill and
certain other intangible assets in 2002 in accordance with the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets

.” Pretax goodwill amortization totaled $13.9 million and $14.5 million in
2001 and 2000.

2001 results include a $4.1 million
pretax loss ($2.5 million after tax or $0.04 per diluted share) for the cumulative effect
of a change in accounting principle for derivatives.

2000 results include a $41.3 million
pretax gain ($25.4 million after tax or $0.43 per diluted share) for the cumulative effect
of a change in accounting principle for pensions.


Item 7:
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Management Overview

In November 2004, Mr. Jack D.
Michaels was elected Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Snap-on, after
having previously served as a member of Snap-on’s Board of Directors since 1998.
Shortly thereafter, Snap-on announced near-term priorities to improve operating
efficiencies, respond to customer needs and market changes more quickly, address
performance issues in its commercial and industrial businesses, and generally accelerate
the pace of change towards achieving long-term profitable growth.

During 2005, measurable progress in
each of these areas was realized. Significant improvement was made in “first-time
fill rates” — an important element of manufacturing effectiveness and in
tracking service to customers and franchisees. As of year-end 2005, fill rates in the
Snap-on Dealer Group improved 19%. Prior-year fill rates had been adversely impacted by
the disruption caused from the closure of two U.S. hand tool plants in 2004.

Initiatives to improve organizational
alignment and working capital, reduce complexity and lower costs were launched early in
2005. These efforts, coupled with the introduction of Rapid Continuous Improvement
(“RCI”), resulted in a 120 basis-point increase in operating earnings margin for
the year, largely from the improvement achieved in the Commercial and Industrial Group and
a 3.6% increase in sales per associate year over year, despite the lower sales volume in
2005. Operating earnings margin as a percent of revenue increased to 7.1% in 2005, as
compared to 5.9% in 2004, despite a slight decline in total revenue from prior-year
levels. Additionally, RCI is now becoming a part of the Snap-on culture and is helping
ensure that progress continues towards further improving manufacturing efficiencies and
reducing costs.

While this progress is encouraging,
the company believes more must be done to improve Snap-on’s operating performance.
Our strategic priorities and plans for 2006 continue to build on the improvement
initiatives already underway in the Commercial and Industrial and the Diagnostics and
Information Groups, while expanded efforts are being launched to strengthen the operating
and financial performance of the Snap-on Dealer Group. These priorities and plans are
aimed at enabling us to continue the progress made in achieving our long-term goals of
profitably growing sales, further lowering costs, and maintaining strong cash flow.

Significant progress has been made in
improving the operating performance of the

Commercial and Industrial Group.

Snap-on
rationalized brands and the Group’s operating footprint, moved toward lower-cost
sourcing and manufacturing, and created an integrated pan-European marketing presence.
Investments have also been made to support advanced technology products, such as
Snap-on’s next-generation tire and wheel service equipment introduced in the last two
years, and to establish an operating presence in emerging growth markets such as China,
India and Eastern Europe. As a result, Snap-on is seeing improved levels of customer
service, market penetration and profitability.

While year-over-year segment revenue
grew slightly (from $1.11 billion in 2004 to $1.13 billion in 2005), operating earnings
grew to $69.6 million from $23.5 million in 2004. Snap-on’s 2006 plans for the
Commercial and Industrial Group builds on this success and on the following strategic
priorities:

•

Continue
to invest in emerging market growth initiatives;

•

Increase
market share in industrial tools through continued improvements in fill rates and product
innovation, and by reaching new customers;

•

Continue
to invest in productivity-enhancing products that utilize advanced technology; and

•

Continue
to rationalize the Group’s operating footprint and move toward lower-cost sourcing
and manufacturing.


In the

Diagnostics and Information
Group

, significant accomplishments have been made during the past three years as a
result of our strategic focus on creating an integrated “instrumentation with
information” business.

•

Two-thirds
of the Group's engineering development is now concentrated on high-value-added‚ data-stream applications;

•

Complexity
and structural costs were reduced and faster product-development cycles achieved; and

•

Investments
were made to support better business-to-business initiatives that include development and
distribution of essential diagnostics and tools, and facilitation services for vehicle
manufacturers and their dealership networks.

For 2005, the Diagnostics and
Information Group’s segment revenue declined to $432.7 million from $487.0 million in
2004, reflecting the comparison against the successful global launch of new,

Snap-on

brand diagnostics products in the prior year, as well as the impact of
lower Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) facilitation sales year over year.
Notwithstanding the lower sales, operating margin improved to 10.8% in 2005 as compared to
9.7% in the prior year.

Strategic priorities for the
Diagnostics and Information Group in 2006 will continue to emphasize process improvements
and new products, such as the recent launch of the new Mitchell1

™

customer
service programs. Snap-on also expects to leverage its market-leading capabilities to
capitalize on the growing need for products and services related to advanced diagnostics,
vehicle interface and data-stream communications.

In the

Snap-on Dealer Group

,
total revenue declined to $994.5 million in 2005 from $1.0 billion in the prior year,
largely due to a decrease in the average number of U.S. franchise dealer vans in operation
compared with the prior year. Despite the year-over-year revenue decline, operating
earnings were $82.2 million in 2005 compared with $80.4 million in 2004.

During 2005, considerable effort was
made in the Snap-on Dealer Group to evaluate and analyze marketplace data, the existing
franchise business and its growth potential. These efforts reaffirmed the growth
opportunities available to Snap-on, as well as the competitive strengths of the company
– namely, the

Snap-on

brand, the company’s mobile van tool distribution
system, which is the preferred distribution system for the automotive service industry,
and the substantial breadth and experience of Snap-on’s franchisees.

To fully capitalize on these
strengths, the Snap-on Dealer Group also concluded that more investment would enhance the
company’s responsiveness to its franchisees and customers, and identify better ways
to assist franchisees in strengthening their businesses. Accordingly, Snap-on’s 2006
strategic priorities to increase sales and profitability for the Snap-on Dealer Group are
focused on the following:

•

Continue
on the company’s existing path to improve and transform manufacturing and the supply
chain into a market-demand-based replenishment system, with lower costs;

•

Continue
to improve service and value to franchisees and customers;

•

Further
enhance the sales and profitability of Snap-on's franchisees; and

•

Extend
the Group’s brand and product lines into targeted niche markets that are currently
underdeveloped.

Specific initiatives in each of these
areas are underway. Snap-on believes that by executing on these focus areas, along with a
continued commitment to new innovative products and RCI to drive lower costs, the company
and its franchisees will realize stronger growth and profitability.

In 2005, Snap-on also continued its
emphasis on improving cash flow. Cash on hand at the end of 2005 increased to $170.4
million from $150.0 million at year-end 2004. In 2005, net cash provided by operating
activities increased to $221.1 million from $146.8 million in 2004. The company used cash
flow to, in part, pay dividends totaling $57.8 million and to repurchase 912,100 shares of
Snap-on common stock for $32.1 million. Snap-on also retired $100 million of 6.625%,
10-year notes with available cash during the fourth quarter of 2005 upon their maturity,
and invested $40.1 million in capital expenditures to largely improve manufacturing
efficiency and flexibility.


Over the last several years, the
company has also been focused on improving cash flow and asset utilization by making more
effective use of its investment in certain working capital items. In 2005, Snap-on made
considerable progress in its efforts to further reduce inventory levels and days sales
outstanding from the improvements attained in 2004. As of year-end 2005, inventory
decreased $58.7 million from prior year, including $19.2 million from currency
translation, and days sales outstanding improved to 74 days from 81 days at year-end 2004.

Results of Operations

Fiscal 2005 vs. Fiscal

Highlights of Snap-on’s results
of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005 (fiscal 2005), and January 1,
2005 (fiscal 2004), are as follows:

Total revenue in 2005 decreased $45.0
million, or 1.9%, from prior-year levels due to lower financial services revenue of $24.5
million and lower net sales of $20.5 million. The $20.5 million decrease in net sales
includes $33.1 million of lower sales partially offset by $12.6 million of favorable
currency translation. The $33.1 million net sales decline principally reflects the impact
of lower sales in the company’s North American franchise operations along with lower
sales in the OEM facilitation and worldwide equipment businesses, partially offset by
increased sales of tools for industrial and commercial applications, including growth in
emerging markets, and higher international dealer sales.

Gross profit (defined as net sales
less cost of goods sold) was $1,019.9 million, or 44.2% of net sales, in 2005, as compared
to $1,009.3 million, or 43.3% in 2004. The $10.6 million, or 90 basis points (100 basis
points equals 1.0 percent), improvement in year-over-year gross profit primarily reflects
benefits from higher selling prices and lower costs, including benefits from efficiency
and productivity initiatives of $15.4 million, higher “last-in, first-out”
(“LIFO”) inventory benefits of $5.6 million, $3.2 million of favorable currency
translation, and $2.5 million of lower pension, postretirement and insurance expenses due,
in part, to favorable demographic changes in the company’s U.S. hourly pension plans,
including a decline in the number of participants. These year-over-year improvements in
gross profit were partially offset by the impact of the lower sales volume, higher
production costs in U.S. manufacturing facilities to improve order-fill rates, and $22.3
million of higher steel costs. Restructuring costs included in “Cost of goods
sold” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings totaled $3.0 million in
2005, as compared to $16.0 million in 2004.

Operating expenses in 2005 decreased
$39.6 million, or 100 basis points as a percentage of total revenue, from prior-year
levels. The decline in year-over-year operating expenses primarily reflects benefits of
$41.4 million from efficiency and cost reduction initiatives, $12.7 million of lower bad
debt expense and dealer termination costs, as well as the absence, in 2005, of both the
$3.6 million charge for the U.S. General Services Administration (“GSA”)
settlement and the $3.3 million of severance costs related to the November 2004
resignation of the company’s former chairman, president and chief executive officer
(“former officer”). These decreases in year-over-year operating expenses were
partially offset by $6.9 million of higher pension, postretirement and insurance expenses,
primarily due to demographic and actuarial assumption changes in the company’s U.S.
salaried pension plans, $5.0 million of higher freight costs, largely due to fuel
surcharges and more frequent shipments to dealers, $4.0 million of unfavorable currency
translation, and $3.0 million of costs to terminate a supplier relationship. Restructuring
costs included in “Operating expenses” on the accompanying Consolidated
Statements of Earnings totaled $16.3 million in 2005, as compared to $5.7 million in 2004.


Interest expense of $21.7 million in
2005 was lower than the $23.0 million incurred in 2004 primarily due to benefits from
lower average debt levels, including the fourth-quarter 2005 repayment of $100 million of
unsecured 6.625% notes on October 3, 2005, partially offset by the impact of higher
year-over-year interest rates.

Other income (expense) – net was
income of $1.7 million in 2005, as compared to income of $1.1 million in 2004. This line
item includes the impact of all non-operating items such as interest income, minority
interest, hedging and currency exchange rate transaction gains and losses, and other
miscellaneous non-operating items. Benefits from higher year-over-year interest income and
foreign exchange gains in 2005, as compared with foreign exchange losses in 2004, were
partially offset by an increase in minority interest expense. Minority interest expense
was $3.6 million in 2005, as compared to $2.0 million in 2004.

Snap-on’s effective tax rate of
37.2% for 2005 included $3.3 million of additional U.S. income tax expense related to the
repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
(the “AJCA”). Under the provisions of the AJCA, Snap-on repatriated
approximately $93 million of qualifying dividends during the second half of 2005.
Snap-on’s effective tax rate of 32.1% in 2004 benefited from the conclusion of
prior-year tax matters. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
discussion of income taxes.

Exit or Disposal
Activities

For a discussion of Snap-on’s
exit and disposal activities, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Segment Results

Snap-on’s business segments are
based on the organization structure used by management for making operating and investment
decisions and for assessing performance. Snap-on’s reportable business segments
include: (i) the Snap-on Dealer Group; (ii) the Commercial and Industrial Group; (iii) the
Diagnostics and Information Group; and (iv) Financial Services. The Snap-on Dealer Group
consists of Snap-on’s business operations serving the worldwide franchised dealer van
channel. The Commercial and Industrial Group consists of the business operations providing
tools and equipment products and equipment repair services to a broad range of industrial
and commercial customers worldwide through direct, distributor and other non-franchised
distribution channels. The Diagnostics and Information Group consists of the business
operations providing diagnostics equipment, vehicle service information, business
management systems, and other solutions for vehicle service to customers in the worldwide
vehicle service and repair marketplace. Financial Services consists of the business
operations of Snap-on Credit LLC (“SOC”), a consolidated, 50%-owned joint
venture between Snap-on and The CIT Group, Inc. (“CIT”), and Snap-on’s
wholly owned finance subsidiaries in those international markets where Snap-on has dealer
operations. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of
SOC.

Snap-on evaluates the performance of
its operating segments based on segment revenues and operating earnings, exclusive of
financing activities and income taxes. Segment revenues are defined as total revenues,
including both external customer revenue and intersegment revenue. Segment operating
earnings are defined as segment revenues less cost of goods sold and operating expenses,
including restructuring costs. Snap-on accounts for intersegment sales and transfers based
primarily on standard costs with reasonable mark-ups established between the segments.
Identifiable assets by segment are those assets used in the respective reportable
segment’s operations. Intersegment amounts are eliminated to arrive at consolidated
financial results.


Due to changes in Snap-on’s
management organization structure, Snap-on realigned its business segments during the
first quarter of fiscal 2005. The primary changes included the transfer of Snap-on’s
technical representative (“tech rep”) support organization from the Snap-on
Dealer Group to the Diagnostics and Information Group and the segregation of
Snap-on’s general corporate expenses from the operating earnings of the business
segments. Prior to fiscal 2005, shared services and general corporate expenses and
corporate assets were allocated to the business segments based on segment revenues.
Beginning in fiscal 2005, the business segments are charged only for those shared services
utilized by the business segment based on an estimate of the value of services provided;
general corporate expenses and corporate assets are not allocated to the business
segments. Corporate assets consist principally of those assets that are centrally managed
including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, pension assets and income
taxes, as well as corporate real estate and related assets. Prior-year financial data by
segment has been restated to reflect these reportable business segment realignments.

Snap-on Dealer Group

Total segment revenue in 2005
decreased $26.1 million, or 2.6%, from prior-year levels. The year-over-year decrease
reflects $30.8 million of lower sales, primarily due to a lower average number of U.S.
dealer vans in operation in 2005, partially offset by higher sales in international
markets and $4.7 million of favorable currency translation. The number of U.S. dealer vans
in operation at December 31, 2005, was down 5.8% from year-end 2004 levels.

Segment gross profit in 2005
decreased $1.6 million, but increased 100 basis points as a percentage of total segment
revenue, from prior-year levels. The year-over-year decrease reflects the impact of the
lower sales volume, higher production costs in U.S. manufacturing facilities to improve
order-fill rates and $9.8 million of higher steel costs. These declines in gross profit
were partially offset by benefits from higher selling prices, an improved mix of
higher-margin diagnostics products, and lower depreciation, largely due to the absence of
depreciation related to two U.S. hand-tool facility closures in 2004. Gross profit in 2005
also benefited from $5.6 million of higher year-over-year LIFO benefits, $8.5 million in
lower restructuring costs, $2.5 million of favorable currency translation and $2.2 million
of lower pension, postretirement and insurance costs. Operating expenses for the Snap-on
Dealer Group decreased $3.4 million year over year, but increased 60 basis points as a
percentage of total segment revenue. The year-over-year decrease primarily includes
benefits from efficiency and cost reduction initiatives of $9.1 million, lower bad debt
expense and dealer termination costs of $4.4 million, and the operating expense impact
from lower sales. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by $4.8
million in higher restructuring costs related to 2005 severance actions, $3.0 million of
costs incurred in the first quarter of 2005 to terminate a supplier relationship, $4.3
million of higher freight costs and $1.9 million of unfavorable currency translation. As a
result of these factors, segment operating earnings in 2005 increased $1.8 million, or 40
basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue, over prior-year levels.


Commercial and
Industrial Group

Total segment revenue in 2005
increased $19.0 million, or 1.7%, over prior-year levels. The year-over-year increase
includes $11.1 million from higher sales and $7.9 million of favorable currency
translation. The $11.1 million year-over-year sales increase primarily reflects higher
sales and pricing of tools for industrial and commercial applications, including
significant growth in emerging markets, and higher sales as a result of the launch of new
power tool products. These year-over-year increases in sales were partially offset by
lower equipment sales due primarily to a continued soft European market, the impact from
certain discontinued products, and a decline in equipment servicing revenues.

Segment gross profit in 2005
increased $19.5 million, or 110 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue,
over prior-year levels. Benefits from higher sales and pricing, as well as lower costs,
including benefits from efficiency and productivity initiatives of $12.5 million and lower
year-over-year restructuring costs of $3.9 million, were partially offset by $12.5 million
of higher steel costs. Operating expenses for the Commercial and Industrial Group
decreased $26.6 million or 300 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue. The
improvement in year-over-year operating expenses includes benefits from efficiency and
cost reduction initiatives of $20.0 million, lower bad debt expense of $7.4 million, and
the absence of the $3.6 million GSA settlement charge incurred in 2004. These reductions
in year-over-year operating expenses were partially offset by $2.2 million of increased
freight costs, $2.1 million of unfavorable currency translation and $1.2 million of lower
gains on sales of facilities. As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings in
2005 increased $46.1 million over prior-year levels.

Diagnostics and
Information Group

Total segment revenue in 2005
decreased $54.3 million, or 11.1%, from prior-year levels, including $54.8 million of
lower sales partially offset by $0.5 million of favorable currency translation. The $54.8
million sales decline primarily reflects the comparison against the 2004 successful launch
of new,

Snap-on

brand diagnostics products, lower sales in the OEM facilitation
business and state emission program updates that were not repeated in 2005.

Segment gross profit in 2005
decreased $7.3 million, but increased 320 basis points as a percentage of total segment
revenue, from prior year. The impact of lower sales and $1.3 million of higher freight
costs was partially offset by benefits from lower costs, including benefits from
efficiency and productivity initiatives of $4.8 million. Operating expenses for the
Diagnostics and Information Group decreased $6.9 million, but increased 210 basis points
as a percentage of total segment revenue. Benefits from continuous improvement actions of
$6.9 million and lower bad debt expense of $2.5 million were partially offset by $2.7
million of higher year-over-year restructuring costs. As a result, segment operating
earnings in 2005 decreased $0.4 million, but increased 110 basis points as a percentage of
total segment revenue, from prior-year levels.

Segment revenues and operating
earnings were $53.6 million and $15.7 million in 2005, down $24.5 million and $18.4
million from prior-year levels, primarily due to the impact of higher year-over-year
interest rates in Snap-on’s domestic financing business, as well as an 11.4% decline
in credit originations.

Corporate

Snap-on’s general corporate
expenses totaled $46.4 million in 2005, up from $43.0 million in 2004. Savings realized
from cost reduction initiatives, as well as the absence, in 2005, of $3.3 million of
severance costs related to the resignation of a former officer, were more than offset by
higher pension and postretirement costs of $8.8 million primarily due to demographic and
actuarial assumption changes in the company’s U.S. salaried pension plans, higher
mark-to-market adjustments and other adjustments on stock-based incentive and deferred
compensation plans of $2.5 million, and higher year-over-year restructuring costs of $1.3
million. In addition, Snap-on’s North-American based Enterprise Resource Planning
(“ERP”) system became fully depreciated mid-year 2004, resulting in lower
depreciation expense year over year.

Fourth Quarter

Highlights of Snap-on’s results
of operations for the quarters ended December 31, 2005, and January 1, 2005, are as
follows:

Total revenue in the fourth quarter
of 2005 decreased $36.4 million, or 6.0%, from prior-year levels due to lower net sales of
$28.4 million and lower financial services revenue of $8.0 million. The $28.4 million
decrease in net sales includes $14.4 million of unfavorable currency translation and $14.0
million of lower sales. The $14.0 million net sales decline principally reflects the
impact of lower sales in the company’s North American dealer operations, along with
lower sales in the OEM facilitation and worldwide equipment businesses and lower
diagnostics products sales. These year-over-year sales declines were partially offset by
higher sales of hand tools for industrial and commercial applications and growth in
emerging markets. Financial services revenue in 2005 declined $8.0 million from 2004
levels, primarily reflecting the impact of higher interest rates in Snap-on’s
domestic financing business, as well as the impact of lower credit originations.


Gross profit decreased $17.5 million,
or 80 basis points, from prior-year levels, primarily reflecting the impact of lower
sales, higher production costs

in U.S. manufacturing facilities to improve
order-fill rates, $6.1 million of unfavorable currency translation and $3.9 million of
higher steel costs. These declines in gross profit were partially offset by benefits from
higher pricing, as well as efficiency and productivity initiatives of $4.5 million and
$3.6 million of higher year-over-year LIFO benefits.

Operating expenses in the fourth
quarter of 2005 decreased $31.1 million, or 280 basis points as a percentage of total
revenue, from the fourth quarter of 2004. The year-over-year improvement in operating
expenses primarily reflects benefits of $12.3 million from efficiency and cost reduction
initiatives, $6.8 million of lower bad debt expense and dealer termination costs, $4.8
million of favorable currency translation, lower restructuring costs of $1.4 million and
the absence, in 2005, of $3.3 million of severance costs related to the resignation of a
former officer. These improvements in operating expenses were partially offset by higher
pension, postretirement and insurance expenses of $3.1 million, higher freight costs of
$1.4 million, and lower year-over-year gains on the sales of facilities of $1.1 million.

Interest expense of $4.6 million in
the fourth quarter of 2005 was down slightly from the $5.6 million incurred in the fourth
quarter of 2004, primarily due to the repayment of $100 million of unsecured notes on
October 3, 2005, partially offset by the impact of higher year-over-year interest rates.

Other income (expense) – net was
income of $3.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, as compared to income of $4.7
million in the comparable prior-year period, primarily due to higher minority interest
expense in 2005, partially offset by favorable year-over-year foreign exchange transaction
gains and other miscellaneous non-operating items.

Snap-on’s effective tax rate of
36.1% in the fourth quarter of 2005 included $0.5 million of additional U.S. income tax
expense as the actual amount of foreign dividends repatriated under the AJCA during
2005 was approximately $18 million higher than earlier estimates. Snap-on’s
effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2004 was 35.3%. See Note 9 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of income taxes.

Snap-on Dealer Group

Total segment revenue in the fourth
quarter of 2005 decreased $14.4 million, or 5.8%, from prior-year levels, including lower
sales of $12.1 million and unfavorable currency translation of $2.3 million. Sales in the
North American franchise businesses were down 4.9% year over year, primarily due to a
lower average number of U.S. dealer vans in operation. Sales in the international
franchise businesses decreased 9.5% year over year, largely due to unfavorable currency
translation.


Segment gross profit for the fourth
quarter of 2005 decreased $10.0 million, or 150 basis points as a percentage of total
segment revenue, from prior-year levels. The year-over-year decrease reflects the impact
of the lower sales volume, higher production costs in U.S. manufacturing facilities to
improve order-fill rates and $1.4 million of higher steel costs. These declines in gross
profit were partially offset by benefits from higher selling prices and $3.6 million of
higher year-over-year LIFO benefits. Operating expenses for the Snap-on Dealer Group
decreased $7.9 million or 110 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue. The
$7.9 million decrease primarily reflects benefits of $4.4 million from efficiency and cost
reduction initiatives, $1.8 million of lower bad debt expense and dealer termination costs
and lower expenses from the lower sales. These decreases in operating expenses were
partially offset by $1.7 million of higher freight expense, largely due to fuel surcharges
and more frequent shipments to dealers. As a result of these factors, segment operating
earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005 decreased $2.1 million, or 40 basis points as a
percentage of total segment revenue, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2004.

Commercial and
Industrial Group

Total segment revenue in the fourth
quarter of 2005 decreased $11.1 million, or 3.8%, from prior-year levels, of which $10.6
million was due to unfavorable currency translation. Increased sales of hand tools for
commercial and industrial applications worldwide were offset by a decline in vehicle
service equipment sales.

Segment gross profit for the fourth
quarter of 2005 decreased $0.9 million from prior year, but increased 110 basis points as
a percentage of total segment revenue. The year-over-year decrease in segment gross profit
primarily reflects $4.5 million of unfavorable currency translation, $2.5 million of
higher steel costs and $1.9 million of other inflationary price increases. These declines
in gross margin were partially offset by benefits of $3.6 million from product cost
reduction and facilities rationalization and consolidation initiatives, higher pricing,
and $0.9 million of lower year-over-year restructuring costs. Operating expenses for the
Commercial and Industrial Group decreased $11.3 million or 280 basis points as a
percentage of total segment revenue. The improvement in year-over-year operating expenses
primarily includes $4.0 million of lower bad debt expense, $3.4 million of benefits from
efficiency and productivity initiatives, $3.1 million of favorable currency translation
and $1.6 million of lower restructuring costs. These improvements in year-over-year
operating expenses were partially offset by $1.5 million of lower gains on sales of
facilities in 2005 and by continued investment spending to support Snap-on’s growth
strategy in Asia and other emerging markets. As a result of these factors, segment
operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005 increased $10.4 million as compared to
the fourth quarter of 2004.


Diagnostics and
Information Group

Total segment revenue in the fourth
quarter of 2005 decreased $24.2 million, or 19.4%, from prior-year levels, including $22.6
million of lower sales and $1.6 million of unfavorable currency translation. The $22.6
million sales decline primarily reflects the comparison against the third-quarter 2004
successful launch of new,

Snap-on

brand diagnostics products, as well as the impact
of lower OEM facilitation sales year over year.

Segment gross profit for the fourth
quarter of 2005 decreased $6.6 million, but increased 320 basis points as a percentage of
total segment revenue, from the same period last year, largely due to the lower sales and
unfavorable currency translation of $0.8 million, partially offset by benefits from
efficiency and productivity initiatives of $2.6 million. Operating expenses for the
Diagnostics and Information Group decreased $6.3 million, but increased 110 basis points
as a percentage of total segment revenue, primarily due to $2.9 million of lower bad debt
expense, $1.7 million of benefits from efficiency and productivity initiatives and $0.8
million of favorable currency translation. As a result of these factors, segment operating
earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005 decreased $0.3 million, but increased 210 basis
points as a percentage of total segment revenue, as compared to the fourth quarter of
2004.

Segment revenues and operating
earnings were $10.2 million and $2.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, down $8.0
million and $3.4 million from prior-year levels, primarily due to the impact of higher
year-over-year interest rates in Snap-on’s domestic financing business, as well as an
11.9% decline in credit originations.

Corporate

Snap-on’s general corporate
expenses totaled $14.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, down $1.0 million from $15.8
million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Savings realized from cost reduction initiatives,
as well as the absence, in 2005, of $3.3 million of severance costs related to the
resignation of a former officer, were more than offset by higher pension and
postretirement costs of $3.6 million and higher year-over-year restructuring costs of $0.7
million.


Fiscal 2004 vs. Fiscal

The Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued interpretation (“FIN”) No. 46R,
“

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (an interpretation of ARB No.
51)

” in December 2003, which became effective for Snap-on at the beginning of its
2004 fiscal year. FIN No. 46R provides consolidation guidance regarding the identification
of variable interest entities for which control is achieved through means other than
through voting rights.

Based on the company’s analysis
of FIN No. 46R, the company concluded that Snap-on would consolidate SOC as of January 4,
2004, the beginning of Snap-on’s 2004 fiscal year. Snap-on previously accounted for
SOC, a 50%-owned joint venture, using the equity method. As Snap-on consolidated SOC on a
prospective basis, previously issued financial statements have not been restated. As a
result of the consolidation of SOC in fiscal 2004, Snap-on began reporting the results of
its finance operations as a new business segment, “Financial Services.” The
impact of the consolidation of SOC on Snap-on’s consolidated balance sheet was not
significant. See Notes 2, 7 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
discussion of SOC and Snap-on’s business segments.

Highlights of Snap-on’s results
of operations for the fiscal years ended January 1, 2005 (fiscal 2004), and January 3,
2004 (fiscal 2003), are as follows:

Snap-on’s 2004 fiscal year
contained 52 weeks of operating results. Snap-on’s 2003 fiscal year contained 53
weeks of operating results, with the additional week occurring in the fourth quarter. The
impact of the additional week of operations on full-year 2003 operating earnings was not
material.

Total revenue in 2004 increased
$174.0 million, or 7.8%, over prior-year levels. Of the year-over-year increase, $86.6
million was attributable to currency translation, and $78.1 million resulted from the
consolidation of SOC, previously accounted for under the equity method, and Snap-on’s
wholly owned financial services subsidiaries. The year-over-year revenue increase also
includes higher sales of handheld diagnostics tools, increased sales in the international
dealer businesses, higher sales of equipment in North America, and higher sales of
commercial and industrial tools in both Europe and Asia. These revenue increases were
partially offset by lower sales in the U.S. dealer businesses and by lower sales of
industrial tools in North America.

Gross profit in 2004 increased $44.6
million, or 10 basis points, to 43.3% of net sales. The year-over-year improvement in
gross profit reflects the impact of the higher sales, $31.1 million of currency
translation, $9.6 million of net savings from cost reduction initiatives and $8.9 million
in lower year-over-year restructuring costs. These improvements in gross profit were
partially offset by $11.3 million in increased year-over-year steel costs, $10.2 million
of higher expenses from production inefficiencies and other manufacturing variances
associated with the relocation of production from the closure of two U.S. hand-tool plants
in March 2004, and lower LIFO benefits and other inventory costs totaling $7.6 million.


Operating expenses in 2004 increased
$86.7 million, or 90 basis points as a percentage of total revenue, over prior-year
levels, including $44.0 million from the consolidation of SOC, previously accounted for
under the equity method, and Snap-on’s wholly owned financial services subsidiaries.
Foreign currency translation contributed $25.9 million to the year-over-year operating
expense increase. Operating expenses in 2004 were also impacted by the higher sales, $3.6
million in costs associated with the settlement of two GSA contract audits and $3.5
million of higher freight costs, reflecting increased freight rates and smaller, but more
frequent, shipments to dealers. In addition, operating expenses in 2004 included $3.5
million of higher start-up costs associated with the company’s expansion of its
distribution system and operating presence in emerging markets and $3.3 million for
severance costs related to the November 2004 resignation of a former officer.

Interest expense was $23.0 million in
2004, down $1.4 million from $24.4 million in 2003. The year-over-year decline primarily
reflects lower interest paid on dealer deposits.

Other income (expense) – net was
income of $1.1 million in 2004, as compared to an expense of $9.0 million in 2003. This
line item includes the impact of all non-operating items such as interest income, minority
interest, hedging and currency exchange rate transaction gains and losses, and other
miscellaneous non-operating items. The year-over-year change in other income (expense)
includes $6.0 million of lower foreign exchange losses and $1.1 million of lower minority
interests, along with higher interest and other income. Minority interests for 2004 and
2003 were $2.0 million and $3.1 million.

Snap-on’s effective tax rates of
32.1% in 2004 and 32.6% in 2003 benefited from the conclusion of prior-year tax matters in
both years.

Exit or Disposal
Activities

For a discussion of Snap-on’s
exit and disposal activities, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Segment Results

Snap-on’s business segments are
based on the organization structure used by management for making operating and investment
decisions and for assessing performance. Snap-on’s reportable business segments
include: (i) the Snap-on Dealer Group; (ii) the Commercial and Industrial Group; (iii) the
Diagnostics and Information Group; and (iv) Financial Services. The Snap-on Dealer Group
consists of Snap-on’s business operations serving the worldwide franchised dealer van
channel. The Commercial and Industrial Group consists of the business operations providing
tools and equipment products and equipment repair services to a broad range of industrial
and commercial customers worldwide through direct, distributor and other non-franchised
distribution channels. The Diagnostics and Information Group consists of the business
operations providing diagnostics equipment, vehicle service information, business
management systems and other solutions for vehicle service to customers in the worldwide
vehicle service and repair marketplace. Financial Services, which consists of the business
operations of SOC and Snap-on’s wholly owned finance subsidiaries in those
international markets where Snap-on has dealer operations, became a new business segment
in fiscal 2004. Prior-year segment disclosures were not restated to include the Financial
Services segment due to the prospective adoption of FIN No. 46R. See Notes 2 and 7 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of SOC and the company’s
adoption of FIN No. 46R.

Snap-on evaluates the performance of
its operating segments based on segment revenues and operating earnings, exclusive of
financing activities and income taxes. Segment revenues are defined as total revenues,
including both external customer revenue and intersegment revenue. Segment operating
earnings are defined as segment revenues less cost of goods sold and operating expenses,
including restructuring costs. Snap-on accounts for intersegment sales and transfers based
primarily on standard costs with reasonable mark-ups established between the segments.
Identifiable assets by segment are those assets used in the respective reportable
segment’s operations. Intersegment amounts are eliminated to arrive at consolidated
financial results.


Due to changes in Snap-on’s
management organization structure, Snap-on realigned its business segments during the
first quarter of fiscal 2005. The primary changes included the transfer of Snap-on’s
tech rep organization from the Snap-on Dealer Group to the Diagnostics and Information
Group and the segregation of Snap-on’s general corporate expenses from the operating
earnings of the business segments. Prior to fiscal 2005, shared services and general
corporate expenses and corporate assets were allocated to the business segments based on
segment revenues. Beginning in fiscal 2005, the business segments are charged only for
those shared services utilized by the business segment based on an estimate of the value
of services provided; general corporate expenses and corporate assets are not allocated to
the business segments. Corporate assets consist principally of those assets that are
centrally managed including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, pension
assets and income taxes, as well as corporate real estate and related assets. The
accompanying 2004 and 2003 financial data by segment has been restated to reflect the 2005
reportable business segment realignments.

Snap-on Dealer Group

Total segment revenue in 2004
increased $7.3 million, or 0.7%, over prior-year levels due to $22.7 million of currency
translation partially offset by a sales decrease of $15.4 million. In the United States,
sales were 3.5% lower year over year. The average number of U.S. dealer vans in operation
during 2004 was down 4% from year-end 2003, primarily due to a lower level of new dealer
additions in 2004. During the first quarter of 2004, Snap-on tightened eligibility
requirements for its franchise dealer expansion and enhancement initiative and the
recruitment standards for prospective dealers, aimed at improving the strength of its
franchised dealer network. In the company’s non-U.S. dealer businesses, segment
revenue increased $34.4 million year over year, including $22.7 million from currency
translation.

Segment gross profit in 2004
decreased $9.7 million, or 130 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue, from
last year, reflecting the impact of lower sales volume and $8.6 million of higher costs
associated with production inefficiencies and other manufacturing variances related to the
relocation of production from two U.S. hand-tool plants. Segment gross profit in 2004 was
also impacted by $4.1 million of lower year-over-year LIFO benefits and other inventory
costs and by $7.7 million from increased steel costs. These higher costs were partially
offset by $8.4 million of currency translation, $13.1 million in lower year-over-year
restructuring costs and $1.3 million of lower pension, postretirement and other insurance
costs. Operating expenses for the Snap-on Dealer Group decreased $2.4 million year over
year, down 50 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue. The $2.4 million
decrease includes the operating expense impact from lower sales volume, as well as $8.0
million of lower bad debt expense and $2.3 million in lower year-over-year restructuring
costs. These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by $6.8 million of
currency translation and $3.4 million of higher freight expense, reflecting increased
freight rates and smaller, but more frequent, shipments to dealers. As a result of these
factors, segment operating earnings in 2004 decreased $7.3 million, or 80 basis points as
a percentage of total segment revenue, as compared to the prior year.


Commercial and
Industrial Group

Total segment revenue in 2004
increased $74.4 million, or 7.2%, over prior-year levels, due to $56.3 million of currency
translation and $18.1 million in higher sales. Demand for tools improved in both North
America and Europe in 2004, despite lower sales of industrial tools in North America. In
addition, higher sales of vehicle service equipment were achieved in North America through
the company’s Technical Automotive Group (“TAG”) distribution channel,
which was launched mid-year 2003.

Segment gross profit in 2004
increased $23.9 million, but decreased 10 basis points as a percentage of total segment
revenue. Benefits realized from higher sales, $19.5 million of currency translation, $4.2
million of lower inventory costs and $2.7 million from cost reduction initiatives were
partially offset by $6.2 million of higher year-over-year restructuring costs, $3.1
million of increased steel costs and $2.3 million of increased freight costs. Operating
expenses for the Commercial and Industrial Group increased $32.8 million or 90 basis
points as a percentage of total segment revenue. The increase in operating expenses
reflects the impact of higher sales, $16.2 million of currency translation, $6.3 million
in higher bad debt expense, $3.6 million of costs associated with the GSA contract audits
settlement and a $3.6 million year-over-year increase in restructuring costs, partially
offset by $2.9 million of benefits from cost reduction initiatives and a $2.9 million
year-over-year increase in gains on the sales of facilities. Operating expenses were also
impacted by $3.5 million of start-up costs associated with the company’s investment
to expand its distribution and operating presence in emerging markets. As a result of
these factors, segment operating earnings in 2004 decreased $8.9 million as compared to
2003.

Diagnostics and
Information Group

Total segment revenue in 2004
increased $38.1 million, or 8.5%, over prior-year levels due to $28.1 million in higher
sales, principally of handheld diagnostics, and $10.0 million of currency translation.

Segment gross profit in 2004
increased $30.4 million, or 350 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue,
from prior year, largely reflecting the growth in sales of handheld diagnostics and
information products, $8.1 million of benefits from cost reduction initiatives and $3.2
million of currency translation. Segment gross profit also benefited from $2.9 million in
lower year-over-year costs for restructuring, primarily reflecting the absence of costs
incurred in 2003 for the closure of the segment’s large-platform diagnostics
facility. Operating expenses for the Diagnostics and Information Group increased $5.2
million, but decreased 130 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue,
reflecting $2.8 million of currency translation, $2.5 million from the absence of gains
realized from the sale of facilities in 2003 and $2.1 million of higher bad debt expense.
As a result of these factors, segment operating earnings in 2004 increased $25.2 million,
or 480 basis points as a percentage of total segment revenue, as compared to the prior
year.

Segment operating earnings in 2004
were $34.1 million. Net finance income was $43.8 million in 2003. Operating earnings for
2004 decreased year over year primarily due to lower loan originations and higher market
interest rates. Snap-on believes that the decline in loan originations is primarily due to
sales mix in the Snap-on Dealer Group and a reduced level of dealer borrowings as a result
of the strengthening fiscal health of dealers, combined with the tightening of both the
eligibility requirements for franchise dealer expansion and the recruitment standards for
new prospective dealers.

Corporate

Snap-on’s general corporate
expenses totaled $43.0 million in 2004, up $7.1 million from $35.9 million in 2003.
Savings realized from lower pension and postretirement expense of $5.4 million, primarily
due to benefits from changes in actuarial assumptions as a result of higher plan asset
returns and favorable demographic changes, were more then offset by higher accounting and
audit-related costs related to the company’s evaluation of the effectiveness of its
internal controls over financial reporting under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, $3.3
million of severance costs related to the resignation of a former officer, and higher
mark-to-market adjustments on stock-based incentive and other compensation plans.

Financial Condition

Snap-on’s growth has
historically been funded by a combination of cash provided by operating activities and
debt financing. Snap-on believes that its cash from operations, coupled with its sources
of borrowings, are sufficient to fund its anticipated requirements for working capital,
capital expenditures, restructuring activities, acquisitions, common stock repurchases and
dividend payments. Due to Snap-on’s credit rating over the years, external funds have
been available at a reasonable cost. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K, Snap-on’s long-term debt and commercial paper was rated A2 and P-1 by
Moody’s Investors Service and A and A-1 by Standard & Poor’s. Snap-on
believes that the strength of its balance sheet affords the company the financial
flexibility to respond to both internal growth opportunities and those available through
acquisitions.


The following discussion focuses on
information included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Snap-on has been focused on improving
asset utilization by making more effective use of its investment in certain working
capital items. As of December 31, 2005, working capital (defined as current assets less
current liabilities) of $566.8 million was up $48.4 million from $518.4 million as of
January 1, 2005 (fiscal 2004 year end). The company assesses management’s operating
performance and effectiveness relative to those components of working capital,
particularly accounts receivable and inventories, that are more directly impacted by
operational decisions. The following represents the company’s working capital
position as of December 31, 2005, and January 1, 2005.

Accounts receivable at the end of
2005 was $485.9 million, down $56.1 million from year-end 2004 levels, largely reflecting
an improvement in days sales outstanding from 81 days at year-end 2004 to 74 days at
year-end 2005 and a $23.6 million decrease from currency translation.

Inventories totaled $283.2 million at
the end of 2005, down $58.7 million from year-end 2004 levels, including $19.2 million
from currency translation. The decrease in inventories from year-end 2004 primarily
reflects the company’s efforts to increase inventory turns, reduce on-hand inventory
levels and improve inventory management through “just in time” raw material
delivery. Inventories accounted for using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”)
method as of December 31, 2005, and January 1, 2005, approximated 63% and 65% of total
inventories. All other inventories are accounted for using the LIFO cost method. The
company’s LIFO reserve increased from $76.3 million at January 1, 2005, to $82.1
million at December 31, 2005. Inventory turns (full year cost of goods sold, divided by
the average of the beginning and ending inventory balances for the year) at December 31,
2005, were 4.1 turns as compared to 3.8 turns at year-end 2004.

Accounts payable at December 31,
2005, was $135.4 million, down $59.5 million from year-end 2004 levels due to the timing
of payments and an $8.7 million decrease from currency translation.

Notes payable and long-term debt at
December 31, 2005, and January 1, 2005, totaled $226.5 million and $331.0 million. Notes
payable to banks under uncommitted lines of credit totaled $20.9 million at December 31,
2005, and $2.5 million at January 1, 2005. Amounts payable to CIT pursuant to a working
capital agreement with SOC totaled $3.9 million at December 31, 2005. See Note 7 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of SOC. At January 1, 2005,
Snap-on had commercial paper outstanding of $25 million. Snap-on repaid $25 million of
commercial paper borrowings in the second quarter of 2005; no commercial paper was
outstanding at December 31, 2005. On October 3, 2005, Snap-on repaid its $100 million,
10-year, 6.625% unsecured notes upon their maturity. The $100 million debt repayment was
made with available cash on hand; the company did not borrow any funds under its existing
credit facilities or committed bank lines of credit to fund the debt repayment.


At December 31, 2005, Snap-on had a
$400 million multi-currency revolving credit facility that terminates on July 27, 2009.
The $400 million multi-currency revolving credit facility’s financial covenant
requires that Snap-on maintain a ratio of debt to the sum of total debt plus
shareholders’ equity of not greater than 0.60 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2005,
Snap-on believes that it was in compliance with all covenants of this revolving credit
facility.

At December 31, 2005, Snap-on also
had $20 million of unused committed bank lines of credit, of which $10 million expires on
July 31, 2006, and $10 million expires on August 31, 2006. At December 31, 2005, Snap-on
had approximately $420 million of unused available debt capacity under the terms of its
revolving credit facility and committed bank lines of credit.

Snap-on maintains sufficient
committed lines of credit and liquidity facilities to cover its expected funding needs on
both a short-term and long-term basis. Snap-on manages its aggregate short-term borrowings
so as not to exceed its availability under its revolving credit facility and committed
lines of credit. The company accesses short-term debt markets, predominantly through
commercial paper issuances, to fund its short-term requirements and to ensure near-term
liquidity. Near-term liquidity requirements for Snap-on in 2006 include the funding of its
investments in capital expenditures, restructuring activities, and payments of dividends
and share repurchases. Snap-on expects to make contributions to its foreign pension plans
in 2006 of $6.2 million; Snap-on is not required to make a contribution to its domestic
pension plans in 2006. Depending on market and other conditions, however, Snap-on may
elect to make discretionary cash contributions to its domestic pension plans in 2006.

As funding needs are determined to be
of a longer-term nature, Snap-on could access medium- and long-term debt markets, as
appropriate, to refinance short-term borrowings and, thus, replenish its short-term
liquidity. Snap-on’s long-term financing strategy is to maintain continuous access to
the debt markets to accommodate its liquidity needs. For additional information on
Snap-on’s debt and credit facilities, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

The following discussion focuses on
information included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow.

Cash flow provided from operating
activities was $221.1 million in 2005, as compared to $146.8 million in 2004. The increase
in cash flow from operating activities in 2005 includes the impact of higher
year-over-year net earnings and lower inventory levels, along with an increase in
year-over-year cash flow from the impacts of combined net changes in operating assets and
liabilities. Cash flow from operating activities in 2004 included a $63.6 million
voluntary U.S. pension contribution and a $10.0 million payment to the U.S.
Department of Justice pursuant to an agreement to resolve a government audit relating to
two contracts with the GSA, partially offset by a $10.7 million income tax refund,
primarily resulting from a $78.2 million voluntary U.S. pension contribution made in the
fourth quarter of 2003. Cash flow from operating activities in 2003 was $177.0 million,
net of pension contributions of $92.2 million. The consolidation of SOC as of January
4, 2004, did not have a material impact on cash flow.

Depreciation in 2005 was $49.5
million, compared with $58.5 million in 2004 and $58.2 million in 2003. The decline in
2005 depreciation from prior-year levels reflects the absence of depreciation for both the
company’s North-American based ERP system, which became fully depreciated mid-year
2004, and the two U.S. hand-tool facilities that were closed in 2004. Amortization expense
was $2.7 million in 2005, $2.5 million in 2004 and $2.1 million in 2003.

Capital expenditures in 2005 were
$40.1 million, compared to $38.7 million in 2004 and $29.4 million in 2003. Capital
expenditures in all three years reflect new product-related, quality, efficiency and
cost-reduction capital investments, including the installation of new production equipment
and machine tooling to enhance manufacturing and distribution operations, as well as
ongoing replacements of manufacturing and distribution facilities and equipment. Snap-on
anticipates that 2006 capital expenditures will be in a range of $50 million to $55
million, including approximately $7 million to replace and enhance its existing global ERP
management information system over a period of several years. Snap-on believes that its
cash generated from operations, as well as the funds available from its credit facilities,
will be sufficient to fund the company’s capital expenditure requirements in 2006.


Snap-on has undertaken stock
repurchases from time to time to offset dilution created by shares issued for employee and
dealer stock purchase plans, stock options, and other corporate purposes, as well as to
repurchase shares when the company believes market conditions are favorable. In 2005,
Snap-on repurchased 912,100 shares of common stock for $32.1 million under its previously
announced share repurchase programs. As of December 31, 2005, Snap-on has remaining
availability to repurchase up to an additional $136.7 million in common stock pursuant to
the Board of Directors’ authorizations. The purchase of Snap-on common stock is at
the company’s discretion, subject to prevailing financial and market conditions.
Snap-on repurchased 1,200,000 shares of common stock for $38.2 million in 2004 and 450,000
shares of common stock for $12.5 million in 2003. Snap-on believes that its cash generated
from operations, as well as the funds available from its credit facilities, will be
sufficient to fund the company’s share repurchases in 2006.

On October 3, 2005, Snap-on repaid
its $100 million, 10-year, 6.625% unsecured notes upon their maturity. The $100 million
debt repayment was made with available cash on hand; the company did not borrow any funds
under its existing credit facilities or committed bank lines of credit to fund the debt
repayment.

Snap-on has paid consecutive
quarterly cash dividends, without interruption or reduction, since 1939. Cash dividends
paid in 2005, 2004 and 2003 totaled $57.8 million, $57.7 million and $58.2 million.

Snap-on entered into a 20-year, $25.7
million capital lease commitment in 2005 for office and distribution facilities for the
Snap-on Dealer Group operations in Japan. The impact of recording the capital lease
commitment was excluded from the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow as the
recording of the capital lease commitment was a “non-cash” item.

At December 31, 2005, $19.2 million
of loans originated by SOC have a primary recourse provision to Snap-on (primarily for
dealer van loans) if the loans become more than 90 days past due. For information on SOC,
long-term debt and operating leases see Notes 2, 7, 10 and 16 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.


Environmental Matters

Snap-on is subject to various
federal, state and local government requirements regulating the discharge of materials
into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment.
Snap-on’s policy is to comply with these requirements, and the company believes that,
as a general matter, its policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to
prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability,
in connection with its business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent
in some of Snap-on’s operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged
in similar businesses.

Snap-on is and has been engaged in
the handling, manufacture, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous or
toxic by one or more regulatory agencies. The company believes that, as a general matter,
its handling, manufacture, use and disposal of these substances are in accordance with
environmental laws and regulations. It is possible, however, that future knowledge or
other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or
increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could bring
into question the company’s handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these
substances.

Consolidated Joint
Venture

SOC, a consolidated, 50%-owned joint
venture between Snap-on and CIT, provides a broad range of financial services to
Snap-on’s U.S. dealer and customer network and to Snap-on’s industrial and other
customers. Snap-on began consolidating SOC as of January 4, 2004, the beginning of
Snap-on’s 2004 fiscal year, as a result of the adoption of FIN No. 46R. Snap-on
previously accounted for SOC using the equity method. Snap-on and CIT have identical
voting and participation rights and responsibilities in SOC. See Notes 2 and 7 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of SOC.

Snap-on receives royalty and
management fee income from SOC based on the volume of financings originated by SOC.
Snap-on also shares ratably with CIT in any residual net profit or loss of the joint
venture after operating expenses, including royalty and management fees, interest costs
and credit loss provisions. Snap-on provides extended-term financing internationally
through its wholly owned finance subsidiaries.

SOC sells substantially all of its
originated contracts on a limited recourse basis to CIT, net of certain fees. SOC
continues to service these contracts for an estimated market-rate servicing fee. In 2005,
SOC originated contracts totaling $413.8 million, as compared to $481.2 million in 2004
and $522.4 million in 2003.

Financial information regarding SOC
loan originations is as follows:


Snap-on has credit risk exposure for
certain SOC-originated contracts with recourse provisions against Snap-on (primarily for
dealer van loans). At December 31, 2005, and January 1, 2005, $19.2 million and $14.8
million of loans, with terms ranging from six months to ten years, have a primary recourse
provision to Snap-on if the loans become more than 90 days past due. The asset value of
the collateral underlying these recourse loans would serve to mitigate Snap-on’s loss
in the event of default. The estimated fair value of the guarantees for all loan
originations with recourse as of December 31, 2005, was not material.

CIT and Snap-on have agreed to lend
funds to support SOC’s working capital requirements on a 50/50 basis, with a combined
maximum borrowing limit not to exceed $24 million. As of December 31, 2005, SOC owed both
Snap-on and CIT $3.9 million each pursuant to this agreement.

Other Matters

Government Contract
Matters

On July 23, 2004, Snap-on reached an agreement
with the U.S. Department of Justice to resolve the government audit, previously discussed
in the company’s 2004 Annual Report on Form 10-K, relating to two contracts with the
GSA. Snap-on agreed to settle the claims over the interpretation and application of the
price reduction and billing provisions of these two contracts for sales from March 1996
through the July 23, 2004, settlement date for $10.0 million. Snap-on remitted the $10.0
million cash settlement to the U.S. Department of Justice on August 5, 2004.

On February 8, 2005, the GSA
requested information from Snap-on to evaluate possible administrative action against the
company. On May 24, 2005, Snap-on and the GSA discussed Snap-on’s pricing and
contract compliance practices. On August 5, 2005, the GSA notified the company that it
would take no administrative action against Snap-on in connection with the Federal Supply
Schedule contracts referred to above. The company considers the matter closed.

Other Legal Matters

Snap-on is also involved in various
legal matters that are being litigated and/or settled in the ordinary course of
business. In certain matters, former dealers, purportedly on behalf of
current and former franchised dealers, are seeking adjudication of certain claims as a
class within an arbitration proceeding. As an initial step, certain claimants have
successfully asserted in arbitration the right to further proceedings to determine whether
class certification in arbitration would be appropriate. Snap-on will continue to
vigorously assert defenses in these matters, including its belief that class certification
is not appropriate. Snap-on has taken steps in court to maintain its right to
challenge adverse results of the arbitral proceedings. Depending upon future developments
and circumstances in these matters, Snap-on will continue to pursue all available strategies
from dispositive class motions to settlement. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these
legal matters due, in part, to the uncertainty inherent in legal proceedings,
including the absence of precedents and clear procedures regarding class proceedings in
arbitration.

New Accounting Standards

See Note 2 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting standards.

Critical Accounting
Policies

The consolidated financial statements
and related notes contain information that is pertinent to management’s discussion
and analysis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These
estimates are generally based on historical experience, current conditions and on various
other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily available from other sources, as well as identifying and
assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. Snap-on considers the following policies to be
the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of
the company’s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could
impact the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flow.


Allowances for Doubtful
Accounts:

Snap-on’s accounts receivable are reported net of estimated bad debt
allowances, which are regularly evaluated by management for adequacy. The evaluations take
into consideration various financial and qualitative factors that may affect
customers’ ability to pay. These factors may include customers’ financial
condition, collateral, debt-servicing capacity, past payment experience and credit bureau
information. Snap-on regularly reviews the allowance estimation process and adjusts the
allowances as appropriate. It is possible, however, that the accuracy of Snap-on’s
estimation process could be adversely impacted if the financial condition of its customers
were to deteriorate. The company does not believe that accounts receivable represent
significant concentrations of credit risk because of the diversified portfolio of
individual customers and geographical areas.

Inventory Valuation:

Snap-on
values its inventory at the lower of cost or market and adjusts for the value of inventory
that is estimated to be excess, obsolete or otherwise unmarketable. Inventory adjustments
for raw materials are largely based on analysis of raw material age and actual physical
inspection of raw material for fitness for use. As part of evaluating work-in-progress and
finished goods, management reviews individual product stock-keeping units (SKUs) by
product category and product life cycle. Cost adjustments for each product
category/product life-cycle state are generally established and maintained based on a
combination of historical experience, forecasted sales and promotions, technological
obsolescence, inventory age and other actual known conditions and circumstances. Should
actual product marketability and raw material fitness for use be affected by conditions
that are different from management estimates, further adjustments to inventory allowances
may be required.

Warranty Accruals:

Snap-on
provides product warranties for specific product lines and accrues for estimated future
warranty costs in the period in which the sale is recorded. Snap-on calculates its accrual
requirements based on historic warranty loss experience that is periodically adjusted for
recent actual experience, including the timing of claims during the warranty period and
actual costs incurred. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
discussion of Snap-on’s warranty accrual.

Pension Benefits:

The
calculation of Snap-on’s pension expense and projected benefit obligation requires
the use of a number of assumptions. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced
by factors outside of Snap-on’s control and can have a significant effect on the
amounts reported in the financial statements. Snap-on believes that the two most critical
assumptions are the expected return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate.

For a discussion of the development
of Snap-on’s pension plans and expected return on plan assets assumption, see Note 12
to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension expense increases as the expected rate
of return on plan assets decreases. Lowering the expected rate of return assumption for
Snap-on’s domestic pension plan assets by 0.5% would increase Snap-on’s 2006
domestic pension expense by approximately $3 million. At year-end 2005, Snap-on’s
domestic plan assets comprised approximately 90% of Snap-on’s worldwide pension plan
assets.

Snap-on establishes the discount rate
using the current rates earned on long-term bonds with a Moody’s Aa rating. Pension
expense and projected benefit obligation both increase as the discount rate is reduced.
Lowering Snap-on’s domestic discount rate assumption by 0.5% would increase
Snap-on’s 2006 domestic pension expense and projected benefit obligation by
approximately $3.7 million and $50.3 million, respectively. At year-end 2005,
Snap-on’s domestic projected benefit obligation comprised approximately 84% of
Snap-on’s worldwide projected benefit obligation.

Income Taxes:

The company
records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than
not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. While the
company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax
strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and
assumptions change in the future, the company may be required to adjust its valuation
allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such
determination is made.


In addition, the company operates
within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The
company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may
change in the future due to new developments in each matter.

Outlook

Snap-on expects to improve its
current 7.1% operating margin to 10% or greater over the next three years, as it continues
making progress towards a targeted long-term goal of a mid-teens operating margin. Snap-on
believes its end-customer markets will grow at rates approximating Gross Domestic Product
(GDP), and that the successful achievement of its plans and initiatives should improve the
company’s market share over time.

For 2006, Snap-on expects, on a
consolidated basis, continued improving performance in the Commercial and Industrial and
the Diagnostics and Information Groups to be offset by a higher level of spending in the
Snap-on Dealer Group, particularly in the first two quarters of 2006, as it implements
certain initiatives to improve its franchise system, resulting in an expected decline in
Dealer segment operating earnings year over year in 2006. On a consolidated basis, this is
expected to result in modestly lower year-over-year net earnings in the first two quarters
of 2006; Snap-on expects a recovery in its net earnings performance to occur in the second
half of 2006 and to make steady progress into 2007.

Consolidated net sales in 2006 are
expected to grow at a low-single-digit rate year over year, reflecting increased sales in
all segments except the Snap-on Dealer Group, where sales are expected to remain flat for
the full year.

In the Commercial and Industrial and
the Diagnostics and Information business segments, Snap-on expects that the realization of
its strategic priorities will result in increased operating earnings in 2006 over the
level of 2005. Tempering this growth in 2006 will be an expected $10 million to $15
million of higher operating spending to continue the company’s expansion in Asia and
other emerging growth markets, and to support innovative new, information-based
diagnostics products.

In the Snap-on Dealer segment, the
company expects to incur approximately $15 million of incremental costs in 2006 to
increase field support and to support other franchise system initiatives. An additional $8
million to $10 million of investment spending will be necessary in 2006 to support
customer service and supply chain initiatives, and to support important new marketing
programs to increase market share. It is expected that the benefits of these programs will
reduce inventories, increase the number of technicians being served and lower costs.
Snap-on also expects to realize $13 million of annual cost savings in 2006 associated with
ongoing initiatives to further improve its manufacturing facilities. The company will
invest an additional $10 million to $15 million of capital expenditures to upgrade U.S.
manufacturing plants.

Additionally, as part of ongoing
initiatives aimed at integrating the company’s global operating footprint
and lowering its cost structure, Snap-on expects to incur restructuring costs of
approximately $20 million in 2006, consistent with 2005 levels.

In the Financial Services segment,
Snap-on expects results to continue to be under pressure from rising interest rates,
although not as significantly as in 2005.

Snap-on also anticipates that the
impact of adopting new stock option accounting rules, at current and anticipated grant
levels, will reduce consolidated operating income in 2006 by approximately $6 million to
$8 million. As a result of retiring $100 million of its debt in October 2005, Snap-on
expects lower interest expense for 2006. Snap-on believes its 2006 effective tax rate will
approximate 35%, compared with the 37.2% incurred in 2005.


Item 7A: Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market, Credit and
Economic Risks

Market risk is the potential economic
loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments.
Snap-on is exposed to market risk from changes in both foreign currency exchange rates and
interest rates. Snap-on monitors its exposure to these risks and attempts to manage the
underlying economic exposures through the use of financial instruments such as forward
exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements. Snap-on does not use derivative
instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Snap-on’s broad-based business
activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related
areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole. Snap-on’s management takes an
active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that
require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification,
assessment and control of various risks.

Foreign Currency Risk
Management

Snap-on has significant international
operations and is subject to certain risks inherent with foreign operations that include
currency fluctuations and restrictions on movement of funds. Foreign exchange risk exists
to the extent that Snap-on has payment obligations or receipts denominated in currencies
other than the functional currency. To manage these exposures, Snap-on identifies
naturally offsetting positions and then generally purchases hedging instruments to protect
the residual net anticipated exposures. Snap-on’s financial position and results of
operations have not been materially affected by such events to date. See Note 11 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of foreign currency risk
management.

Interest Rate Risk
Management

Snap-on’s interest rate risk
management policies are designed to reduce the potential earnings volatility that could
arise from changes in interest rates. Through the use of interest rate swaps, Snap-on aims
to stabilize funding costs by managing the exposure created by the differing maturities
and interest rate structures of Snap-on’s assets and liabilities. See Note 11 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of interest rate risk management.

Snap-on utilizes a Value-at-Risk
(“VAR”) model to determine the potential one-day loss in the fair value of its
interest rate and foreign exchange-sensitive financial instruments from adverse changes in
market factors. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a
95% confidence level. Snap-on’s computations are based on the inter-relationships
among movements in various currencies and interest rates (variance/co-variance technique).
These inter-relationships were determined by observing interest rate and foreign currency
market changes over the preceding quarter.

The estimated maximum potential
one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the VAR model, at December 31, 2005, was

$0.3 million on interest rate-sensitive financial instruments and $0.4 million on
foreign currency-sensitive financial instruments. The VAR model is a risk management tool
and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by
Snap-on, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors.

Credit Risk

Credit risk is the possibility of
loss from a customer’s failure to make payments according to contract terms. Prior to
granting credit, each customer is evaluated, taking into consideration the borrower’s
financial condition, collateral, debt-servicing capacity, past payment experience, credit
bureau information and other financial and qualitative factors that may affect the
borrower’s ability to repay. Specific credit reviews and standard industry credit
scoring models are used in performing this evaluation. Loans that have been granted are
typically monitored through an asset-quality-review process that closely monitors past due
accounts and initiates collection actions when appropriate. In addition to its direct
credit risk exposure, Snap-on also has credit risk exposure for certain SOC loan
originations with recourse provisions against Snap-on (primarily for dealer van loans). At
December 31, 2005, $19.2 million of loans originated by SOC have a recourse provision to
Snap-on if the loans become more than 90 days past due. For additional information on SOC,
refer to the section entitled “Consolidated Joint Venture” in this
Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Notes 2 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.


Commodity Risk

The company is a purchaser of certain
commodities, including steel and energy sources such as natural gas and electricity. The
company is also a purchaser of components and parts that are integrated into the
company’s end products, as well as the purchaser of certain finished goods, all
of which may contain various commodities including steel, aluminum and others.
Snap-on’s supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily
available from numerous suppliers.

Snap-on experienced higher pricing
related to certain grades and alloys of steel in 2004 and 2005 due to global demand for
these materials. The company generally buys these commodities based upon market prices
that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process. The company does not
anticipate experiencing any significant pricing or availability issues with regards to
2006 raw material steel purchases.

Several of the company’s
distribution channels, particularly the mobile dealer van channel, can be significantly
impacted by increases in gasoline and fuel prices. As these costs rise, dealers may limit
their driving, resulting in fewer customer calls and generally lower product sales. 
Snap-on also experienced higher fuel surcharges on material and product shipments in
2005 as a result of the increase in gasoline and fuel prices.

To the extent that commodity prices
increase and the company does not have firm pricing agreements with its suppliers, the
company may experience margin declines to the extent that it is not able to
increase the selling prices of its products.

Item 8: Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data

See List of Financial Statements on
page 50.

Item 9: Changes in and
Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.


Item 9A: Controls and
Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures

Snap-on maintains a system of
disclosure controls and procedures that is designed to provide reasonable assurance that
material information relating to the company and its consolidated subsidiaries is timely
communicated to the officers who certify Snap-on’s financial reports and to other
members of senior management and the Board of Directors, as appropriate.

Under the supervision and with the
participation of management, including Snap-on’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of this system of disclosure controls
and procedures as of December 31, 2005. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the company’s disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) are effective to ensure that the
information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or
submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Changes in Internal
Control

There were no changes in internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2005,
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
Snap-on’s internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in

Internal Control
– Integrated Framework

. Based on our evaluation under this framework, management
has concluded that, as of December 31, 2005, our internal control over financial reporting
was effective.

Management’s assessment of the
effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005,
has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting
firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.

Our management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our internal control
over financial reporting will prevent all error or fraud. Because of inherent limitations,
a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable
assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, because of changes in
conditions, effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and
Shareholders of

Snap-on Incorporated:

We have audited management’s
assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting, that Snap-on Incorporated and subsidiaries (the “Company”)
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005,
based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The
Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing
similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations
of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may
not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are
subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s
assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2005, based on the criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005, of the
Company and our report dated February 20, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph relating to the adoption of
FASB Interpretation 46R and the change in reportable segments.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and
Shareholders of

Snap-on Incorporated:

We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of Snap-on Incorporated and subsidiaries (the
“Company”) as of December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income,
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Snap-on Incorporated and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005, based on the criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 20, 2006, expressed an
unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

As discussed in Note 2 to the
consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation 46R,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

, and, accordingly, began consolidating
Snap-on Credit LLC as of January 4, 2004, and, as discussed in Note 17 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company changed its reportable segments in 2005 and 2004.

Note 1: Nature of
Operations

Snap-on Incorporated
(“Snap-on” or “the company”) was incorporated under the laws of the
state of Wisconsin in 1920 and reincorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in
1930. Snap-on is a leading global innovator, manufacturer and marketer of high-quality
tool, diagnostic, service and equipment solutions for professional tool and equipment
users under various brands and trade names. Product lines include a broad range of hand
and power tools, tool storage, saws and cutting tools, pruning tools, vehicle service
diagnostics equipment, vehicle service equipment, including wheel service, safety testing
and collision repair equipment, vehicle service information, business management systems,
equipment repair services, and other tool and equipment solutions. Snap-on also derives
income from various financing programs to facilitate the sales of its products.
Snap-on’s customers include automotive technicians, vehicle service centers,
manufacturers, industrial tool and equipment users, and those involved in commercial
applications such as construction, electrical and agriculture. Products are sold through
Snap-on’s franchised dealer van, company-direct, distributor and Internet sales
channels.

Note 2: Summary of
Accounting Policies

Principles of consolidation and
presentation:

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Snap-on,
its majority-owned subsidiaries and, beginning in 2004, Snap-on Credit LLC
(“SOC”), a 50%-owned joint venture with The CIT Group, Inc. (“CIT”).
Snap-on’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain
prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation.

In December 2003, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Interpretation (“FIN”) No.
46R,

“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (an interpretation of ARB No.
51),”

which became effective for Snap-on at the beginning of its 2004 fiscal
year. FIN No. 46R provides consolidation guidance regarding the identification of variable
interest entities (“VIE”) for which control is achieved through means other than
through voting rights. FIN No. 46R provides guidance in determining if a business
enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a VIE and whether or not that business enterprise
should consolidate the VIE for financial reporting purposes. Based on the company’s
analysis of FIN No. 46R, the company concluded that Snap-on would consolidate SOC as of
January 4, 2004, the beginning of Snap-on’s 2004 fiscal year. Snap-on previously
accounted for SOC using the equity method. As Snap-on consolidated SOC on a prospective
basis, previously issued financial statements have not been restated. The impact of the
consolidation of SOC on Snap-on’s consolidated balance sheet was not significant.
Refer to Note 7 for additional information on SOC. As a result of the consolidation of SOC
in fiscal 2004, Snap-on began reporting the results of its finance operations as a new
business segment, “Financial Services.” Refer to Note 17 for information on
Snap-on’s business segments.

Financial services:

Beginning
in 2004, financial services revenue consists of SOC’s sales of originated contracts
and service fee income, as well as installment contract revenue and dealer loan receivable
revenue derived from SOC and Snap-on’s wholly owned international finance operations.
Administrative expenses from Snap-on’s financial services business are included in
“Operating expenses” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Net finance income:

In 2003,
prior to the consolidation of SOC, net finance income consisted of royalty and management
fees received from SOC based on the volume of financings originated by SOC, as well as
installment contract revenue and dealer loan receivable revenue derived from
Snap-on’s wholly owned international finance operations, net of administrative
expenses. Administrative expenses related to Snap-on’s wholly owned international
finance operations totaled $13.4 million in 2003.

Fiscal year accounting period:

Snap-on’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest December 31. The 2005 and 2004
fiscal years each contained 52 weeks and ended on December 31, 2005, and January 1, 2005,
respectively. Snap-on’s 2003 fiscal year contained 53 weeks and ended on January 3,
2004.


Use of estimates:

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue recognition:

Snap-on
recognizes revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) the price is fixed or determinable; (iii)
collectibility is reasonably assured; and (iv) delivery has occurred or services have been
rendered. Snap-on maintains an accrual for estimated future product returns based upon
historical product return experience and assumptions for the gross profit margin and
volume of future sales returns. Franchise fee revenue is recognized as the fees are
earned; such revenue was not material in any year. Subscription revenue is deferred and
recognized over the life of the subscription.

Research and engineering:

Research and engineering costs are charged to expense in the year incurred. For 2005, 2004
and 2003, research and engineering costs totaled $50.0 million, $58.2 million and $57.0
million.

Shipping and handling:

Amounts
billed to customers for shipping and handling are included as a component of sales. Costs
incurred by Snap-on for shipping and handling are generally included as a component of
cost of goods sold when the costs relate to manufacturing activities. In 2005, 2004 and
2003, Snap-on incurred shipping and handling charges of $17.9 million, $17.0 million and
$15.9 million that were recorded in “Cost of goods sold” on the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Shipping and handling costs incurred in conjunction
with selling or distribution activities are generally included as a component of operating
expenses. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, Snap-on incurred shipping and handling charges of $62.6
million, $57.8 million and $50.3 million that were recorded in “Operating
expenses” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Advertising and promotion:

Production costs of future media advertising are deferred until the advertising occurs.
All other advertising and promotion costs are generally expensed when incurred. For 2005,
2004 and 2003, advertising and promotion expense totaled $47.1 million, $49.8 million and
$51.0 million.

Warranties:

Snap-on provides
product warranties for specific product lines and accrues for estimated future warranty
costs in the period in which the sale is recorded. See Note 16 for further discussion of
warranties.

Minority interest:

Minority
interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries for 2005, 2004 and 2003 totaled $3.6
million, $2.0 million and $3.1 million and is included in “Other income (expense)
– net” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. At the end of
2005 and 2004, minority interest in subsidiaries totaled $16.4 million and $22.3 million
and is included in “Other long-term liabilities” on the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Foreign currency translation:

The financial statements of Snap-on’s foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S.
dollars in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 52,

“Foreign Currency Translation.”

Assets and liabilities of foreign
subsidiaries are translated at current rates of exchange, and income and expense items are
translated at the average exchange rate for the period. The resulting translation
adjustments are recorded directly into “Accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss)” in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Foreign exchange
transactions resulted in a pretax gain of $0.7 million in 2005, and pretax losses of $0.7
million in 2004 and $6.6 million in 2003. Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses
are reported in “Other income (expense) — net” on the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Earnings

.

Income taxes:

Deferred income
taxes are provided for temporary differences arising from differences in bases of assets
and liabilities for tax and financial reporting purposes. Deferred income taxes are
recorded on temporary differences at the tax rate expected to be in effect when the
temporary differences reverse. See Note 9 for further discussion of income taxes.


Per share data:

Basic earnings
per share calculations were computed by dividing net earnings by the corresponding
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The dilutive effect
of the potential exercise of outstanding options to purchase common shares is calculated
using the treasury stock method. Snap-on had dilutive shares as of year-end 2005, 2004 and
2003, of 584,222 shares, 448,098 shares and 171,395 shares. Options to purchase 612,892
shares, 2,352,111 shares and 3,694,950 shares of Snap-on common stock at year-end 2005,
2004 and 2003 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share as the
exercise prices of the options were greater than the average market price of the common
stock for the respective year and, as a result, the effect on earnings per share would be
anti-dilutive.

Stock-based employee compensation
arrangements:

Snap-on has various stock-based employee compensation plans. Snap-on
accounts for its stock-based employee compensation under Accounting Principles Board
(“APB”) Opinion No. 25,

“Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees.”

See Note 14 for further discussion of stock options and purchase
plans.

In December 2004, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 123(R), “

Share-Based Payment

.” See “New accounting
standards” (below) for information on the company’s adoption of SFAS No. 123(R).

Derivatives:

Snap-on utilizes
derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps and foreign exchange
contracts, to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate
risks. Snap-on accounts for its derivatives in accordance with SFAS No. 133,

“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,”

as
amended by SFAS No. 138 and SFAS No. 149. Snap-on does not hold or issue financial
instruments for speculative or trading purposes. See Note 11 for further discussion of
derivatives.

Concentrations:

Snap-on is
exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to its
interest rate swap and foreign exchange contracts. Snap-on does not obtain collateral or
other security to support its financial instruments subject to credit risk, but monitors
the credit standing of the counterparties and enters into agreements only with financial
institution counterparties with a credit rating of A- or better. Snap-on does not
anticipate non-performance by its counterparties.

Snap-on’s accounts receivable do
not represent significant concentrations of credit risk because of the diversified
portfolio of individual customers and geographic areas.

Approximately 3,200 employees, or 28%
of Snap-on’s worldwide workforce, are represented by unions and/or covered under
collective bargaining agreements. Of these, approximately 1,240 are covered under various
European national union agreements that are renewed on an annual basis. Approximately 610
employees are covered under agreements expiring in 2006, including approximately 280
covered under various European national union agreements. In recent years, Snap-on has not
experienced any significant work slow-downs, stoppages or other labor disruptions.

Cash equivalents:

Snap-on
considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less
to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates market
value.

Accounts receivable and allowance
for doubtful accounts:

Accounts receivable are carried at face value less an estimated
allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is established and
periodically updated based upon known bad debt risks and estimates of potential
uncollectible accounts receivable based upon past loss history, customer payment practices
and economic conditions. Actual collection experience may differ from the current estimate
of net receivables. A change to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required
if future events or other changes in circumstances result in a change in the estimate of
the ultimate collectibility of a specific account or accounts.

Inventories:

Inventories
consist of manufactured products and merchandise for resale. Manufactured products include
the costs of materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. Most of Snap-on’s
inventories are valued at the lower of cost, on the “first-in, first-out”
(“FIFO”) basis, or market. Remaining inventories are generally valued at cost,
on the “last-in, first-out” (“LIFO”) basis. Inventories accounted for
using the FIFO basis represented approximately 63% and 65% of the total gross inventories
at December 31, 2005, and January 1, 2005. See Note 4 for further discussion of
inventories.


Property and equipment:

Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over estimated useful
lives. Major repairs that extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized, while
routine maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software included in
property and equipment reflects costs related to internally developed or purchased
software for internal use and is amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated
useful lives. Development costs for computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise
marketed externally are also capitalized once technological feasibility has been achieved
and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Capitalized
software is subject to an ongoing assessment of recoverability based upon anticipated
future revenues and identified changes in hardware and software technologies. Long-lived
assets are evaluated for impairment in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144,
“

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

.” See
Note 5 for further discussion of property and equipment.

Goodwill and other intangible
assets:

SFAS No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,”

requires the testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for
impairment, at least annually. Snap-on evaluates annually, and when significant changes in
expected long-term performance or other events arise, the existence of goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment on the basis of whether the assets are fully
recoverable from projected, discounted cash flows of the related business unit. See Note 6
for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets.

New accounting standards:

In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R)

“Share-Based Payment,”

which requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services in exchange for awards
of equity or liability instruments based on the grant-date fair value of those awards
(with limited exceptions). That cost, based on the estimated number of awards that are
expected to vest, will be recognized over the period during which the employee is required
to provide the service in exchange for the award. No compensation cost is recognized for
awards for which employees do not render the requisite service. SFAS No. 123(R) also
requires entities to remeasure awards of liability instruments at each reporting date,
through the settlement date, based on current fair value. Changes in fair value of
liability instruments during the requisite service period will be recognized as
compensation cost over that service period. Upon adoption, the grant date fair value of
employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments. SFAS
No. 123(R) replaces SFAS No. 123,

“Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,”

and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25,

“Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees.”

The company will adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) on
January 1, 2006, using the modified prospective application permitted under this
statement. The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) will result in the company recording expense
for (i) the unvested portion of grants issued prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R),
and (ii) new grant issuances, both of which will be expensed over the requisite service
period.

Snap-on anticipates that the impact
of adopting SFAS No. 123(R), at current and anticipated grant levels, will reduce
consolidated operating income in 2006 by approximately $6 million to $8 million for
full-year fiscal 2006. Actual share-based compensation expense in fiscal 2006 will depend,
however, on a number of factors, including the amount of new awards granted in 2006, the
fair value of those awards at the date of grant, and the fair value of the company’s
stock. In addition, Snap-on expects to record, in the first quarter of 2006, a charge for
the outstanding liability-based awards as of January 1, 2006, as a cumulative effect of a
change in accounting principle. The company does not believe that this charge will have a
material impact on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

See Note 14 for further discussion of
stock options and purchase plans and the pro forma effect on net earnings and earnings per
share as if Snap-on had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123.

FASB Interpretation No. 47
(“FIN No. 47”), “

Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations,

” an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, was issued in
March 2005 and is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. FIN No. 47
provides clarification with respect to the timing of liability recognition for legal
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets when the timing
and/or method of settlement of the obligation is conditional on a future event. FIN No. 47
requires that the fair value of a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation
be recognized in the period in which it occurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value
can be made. The company does not believe the adoption of FIN No. 47 will have a material
impact on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Note 7: Snap-on Credit
LLC Joint Venture

SOC, a consolidated, 50%-owned joint
venture between Snap-on and CIT, provides a broad range of financial services to
Snap-on’s U.S. dealer and customer network and to Snap-on’s industrial and other
customers. Snap-on began consolidating SOC as of January 4, 2004, the beginning of
Snap-on’s 2004 fiscal year, as a result of the adoption of FIN No. 46R. Snap-on
previously accounted for SOC using the equity method. Snap-on and CIT have identical
voting and participation rights and responsibilities in SOC. See Note 2 for further
discussion of SOC.

Snap-on receives royalty and
management fee income from SOC based on the volume of financings originated by SOC.
Snap-on also shares ratably with CIT in any residual net profit or loss of the joint
venture after operating expenses, including royalty and management fees, interest costs
and credit loss provisions. Snap-on provides extended-term financing internationally
through its wholly owned finance subsidiaries.


SOC sells substantially all of its
originated contracts on a limited recourse basis to CIT, net of certain fees. SOC
continues to service these contracts for an estimated market-rate servicing fee. In 2005,
SOC originated contracts totaling $413.8 million, compared to $481.2 million in 2004 and
$522.4 million in 2003.

Snap-on has credit risk exposure for
certain SOC-originated contracts with recourse provisions against Snap-on (primarily for
dealer van loans). At December 31, 2005, and January 1, 2005, $19.2 million and $14.8
million of loans, with terms ranging from six months to ten years, have a primary recourse
provision to Snap-on if the loans become more than 90 days past due. The asset value of
the collateral underlying these recourse loans would serve to mitigate Snap-on’s loss
in the event of default. The estimated fair value of the guarantees for all loan
originations with recourse as of December 31, 2005, was not material.

CIT and Snap-on have agreed to lend
funds to support SOC’s working capital requirements on a 50/50 basis, with a combined
maximum borrowing limit not to exceed $24 million. As of December 31, 2005, SOC owed both
Snap-on and CIT $3.9 million each pursuant to this agreement.

Snap-on’s exposure related to
SOC as of December 31, 2005, was its $0.7 million investment and the $3.9 million working
capital loan plus the recourse obligations on customer financings, both discussed above.

Note 8: Exit or Disposal
Activities

During 2005, Snap-on recorded costs
associated with exit and disposal activities of $19.3 million, including $3.0 million
included in “Cost of goods sold” and $16.3 million included in “Operating
expenses” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Of the $19.3
million of costs incurred in 2005, $15.5 million qualified for accrual treatment. Costs
associated with exit and disposal activities incurred in 2005 primarily related to
headcount reductions at multiple North American facilities; consolidation of several U.S.
dealer branch locations; headcount reductions at German and U.K. diagnostics’
facilities; the closure of a Swedish saw plant that was consolidated into the
company’s Portugal operations; consolidation of European administration and sales
support functions; and management realignment actions at various other Snap-on facilities.

Exit and disposal accrual usage of
$11.9 million in 2005 consisted of $11.6 million for severance payments and $0.3 million
for facility consolidation or closure costs. Snap-on anticipates that the severance cost
accrual associated with its 2005 exit and disposal activities will be fully utilized by
the end of 2006. The utilization of the facility consolidation or closure costs will
extend beyond 2006 primarily due to longer-term lease obligations.


During 2004, Snap-on recorded costs
associated with exit and disposal activities of $21.7 million, including $16.0 million
included in “Cost of goods sold” and $5.7 million included in “Operating
expenses” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Of the $21.7
million of costs incurred in 2004, $10.5 million qualified for accrual treatment,
including $4.2 million related to 2003 activities. Snap-on’s exit and disposal

Exit and disposal accrual usage of
$2.6 million in 2005 consisted of $2.5 million for severance payments and $0.1 million for
facility consolidation or closure costs. Snap-on’s exit and disposal activities
related to its 2004 actions are anticipated to be completed in early 2006.

During 2003, Snap-on recorded costs
associated with exit and disposal activities of $30.2 million, including $25.8 million
included in “Cost of goods sold” and $4.4 million included in “Operating
expenses” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The exit and
disposal accrual remaining at January 1, 2005, of $0.9 million for the 2003 actions was
consumed primarily by severance payments in the first half of 2005.

Snap-on expects to fund the remaining
cash requirements of its 2005 and 2004 exit and disposal activities with cash flow from
operations and borrowings under the company’s existing credit facilities. The
estimated costs for the exit and disposal activities were based on management’s best
business judgment under prevailing circumstances.

A valuation allowance totaling $42.2
million, $43.5 million and $37.8 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003 has been established for
deferred income tax benefits related to certain subsidiary loss carryforwards that may not
be realized. Realization of the net deferred tax assets is dependent on generating
sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration. Although realization is not assured,
management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be
realized. The amount of the net deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could
be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward
period are reduced.

In October 2004 the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004 (the “AJCA”) was signed into law. The AJCA creates a
one-time tax incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated foreign earnings by
providing a tax deduction of 85% of qualifying dividends received from foreign affiliates.
Under the provisions of the AJCA, Snap-on repatriated approximately $93 million of
qualifying dividends in the second half of 2005, which resulted in additional income tax
expense of $3.3 million for the year. Of the additional $3.3 million income tax expense,
$2.8 million was recorded in the third quarter based on plans to repatriate approximately
$75 million of qualifying dividends. Additional income tax expense of $0.5 million was
recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 as the amount repatriated increased by
approximately $18 million over earlier estimates. The undistributed earnings of all
non-U.S. subsidiaries totaled $173.6 million, $241.2 million and $214.7 million at the end
of 2005, 2004 and 2003. Snap-on has not provided any deferred taxes on these undistributed
earnings as it considers the undistributed earnings to be permanently invested.
Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to these
earnings is not practicable.


Note 10: Short-term and
Long-term Debt

Notes payable and long-term debt at
December 31, 2005, and January 1, 2005, totaled $226.5 million and $331.0 million. Notes
payable to banks under uncommitted lines of credit totaled $20.9 million at December 31,
2005, and $2.5 million at January 1, 2005. Amounts payable to CIT pursuant to a working
capital agreement with SOC totaled $3.9 million at December 31, 2005. See Note 7 for
further discussion of SOC. At January 1, 2005, Snap-on had commercial paper outstanding
of $25 million. Snap-on repaid $25 million of commercial paper borrowings in the second
quarter of 2005; no commercial paper was outstanding at December 31, 2005.

Average commercial paper and bank
notes outstanding were $15.5 million in 2005 and $29.1 million in 2004. The
weighted-average interest rate on these instruments was 3.77% in 2005 and 2.12% in 2004.
As of December 31, 2005, and January 1, 2005, the weighted-average interest rate on
outstanding commercial paper and bank notes was 3.68% and 2.37%.

At December 31, 2005, Snap-on had a
$400 million multi-currency revolving credit facility that terminates on July 27, 2009.
The $400 million multi-currency revolving credit facility’s financial covenant
requires that Snap-on maintain a ratio of debt to the sum of total debt plus
shareholders’ equity of not greater than 0.60 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2005,
Snap-on believes that it was in compliance with all covenants of this revolving credit
facility.

At December 31, 2005, Snap-on also
had $20 million of unused committed bank lines of credit, of which $10 million expires on
July 31, 2006, and $10 million expires on August 31, 2006. At December 31, 2005, Snap-on
had approximately $420 million of unused available debt capacity under the terms of its
revolving credit facility and committed bank lines of credit.

In October 1995, Snap-on issued $100
million of unsecured notes pursuant to a $300 million shelf registration statement filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1994. These 10-year, 6.625% notes were
repaid by Snap-on in the fourth quarter of 2005 upon their maturity. The $100 million debt
repayment was made with available cash on hand; the company did not borrow any funds under
its existing credit facilities or committed bank lines of credit to fund the debt
repayment. In August 2001, Snap-on issued an additional $200 million of unsecured notes
pursuant to the $300 million shelf registration. The August 2001 notes require semiannual
interest payments at the rate of 6.25% and mature in their entirety on August 15, 2011.

Snap-on’s long-term debt as of
fiscal year-end 2005 and 2004 consisted of the following:

Note 11: Financial
Instruments

Snap-on accounts for its hedging
activities under SFAS No. 133,

“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,”

as amended by SFAS No. 138 and SFAS No. 149. These standards require
that all derivative instruments be reported in the consolidated financial statements at
fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are to be recorded each period in
earnings or on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in “Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss),” depending on the type of hedged transaction and whether
the derivative is designated and effective as part of a hedged transaction. Gains or
losses on derivative instruments reported in “Accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss)” must be reclassified as earnings in the period in which earnings are affected
by the underlying hedged item and the ineffective portion of all hedges must be recognized
in earnings in the current period.

Snap-on uses derivative instruments
to manage well-defined interest rate and foreign currency exposures. Snap-on does not use
derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. The criteria used to determine
if hedge accounting treatment is appropriate are (i) the designation of the hedge to an
underlying exposure, (ii) whether or not overall risk is being reduced, and (iii) if there
is a correlation between the value of the derivative instrument and the underlying
obligation. On the date a derivative contract is entered into, Snap-on designates the
derivative as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, a hedge of a net investment in a
foreign operation, or a natural hedging instrument whose change in fair value is
recognized as an economic hedge against changes in the values of the hedged item.

Foreign currency derivative
instruments:

Snap-on has operations in a number of countries that have transactions
outside their functional currencies and, as a result, is exposed to changes in foreign
currency exchange rates. Snap-on also has intercompany loans to foreign subsidiaries
denominated in foreign currencies. Snap-on manages these exposures on a consolidated
basis, which allows for netting of certain exposures to take advantage of natural offsets.
Forward exchange contracts are generally used to hedge the net exposures. Gains or losses
on net foreign currency hedges are intended to offset losses or gains on the underlying
net exposures in an effort to reduce the earnings volatility resulting from fluctuating
foreign currency exchange rates.

At December 31, 2005, Snap-on had
$38.4 million of net foreign exchange forward buy contracts outstanding comprised of buy
contracts of $50.6 million in Swedish kronor, $3.3 million in Australian dollars, and $3.0
million in other currencies, and sell contracts of $8.4 million in euros, $5.6 million in
Singapore dollars and $4.5 million in other currencies. At January 1, 2005, Snap-on had
$11.3 million of net foreign exchange forward sell contracts outstanding comprised of sell
contracts of $73.3 million in euros, $29.7 million in British pounds, $12.3 million in
Singapore dollars, $3.2 million in Danish kronor, $2.9 million in Hungarian forints, $2.1
million in Norwegian kroner, and $3.7 million in other currencies, and buy contracts of
$78.0 million in Swedish kronor, $19.3 million in Canadian dollars, $15.2 million in
Australian dollars, and $3.4 million in other currencies.

The majority of Snap-on’s
forward exchange contracts are not designated as hedges under SFAS No. 133. The fair value
changes of these contracts are reported in earnings as foreign exchange gain or loss,
which is included in “Other income (expense) – net” on the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Interest rate swap agreements:

Snap-on enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest costs and risks
associated with changing interest rates. Interest rate swap agreements are accounted for
as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges. The differentials paid or received on
interest rate swap agreements are recognized as adjustments to interest expense. For fair
value hedges, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative is
recorded in “Long-term debt” on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets,
while any ineffective portion is recorded as an adjustment to interest expense. For cash
flow hedges, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative is
recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” while any
ineffective portion is recorded as an adjustment to interest expense. The notional amount
of interest rate swaps outstanding and designated as fair value hedges was $50 million at
December 31, 2005. The notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding was $75 million
at January 1, 2005, and included $50 million of fair value hedges and $25 million of cash
flow hedges.

Changes in the fair value of
derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting are reflected as
derivative assets or liabilities with the corresponding gains or losses reflected in
earnings in the period of change. An offsetting gain or loss is also reflected in earnings
based upon the changes of the fair value of the debt instrument being hedged. For all fair
value hedges qualifying for hedge accounting, the net accumulated derivative loss at
December 31, 2005, was $1.9 million. At December 31, 2005, the maximum maturity date of
any fair value hedge was six years. During the years ended December 31, 2005, and January
1, 2005, cash flow hedge and fair value hedge ineffectiveness was not material.


Fair value of financial
instruments:

SFAS No. 107,

“Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
Instruments,”

requires Snap-on to disclose the fair value of financial
instruments for both on- and off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities for which it is
practicable to estimate that value. The following methods and assumptions were used in
estimating the fair value of financial instruments:

Installment contracts

: A
discounted cash flow analysis was performed over the average life of a contract using a
discount rate currently available to Snap-on adjusted for credit quality, cost and profit
factors. As of December 31, 2005, and January 1, 2005, the fair value was approximately
$103 million and $117 million, versus a book value of $92.2 million and $101.9 million.

Long-term debt

: The fair value
of long-term debt, including current maturities, was estimated using a discounted cash
flow analysis based on quoted market rates for similar instruments. As of December 31,
2005, and January 1, 2005, the fair value was approximately $211 million and $323 million,
versus a book value of $200.0 million and $300.0 million.

All other financial
instruments

: The carrying amounts of all cash equivalents, interest rate swaps and
forward exchange contracts approximate fair value based upon quoted market prices or
discounted cash flows. The fair value of trade accounts receivable, accounts payable and
other financial instruments approximates carrying value due to their short-term nature.

Note 12: Pension Plans

Snap-on has several non-contributory
defined benefit pension plans covering most U.S. employees and certain employees in
foreign countries. Snap-on also has foreign contributory defined benefit pension plans
covering certain foreign employees. Retirement benefits are generally provided based on
employees’ years of service and average earnings or stated amounts for years of
service. Normal retirement age is 65, with provisions for earlier retirement. Snap-on
recognizes retirement plan expenses in accordance with SFAS No. 87,

“Employers’ Accounting for Pensions.”

Snap-on uses a December 31
measurement date for the majority of its plans. Snap-on expects to make contributions to
its foreign pension plans in 2006 of $6.2 million; Snap-on is not required to make a
contribution to its domestic pension plans in 2006. Depending on market and other
conditions, however, Snap-on may elect to make discretionary cash contributions to its
domestic pension plans in 2006.

Snap-on’s domestic pension plans
have a long-term investment horizon and a total return strategy that emphasizes a capital
growth objective. The long-term investment performance objective for Snap-on’s
domestic plan assets is to achieve net of expense returns that meet or exceed the 8.5%
domestic long-term, rate-of-return-on-assets assumption used for reporting purposes.

The basis for determining the overall
expected long-term, rate-of-return-on-assets assumption applies a nominal returns
forecasting method. For each asset class, future returns are estimated by identifying the
premium of riskier asset classes over lower risk alternatives. The methodology constructs
expected returns using a “building block” approach to the individual components
of total return. These forecasts are stated in both nominal and real (after inflation)
terms. This process first considers the long-term historical return premium based on the
longest set of data available for each asset class. These premiums are then adjusted based
on current relative valuation levels and macro-economic conditions.

For risk and correlation assumptions,
the actual experience for each asset class is reviewed for the longest time period
available. Expected relationships for a 10 to 20 year time horizon are determined based
upon historical results, with adjustments made for material changes. For example, expected
correlations for international equities relative to U.S. equities are higher than
historical averages due to the integration of the global economy.

Investments are broadly diversified
to attempt to minimize the risk of large losses. Since asset allocation is a key
determinant of expected investment returns, assets are periodically rebalanced to the
targeted allocation to correct significant deviations from the asset allocation policy
that are caused by market fluctuations and cash flow.


Snap-on has adopted a strategic asset
allocation policy that is intended to offer the highest probability of achieving the
long-term investment return goal with the lowest level of risk. Asset/liability studies
are conducted periodically to determine if any revisions to the strategic asset allocation
policy are indicated.

Snap-on’s foreign pension
plans’ weighted-average asset allocation by asset category and fair value of plan
assets at December 31, 2005, and January 1, 2005, are as follows:

Snap-on’s primary investment
objective for its foreign pension plan assets is to meet the projected obligations to the
beneficiaries over a long period of time, and to do so in a manner that is consistent with
the company’s risk tolerance. The foreign asset allocation policies consider the
company’s financial strength and long-term asset class risk/return expectations,
since the obligations are long term in nature. The assets are well diversified and are
managed locally by professional investment firms.

The expected long-term rate of return
on foreign plan assets reflects management’s expectations of long-term average rates
of return on funds invested to provide benefits included in the projected benefit
obligations. The expected return is based on the outlook for inflation, fixed income
returns and equity returns, while also considering historical returns, asset allocation
and investment strategy.

Snap-on has several 401(k) plans
covering certain U.S. employees. Snap-on’s employer match to the 401(k) plans is made
with cash contributions. For 2005, 2004 and 2003, Snap-on recognized $2.4 million, $2.3
million and $12.4 million of expense related to its 401(k) plans. Included in
Snap-on’s 2003 401(k) plan expense is $10.2 million related to the closure of two
U.S. hand-tool facilities.

Note 13: Retiree Health
Care

Snap-on provides certain health care
benefits for certain retired U.S. employees. The majority of Snap-on’s U.S. employees
become eligible for those benefits if they reach early retirement age while working for
Snap-on; however, the age and service requirements for eligibility under the plans have
been increased for certain employees hired on and after specified dates since 1992.
Generally, most plans pay stated percentages of covered expenses after a deductible is
met. There are several plan designs, with more recent retirees being covered under a
comprehensive major medical plan. In determining benefits, the plans take into
consideration payments by Medicare and other insurance coverage.

For employees retiring under the
comprehensive major medical plans, retiree contributions are required, and these plans
contain provisions allowing for benefit and coverage changes. The plans require retirees
to contribute either the full cost of the coverage or amounts estimated to exceed a capped
per-retiree annual cost commitment by Snap-on. Most employees hired since 1994 are
required to pay the full cost. Snap-on does not fund the retiree health care plans.

Effective January 1, 2006, Snap-on
will establish individual, unfunded bookkeeping accounts equal to the actuarial present
value of the capped per-retiree annual cost for certain U.S. individuals retiring after
1988. Retirees will be able to self-direct the spending of their account and may consume,
for qualifying medical expenses, the account balance at their discretion. With the
expected reduction in these individual accounts, liabilities and expense in future years
are expected to decline. This plan change was recognized as a negative plan amendment that
reduced the December 31, 2005, benefit obligation by approximately $2.0 million. The $2.0
million benefit obligation reduction will be amortized to income ratably over the next
five years; the reduction in 2005 expense was less than $0.1 million.


Snap-on recognizes postretirement
health care expense in accordance with SFAS No. 106,

“Employers’ Accounting
for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions.”

The actuarial calculation assumes a
health care cost trend rate of 9.5% in 2006, decreasing gradually to 6.0% in 2011 and
thereafter. As of December 31, 2005, a one-percentage-point increase in the health care
cost trend rate for future years would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation by $1.2 million and the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost
components by $0.1 million. Conversely, a one-percentage-point decrease in the health care
cost trend rate for future years would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation by $1.0 million and the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost
components by $0.1 million.

On December 8, 2003, the Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Act”) was
signed into law. The Act includes a prescription drug benefit under Medicare Part D as
well as a federal subsidy, beginning in 2006, to sponsors of retiree health care plans
that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent, as defined in the Act, to
Medicare Part D. Three of the company’s retiree health care plans are at least
actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D and eligible for the federal subsidy. Cash flow
from the subsidy is expected to be less than $0.1 million annually.


Note 14: Stock Options
and Purchase Plans

Snap-on has various stock award and
purchase plans for directors, officers and key employees.

On April 27, 2001, Snap-on’s
shareholders approved the 2001 Incentive Stock and Awards Plan (“2001 Plan”).
This plan reserved five million shares of common stock for issuance, of which 1,446,935
shares were available for future grants at December 31, 2005. Stock options outstanding
under the 2001 Plan and the predecessor plan have expiration dates ranging from 2006 to
2015 and vesting periods ranging from immediate to two years. The plans provide that
options be granted at exercise prices equal to market value on the date the option is
granted. Stock option activity under the 2001 Plan and predecessor plans was as follows:

Snap-on grants shares of
performance-based restricted stock and performance shares (collectively, “performance
grants”) to certain executive officers and other key employees under the 2001 Plan.
Vesting of the shares of performance grants will be dependent upon performance relative to
pre-defined goals for revenue growth, operating income, return on assets and other
measures for fiscal years 2003 through 2007. Based on Snap-on’s performance relative
to these goals, the recipient can earn up to 100% of the performance grants. Snap-on
granted 115,180 shares, 225,700 shares and 423,300 shares of performance grants under the
2001 Plan during 2005, 2004 and 2003. As of December 31, 2005, there were 669,951 shares
outstanding for all grants. The company recorded $3.9 million and $1.1 million of
compensation expense in 2005 and 2004 related to performance grants; the company did not
record any compensation expense in 2003 as the pre-defined goals for the performance
grants were not achieved during that year. For performance achieved above a certain level,
the recipient may earn cash awards in addition to the performance grants, not to exceed
50% of the number of shares of performance grants initially awarded. Cash awards related
to the 2005, 2004 and 2003 award grants represent the right to receive in cash $31.73,
$33.45 and $24.49 per unit, which were the fair market value of the shares at the date of
grant. Performance relative to the 2004 and 2003 award grants was not sufficient to earn
cash awards. The right to receive cash awards under the 2005 performance grant will be
determined, upon vesting, at the end of 2007.


As of December 31, 2005, Snap-on had
no restricted stock grants outstanding under the 2001 Plan whose vesting is not dependent
on performance. Compensation expense for previously issued restricted stock grants was
recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective service period. Snap-on recognized
compensation expense of $0.1 million in 2005 and 2004, and $1.0 million in 2003 related to
non-performance restricted shares.

As of December 31, 2005, Snap-on had
474,650 stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) outstanding that were granted to
certain key non-U.S. employees with an average grant price of $31.67 per unit. These SARs
expire ten years after date of grant and have vesting periods of two years. The SARs
provide for the cash payment of the excess of the fair market value of
Snap-on’s common stock price on the date of exercise over the grant price, and
Snap-on accrues compensation expense based upon the current market price for its common
stock and the number of SARs outstanding. The SARs have no effect on dilutive shares or
shares outstanding as any appreciation of Snap-on’s common stock value over the grant
price is paid in cash and not in common stock.

Directors’ Fee Plan:

Under the Directors’ Fee Plan, non-employee directors may elect up to 100% of
their fees and retainer in shares of Snap-on’s common stock. Directors may elect to
defer receipt of all or part of these shares. For 2005, 2004 and 2003, issuances under the
Directors’ Fee Plan totaled 7,289 shares, 5,776 shares and 4,236 shares.
Additionally, receipt of 3,923 shares, 10,668 shares and 11,130 shares was deferred in
2005, 2004 and 2003. At December 31, 2005, shares reserved for issuance to directors under
this plan totaled 171,946 shares.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan:

Employees of Snap-on are eligible to participate in an employee stock purchase plan. The
employee purchase price of the common stock is the lesser of the mean of the high and low
price of the stock on the beginning date (May 15) or ending date (May 14) of each plan
year. For 2005, 2004 and 2003, issuances under the employee stock ownership plan totaled
30,876 shares, 36,512 shares and 36,428 shares. At December 31, 2005, shares reserved for
issuance to employees under this plan totaled 386,898 and Snap-on held contributions of
approximately $0.7 million for the purchase of common stock by employees. Employees are
able to withdraw from the plan and receive all contributions made during the plan year.
Compensation expense for plan participants in 2005, 2004 and 2003 was not material.

Dealer Stock Purchase Plan:

Franchised dealers are eligible to participate in a dealer stock purchase plan. The
dealer purchase price of the common stock is the lesser of the mean of the high and low
price of the stock on the beginning date (May 15) or ending date (May 14) of each plan
year. For 2005, 2004 and 2003, issuances under the dealer stock purchase plan totaled
43,911 shares, 49,290 shares and 49,923 shares. At December 31, 2005, shares reserved for
issuance to franchised dealers under this plan totaled 71,419 and Snap-on held dealer
contributions of approximately $1.0 million for the purchase of common stock. Dealers are
able to withdraw from the plan and receive all contributions made during the plan year.
Compensation expense for plan participants in 2005, 2004 and 2003 was not material.

Dividend Reinvestment and Stock
Purchase Plan:

Under this plan, participating shareholders may invest the cash
dividends from all or a portion of their common stock to buy additional shares. The
program also permits new investors and current shareholders to make additional
contributions. For 2005, 2004 and 2003, issuances under the dividend reinvestment and
stock purchase plan totaled 30,941 shares, 42,881 shares and 54,504 shares. At December
31, 2005, shares available for purchase under this plan totaled 1,634,311 shares.

SFAS No. 148:

Snap-on accounts
for its stock-based employee compensation plans under the recognition and measurement
principles of APB Opinion No. 25. In accordance with the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25,
no compensation expense was recorded for stock options as all options granted had an
exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the measurement
date. For restricted stock and SARs, Snap-on recorded compensation expense in the
respective periods as appropriate. For information on the company’s January 1, 2006,

Note 15: Capital Stock

Snap-on has undertaken repurchases of
Snap-on common stock from time to time to offset dilution created by shares issued for
employee and dealer stock purchase plans, stock options, and other corporate purposes, as
well as to repurchase shares when market conditions are favorable. Snap-on repurchased
912,100 shares in 2005, following the repurchase of 1,200,000 shares in 2004 and 450,000
shares in 2003. As of the end of 2005, Snap-on has remaining availability to repurchase up
to an additional $136.7

million in common stock pursuant to the Board of
Directors’ authorizations. The purchase of Snap-on common stock is at the
company’s discretion, subject to prevailing financial and market conditions. In 2005,
Snap-on’s average common stock repurchase price was approximately $35.14 per share.


In August 1997, the Board of
Directors declared a dividend distribution of one preferred stock purchase right for each
share of Snap-on’s outstanding common stock. The rights are exercisable only if a
person or group acquires 15% or more of Snap-on’s common stock (“Acquiring
Person”) or publicly announces a tender offer to become an Acquiring Person. Each
right may then be exercised to purchase one one-hundred-and-fiftieth of a share of Series
A Junior Preferred Stock for $190, but if a person or group becomes an Acquiring Person,
then each right entitles the holder (other than an Acquiring Person) to acquire common
stock of Snap-on having a market value equivalent to two times the current purchase price.
If Snap-on is acquired in a merger or other business combination not approved by the Board
of Directors, then each holder of a right will be entitled to purchase common stock of the
surviving company having a market value equivalent to two times the current purchase
price. The effect of the rights is to cause ownership dilution to a person or group
attempting to acquire Snap-on without approval of Snap-on’s Board of Directors. The
rights expire on November 3, 2007, and may be redeemed by Snap-on at a price of $0.01 per
right under certain circumstances.

Snap-on created a Grantor Stock Trust
(“GST”) in 1998 that was subsequently amended. In conjunction with the formation
of the GST, Snap-on sold 7.1 million shares of treasury stock to the GST. The sale of
these shares had no net impact on shareholders’ equity or on Snap-on’s
Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The GST is a funding mechanism for certain benefit
programs and compensation arrangements, including the 2001 Incentive Stock and Awards Plan
and employee and dealer stock purchase plans. The Northern Trust Company, as trustee of
the GST, votes the common stock held by the GST based on the terms set forth in the GST
Agreement as amended. The GST is recorded as “Grantor Stock Trust at fair market
value” on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Shares owned by the GST are
accounted for as a reduction to shareholders’ equity until used in connection with
employee benefits. Each period, the shares owned by the GST are valued at the closing
market price, with corresponding changes in the GST balance reflected in additional
paid-in capital. At December 31, 2005, the GST held 3,204,308 shares of common stock.

Rent expense, net of sub-lease rental
income, for worldwide facilities and office equipment was $29.7 million, $35.6 million and
$33.0 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Snap-on has a multi-year, $5.1
million purchase commitment with one of its suppliers.


CIT and Snap-on have agreed to lend
funds to support SOC’s working capital requirements on a 50/50 basis, with a combined
maximum borrowing limit not to exceed $24 million. As of December 31, 2005, SOC owed both
Snap-on and CIT $3.9 million each pursuant to this agreement.

Snap-on has credit risk exposure for
certain SOC-originated contracts with recourse provisions against Snap-on (primarily for
dealer van loans). At December 31, 2005, and January 1, 2005, $19.2 million and $14.8
million of loans, with terms ranging from six months to ten years, have a primary recourse
provision to Snap-on if the loans become more than 90 days past due. The asset value of
the collateral underlying these recourse loans would serve to mitigate Snap-on’s loss
in the event of default. The estimated fair value of the guarantees for all loan
originations with recourse as of December 31, 2005, was not material. See Note 7 for
further discussion of SOC.

Snap-on provides product warranties
for specific product lines and accrues for estimated future warranty cost in the period in
which the sale is recorded. Snap-on calculates its accrual requirements based on historic
warranty loss experience that is periodically adjusted for recent actual experience. The
following summarizes Snap-on’s product warranty accrual activity for fiscal-year 2005
and 2004:

On July 23, 2004, Snap-on reached an
agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice to resolve the government audit relating to
two contracts with the U.S. General Services Administration (“GSA”). Snap-on
agreed to settle the claims over the interpretation and application of the price reduction
and billing provisions of these two contracts for sales from March 1996 through the July
23, 2004, settlement date for $10.0 million. Snap-on remitted the $10.0 million cash
settlement to the U.S. Department of Justice on August 5, 2004. On August 5, 2005, the GSA
notified the company that it would take no administrative action against Snap-on in
connection with the Federal Supply Schedule contracts referred to above. The company
considers the matter closed.

Snap-on is also involved in various
legal matters that are being litigated and/or settled in the ordinary course of
business. In certain matters, former dealers, purportedly on behalf of
current and former franchised dealers, are seeking adjudication of certain claims as a
class within an arbitration proceeding. As an initial step, certain claimants have
successfully asserted in arbitration the right to further proceedings to determine whether
class certification in arbitration would be appropriate. Snap-on will continue to
vigorously assert defenses in these matters, including its belief that class certification
is not appropriate. Snap-on has taken steps in court to maintain its right to
challenge adverse results of the arbitral proceedings. Depending upon future developments
and circumstances in these matters, Snap-on will continue to pursue all available strategies from
dispositive class motions to settlement. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these
legal matters due, in part, to the uncertainty inherent in legal proceedings,
including the absence of precedents and clear procedures regarding class proceedings in
arbitration.


Note 17: Segments

Snap-on’s business segments are
based on the organization structure used by management for making operating and investment
decisions and for assessing performance. Snap-on’s reportable business segments
include: (i) the Snap-on Dealer Group; (ii) the Commercial and Industrial Group; (iii) the
Diagnostics and Information Group; and (iv) Financial Services. The Snap-on Dealer Group
consists of Snap-on’s business operations serving the worldwide franchised dealer van
channel. The Commercial and Industrial Group consists of the business operations providing
tools and equipment products and equipment repair services to a broad range of industrial
and commercial customers worldwide through direct, distributor and other non-franchised
distribution channels. The Diagnostics and Information Group consists of the business
operations providing diagnostics equipment, vehicle service information, business
management systems, and other solutions for vehicle service to customers in the worldwide
vehicle service and repair marketplace. Financial Services, which became a new business
segment in 2004 as a result of the prospective adoption of FIN No. 46R, consists of the
business operations of SOC, a consolidated, 50%-owned joint venture, and Snap-on’s
wholly owned finance subsidiaries in those international markets where Snap-on has dealer
operations. See Notes 2 and 7 for further discussion of SOC and the adoption of FIN No.
46R.

Snap-on evaluates the performance of
its operating segments based on segment revenues and operating earnings, exclusive of
financing activities and income taxes. Segment revenues are defined as total revenues,
including both external customer revenue and intersegment revenue. Segment operating
earnings are defined as segment revenues less cost of goods sold and operating expenses,
including restructuring costs. Snap-on accounts for intersegment sales and transfers based
primarily on standard costs with reasonable mark-ups established between the segments.
Identifiable assets by segment are those assets used in the respective reportable
segment’s operations. Intersegment amounts are eliminated to arrive at consolidated
financial results.

Due to changes in Snap-on’s
management organization structure, Snap-on realigned its business segments during the
first quarter of fiscal 2005. The primary changes included the transfer of Snap-on’s
technical representative support organization from the Snap-on Dealer Group to the
Diagnostics and Information Group and the segregation of Snap-on’s general corporate
expenses from the operating earnings of the business segments. Prior to fiscal 2005,
shared services and general corporate expenses and corporate assets were allocated to the
business segments based on segment revenues. Beginning in fiscal 2005, the business
segments are charged only for those shared services utilized by the business segment based
on an estimate of the value of services provided; general corporate expenses and corporate
assets are not allocated to the business segments. Corporate assets consist principally of
those assets that are centrally managed including cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments, pension assets and income taxes, as well as corporate real estate and related
assets. Prior-year financial data by segment has been restated to reflect these reportable
business segment realignments.

Neither Snap-on nor any of its
segments, except Financial Services, depend on any single customer, small group of
customers or government for more than 10% of its revenues. As a result of SOC’s
relationship with CIT, Snap-on’s Financial Services business segment depends on CIT
for more than 10% of its revenues. See Note 7 for further discussion of SOC.

Products and services:

Snap-on
derives net sales from a broad line of products and complementary services that are
grouped into two categories: tools and equipment. The tools category includes
Snap-on’s hand tools, power tools, tool storage units, saws, and cutting and pruning
tools product offerings. The equipment category includes vehicle service
diagnostics equipment, vehicle service equipment, vehicle service information, business
management systems and equipment repair service product offerings. Snap-on also derives
revenue from financing its products through SOC and through its wholly owned finance
subsidiaries. Snap-on utilizes various financing programs to facilitate the sales of its
products. See Notes 2 and 7 for further discussion of SOC. Further product line
information is not presented as it is not practicable to do so. The following table shows
