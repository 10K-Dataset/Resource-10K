TABLE OF
CONTENTS


PART I

Safe Harbor

Statements
in this document that are not historical facts, including statements that (i) are
in the future tense; (ii) include the words “expects,” “plans,” “targets,”
“estimates,” “believes,” “anticipates,” or similar words that reference Snap-on
Incorporated (“Snap-on” or “the company”) or its management; (iii) are specifically
identified as forward-looking; or (iv) describe Snap-on’s or management’s
future outlook, plans, estimates, objectives or goals, are forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995.  Snap-on cautions the reader that
any forward-looking statements included in this document that are based upon
assumptions and estimates were developed by management in good faith and are
subject to risks, uncertainties or other factors that could cause (and in some
cases have caused) actual results to differ materially from those described in
any such statement. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be
relied upon as a prediction of actual results or regarded as a representation
by the company or its management that the projected results will be achieved.
For those forward-looking statements, Snap-on cautions the reader that numerous
important factors, such as those listed below, as well as those factors
discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly  those in “Item 1A: Risk Factors,” could
affect the company’s actual results and could cause its actual consolidated
results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking
statement made by, or on behalf of, Snap-on.

These risks and
uncertainties include, without limitation, uncertainties related to estimates,
statements, assumptions and projections generally, and the timing and progress
with which Snap-on can attain efficiencies and savings from its Rapid
Continuous Improvement (“RCI”) and cost reduction actions, including its
ability to achieve improvements in the company’s manufacturing footprint and
greater efficiencies in its supply chain, and enhance machine maintenance,
plant productivity and manufacturing line set-up and change-over practices, any
or all of which could result in production inefficiencies, higher costs and
lost revenues.  These risks also include
uncertainties related to Snap-on’s capability to implement future strategies
with respect to its existing businesses, its ability to refine its brand and
franchise strategies, retain and attract franchisees, further enhance service
and value to franchisees and thereby enhance their sales and profitability,
introduce successful new products, successfully integrate acquisitions
(including the company’s November 28, 2006, acquisition of Snap-on
Business Solutions (formerly ProQuest Business Solutions)), as well as its
ability to withstand disruption arising from natural disasters, planned
facility closures or other labor interruptions, litigation challenges and
external negative factors including significant changes in the current
competitive environment, inflation, interest rates and other monetary and
market fluctuations; and the impact of legal proceedings, energy and raw
material supply and pricing (including steel and gasoline), the amount, rate
and growth of general and administrative expenses, including health care and
postretirement costs, and terrorist disruptions on business.  Snap-on disclaims any responsibility to
update any forward-looking statement provided in this document, except as
required by law.

In
addition, investors should be aware that generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) prescribe when a
company should reserve for particular risks, including litigation
exposures.  Accordingly, results for a
given reporting period could be significantly affected if and when a reserve is
established for a major contingency. Reported results, therefore, may appear to
be volatile in certain accounting periods.


Item 1: Business

Snap-on was incorporated
under the laws of the state of Wisconsin in 1920 and reincorporated under the
laws of the state of Delaware in 1930.  Snap-on
is a leading global innovator, manufacturer and marketer of tools, diagnostics,
equipment, software and service solutions for professional users.  Products and services include hand and power
tools, tool storage, diagnostics software, information and management systems,
shop equipment and other solutions for vehicle dealerships and repair centers,
as well as customers in industry, government, agriculture, aviation and natural
resources.  Snap-on also derives income
from various financing programs to facilitate the sales of its products.

Snap-on markets its
products and brands through multiple distribution sales channels in more than 130
countries. Snap-on’s largest geographic markets include the United States,
Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands,
Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. 
Snap-on also reaches its customers through the company’s franchisee, company-direct,
distributor and Internet channels.  Snap-on originated the mobile van tool
distribution channel in the automotive repair market.

Snap-on’s business
segments are based on the organization structure used by management for making
operating and investment decisions and for assessing performance.  Snap-on’s reportable business segments
include: (i) the Commercial & Industrial Group; (ii) the
Snap-on Tools Group; (iii) the Diagnostics & Information Group;
and (iv) Financial Services. The Commercial & Industrial Group consists
of the business operations providing tools and equipment products and equipment
repair services to a broad range of industrial and commercial customers
worldwide through direct, distributor and other non-franchise distribution
channels. The Snap-on Tools Group consists of the business operations serving
the worldwide franchise van channel.  The
Diagnostics & Information Group consists of the business operations
providing diagnostics equipment, vehicle service information, business
management systems, electronic parts catalogs, and other solutions for vehicle
service to customers in the worldwide vehicle service and repair marketplace.
Financial Services consists of the business operations of Snap-on Credit LLC (“SOC”),
a consolidated, 50%-owned joint venture between Snap-on and The CIT Group, Inc.
(“CIT”), and Snap-on’s wholly owned finance subsidiaries in those international
markets where Snap-on has franchise operations. 
See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on
business segments and foreign operations.

Snap-on evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on
segment revenues and operating earnings. For the Commercial &
Industrial, Snap-on Tools, and Diagnostics & Information Groups,
segment net sales include both external and intersegment net sales.  Snap-on accounts for intersegment sales and
transfers based primarily on standard costs with reasonable mark-ups
established between the segments. 
Identifiable assets by segment are those assets used in the respective
reportable segment’s operations. 
Intersegment amounts are eliminated to arrive at consolidated financial
results.

On November 28,
2006, Snap-on acquired the ProQuest Business Solutions business and certain net
assets (collectively, “Snap-on Business Solutions” or “Business Solutions”)
from ProQuest Company for an initial purchase price of $516.0 million of cash
and the assumption of approximately $19 million of debt.

Subsequent to the November 28, 2006,
closing, the cash purchase price increased by $5.7 million to $521.7 million,
primarily reflecting a higher level of working capital received by Snap-on at
closing.  For segment reporting, Snap-on
Business Solutions is included in the Diagnostics & Information Group.

Snap-on Business Solutions
is a world leader in automotive parts and service information.  Its products are aimed at assisting original
equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and their dealers to enhance their service
operations.  Business Solutions’ products
include integrated software, services and systems that transform complex
technical data for parts catalogs into easily accessed electronic information
(electronic parts catalogs). Other products and services include warranty
management systems and analytics to help dealerships manage and track the
complex process of warranty claims management. 
Over 35,000 automotive dealerships around the world use Business Solutions’
electronic parts catalogs, which are available in 26 different languages and
support 15 automotive manufacturers and 31 brands.  Business Solutions’ products are also sold to
over 85,000 dealers in the power equipment and power sports markets. See Note 2
to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Snap-on
Business Solutions acquisition.

Products and Services

Snap-on
offers a broad line of products and complementary services that are grouped
into three product categories: (i) tools; (ii) diagnostics and repair information; and (iii) equipment.  Further product line information is not
presented as it is not practicable to do so. 
The following table shows the consolidated net sales of these
product categories for the last three years:

The

tools

product category

includes hand tools, power
tools and tool storage products. Hand tools include wrenches, screwdrivers,
sockets, pliers, ratchets, saws and cutting tools, pruning tools, torque
measuring instruments and other similar products. Power tools include pneumatic
(air), cordless (battery) and corded (electric) tools such as impact wrenches,
ratchets, chisels, drills, sanders, polishers and similar products. Tool
storage includes tool chests, roll cabinets and other similar products.  The majority of products are manufactured by
Snap-on and, in completing the product line, other items are purchased from
external manufacturers.

The

diagnostics
and repair information

product category includes handheld and
PC-based diagnostics products, service and repair information products,
diagnostic software solutions, electronic parts catalogs, business management
systems, point-of-sale systems, integrated systems for vehicle service shops,
equipment repair services, OEM purchasing facilitation services, and warranty
management systems and analytics to help dealerships manage and track
performance.

Snap-on supports the
sale of its diagnostics and vehicle service shop equipment by offering training
programs as well as after sales support for its customers, primarily focusing
on the technologies and the application of specific products developed and marketed
by Snap-on.

The

equipment

product
category includes solutions for the diagnosis and service of automotive and
industrial equipment. Products include wheel alignment equipment, wheel
balancers, tire changers, vehicle lifts, test lane systems, collision repair
equipment, air conditioning service equipment, brake service equipment, fluid
exchange equipment, transmission troubleshooting equipment, safety testing
equipment, battery chargers and hoists.


Products are marketed
under a number of brand names and trademarks, many of which are well known in
the vehicle service and industrial markets served. Some of the major

trade names and trademarks and the products and services
with which they are associated include the following:

In addition to its sales of tool, diagnostic,
service and equipment solutions, Snap-on also generates revenue from various
financing activities that include (i) loans to franchisees; (ii) loans to the
franchisees’ customers; and (iii) loans to Snap-on’s industrial and other
customers for the purchase of tools, equipment and diagnostics products on an
extended-term payment plan.

Franchise fee revenue,
including nominal, non-refundable initial and ongoing monthly fees (primarily
for sales and business training and marketing and product promotion programs),
is recognized as the fees are earned.


Sales and Distribution

Snap-on markets and
distributes its products and related services principally to professional

tool and equipment users around the
world.  The two largest market sectors
are the vehicle service and repair sector and the industrial sector.

Vehicle Service and
Repair Sector

The vehicle service and
repair sector has three main customer groups: (i) professional technicians
who purchase tools and equipment for themselves; (ii) vehicle service and
repair shop owners and managers

-

including
independent shops, national chains and automotive dealerships

-

who
purchase tools, equipment and diagnostics products for use by multiple
technicians within a service or repair facility; and (iii) OEMs.

Snap-on provides
innovative tool, equipment and business solutions, as well as technical sales
support and training, to meet technicians’ evolving needs. Snap-on’s franchise
van distribution system offers technicians the convenience of purchasing
quality tools with minimal disruption of their work routine. Snap-on also
provides owners and managers of shops, where technicians work, with tools,
diagnostics equipment, repair and service information, including electronic
parts catalogs, and shop management products. Through its Equipment Solutions (“OEM
facilitation”) business, Snap-on provides OEMs with products and services
including tools, consulting services and facilitation services.  Snap-on’s facilitation services include
product procurement, distribution and administrative support to customers for
their dealership equipment programs.

Major challenges for
Snap-on and the vehicle service and repair sector include the increasing rate
of technological change within motor vehicles, vehicle population growth,
vehicle life and the resulting impact on the businesses of both our suppliers
and customers that is necessitated by such change.  Snap-on believes it is a meaningful
participant in the market sector for vehicle service and repair.

Industrial Sector

Snap-on markets its
products globally to a broad cross-section of industrial and commercial
customers including  maintenance and
repair operations; manufacturing and assembly facilities; various government
agencies, facilities and operations, including military operations; vocational
and technical schools; aerospace and aviation; OEM and repair customers; oil
and gas developers; mining operations; energy and power generation equipment fabricators;
agriculture; infrastructure construction companies; and other customers that
require instrumentation, service tools and/or equipment for their products.

The industrial sector
for Snap-on has achieved growth in recent years by providing value-added
products and services to an increasingly expanding global base of customers, particularly
those in the market segments of natural resources, aerospace, government and
education.  Through its experienced and
dispersed sales organization, industrial “solutioneers” strive to develop
unique and highly valued productivity solutions for customers worldwide that
leverage Snap-on’s product, service and development capabilities.

Major challenges in the
industrial sector include a highly competitive, cost-conscious environment, and
a trend toward customers making many of their tool and equipment purchases
through one integrated supplier. Snap-on believes it is a meaningful
participant in the market sector for industrial tools and equipment.

Distribution Channels

Snap-on serves customers
primarily through the following channels of distribution: the mobile franchise
van channel,  company-direct sales,
distributors and e-commerce.  The
following discussion summarizes Snap-on’s general approach for each channel,
and is not intended to be all-inclusive.


Franchisees

In the United States,
the majority of sales to the vehicle service and repair sector are conducted
through Snap-on’s franchise van distribution system.  Snap-on’s franchisees primarily serve vehicle
service technicians and vehicle service shop owners, generally providing weekly
contact at the customer’s place of business. 
Franchisees’ sales are concentrated in hand and power tools, tool
storage units, small diagnostic and shop equipment, and diagnostics and repair
information products, which can easily be transported in a van and demonstrated
during a brief sales call.  Franchisees
purchase Snap-on’s products at a discount from suggested list prices and resell
them at prices established by the franchisee. Most

U.S.
franchisees are provided a list of places of business that serves as the basis
of the franchisee’s sales route, although some franchisees have sales areas
defined by other methods.

Snap-on also offers
a trial franchise option – termed the “Gateway Program” –  to potential U.S. franchisees that do
not meet the franchise qualification requirements.  Gateway Program
participants have less upfront investment and are provided an initial base
level of consigned inventory from Snap-on to assist them
in gaining experience and building equity toward the
future purchase of a standard franchise. Snap-on also provides certain
franchisees the opportunity to add vans to their franchise or to add a limited
number of franchises.  Snap-on charges
nominal initial and ongoing monthly license fees.  Since 1991, new U.S. franchisees, and a
majority of the pre-1991 U.S. franchisees, have been enrolled as franchisees of
Snap-on.  At 2007 year end, 3,269 U.S.
franchisees (approximately 96%) were enrolled as franchisees, or employed by franchisees,
as compared with 3,308 U.S. franchisees (approximately 95%) at year-end 2006.

Snap-on has replicated
its U.S. franchise van distribution model in certain other countries including
Australia, Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, South Africa and the United Kingdom.
In many of these markets, as in the United States, purchase decisions are
generally made or influenced by professional vehicle service technicians and
shop owners. Snap-on markets products in certain other countries through its
subsidiary, Snap-on Tools International LLC, which sells to foreign
distributors under license or contract with Snap-on.

Through SOC, financing
is available to U.S. franchisees, including financing for van and truck leases,
working capital loans, and loans to enable new franchisees to fund the purchase
of the franchise.  Internationally,
Snap-on offers financing to its franchisees and customer networks through its
wholly owned finance subsidiaries.  While
Snap-on offers financing to qualified franchisees and their customers through
SOC and its wholly owned international finance subsidiaries, the decision to
finance through Snap-on or another financing entity is solely at the election
of the customer.

Snap-on supports its
franchisees with a field organization of regional offices, franchise
performance teams, Diagnostic Sales Developers (“DSDs”), service centers and
distribution centers.  Snap-on also
provides sales and business training, and marketing and product promotion
programs, as well as customer and franchisee financing programs through SOC and
its wholly owned international finance subsidiaries, all of which are designed
to strengthen franchisee sales.  In the
United States and Canada, the National Franchise Advisory Council and the
Snap-on Tools Canadian Franchise Advisory Council, both of which are composed
of franchisees that are elected by franchisees, assist Snap-on in identifying
and implementing enhancements to the franchise program.

In
the United States, franchisees work closely with the DSDs.  The DSD specialists demonstrate and sell
higher-price-point diagnostics and vehicle service shop management information
systems.  DSDs work independently and
with franchisees to identify and generate sales leads among vehicle service
shop owners and managers.  DSDs are
Snap-on employees who, beginning in 2008, are compensated through a combination
of base salary and commission; a franchisee receives a brokerage fee from
certain sales made by the DSDs to the franchisee’s customers.  Most products sold through franchisees and the
DSDs are sold under the

Snap-on

,

Blue-Point

and

Sun

brand
names.

Company Direct Sales

In the United States, a significant
proportion of shop equipment sales under the

Sun, John
Bean and Blackhawk

brands

and
information products under the

Mitchell1

brand

are made by a direct sales force that has responsibility
for national accounts. As the vehicle service and repair sector consolidates
(with more business conducted by national chains, automotive dealerships and
franchised service centers), the company believes these larger organizations
can be serviced


most effectively by
sales people who can demonstrate and sell the full line of equipment and
diagnostic products and services. 
Snap-on also sells these products and services directly to OEMs.

Snap-on

brand tools
and equipment are marketed to industrial and governmental customers in the
United States through both industrial sales representatives, who are employees,
and independent industrial distributors. In most markets outside the United
States, industrial sales are conducted through independent distributors. The
sales representatives focus on industrial customers whose main purchase
criteria are quality and service. At the end of 2007, Snap-on had industrial
sales representatives in the United States, Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico,
Puerto Rico and some European, Asian, Latin American and Middle Eastern
countries, with the United States representing the majority of Snap-on’s total
industrial sales.

Business Solutions sells automotive, power equipment and
power sports software solutions, both domestically and internationally,
through an internal sales force. Products and services are marketed to two
targeted groups: OEMs and individual dealerships. To effectively reach the
large OEMs in the automotive segment, such as General Motors
Corporation, Daimler AG, Ford Motor Company, Chrysler LLC, and Toyota Motor
Corporation, Business Solutions has deployed a team of business development
professionals in the world’s principal automotive centers in the United States,
the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, France, Spain and Japan.  In the
United States and Canada, automotive  products and services are sold
directly to individual dealerships using an experienced sales force.  In
reaching customers such as John Deere (Deere & Company), JC Bamford
Excavators Ltd. (JCB) and Yamaha Corporation of America (Yamaha) in the power
equipment and power sports segments, teams are also positioned to support
the 90+ brands that Business Solutions distributes to globally.  Business management solutions are sold
directly to the automotive OEMs in the United States and throughout Europe,
including the United Kingdom.

Distributors

Sales of certain tools
and equipment are made through independent vehicle service and industrial
distributors who purchase the items from Snap-on and resell them to end
users.  Hand tools under the

Bahco, Fish and Hook, Pradines

and

Lindstrom

brands and trade names, for example, are sold through distributors in Europe,
North and South America, Asia and certain other parts of the world.  Wheel service and other vehicle service
equipment are sold through distributors primarily under brands including

Hofmann,

Kansas Jack

,

John Bean

and

Blackhawk

.

Sun

-branded equipment is marketed through distributors in
South America and Asia

,

and
through both a direct sales force and distributors in Europe.

E-commerce

Snap-on’s e-commerce
development initiatives allow Snap-on to combine the capabilities of the
Internet with Snap-on’s existing brand sales and distribution strengths to
reach new and under-served customer segments. Snap-on offers current and
prospective customers online, around-the-clock access to purchase products
through its public Internet Web site at www.snapon.com.  The site features an online catalog
containing nearly 14,000 products, including

Snap-on

hand tools, power tools, tool storage units and diagnostic equipment available
to consumers and professionals in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada
and Australia.

At
the end of 2007, Snap-on had more than 468,000 registered users, including
approximately 38,000 industrial accounts. 
E-commerce and certain other system enhancement initiatives are designed
to improve productivity and further leverage the one-on-one relationships and
service Snap-on has with its current and prospective customers. Through
business-to-business and business-to-consumer capabilities, Snap-on and its
franchisees are enhancing communications with customers on a real-time,
24-hour, 7-day a week basis.

Competition

Snap-on competes on the
basis of its product quality and performance, product line breadth and depth,
service, brand awareness and imagery, and technological innovation. While no
single company competes with Snap-on across all of its product lines and
distribution channels, various companies compete in one or more product
categories and/or distribution channels.


Snap-on believes it is a leading manufacturer and distributor of professional
tools, diagnostics, equipment and repair solutions, offering the broadest line
of these products to the vehicle service industry.  The major competitors selling to professional
technicians in the automotive service and repair sector through the mobile van
channel include MAC Tools (The Stanley Works), Matco (Danaher Corporation), and
Cornwell.  Snap-on also competes with
companies that sell tools and equipment to automotive technicians through
non-mobile van distributors including Craftsman (Sears Brands LLC), RIDGID and
Husky (The Home Depot, Inc.), and Kobalt (Lowes Companies, Inc.),
auto parts supply outlets (such as NAPA, AutoZone, Inc. and Pep Boys), and
tool supply warehouses/distributorships (such as MEDCO and Integrated Supply
Network, Inc. (ISN)).  Within the
power tools category, Snap-on’s major competitors include Ingersoll-Rand Co. Limited,
The Black & Decker Corp., Makita Corp., Chicago Pneumatic (Atlas
Copco), and Milwaukee Electric (Techtronic Industries Co. Ltd.).  In the industrial sector, major competitors
include Facom Tools and Proto (The Stanley Works), Armstrong (Danaher
Corporation), IRWIN (Newell Rubbermaid, Inc.), Cooper Industries, Ltd.,
and Westward (W.W. Grainger, Inc.). 
The major competitors selling diagnostics and shop equipment and
information to shop owners and managers in the vehicle service and repair
sector include Corghi S.p.A., Fluke and Hennessy (Danaher Corporation),
Robinair and OTC (SPX Corporation), Hunter Engineering, Rotary Lift and Chief
Automotive (Dover Corporation), Car-O-Liner AB, Lexcom GmbH, Infomedia Ltd.,
ALLDATA (AutoZone, Inc.), and the proprietary diagnostic and information
systems of OEMs.

Raw Materials and
Purchased Product

Snap-on’s supply of raw
materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous
suppliers.  During 2006 and 2007, Snap-on
experienced higher pricing related to certain grades and alloys of steel.  Snap-on has secured an ample supply of both
bar and coil steel for the near future to ensure stable supply to meet material
demands.  While Snap-on believes that
steel prices will continue to remain high for 2008, the company does not
anticipate experiencing any significant steel pricing or availability issues in
2008.

Patents, Trademarks and
Other Intellectual Property

Snap-on vigorously
pursues and relies on patent protection to protect its intellectual property
and its position in its markets. As of December 29, 2007, Snap-on and its
subsidiaries held over 800 active and pending patents in the United States and
over 1,600 active and pending patents outside of the United States.  Sales relating to any single patent did not
represent a material portion of Snap-on’s revenues in the last three years.

Examples of products
that have features or designs that benefit from patent protection include wheel
alignment systems, wheel balancers, tire changers, lifts, test lanes, sealed
ratchets, electronic torque instruments, ratcheting screwdrivers,
emissions-sensing devices and diagnostic equipment.

Much of the technology
used in the manufacture of vehicle service tools and equipment is in the public
domain. Snap-on relies primarily on trade secret protection to protect
proprietary processes used in manufacturing. 
Methods and processes are patented when appropriate.  Copyright protection is also utilized when
appropriate.

Trademarks used by
Snap-on are of continuing importance to Snap-on in the marketplace.  Trademarks have been registered in the United
States and more than 100 other countries, and additional applications for
trademark registrations are pending. 
Snap-on vigorously polices proper use of its trademarks.  Snap-on’s right to manufacture and sell
certain products is dependent upon licenses from others; however, these
products under license do not represent a material portion of Snap-on’s net sales.

Domain names have become
a valuable corporate asset for companies around the world, including Snap-on.  Domain names often contain a trademark or
service mark or even a corporate name and are often considered intellectual
property. The recognition and value of the

Snap-on

name,
trademark, and domain name are core strengths of the company.

Snap-on is selectively
and strategically licensing the

Snap-on

brand
to carefully selected manufacturing and distribution companies for items such
as apparel, work boots and a variety of other goods, in order to further build equity
and market presence for the company’s strongest brand.


Environment

Snap-on
is subject to various environmental laws, ordinances, regulations, and other
requirements of government authorities in the United States and other
nations.  At Snap-on, these environmental
liabilities are managed through the Snap-on Environmental, Hygiene, and Safety
Management System (“EH & SMS”), which is applied worldwide.  The system is based upon continual
improvement and is certified to ISO 14001:1996 and OHSAS 18001:1999, verified
through Det Norske Veritas (DNV) Certification, Inc.

Snap-on believes that it
complies with applicable environmental control requirements in its
operations.  Expenditures on
environmental matters through EH & SMS have not had, and Snap-on does
not for the foreseeable future expect them to have, a material effect upon
Snap-on’s capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

Employees

At the end of January 2008,
Snap-on employed approximately 11,600 people compared to approximately 12,400 people
at the end of January 2007.  The
year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the impacts of restructuring-related
and management realignment actions at various Snap-on facilities, as well as
the June 2007 sale of a non-strategic business based in the Netherlands.

Approximately 3,100
employees, or 27% of Snap-on’s worldwide workforce, are represented by unions
and/or covered under collective bargaining agreements.  Approximately 1,100 employees are covered under
agreements expiring in 2008. In recent years, Snap-on has not experienced any
significant work slow-downs, stoppages or other labor disruptions.

The number of covered
union employees whose contracts expire within the next five years approximates 1,100
employees in 2008; 500 employees in 2009; 650 employees in 2010; 100 employees
in 2011; and zero employees in 2012.

There can be no
assurance that future contracts with Snap-on’s unions will be renegotiated upon
terms acceptable to Snap-on.

Working Capital

As most of Snap-on’s
business is not seasonal and its inventory needs are relatively constant, no
unusual working capital needs arise during the year.  Snap-on did not have a significant backlog of
orders at December 29, 2007.

Snap-on’s financial
condition and use of working capital are discussed herein in “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Neither Snap-on nor any
of its segments, except Financial Services, depend on any single customer,
small group of customers or government for any material part of its
revenues.  As a result of SOC’s
relationship with CIT, Snap-on’s Financial Services segment depends on CIT for
more than 10% of its revenues.

Item
1A: Risk Factors

In evaluating the company, careful consideration should be given to the
following risk factors, in addition to the other information included in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Consolidated Financial Statements
and the related notes.  Each of these
risk factors could adversely affect the company’s business, operating results,
cash flows and/or financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of
an investment in the company’s common stock.

The success of Snap-on’s mobile van tool
distribution business depends on the success of its franchisees.

Approximately 38% of our 2007 revenues were generated by the Snap-on Tools
Group, which consists of Snap-on’s business operations serving the worldwide
franchise van channel. Except in limited circumstances, each of our mobile tool
vans is operated by a franchisee pursuant to a franchise agreement. Snap-on’s
success is dependent on its relationships with franchisees, individually and
collectively, as they are the primary sales and service link between the
company and vehicle service and repair technicians, who are an important class
of end users for Snap-on’s products and services. If our franchisees are not
successful, or if we do not maintain an effective relationship with our
franchisees, the delivery of products, the collection of receivables and/or our
relationship with end users could be adversely affected and thereby negatively
impact our financial results.


In addition, if we are unable to maintain effective relationships with
franchisees, the company or the franchisees may choose to terminate the
relationship, which may result in (i) open routes, in which end-use
customers are not provided reliable service; (ii) litigation resulting
from termination; and/or (iii) reduced collections or increased write-offs
of franchisee receivables owed to Snap-on. 
As Snap-on has approximately 4,700 franchisees worldwide and most of
these franchise relationships are governed by contract, it is not uncommon for
litigation to result from the termination of these relationships.

We may not successfully integrate businesses we
acquire, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and
financial position.

If we pursue future growth through further acquisitions, including
participation in joint ventures, this would involve significant risks that
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial position.  These risks include:

·

Loss of the acquired businesses’ customers;

·

An inability to integrate successfully the acquired businesses’
operations;

·

Inability to coordinate management and integrate and
retain employees of the acquired businesses;

·

Difficulties in implementing and maintaining
consistent standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems;

·

Failure to realize anticipated synergies, economies of
scale or other anticipated benefits, or to maintain operating margins;

·

Strain on our personnel, systems and resources, and
diversion of attention from other priorities;

·

Incurrence of additional debt and related interest
expense;

·

The dilutive effect of the issuance of additional equity
securities;

·

Unforeseen or contingent liabilities of the acquired businesses;
and

·

Large write-offs or write-downs, or the impairment of
goodwill or other intangible assets.

Information technology infrastructure is critical
to supporting business objectives.

We depend heavily on information technology infrastructure to achieve
our business objectives.  If a problem
occurs that impairs this infrastructure, the resulting disruption could impede
our ability to record or process orders, manufacture and ship in a timely
manner, or otherwise carry on business in the normal course.  Any such events could cause us to lose
customers or revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to
remediate.

In association with initiatives to better integrate business units,
rationalize operating footprint and improve responsiveness to franchisees and
customers, Snap-on is replacing and enhancing its existing global Enterprise
Resource Planning (ERP) management information system.  The integration, implementation and deployment
of new information technology processes and a common information
infrastructure, which began in 2006, is occurring over a multi-year period.  We could experience disruptions in our
business as we implement the system enhancements, which could have an adverse
effect on our business and results of operations.

The recognition of impairment charges on goodwill
or other intangible assets would adversely impact future financial position and
results of operations.

We are required to perform impairment tests on our goodwill and other
intangibles annually or at any time when events occur, which could impact the
value of our business segments. Our determination of whether impairment has
occurred is based on a comparison of each of our reporting units’ fair market
value with its carrying value. Significant and unanticipated changes could
require a provision for impairment in a future period that could substantially
affect our reported earnings and reduce our consolidated net worth and
shareholders’ equity.


The steps taken to restructure operations,
rationalize operating footprint, lower operating expenses, and achieve greater
efficiencies in the supply chain could disrupt business.

We have taken steps in the past, and expect to take additional steps in
2008, intended to improve customer service and to drive further efficiencies
and reduce costs, some of which could be disruptive to our business.  These actions, collectively across our
operating groups, are focused on the following:

·

Continue on the company’s existing path to improve and
transform global manufacturing and the supply chain into a market-demand-based
replenishment system, with lower costs;

·

Continue to enhance service and value to Snap-on’s
franchisees and customers;

·

Continue to invest in initiatives focused on building
a strong sales and operating presence in emerging growth markets;

·

Continue to implement RCI activities throughout the
organization to drive further efficiencies and reduce costs;

·

Continue to invest in developing and marketing new,
innovative, higher-value-added products and advanced technologies; and

·

Extend Snap-on’s products and services into additional
and/or adjacent markets or to new customers.

Specific initiatives in each of these areas are underway.  Snap-on believes that by executing on these
focus areas, along with a continued commitment to new innovative products and
RCI to drive higher levels of productivity and lower costs, the company and its
franchisees will realize stronger growth and profitability.  However, failure to succeed in the
implementation of any or all of these actions could result in an inability to
achieve our financial goals and could be disruptive to the business.

In addition, reductions to headcount and other cost reduction measures
may result in the loss of technical expertise that could adversely affect our
research and development efforts and ability to meet product development
schedules. Efforts to reduce components of expense could result in the
recording of charges for inventory and technology-related write-offs, workforce
reduction costs or other charges relating to the consolidation of facilities.
If we were to incur a substantial charge to further these efforts, our earnings
(or loss) per share would be adversely affected in such period. If we are
unable to effectively manage our cost reduction and restructuring efforts, our
business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.

Exposure to credit risks of customers and resellers
may make it difficult to collect receivables and could adversely affect
operating results and financial condition.

Industry and economic conditions have the potential to weaken the
financial position of some of our customers. If circumstances surrounding our
customers’ financial capabilities were to deteriorate, such write-downs or
write-offs would negatively affect our operating results for the period in
which they occur and, if large, could have a material adverse effect on our
operating results and financial condition.

Failure to maintain effective distribution of
products and services could adversely impact revenue, gross margin and
profitability.

We use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and
services. Successfully managing the interaction of our distribution efforts to
reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a
complex process. Moreover, since each distribution method has distinct risks
and gross margins, our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in
the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our
revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability.

Risks associated with the disruption of
manufacturing operations could adversely affect profitability or competitive position.

We manufacture a significant portion of the products we sell. Any
prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing
facilities, whether due to technical or labor difficulties, lack of raw
material or component availability, destruction of or damage to any facility
(including natural disasters, use and storage of hazardous materials or other
events), or other reasons, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.


The inability to provide acceptable financing
alternatives to end-user customers and franchisees could adversely impact
operating results.

An integral component of Snap-on’s business and profitability is its
ability to offer financing alternatives to end-user customers and franchisees
which, for its domestic financing operations, are managed through a joint
venture with CIT.  Historically, CIT has
been the exclusive purchaser of the credit and installment financing arranged
by SOC.  A deterioration of the
relationship between the joint venture partners, or if the joint venture should
be unexpectedly dissolved, could have an adverse impact on Snap-on’s results of
operations and ability to provide financing to end-user customers and
franchisees in the United States.  Adverse
fluctuations in interest rates and/or the ability to provide competitive
financing programs could also have an adverse impact on Snap-on’s revenue and
profitability.

The global tool, equipment, and diagnostics and
repair industry is competitive.

We face strong competition in all of our market segments.  Price competition in our various industries
is intense and pricing pressures from competitors and customers are increasing.
In general, as a manufacturer and marketer of premium products and services,
the expectations of Snap-on’s customers and its franchisees are high and
increasing.  Any inability to maintain customer
satisfaction could diminish Snap-on’s premium image and reputation and could
result in a lessening of its ability to command premium pricing. We expect that
the level of competition will remain high in the future, which could limit our
ability to maintain or increase market share or profitability.

The inability to continue to introduce new products
that respond to customer needs and achieve market acceptance could result in
lower revenues and reduced profitability.

Sales from new products represent a significant portion of our net
sales and are expected to continue to represent a significant component of our
future net sales. We may not be able to compete effectively unless we continue
to enhance existing products or introduce new products to the marketplace in a
timely manner. Product improvements and new product introductions require
significant financial and other resources including significant planning,
design, development, and testing at the technological, product, and
manufacturing process levels. Our competitors’ new products may beat our
products to market, be more effective with more features, be less expensive
than our products, and/or render our products obsolete. Any new products that
we develop may not receive market acceptance or otherwise generate any
meaningful net sales or profits for us relative to our expectations based on,
among other things, existing and anticipated investments in manufacturing
capacity and commitments to fund advertising, marketing, promotional programs,
and research and development.

Economic conditions and world events could affect
our operating results.

We, our franchisees and our customers, may be adversely affected by an
economic downturn such as changes in consumer and investor confidence, volatile
corporate profits, and reduced business and consumer spending.  We, our franchisees and customers, and the
economy as a whole, also may be affected by future world events such as acts of
terrorism, developments in the war on terrorism, conflicts in the Middle East
and other international situations, and by natural disasters.  These factors may affect our results of
operations by reducing our sales, margins and/or net income as a result of a
slowdown in customer orders or order cancellations.  In addition, political and social turmoil
related to international conflicts and terrorist acts may put further pressure
on economic conditions abroad. Unstable political, social and economic
conditions may make it difficult for our franchisees, customers, suppliers and
us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. If such
conditions persist, our business, financial condition, results of operations
and cash flow could be negatively affected.

Raw material and energy price fluctuations and
shortages (including steel and various fuel sources) could adversely affect the
ability to obtain needed manufacturing materials and could adversely affect
results of operations.

The principal raw material used in the manufacture of our products is
steel, which we purchase in competitive, price-sensitive markets. To meet
Snap-on’s high quality standards, our steel needs range from specialized
alloys, which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers, to
commodity types of alloys. These raw materials have historically exhibited
price and demand cyclicality. Some of these materials have been, and in the
future may be, in short supply. As some steel alloys require specialized
manufacturing procedures, we could experience inventory shortages if we were
required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice.  Additionally, unexpected price increases
could result in higher prices to our customers or an erosion of the margins on
our products.


We believe our ability to sell our products is also dependent on the
number of vehicles on the road, the number of miles driven and the general
aging of vehicles. These factors affect the frequency, type and amount of
service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians, and therefore affect
the demand for the number of technicians, the prosperity of the technicians and,
subsequently, the demand technicians have for our tools, other products and
services, and the value technicians place on those products and services. To
the extent that gasoline prices increase, consumers may turn to other,
non-gasoline based, methods of transportation, including more frequent use of
public transportation.  A decrease in the
use of gasoline consuming vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand
for our products.

We use various energy sources to transport, produce and distribute
products, and some of our products have components that are petroleum based.  Petroleum and energy prices have recently
been volatile and have generally increased; further volatility and increases
may be caused by market fluctuations, supply and demand, currency fluctuation,
production and transportation disruption, world events, and changes in
governmental programs.  Price increases
raise both our operating costs and the costs of our materials, and we may not
be able to increase our prices enough to offset these costs.  Higher prices also may reduce the level of
future customer orders and our profitability.

Our operations expose us to the risk of environmental
liabilities, costs, litigation and violations that could adversely affect our
financial condition, results of operations and reputation.

Certain of our operations
are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which
they operate, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the
ground, air and water and establish standards for the generation, treatment,
use, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes. We must also comply with various
health and safety regulations in the United States and abroad in connection
with our operations.  Failure to comply
with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal, monetary and
non-monetary penalties and damage to our reputation. In addition, we may incur
costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated
with past or current waste disposal practices. 
We cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or
future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our
estimates or adversely affect our financial condition and results of
operations.

Foreign operations are subject to currency exchange,
political and other risks that could adversely affect results of operations.

Approximately 43% of our revenues in 2007 were generated outside of the
United States.  Future growth rates and
success of our business depends in large part on continued growth in our
non-U.S. operations, including growth in emerging markets. Numerous risks
and uncertainties affect our non-U.S. operations. These risks and
uncertainties include political, economic and social instability, including
acts of war, civil disturbance or acts of terrorism, local labor conditions,
changes in government policies and regulations, including imposition or
increases in withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by
international subsidiaries, transportation delays or interruptions and
difficulties in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights. We
are also affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, inflation
rates and interest rates. Additionally, cash generated in
non-U.S. jurisdictions may be difficult to repatriate to the United
States in a tax-efficient manner. 
Our foreign operations are also subject to other risks and challenges,
such as the need to staff and manage diverse workforces, respond to the needs
of multiple national and international marketplaces, and differing business
climates and cultures in various countries.

Failure to adequately protect intellectual property
could adversely affect business.

Intellectual property rights are an important and integral component of
our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a
combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as
licensing agreements and third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements.
Adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent
us from manufacturing and selling our products or prevent us from stopping
others from manufacturing and selling competing products. Failure to obtain or
maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

The inability to successfully defend claims from
taxing authorities could adversely affect operating results and financial
position.

We conduct business in many countries, which requires us to interpret
the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions. Due to
the subjectivity of tax laws between those jurisdictions, as well as the
subjectivity of factual


interpretations, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ
from actual payments or assessments. Claims from taxing authorities related to
these differences could have an adverse impact on our operating results and
financial position.

Failure to attract and retain qualified personnel
could lead to a loss of revenue and/or profitability.

Snap-on’s success depends, in part, on the efforts and abilities of its
senior management team and other key employees. Their skills, experience and
industry contacts significantly benefit our operations and administration.  The failure to attract and retain members of
our senior management team and other key employees could have a negative effect
on our operating results.  In addition, transitions
of important responsibilities to new individuals inherently include the
possibility of disruptions to our business and operations, which could
negatively affect our operating results and financial position.

Failure to achieve expected investment returns on pension
plan assets, as well as changes in interest rates, could adversely impact our
results of operations, financial position and cash flow.

Snap-on sponsors various
pension benefit plans. The assets of the pension plans are broadly diversified in an attempt to mitigate
the risk of a large loss.  The assets are invested in equity
securities, fixed income securities, real
estate and other real assets, other alternative investments and cash.  Required
funding for the company’s defined benefit pension plans is determined in
accordance with guidelines set forth in the federal Employee Retirement Income
Security Act (ERISA). Additional contributions to enhance the funded status of
the pension plans can be made at the company’s discretion. However, there
can be no assurance that the value of the pension plan assets, or the
investment returns on those plan assets, will be sufficient to meet the future benefit obligations of
such plans.  In addition, during periods of adverse investment market
conditions and declining interest rates, the company may be required to make
additional cash contributions to the plans that would reduce our financial
flexibility.

Our defined benefit
pension plan obligations are affected by changes in market interest
rates.  Significant fluctuations
in market interest rates will add volatility to our pension plan
obligations.  Declining market interest rates will increase our pension
plan obligations.  While our plan assets are broadly diversified, there is
inherent market risks associated with investments.  If adverse market
conditions develop, our plan assets could incur a loss.  The combination
of declining market interest rates and plan asset investment losses may adversely
impact our financial position and results of operations.

The company’s defined
benefit pension expense is calculated by netting five factors: (i) service
cost; (ii) interest on projected benefit obligations; (iii) the
expected return on plan assets; (iv) the amortization of prior service
costs; and (v) the effects of actuarial gains and losses.  The
accounting for pensions involves the estimation of a number of factors that are
highly uncertain.  Certain factors, such
as the interest cost and the expected return on plan assets, are impacted by
changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets.  A
significant decrease in market interest rates and a decrease in the fair value
of plan assets would increase net pension expense and may adversely affect the company’s
future results of operations.  See Note
11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the
company’s pension benefit plans.

Submission of Matters to a Vote
of Security Holders

No matters were submitted to a vote of shareholders during the fourth
quarter of the fiscal year ended December 29, 2007.

PART II

Item 5: Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related
Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

At December 29,
2007, Snap-on had 57,429,139 shares of common stock outstanding.  Snap-on’s stock is

listed on
the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “SNA.”  As of February 15, 2008, there were 7,194
registered holders of Snap-on common stock.

Snap-on’s
common stock high and low prices, as of the close of trading, for the last two
fiscal years by quarter were as follows:

Snap-on has paid consecutive
quarterly cash dividends, without interruption or reduction, since 1939.  On November 1, 2007, Snap-on announced
that its Board of Directors (“Board”) approved a $0.03 per share, or 11.1%,
increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.30 per share.  Quarterly dividends declared in 2007 were
$0.30 in the fourth quarter and $0.27 in the first three quarters ($1.11 per
share for the year).  Quarterly dividends
declared were $0.27 ($1.08 per share for the year) in 2006 and $0.25 per share ($1.00
per share for the year) in 2005.  Cash
dividends paid in 2007, 2006 and 2005 totaled $64.8 million, $63.6 million and
$57.8 million, respectively.  Snap-on’s
Board monitors and evaluates the company’s dividend practice quarterly and the
Board may elect to increase, decrease or not pay a dividend on Snap-on common
stock based upon the company’s financial condition, results of operations, cash
requirements and future prospects of Snap-on and other factors deemed relevant
by the Board

.

See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on securities authorized for issuance under
equity compensation plans.


The following chart discloses information
regarding the shares of Snap-on’s common stock repurchased by the company
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, all of which were purchased pursuant
to the Board’s authorizations that the company has publicly announced.

Snap-on has undertaken stock repurchases from time to
time to offset dilution created by shares issued for employee and dealer stock
purchase plans, stock options, and other corporate purposes, as well as to
repurchase shares when the company believes market conditions are
favorable.  The repurchase of Snap-on
common stock is at the company’s discretion, subject to prevailing financial
and market conditions.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

*Subject to further adjustment
pursuant to the 1996 Authorization described below, as of December 29, 2007,
the approximate value of shares that may yet be purchased pursuant to the three
outstanding Board authorizations discussed below is $116.8 million.

·

In its
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28,
1996, Snap-on disclosed that the company’s Board authorized the company to repurchase
shares of its common stock from time to time in the open market or in privately
negotiated transactions (“the 1996 Authorization”).  The 1996 Authorization allows the repurchase
of up to the number of shares issued or delivered from treasury from time to
time under the various plans the company has in place that call for the
issuance of the company’s common stock. 
Because the number of shares that are purchased pursuant to the 1996
Authorization will change from time to time as (i) the company issues
shares under its various plans; and (ii) shares are repurchased pursuant
to this authorization, the number of shares authorized to be repurchased will
vary from time to time.  The 1996
Authorization will expire when terminated by the company’s Board.  When calculating the approximate value of
shares that the company may yet purchase under the 1996 Authorization, the
company assumed a price of $49.97, $47.07 and $48.13 per share of common stock
as of the end of the fiscal 2007 months ended October 27, November 24
and December 29, respectively.

·

On
June 29, 1998, the company announced that its Board authorized the
repurchase of an aggregate of $100 million of the company’s common stock (“the 1998
Authorization”).  The 1998 Authorization
will expire when the aggregate repurchase price limit is met, unless terminated
earlier by the company’s Board.

·

On
February 3, 1999, the company announced that its Board authorized the
repurchase of an aggregate of $50 million of the company’s common stock (“the 1999
Authorization”).  The 1999 Authorization
will expire when the aggregate repurchase price limit is met, unless terminated
earlier by the company’s Board.

During
2007, the company repurchased 1,860,000 shares of common stock at an average
purchase price of $50.77 per share.

In conjunction with the consolidation of Snap-on
Credit LLC (“SOC”) at the beginning of 2004, Financial services revenue
consists of SOC’s sales of originated contracts and service fee income, as well
as installment contract revenue and franchisee loan receivable revenue derived
from SOC and Snap-on’s wholly owned international finance operations.  Snap-on began consolidating SOC in fiscal
2004 as a result of the adoption of Financial Interpretation No. 46R,

“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (an interpretation of ARB
No. 51)

.”  As Snap-on
consolidated SOC on a prospective basis, previously issued financial statements
were not restated.  Prior to fiscal 2004,
Snap-on accounted for SOC using the equity method.

See
Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information

on SOC.


Item 7:  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Management Overview

In 2007 Snap-on continued to implement strategic initiatives intended to
create long-term value for company shareholders, associates, franchisees and
other distributor partners across all of its business segments and
channels.   During the year, Snap-on believes
it made measurable progress on many fronts.

Net sales grew 15.7% year over year, with sales increases in each
segment.  Operating earnings of $324.8
million in 2007 nearly doubled from $162.8 million in 2006.   Higher sales, increased income from
financial services, and improved operating expense margins from ongoing
efficiency, productivity and cost reduction (collectively “Rapid Continuous
Improvement” or “RCI”) initiatives, along with the absence of the 2006
franchisee litigation settlement cost, all contributed to the significant year-over-year
earnings improvement.

Our strategic priorities and plans for 2008 will continue to build on
the improvement initiatives underway to achieve sustainable, profitable growth
through increased sales and lower costs.

In the

Commercial & Industrial Group

,
higher sales, including growth in emerging markets, combined with expense
control and savings from restructuring initiatives to deliver continued
improvements in operating performance. 
Segment net sales in 2007 were up 13.3% and operating earnings were up
23.8%.

Benefits from ongoing cost reduction and RCI initiatives, including
increased production and sourcing of materials from lower-cost regions and
facilities, were major contributors to the year-over-year earnings
improvement.  As a result of continued
sales growth, improved levels of customer service, and savings from RCI and
restructuring activities, operating earnings increased to $131.5 million in
2007.

The Commercial & Industrial Group expects to continue to build
on the following strategic priorities in 2008:

·

Continue to invest in emerging market growth
initiatives, such as China, India and Eastern Europe;

·

Increase market share in key industrial market
segments by reaching new customers, building business with existing customers
and continually improving order fill rates;

·

Continued innovation in productivity-enhancing
products that utilize increasingly advanced technology;

·

Continue to pursue key, large customers that offer
long-term growth potential; and

·

Continue to rationalize the operating footprint and
shift manufacturing activities to lower-cost regions.

In the

Snap-on Tools Group

, considerable
progress on fundamental, strategic initiatives strengthened company operating
and financial performance, as well as franchisee performance and satisfaction.

Higher sales of a mid-tier brand of tools and equipment (Blue Point), a
re-launch of the company’s warehouse distribution program, and a more focused
promotional program all contributed to the 8.1% sales growth in 2007.  Supply chain improvements and an ongoing
transition to a market-demand-based replenishment system continued to improve
complete and on-time delivery of a broad assortment of products.  Operating earnings of $125.1 million in 2007
improved significantly from prior-year levels, primarily due to contributions
from the higher sales and benefits from ongoing cost reduction and RCI
initiatives, as well as the absence of the $38.0 million franchisee litigation
settlement charge in 2006.


The Snap-on Tools Group expects to continue to build on the progress
made in enhancing the franchise proposition and delivering customer productivity
solutions, with specific initiatives in 2008 focused on the following:

·

Continue to improve franchisee profitability and
satisfaction;

·

Improve service to existing customers;

·

Introduce programs to capture un-served customers;

·

Continued new product innovation and development;

·

Continually improve the supply chain through investments
in manufacturing and use of RCI; and

·

Integrate customer driven, pull-marketing initiatives.

By executing in these areas, Snap-on believes the company and its
franchisees will continue to serve more customers better and more profitably.

In the

Diagnostics & Information Group

,
significant progress was realized across many facets of the business in
2007.  Segment sales increased 28.5% to
over $650 million, despite lower original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”)
facilitation sales, due primarily to the wind down of a major facilitation program
in Europe, and the outsourcing of certain non-strategic, low-margin products
previously manufactured for the Snap-on Tools Group.

The integration of the Snap-on Business Solutions (“Business Solutions”)
acquisition, which was acquired November 28, 2006, provided an opportunity
to successfully build closer relationships with key OEM customers and
strengthen Snap-on’s position as a provider of productivity solutions.   New product and program offerings, coupled with
a renewed focus and dedication to customer delivery, were rewarded with solid
sales growth.   Integrating Snap-on’s RCI
initiatives also drove improved operating cost leverage.

The diagnostics equipment and software business, as well as the shop
management business, grew through the development and launch of new hardware
and software products targeted at a broader and growing customer base.  Focus on RCI initiatives also achieved strong
cost reduction and improved inventory turns.

The Diagnostics & Information Group expects to build on the
following strategic priorities in 2008:

·

Continued growth in the base business and emerging
markets;

·

Further leveraging of customer relationships and
product and service offerings; and

·

Continued innovation in new products and services.

Financial Services

revenue increased 28.6% to $63.0 million, and operating
income of $22.4 million increased 72.3% from the prior year.  Originations in 2007 were flat with
prior-year levels.

Cash Flows

Snap-on delivered
continued increased cash flow from operations of $231.1 million in 2007, up
from $203.4 million in the prior year. 
Snap-on used available cash in 2007 to repurchase over 1.8 million
shares of Snap-on common stock for $94.4 million, pay dividends totaling $64.8
million, and pay down debt of $36.6 million. 
Capital expenditures in 2007 of $61.9 million reflect higher levels of
efficiency and cost-reduction capital investments and higher levels of spending
to support strategic supply chain and other growth initiatives, including the
expansion of the company’s manufacturing capabilities in lower-cost regions and
emerging markets.  Cash at year-end 2007
of $93.0 million was up from $63.4 million at year-end 2006.  In 2006, the company used available cash to
fund, in part, the purchase of the Business Solutions acquisition, pay
dividends totaling $63.6 million, repurchase over 2.6 million shares of Snap-on
common stock for $109.8 million, and invest $50.5 million in capital
expenditures.


Results of Operations

Fiscal 2007 vs. Fiscal 2006

Highlights of Snap-on’s results of operations for the fiscal years
ended December 29, 2007, and December 30, 2006, are as follows:

NM:  Not
meaningful

Note: 
Certain 2006 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2007
income statement presentation.  See Note
1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the 2007 income
statement presentation.

Percentage Disclosure:  Cost of goods sold, Gross profit and
Operating expense percentages are calculated as a percentage of Net sales.  Financial services expenses and Operating
income from financial services percentages are calculated as a percentage of
Financial services revenue.  All other
income statement line item percentages are calculated as a percentage of the
sum of Net sales and Financial services revenue.

Net
sales in 2007 increased $386.1 million, or 15.7%, from 2006 levels, including
$84.0 million from currency translation. 
Sales in the Commercial & Industrial Group increased $158.6 million,
or 13.3%, year over year, primarily due to higher sales of professional tools
and equipment in Europe, increased industrial sales, and continued strong sales
growth in emerging markets.  Sales in the
Snap-on Tools Group increased $82.7 million, or 8.1%, from prior-year levels,
primarily driven by a 6.3% increase in North American sales and continued
strong growth in international sales.  In
the Diagnostics & Information Group, sales were up $144.4 million, or
28.5%, from 2006 levels, primarily due to sales from the November 28,
2006, acquisition of Business Solutions, partially offset by lower sales due to
the wind down of an OEM facilitation program in Europe, and by lower sales as a
result of outsourcing certain products previously manufactured and sold to the
Snap-on Tools Group.

Gross profit in 2007 was
$1,266.6 million, as compared to $1,079.8 million in 2006.  The $186.8 million improvement in 2007 gross
profit primarily reflects benefits from the higher sales, $40.6 million of
savings from ongoing RCI initiatives, and $30.9


million of currency
translation. These increases were partially offset by $22.5 million of
increased production and material costs, and $6.6 million of higher
year-over-year restructuring costs. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit
improved from 44.0% in 2006 to 44.6% in 2007.

Operating expenses in
2007 were $964.2 million, as compared to $930.0 million in 2006. The $34.2
million increase in operating expenses includes $62.1 million of higher
year-over-year operating expenses for Business Solutions (twelve months of
operating expense in 2007 versus approximately five weeks of post-acquisition operating
expense in 2006), $22.2 million of unfavorable currency translation, higher
volume-related expenses, and increased spending for expansion in emerging markets.
These increases in year-over-year operating expenses were largely offset by the
absence, in 2007, of a $38.0 million franchisee litigation settlement charge
recorded in 2006, higher benefits of $11.5 million from ongoing RCI
initiatives, $6.4 million of gains on the sale of facilities and $2.0 million
of lower restructuring costs. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses
of 33.9% were significantly improved from 2006 levels. See Note 15 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the franchisee
litigation settlement.

Interest expense of $46.1
million in 2007 was up from $20.6 million in 2006 primarily due to higher debt
levels to finance the Business Solutions acquisition.

Other income (expense) –
net was income of $5.5 million in 2007 as compared to income of $5.3 million in
2006. This line item includes the impact of all non-operating items such as
interest income and hedging and currency exchange rate transaction gains and
losses. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
information on other income (expense) – net.

Snap-on’s effective income
tax rate on earnings before minority interests and equity earnings (loss) was 32.5%
in 2007, as compared with 31.1% in the prior year. See Note 8 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on income taxes.

On June 29, 2007,
Snap-on sold its Sun Electric Systems (“SES”) business based in the Netherlands
for a nominal cash purchase price. SES’s primary business was the research,
development and manufacture of test equipment in Europe for aircraft hydraulics.
SES reported full-year sales of $18.3 million in 2006 and was not a significant
subsidiary of Snap-on. Snap-on divested of SES as it deemed SES to be non-core
to the company’s ongoing strategies. The anticipated future capital and other
resources necessary to be expended in connection with the SES business were not
consistent with Snap-on’s growth plans. Snap-on recorded an $8.0 million net
loss ($9.2 million net loss on sale partially offset by $1.2 million of net
earnings from operations) from the sale of SES in 2007. Certain prior year
amounts were reclassified on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Earnings to reflect the sale of SES as “Discontinued operations, net of tax.”
For segment reporting purposes, the results of operations of SES were
previously included in the Diagnostics & Information Group. See Note
16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on SES.

Net earnings from
continuing operations in 2007 were $189.2 million, or $3.23 per diluted share. Net
earnings from continuing operations in 2006 were $97.9 million, or $1.65 per
diluted share, including a $23.4 million after-tax charge ($0.40 per diluted
share) related to the resolution of the franchisee litigation settlement. Net
earnings in 2007 were $181.2 million, or $3.09 per diluted share, as compared
to net earnings of $100.1 million, or $1.69 per diluted share, in 2006. Results
of operations for 2007 include a full year of operating results for Business
Solutions; results of operations for 2006 include approximately five weeks of
post-acquisition operating results for Business Solutions. See Note 2 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the Business Solutions
acquisition.

Segment
Results

Snap-on’s business
segments are based on the organization structure used by management for making
operating and investment decisions and for assessing performance. Snap-on’s
reportable business segments include: (i) the Commercial &
Industrial Group; (ii) the Snap-on Tools Group; (iii) the Diagnostics &
Information Group; and (iv) Financial Services. The Commercial &
Industrial Group consists of the business operations providing tools and
equipment products and equipment repair services to a broad range of industrial
and commercial customers worldwide through direct, distributor and other
non-franchise distribution channels. The Snap-on Tools Group consists of the
business operations serving the worldwide franchise van channel. The
Diagnostics & Information Group consists of the business operations
providing diagnostics equipment, vehicle service information, business
management systems, electronic parts catalogs, and other solutions for vehicle
service to customers in the worldwide vehicle service and repair marketplace.
Financial Services consists of the business operations of Snap-on Credit LLC (“SOC”),
a consolidated, 50%-owned joint venture between Snap-on and The CIT Group, Inc.
(“CIT”), and Snap-on’s wholly owned finance subsidiaries in those international
markets where Snap-on has franchise operations.

Snap-on evaluates the
performance of its operating segments based on segment revenues and operating
earnings. For the Commercial & Industrial, Snap-on Tools, and
Diagnostics & Information Groups, segment net sales include both
external and intersegment net sales. Snap-on accounts for intersegment sales
and transfers based primarily on standard costs with reasonable mark-ups
established between the segments. Identifiable assets by segment are those
assets used in the respective reportable segment’s operations. Intersegment
amounts are eliminated to arrive at consolidated financial results.

Commercial &
Industrial Group

Segment
net sales in 2007 increased $158.6 million, or 13.3%, from 2006 levels due to
$101.4 million of higher sales and $57.2 million of currency translation. The
$101.4 million sales increase primarily reflects higher sales of professional
tools and equipment in Europe, increased industrial sales, and continued strong
sales growth in emerging markets.


Segment
gross profit of $483.5 million in 2007 was up $47.8 million over 2006 levels
primarily due to higher sales, $24.6 million of savings from ongoing RCI
initiatives, and $20.7 million of currency translation. These increases were
partially offset by $14.4 million of increased production and material costs
and $8.4 million of higher restructuring costs. Operating expenses of $352.0
million in 2007 were up $22.5 million from 2006 levels, but improved 160 basis
points (100 basis points equals 1.0 percent) as a percentage of segment sales. The
increase in year-over-year operating expenses primarily includes $15.2 million
of currency translation, higher volume-related expenses, increased investment
spending to further expand the company’s sales and manufacturing presence in
emerging growth markets and lower-cost regions, and $3.1 million of higher
restructuring costs. These increases in operating expenses were partially
offset by $5.4 million of gains on the sale of facilities in Europe and $3.1
million of savings from ongoing RCI initiatives. As a result of these factors,
segment operating earnings in 2007 increased $25.3 million from 2006 levels. As
a percentage of segment net sales, including the impact of $11.5 million of
higher restructuring costs in 2007, operating earnings for the Commercial &
Industrial Group improved from 8.9% in 2006 to 9.7% in 2007.

Snap-on
Tools Group

NM:  Not meaningful

Segment
net sales in 2007 increased $82.7 million, or 8.1%, from 2006 levels primarily
driven by a 6.3% increase in North American franchise sales, including higher
sales from a new mid-tier product offering and the re-launch of the company’s
in-house warehouse distribution program, as well as the impacts of lower levels
of franchisee turnover and product returns. Sales in the company’s
international franchise operations increased 15.3% year over year primarily due
to continued strong growth in the United Kingdom and Australia. Currency
translation contributed $18.0 million of the segment’s year-over-year sales
increase.

Segment
gross profit of $489.5 million in 2007 was up $41.8 million from 2006 levels
primarily due to the higher sales and lower costs, including $15.9 million of
benefits from ongoing RCI initiatives and $7.1 million of currency translation.
These improvements to gross profit were partially offset by $7.0 million of
higher production and material costs. Operating expenses of $364.4 million in
2007 were down $45.7 million from prior-year levels primarily due to the
absence of the $38.0 million franchisee litigation settlement charge recorded
in 2006, lower spending of $4.4 million in 2007 related to the company’s
strategic supply chain and franchise system initiatives, $3.3 million of lower
bad debt expense, and $3.2 million of lower restructuring costs. These
decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by $4.2 million of
currency translation and higher volume-related expenses. As a result of these
factors, operating earnings in 2007 for the Snap-on Tools Group increased $87.5
million from 2006 levels and, as a percentage of segment net sales, improved
from 3.7% in 2006 to 11.3% in 2007.


Diagnostics &
Information Group

Segment
net sales in 2007 of $650.6 million increased $144.4 million, or 28.5%, from
2006 levels

primarily due to $179.0 million of higher sales in 2007 (twelve months of
sales in 2007 versus approximately five weeks of post-acquisition sales in
2006) from Business Solutions and higher sales of diagnostics and information
products. Currency translation contributed $11.8 million of the year-over-year
sales increase. These increases were partially offset by approximately $35 million
of lower sales due to the wind down of an OEM facilitation program in Europe,
and by lower sales from the outsourcing of certain non-strategic, low-margin
diagnostics equipment products previously manufactured and sold to the Snap-on
Tools Group.

Segment
gross profit of $293.6 million in 2007 was up $97.2 million from 2006 levels
primarily due to the higher sales and a more favorable product mix. As a
percentage of segment net sales, gross profit margin of 45.1% in 2007 improved
significantly from 38.8% in 2006. Operating expenses of $194.1 million were up
$57.5 million from 2006 levels primarily due to $62.1 million of higher operating
expenses for Business Solutions (twelve months of operating expense in 2007
versus approximately five weeks of post-acquisition operating expense in 2006),
partially offset by $7.3 million of savings from ongoing RCI initiatives. As a
result of these factors, operating earnings for the Diagnostics &
Information Group in 2007 increased $39.7 million from 2006 levels and, as a
percentage of segment net sales, improved from 11.8% in 2006 to 15.3% in 2007.

Financial
Services

Financial services
operating income in 2007 was $22.4 million on $63.0 million of revenue, as
compared with $13.0 million of operating income on $49.0 million of revenue in
2006. The increase in operating income primarily reflects the impact of higher
net yields and lower borrowing costs. Originations of $539.6 million in 2007
were essentially flat with prior-year levels.

Corporate

Snap-on’s
general corporate expenses of $53.7 million in 2007 were essentially flat with the
$53.8 million incurred in 2006.


Fourth
Quarter

Highlights of Snap-on’s
results of operations for the fiscal fourth quarters ended December 29,
2007, and December 30, 2006, are as follows:

NM:  Not meaningful

Note:  Certain 2006 amounts have been reclassified
to conform to the 2007 income statement presentation. See Note 1 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the 2007 income statement
presentation.

Percentage
Disclosure:  Cost of goods sold, Gross
profit and Operating expense percentages are calculated as a percentage of Net
sales. Financial services expenses and Operating income from financial services
percentages are calculated as a percentage of Financial services revenue. All
other income statement line item percentages are calculated as a percentage of
the sum of Net sales and Financial services revenue.

Net
sales in the fourth quarter of 2007 increased $91.5 million, or 14.0%, from
2006 levels,

including $59.9 million of higher
sales and $31.6 million of currency translation. Sales in the Commercial &
Industrial Group increased $51.5 million, or 16.2%, year over year, primarily
due to higher industrial sales, increased sales of professional tools and
equipment in Europe, and continued strong sales growth in emerging markets. Sales
in the Snap-on Tools Group increased $11.6 million, or 4.4%, from 2006 levels
primarily driven by continued strong sales in the company’s international
franchise operations and higher sales in North America. Sales in the
Diagnostics & Information Group increased $29.4 million, or 21.0%,
from 2006 levels primarily due to incremental fourth-quarter sales in 2007 from
the November 28, 2006, acquisition of Business Solutions (13 weeks of
sales in 2007 versus approximately five weeks of post-acquisition sales in
2006) and higher sales of diagnostics and information products, partially
offset by lower sales due to the wind down of an OEM facilitation program in
Europe.


Gross
profit in the fourth quarter of 2007 was $333.4 million, or 44.9% of net sales,
as compared to $282.7 million, or 43.4% of net sales, in 2006. The $50.7
million improvement in 2007 gross profit primarily reflects benefits from the
higher sales, savings from ongoing RCI initiatives of $12.6 million, and
currency translation of $11.4 million, partially offset by $7.4 million of
increased production and material costs. Fourth-quarter 2007 gross profit also
benefited from $6.0 million of “last-in, first-out” (“LIFO”) related inventory
benefits; gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2006 included LIFO-related charges
of $4.1 million.

Operating
expenses in the fourth quarter of 2007 were $245.1 million, as compared to
$229.1 million in 2006. The $16.0 million increase includes $9.6 million of
higher year-over-year operating expenses for Business Solutions, $8.0 million
of currency translation, higher volume-related expenses, and $3.8 million of
increased restructuring costs. These increases were partially offset by a $4.0
million gain on the sale of a facility in Europe, $2.6 million of lower bad
debt expense, $1.9 million of benefits from ongoing RCI initiatives, and $1.7
million of lower spending in 2007 related to the company’s strategic supply
chain and franchise system initiatives. As a percentage of net sales, operating
expenses improved 220 basis points to 33.0% in the fourth quarter of 2007, as
compared to 35.2% in 2006.

Interest expense of $11.5
million in the fourth quarter of 2007 was up $4.5 million from 2006 levels
primarily due to higher debt levels to finance the Business Solutions
acquisition.

Other income (expense) –
net was expense of $0.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 as compared to
income of $2.0 million in 2006. This line item includes the impact of all
non-operating items such as interest income and hedging and currency exchange
rate transaction gains and losses.

Snap-on’s effective income
tax rate on earnings before minority interests and equity earnings (loss) in
the fourth quarter of 2007 was 31.2%, as compared with 28.5% in the prior year.
The lower effective tax rate in 2006 primarily reflects the reversal of certain
foreign income tax valuation allowances. See Note 8 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for further information on income taxes.

Net earnings in the
fourth quarter of 2007 were $57.3 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, as
compared with net earnings of $38.0 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, in
2006. Results of operations for the fourth quarter of 2007 include a full
quarter (13 weeks) of operating results for Business Solutions; results of
operations for the fourth quarter of 2006 included approximately five weeks of
post-acquisition operating results for Business Solutions.

Commercial &
Industrial Group

Segment
net sales in the fourth quarter of 2007 increased $51.5 million, or 16.2%, from
2006 levels, including $30.1 million of higher sales and $21.4 million of
currency translation. The $30.1 million sales increase primarily reflects
higher industrial sales, increased sales of professional tools and equipment in
Europe, and continued strong sales growth in emerging markets.


Segment
gross profit of $132.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 was up $15.9
million over 2006 levels. The improvement in gross profit primarily reflects
benefits from the higher sales, $8.5 million of savings from ongoing RCI
initiatives, and $7.3 million of currency translation. These improvements in
gross profit were partially offset by $6.2 million of higher production and
material costs and $1.1 million of higher year-over-year restructuring costs. Operating
expenses of $94.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 were up $9.9 million
from 2006 levels, but improved 100 basis points as a percentage of segment
sales. The increase in operating expenses primarily includes $5.1 million of
currency translation, $3.6 million of higher restructuring costs, higher
volume-related expenses, and increased investment spending to further expand
Snap-on’s presence in emerging growth markets and lower-cost regions. These
increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $4.0 million gain on
the sale of a facility in Europe and $1.1 million of savings from ongoing RCI
initiatives. As a result of these factors, fourth-quarter operating earnings
for the Commercial & Industrial Group increased $6.0 million from 2006
levels. As a percentage of segment net sales, including the impact of $4.7
million of higher restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of 2007, operating
earnings for the Commercial & Industrial Group improved from 10.1% in
2006 to 10.3% in 2007.

Snap-on
Tools Group

Segment
net sales in the fourth quarter of 2007 increased $11.6 million, or 4.4%, from
2006 levels. Sales in the company’s international franchise operations
increased $9.6 million, or 19.3%, over 2006 levels, primarily due to continued
strong sales growth in the United Kingdom and higher sales in Japan. Sales in
the company’s North American franchise operations increased 1.0% from 2006
levels. Currency translation contributed $7.5 million of the segment’s
year-over-year sales increase.

Segment gross profit of
$125.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 was up $18.0 million over 2006 levels
primarily due to the higher sales and lower costs, including benefits of $4.1
million from ongoing RCI initiatives and $3.0 million of currency translation.
Segment gross profit in 2007 also includes $6.0 million of LIFO-related
inventory benefits; segment gross profit in 2006 included $4.1 million of LIFO-related
charges. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2007 declined $3.3 million
from prior-year levels primarily due to $2.3 million of lower bad debt expense
and $1.7 million of lower costs in 2007 related to the company’s strategic
supply chain and franchise system initiatives. As a result of these factors,
fourth-quarter operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group increased $21.3
million from 2006 levels and, as a percentage of segment net sales, improved
from 5.8% in 2006 to 13.4% in 2007.


Diagnostics &
Information Group

Segment
net sales of $169.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 increased $29.4
million, or 21.0%, from 2006 levels. Incremental year-over-year sales of $31.4
million from the acquisition of Business Solutions (13 weeks of sales in 2007
versus approximately five weeks of post-acquisition sales in 2006) and higher
sales of diagnostics and information products were partially offset by lower sales
due to the wind down of an OEM facilitation program in Europe. Currency
translation contributed $3.8 million of the year-over-year sales increase.

Segment gross profit of
$75.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 increased $16.8 million from 2006
levels primarily due to the higher sales and a more favorable product mix. As a
percentage of segment net sales, gross profit margin of 44.7% was up 260 basis
points from 2006 levels. Operating expenses of $48.4 million in the fourth
quarter of 2007 were up $10.1 million from 2006 levels primarily due to $9.6
million of higher year-over-year operating expenses for Business Solutions,
partially offset by $2.6 million of savings from ongoing RCI initiatives. As a
result of these factors, fourth-quarter operating earnings for the Diagnostics &
Information Group increased $6.7 million from 2006 levels and, as a percentage
of segment net sales, improved from 14.8% in 2006 to 16.2% in 2007.

Financial
Services

Financial
services operating income in the fourth quarter of 2007 was $8.0 million on
$19.0 million of revenue, as compared with $5.0 million of operating income on
$14.8 million of revenue in 2006. The increase in operating income primarily
reflects the impact of higher net yields. Originations of $139.4 million in the
fourth quarter of 2007 were up 3.0% from prior-year levels.

Corporate

Snap-on’s general corporate
expenses of $13.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 were down slightly from
the $14.5 million incurred in the fourth quarter of 2006.


Fiscal
2006 vs. Fiscal 2005

Highlights of Snap-on’s
results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2006, and December 31,
2005, are as follows:

NM:  Not meaningful

Note:  Certain amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the 2007 income statement presentation. See Note 1
to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the 2007 income
statement presentation.

Percentage Disclosure:  Cost of
goods sold, Gross profit and Operating expense percentages are calculated as a
percentage of Net sales. Financial services expenses and Operating income from
financial services percentages are calculated as a percentage of Financial
services revenue. All other income statement line item percentages are
calculated as a percentage of the sum of Net sales and Financial services
revenue.

Net sales in 2006
increased $174.1 million, or 7.6%, from 2005 levels, including $11.0 million
from currency translation. The increase in net sales includes higher sales in
the Diagnostics & Information Group’s OEM facilitation business and $20.4
million of sales for the approximate five-week period following the company’s November 28,
2006, acquisition of Business Solutions. Sales in the Commercial &
Industrial Group also increased year over year primarily due to higher sales of
tools for U.S. commercial and industrial applications, improved worldwide sales
of equipment products, along with continued growth in emerging markets. Sales
in the Snap-on Tools Group increased $30.5 million, or 3.1%, over 2005 levels,
reflecting sales increases in both the North American and international
franchise operations. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
information on the Business Solutions acquisition.


Gross profit was $1,079.8
million, or 44.0% of net sales, in 2006, as compared to $1,011.2 million, or
44.3% of net sales, in 2005. The $68.6 million increase in 2006 gross profit
primarily reflects benefits from higher sales and pricing, as well as benefits
from lower costs, including benefits from ongoing RCI initiatives of $34.9
million. The year-over-year increase in gross profit also includes $11.5
million from the fourth-quarter 2006 acquisition of Business Solutions and $4.2
million of currency translation. These increases in gross profit were partially
offset by higher year-over-year production costs of $22.6 million, and LIFO and
other inventory expenses of $11.2 million, including a $1.0 million charge
related to LIFO inventories in 2006 versus a comparable $8.8 million benefit in
2005. Restructuring costs included in “Cost of goods sold” totaled $12.1
million in 2006, as compared to $3.0 million in 2005. The 30 basis point
decline in year-over-year gross profit as a percentage of net sales also
reflects the impact of a shift in product mix that included higher 2006 sales
(and lower relative gross margin) in the OEM facilitation business.

Financial services
operating income was $13.0 million on $49.0 million of revenue in 2006, as
compared with $15.7 million of operating income on $53.6 million of revenue in
2005. The decrease in operating income primarily reflects the impact of lower
net interest spreads, partially offset by higher levels of originations.

Operating expenses in
2006 were $930.0 million, as compared to $863.5 million in 2005. The $66.5
million increase in 2006 operating expenses is primarily due to the recording
of a $38.0 million pretax charge in the second quarter of 2006 related to the
settlement of franchisee litigation matters. Operating expenses in 2006 also
included $22.8 million in higher spending for strategic growth initiatives and
$22.0 million of higher stock-based and performance-based incentive
compensation, including $6.3 million in costs associated with the January 1,
2006, adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123(R),

“Share-Based Payment,”

on a prospective
basis. The year-over-year increase in 2006 operating expenses also includes
$6.7 million of operating expenses from the acquisition of Business Solutions
and $2.7 million of currency translation. These increases in operating expenses
were partially offset by benefits from ongoing RCI initiatives of $15.3
million, as well as the absence of $3.0 million of costs incurred in 2005 to
terminate a supplier relationship. Restructuring costs included in “Operating
expenses” totaled $9.6 million in 2006, as compared to $15.4 million in 2005. See
Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the
franchisee litigation settlement.

Interest expense of $20.6
million in 2006 was slightly lower than the $21.7 million incurred in 2005
primarily due to lower average debt levels, including the October 3, 2005,
repayment of $100 million of unsecured 6.625% notes. The year-over-year
decrease in interest expense was partially offset by the impacts of higher
interest rates and $1.8 million of interest expense in 2006 related to the
issuance of approximately $305 million of commercial paper obligations to
finance, in part, the November 28, 2006, acquisition of Business Solutions.
See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on
commercial paper borrowings.

Other income (expense) –
net was income of $5.3 million in 2006, as compared to income of $3.1 million
in 2005. This line item includes the impact of all non-operating items such as
interest income and hedging and currency exchange rate transaction gains and
losses. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
information on other income (expense) – net.

Snap-on’s effective
income tax rate on earnings before minority interests and equity earnings (loss)
was 31.1% in 2006, as compared with 38.1% in the prior year. The lower
effective tax rate in 2006 primarily reflects the mix of U.S. and non-U.S.
earnings, including the impacts of the $38.0 million pretax franchisee
litigation settlement charge that was tax effected at a higher U.S. tax rate,
and the reversal of foreign income tax valuation allowances as a result of
foreign restructuring and other activities. Snap-on’s effective income tax rate
of 38.1% in 2005 included $3.3 million of additional U.S. income tax expense
related to the repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings under the American
Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (“the AJCA”). Under the provisions of the AJCA,
Snap-on repatriated approximately $93 million of qualifying dividends in 2005.
See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on
income taxes.

Net earnings in 2006 were
$100.1 million, or $1.69 per diluted share, including a $23.4 million after-tax
charge ($0.40 per diluted share) related to the resolution of the franchisee
litigation settlement, as compared with net earnings of $92.9 million, or $1.59
per diluted share, in 2005. Results of operations for fiscal 2006 included
approximately five weeks of operating results for the November 28, 2006,
acquisition of Business Solutions.

Segment
Results

Commercial &
Industrial Group

Segment
net sales in 2006 increased $62.8 million, or 5.6%, from 2005 levels due to
$54.9 million of higher sales and $7.9 million of currency translation. The
$54.9 million sales increase primarily reflects growth in emerging markets,
higher worldwide equipment and power tool sales, and increased sales of tools
for U.S. commercial and industrial applications.

Segment gross profit of
$435.7 million in 2006 was up $41.2 million, or 170 basis points as a
percentage of segment sales, over 2005 levels. The improvement in 2006 gross
profit primarily reflects benefits from increased sales of higher-margin
products and improved pricing, savings of $16.7 million from ongoing RCI
initiatives, including increased production and sourcing of materials from
lower-cost regions and facilities, and $2.4 million of currency translation. These
improvements were partially offset by $5.7 million of higher restructuring
costs primarily related to manufacturing footprint initiatives in Europe, and
$3.7 million of higher material and production costs. Operating expenses
increased $4.6 million, but decreased 100 basis points as a percentage of
segment sales, from 2005 levels. The operating expense increase includes higher
volume-related expenses, $6.7 million of increased spending to support the
expansion of Snap-on’s sales and manufacturing presence in emerging growth
markets and lower-cost regions, higher performance-based incentive compensation
of $2.1 million, and $1.6 million of currency translation. These increases were
partially offset by $6.5 million of benefits from ongoing RCI initiatives and
$3.6 million of lower restructuring costs. As a result of these factors,
operating earnings in 2006 for the Commercial & Industrial Group
increased $36.6 million over 2005 levels.

Snap-on
Tools Group

NM:  Not meaningful

Segment
net sales in 2006 increased $30.5 million from 2005 levels due to $28.4 million
of higher sales and $2.1 million of currency translation. Sales in the company’s
North American franchise operations were up 3.1% over 2005 levels, primarily
driven by a significant year-over-year increase in fourth-quarter U.S. sales,
partially offset by a lower average number of U.S. franchisees in 2006. The
average number of U.S. franchisees in 2006 was down 3.0% from 2005 levels. As
the company continues implementing its strategic initiatives to improve the franchise
system, it anticipates that the decline in the number of U.S. franchisees will
moderate. In 2006, sales in the company’s international franchise operations
were up 3.1% from 2005 levels, largely due to strong sales growth in the United
Kingdom and Australia.


Segment gross profit of
$447.7 million in 2006 was up slightly from $445.6 million in 2005. The $2.1
million increase in 2006 gross profit primarily reflects the higher sales and
selling prices, as well as lower costs of $17.3 million from ongoing RCI
initiatives. These increases were partially offset by higher production costs
and $10.5 million of increased year-over-year LIFO and other inventory
expenses, including a $1.0 million charge related to LIFO inventories in 2006,
versus a comparable $8.8 million benefit in 2005. Snap-on also incurred $2.0
million of higher restructuring costs in 2006 primarily related to the expected
mid-2007 closure of its Johnson City, Tennessee, hand tool facility. Snap-on
expects to phase out production at the Johnson City facility and transfer
production to other Snap-on hand tool facilities and suppliers. Gross profit as
a percentage of segment sales was 43.7%, down 110 basis points from 44.8% in
the prior year. Operating expenses in 2006 were up $46.7 million from
prior-year levels, primarily due to the $38.0 million pretax franchisee
litigation settlement charge, $13.3 million of higher costs, including $1.7
million of restructuring-related costs, to support strategic supply chain and
franchise system initiatives, and $5.5 million of higher performance-based
incentive compensation. These increases were partially offset by $4.6 million
of benefits from ongoing RCI initiatives and the absence of $3.0 million of costs
incurred in 2005 to terminate a supplier relationship. As a result of these
factors, operating earnings in 2006 for the Snap-on Tools Group declined $44.6
million from 2005 levels.

Diagnostics &
Information Group

Segment
net sales of $506.2 million in 2006 increased $101.1 million, or 25.0%, from
2005 levels, largely due to higher OEM facilitation sales, $20.4 million of
incremental sales for the approximate five-week period following the company’s November 28,
2006, acquisition of Business Solutions, and increased sales of information
products. Currency translation contributed $1.5 million to the year-over-year
sales increase.

Segment
gross profit of $196.4 million in 2006 was up $25.3 million from 2005 levels
primarily due to the higher sales, including $11.5 million from the Business
Solutions acquisition, and $2.2 million of benefits from efficiency and
productivity initiatives, partially offset by $1.4 million of higher
restructuring costs. As a percentage of segment net sales, gross profit margin
of 38.8% was down 340 basis points from 2005 levels, reflecting a shift in
product mix that included higher 2006 OEM (and lower relative gross margin)
facilitation sales. Operating expenses in 2006 of $136.6 million were up $7.8
million from 2005 levels. The increase in year-over-year operating expenses
primarily includes $6.7 million of operating expenses from the Business
Solutions acquisition and $4.5 million of higher spending to support strategic
growth initiatives, partially offset by $3.3 million of benefits from
efficiency and productivity initiatives. As a result of these factors,
operating earnings in 2006 for the Diagnostics & Information Group
increased $17.5 million over 2005 levels.

Financial
Services

Financial services
operating income in 2006 was $13.0 million on $49.0 million of revenue, as
compared with $15.7 million of operating income on $53.6 million of revenue in
2005. The decrease in operating income primarily reflects the impact of lower
net interest spreads, partially offset by a 2.9% increase in year-over-year
originations.


Corporate

Snap-on’s general
corporate expenses totaled $53.8 million in 2006, up from $46.4 million in
2005, primarily due to $15.2 million of increased stock-based and
performance-based incentive compensation, including $6.3 million from the January 1,
2006, adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). Increased expenses in 2006 also
included $4.2 million of higher insurance and other costs. These expense
increases were partially offset by $9.5 million of benefits from RCI
initiatives.

See Note 13 to
the Consolidated

Financial Statements for information on
the company’s adoption of SFAS No. 123(R).

Financial
Condition

Snap-on’s growth has historically
been funded by a combination of cash provided by operating activities and debt
financing. Snap-on believes that its cash from operations, coupled with its
sources of borrowings, are sufficient to fund its anticipated requirements for
working capital, capital expenditures, restructuring activities, acquisitions,
common stock repurchases and dividend payments. Due to Snap-on’s credit rating
over the years, external funds have been available at a reasonable cost. As of
the close of business on February 15, 2008, Snap-on’s long-term debt and
commercial paper was rated A3 and P-2 by Moody’s Investors Service and A- and A-2
by Standard & Poor’s. Snap-on believes that the strength of its
balance sheet, combined with its cash flows from operating activities, affords
the company the financial flexibility to respond to both internal growth
opportunities and those available through acquisitions.

The following discussion
focuses on information included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance
Sheets.

Snap-on has been focused
on improving asset utilization by making more effective use of its investment
in certain working capital items. The company assesses management’s operating
performance and effectiveness relative to those components of working capital,
particularly accounts receivable and inventories, that are more directly
impacted by operational decisions.

As of December 29, 2007, working capital (current
assets less current liabilities) of $548.2 million was up $117.0 million from
$431.2 million as of December 30, 2006. The increase in year-over-year
working capital primarily reflects higher levels of “Cash and cash equivalents”
of $29.6 million, lower “Notes payable and current maturities of long-term debt”
of $27.7 million, and $27.7 million of increased “Accounts receivable – net of
allowances.”

The following represents
the company’s working capital position as of December 29, 2007, and December 30,
2006.

Accounts receivable at
the end of 2007 was $586.9 million, up $27.7 million from year-end 2006 levels.
The year-over-year increase in accounts receivable primarily reflects the
impact of higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2007 and $25.1 million of
currency translation. This increase in accounts receivable was partially offset
by lower levels of receivables as a result of an improvement in days sales
outstanding from 76 days at year-end 2006 to 73 days at year-end 2007.


Inventories of $322.4
million at year-end 2007 were essentially flat with year-end 2006 levels, as a
$15.3 million net decrease in inventories was largely offset by $14.7 million
of currency translation. Lower year-over-year inventory levels from the wind
down of a 2006 OEM facilitation program in Europe (essential equipment and
diagnostics deployments for major OEMs) and reduced U.S. supply chain
inventory, were partially offset by higher inventory levels to better meet
increased demand for industrial products, and professional tools and equipment
in Europe. Inventories accounted for using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”)
method as of December 29, 2007, and December 30, 2006, approximated 65%
and 62%, respectively, of total inventories. All other inventories are
accounted for using the LIFO cost method. The company’s LIFO reserve decreased
from $86.7 million at December 30, 2006, to $75.0 million at December 29,
2007. Inventory turns (full year cost of goods sold divided by the average of
the beginning and ending inventory balances for the year) were 4.9 turns at year-end
2007, as compared to 4.6 turns at year-end 2006.

Accounts payable at December 29,
2007, was $171.6 million, down $7.2 million from year-end 2006 levels primarily
due to the timing of payments and the impact of lower inventory levels,
partially offset by $6.8 million of currency translation.

Notes payable and
long-term debt as of December 29, 2007, was $517.9 million; no commercial
paper was outstanding at December 29, 2007. As of December 30, 2006,
notes payable and long-term debt was $549.2 million, including $314.9 million
of commercial paper. On January 12, 2007, Snap-on sold $300 million in
floating and fixed rate notes consisting of $150 million of floating rate notes
that mature on January 12, 2010, and $150 million of fixed rate notes that
mature on January 15, 2017. Interest on the floating rate notes accrues at
a rate equal to the three-month London Interbank offer rate plus 0.13% per year
and is payable quarterly. Interest on the fixed rate notes accrues at a rate of
5.50% per year and is payable semi-annually. Snap-on used the proceeds from the
sale of the notes, net of $1.5 million of transaction costs, to repay
commercial paper obligations issued to finance the acquisition of Business
Solutions. On January 12, 2007, the company also terminated a $250 million
bridge credit agreement that Snap-on established prior to its acquisition of
Business Solutions.

Average commercial paper
and bank notes outstanding were $124.9 million in 2007 and $55.1 million in
2006. The weighted-average interest rate on these instruments was 5.59% in 2007
and 5.63% in 2006. As of December 29, 2007, the weighted-average interest
rate on outstanding bank notes was 8.78%. At December 30, 2006, the
weighted-average interest rate on outstanding commercial paper and bank notes was
5.42%.

Long-term debt of $502.0
million as of December 29, 2007, includes $200 million of unsecured 6.25%
notes, $150 million of unsecured floating rate notes, $150 million of unsecured
5.50% notes, and $2.0 million of other long-term debt. Current maturities of
long-term debt and notes payable to banks under uncommitted lines of credit of
$15.9 million at December 29, 2007, included $10.1 million of notes
payable and $5.8 million of current maturities of long-term debt.

On August 10, 2007,
Snap-on entered into a five-year, $500 million multi-currency revolving credit
facility that terminates on August 10, 2012. This $500 million facility
replaces Snap-on’s previous $400 million multi-currency revolving credit
facility that was set to terminate on July 27, 2009. The $500 million
revolving credit facility’s financial covenant requires that Snap-on maintain,
as of each fiscal quarter end, (i) a ratio of total debt to the sum of
total debt plus shareholders’ equity of not greater than 0.60 to 1.00; or (ii) a
ratio of total debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization (EBITDA) for the preceding four fiscal quarters then ended of not
greater than 3.50 to 1.00. As of December 29, 2007, Snap-on was in
compliance with all covenants of this revolving credit facility.

As of December 29,
2007, Snap-on also had $20 million of unused available debt capacity under its
committed bank lines of credit, including a $10 million line of credit that
expires on July 29, 2008, and a $10 million line of credit that expires
on   August 31, 2008. As of December 29,
2007, Snap-on had $520 million of unused available debt capacity under the
terms of its revolving credit facility and its committed bank lines of credit.

Snap-on maintains
sufficient committed and uncommitted lines of credit and liquidity facilities
to cover its expected funding needs on both a short-term and long-term basis. Snap-on
manages its aggregate short-term borrowings so as not to exceed its
availability under its revolving credit facilities and committed lines of
credit. The company accesses short-term debt markets predominantly through
commercial paper issuances and lines of credit to fund its short-term
requirements and to ensure near-term liquidity. Near-term liquidity
requirements for Snap-on in 2008 include the funding of its investments in
capital expenditures and restructuring activities, payments of dividends,
interest and share repurchases. Snap-on expects to make contributions of $10.0
million to its foreign pension plans and $1.2 million to its domestic pension
plans in 2008. Depending on market and other conditions, Snap-on may elect to
make discretionary cash contributions to its domestic pension plans in 2008.


Snap-on’s long-term
financing strategy is to maintain continuous access to the debt markets to
accommodate its liquidity needs. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information on Snap-on’s debt and credit facilities.The
following discussion focuses on information included in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow.

Cash flow provided from
operating activities was $231.1 million in 2007, $203.4 million in 2006, and
$221.1 million in 2005. Depreciation expense was $53.5 million in 2007, $48.5
million in 2006 and $49.5 million in 2005. The increase in depreciation from
2006 levels primarily reflects the impact of higher levels of capital spending
in 2006 and 2007.

Capital expenditures were
$61.9 million in 2007, $50.5 million in 2006 and $40.1 million in 2005. Capital
expenditures in all three years mainly reflect efficiency and cost-reduction
capital investments, including the installation of new production equipment and
machine tooling to enhance manufacturing and distribution operations, as well
as ongoing replacements of manufacturing and distribution equipment. Capital
spending in 2006 and 2007 also included higher levels of spending to support
the company’s strategic supply chain and other growth initiatives, including
the expansion of the company’s manufacturing capabilities in lower-cost regions
and emerging markets, and for the replacement and enhancement of its existing
global enterprise resource planning (ERP) management information system, which
will continue over a period of several years. Snap-on believes that its cash
generated from operations, as well as the funds available from its credit
facilities, will be sufficient to fund the company’s capital expenditure
requirements in 2008.

Amortization expense was
$22.2 million in 2007, $3.4 million in 2006 and $2.7 million in 2005. The
increase in 2007 amortization expense is primarily due to the amortization of
intangibles from the November 2006 acquisition of Business Solutions. See
Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on acquired
intangible assets.

Snap-on has undertaken
stock repurchases from time to time to offset dilution created by shares issued
for employee and dealer stock purchase plans, stock options, and other
corporate purposes, as well as to repurchase shares when the company believes
market conditions are favorable. In 2007, Snap-on repurchased 1,860,000 shares
of common stock for $94.4 million under its previously announced share
repurchase programs. The cash used to repurchase shares of common stock was
partially offset by $39.2 million of proceeds from stock purchase and option
plan exercises and $6.0 million of related excess tax benefits. As of December 29,
2007, Snap-on had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $116.8
million in common stock pursuant to the Board of Directors’ (“Board”)
authorizations. The purchase of Snap-on common stock is at the company’s
discretion, subject to prevailing financial and market conditions. Snap-on
repurchased 2,616,618 shares of common stock for $109.8 million in 2006 and
912,100 shares of common stock for $32.1 million in 2005. Snap-on believes that
its cash generated from operations, as well as the funds available from its
credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund the company’s share repurchases
in 2008.

On October 3, 2005,
Snap-on repaid its $100 million, 10-year, 6.625% unsecured notes upon their
maturity. The $100 million debt repayment was made with available cash on hand.

Snap-on has paid
consecutive quarterly cash dividends, without interruption or reduction, since
1939. Cash dividends paid in 2007, 2006 and 2005 totaled $64.8 million, $63.6
million and $57.8 million, respectively. On November 1, 2007, the company
announced that its Board increased the quarterly cash dividend by 11.1% to
$0.30 per share ($1.20 per share per year). At the beginning of fiscal 2006,
the company’s Board increased the quarterly cash dividend by 8% to $0.27 per
share ($1.08 per share per year).

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

Except as set forth below
in the section labeled “Contractual Obligations and Commitments,” the company
had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 29, 2007.


Contractual Obligations and Commitments

A summary of Snap-on’s future contractual obligations and commitments
as of December 29, 2007, are as follows:

The company has excluded payments related to its pension and
postretirement benefit plans from the contractual obligation table above;
see Notes 11 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information
on the company’s benefit plans and payments.  The contractual obligation table above does
not include income tax liabilities recorded in accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 48

“Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes: an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109;”

see Note 8 for information on income taxes.

Environmental Matters

Snap-on is subject to various federal, state and local government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Snap-on’s policy is to comply with these requirements and the company believes that, as a general matter, its policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with its business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in some of Snap-on’s operations and products, as it is with other compani
es engaged in similar businesses.

Snap-on is and has been engaged in the handling, manufacture, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies. The company believes that, as a general matter, its handling, manufacture, use and disposal of these substances are in accordance with environmental laws and regulations. It is possible, however, that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could bring into question the company’s handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these substances.

Consolidated Joint Venture

SOC,
a consolidated, 50%-owned joint venture between Snap-on and CIT, provides a
broad range of financial services to Snap-on’s U.S. franchisee and customer
network and to Snap-on’s industrial and other customers. Snap-on and CIT have
identical voting and participation rights and responsibilities in SOC.

See Note 1
to the Consolidated

Financial Statements for further
information on

SOC.

Snap-on
receives royalty and management fee income from SOC based on the volume of
financings originated by SOC.  Snap-on
also shares ratably with CIT in any residual net profit or loss of the joint
venture after operating expenses, including royalty and management fees,
interest costs and credit loss provisions. 
Snap-on provides extended-term financing internationally through its
wholly owned finance subsidiaries.

SOC sells substantially all of its originated contracts on a limited
recourse basis to CIT, net of certain fees, and SOC continues to service these
contracts for an estimated market-rate servicing fee.  SOC originated contracts totaling $422.7
million in 2007, $426.8 million in 2006 and $413.8 million in 2005.

CIT and Snap-on have agreed to lend funds to support SOC’s working
capital requirements on a 50/50 basis. 
As of December 29, 2007, and December 30, 2006, SOC owed
each of Snap-on and CIT $0.3 million and $0.1 million, respectively, pursuant
to this agreement.

New Accounting Standards

See Note 1 to the
Consolidated

Financial Statements for information on
new accounting standards.

Critical
Accounting Policies

The
consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is
pertinent to management’s discussion and analysis.  The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  These estimates are generally based on
historical experience, current conditions and on various other assumptions that
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which
form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily available from other sources, as well as
identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments
and contingencies.  Actual results could
differ from those estimates.  Snap-on
considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the
judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company’s consolidated
financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company’s
financial position, results of operations and cash flow.

Revenue Recognition:

Snap-on derives
revenue primarily from the sale of tools, diagnostics and equipment solutions
for professional tool and equipment users. 
Snap-on markets its products and services through the worldwide
franchise mobile van channel, company direct sales, and independent distributor
and other non-franchise channels, including its public Internet Web site.  Snap-on also derives revenue from various
financing programs to facilitate the sales of its products.

Snap-on recognizes revenue from the sale of tools, diagnostics and
equipment solutions when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) the price is fixed or
determinable; (iii) collectibility is reasonably assured; and (iv) delivery
has occurred or services have been rendered. 
Delivery generally occurs when the title and the risks and rewards of
ownership have substantially transferred to the customer.  For sales contingent upon customer acceptance
or product installation, revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations
are fulfilled.  As required by SFAS No. 48,
“

Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists,”

estimated
product returns are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of
sale based upon historical product return experience and assumptions for the
gross profit margin and volume of future sales returns.  Provisions for customer volume rebates,
discounts and allowances are also recorded as a reduction of reported revenues
at the time of sale based on historical experience and known trends.  Revenue related to maintenance and
subscription agreements is recognized over the term of the agreement.


Snap-on also recognizes revenue related to multiple element
arrangements, including sales of software and software-related services.  Snap-on follows the guidance under Statement
of Position (“SOP”) 97-2,

“Software Revenue
Recognition,”

as amended and Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
Issue No. 03-5,

“Applicability of SOP 97-2
to Non-software Deliverables Containing More than Incidental Software”

for
software and software-related elements, and EITF Issue No. 00-21,

“Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,”

in
conjunction with Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,

“Revenue Recognition,”

for hardware and
hardware-related elements.  When a sales
arrangement contains multiple elements, such as hardware and software products
and/or services, Snap-on uses vendor specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair
value to allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value and,
when necessary, uses the residual method to assign value to the delivered
elements when VSOE only exists for the undelivered elements.  Snap-on limits the amount of revenue
recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the
future delivery of products or services. 
The amount assigned to future delivery of products or services is
recognized when the product is delivered and/or when the services are
performed.  In instances where the
product and/or services are performed over an extended period, as is the case
with subscription agreements or the providing of ongoing support, revenue is
recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement, which
generally ranges from 12 to 60 months.

Purchased software and costs incurred in the development of software
that will ultimately be sold are capitalized at the time technological
feasibility has been attained and the related product is ready for general
release. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the company capitalized $10.6 million,
$5.0 million and $4.2 million, respectively, of such costs. Amortization
of capitalized software development costs was $4.9 million in 2007, $2.5
million in 2006, and $1.7 million in 2005. Unamortized capitalized software
development costs were $24.0 million at December 29, 2007, and $18.3
million at December 30, 2006.

Financial Services Revenue:

In addition to its sales of
tools, diagnostics and equipment solutions, Snap-on also generates revenue from
various financing programs that include (i) loans to franchisees; (ii) loans
to the franchisees’ customers; and (iii) loans to Snap-on’s industrial and
other customers for the purchase of tools and equipment on an extended-term
payment plan.  These financing programs
are offered through SOC, a consolidated 50%-owned joint venture with CIT, and
Snap-on’s wholly owned international finance subsidiaries.  Financial services revenue consists of SOC’s
sales of originated contracts to CIT and service fee income, as well as
installment contract revenue and franchisee loan receivable revenue derived
from SOC and Snap-on’s wholly owned international finance operations.  The decision to finance through Snap-on or
another financing entity is solely at the election of the customer.  When assessing customers for potential
financing, Snap-on considers various factors regarding ability to pay including
financial condition, collateral, debt-servicing ability, past payment
experience and credit bureau information. 
Contracts originated by SOC and subsequently sold to CIT are also
subject to the underwriting approval of CIT.

Financing revenue from SOC is recognized primarily from the sale of
originated contracts to CIT net of various fees, including securitization,
warehousing, bad debt and prepayment fees. 
SOC continues to service these contracts for an estimated market-rate
servicing fee.  Servicing fees are paid
to SOC by CIT and such revenue is recognized over the contractual term of the
loan, with a portion of the servicing fee recognized at the time of
origination.  Financing revenue from
originated loans that are retained is recognized over the life of the contract,
with interest computed on a daily basis.

Snap-on’s wholly owned international finance subsidiaries own all of
the loans originated through their financing programs. Revenue from interest
income is recognized over the life of the contract, with interest computed on a
daily basis.

Franchise
fee revenue, including nominal, non-refundable initial and ongoing monthly fees
(primarily for sales and business training and marketing and product promotion
programs), is recognized as the fees are earned.

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-lived Intangible
Assets

: Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price
paid over the value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of
businesses acquired. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are
not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment annually or more frequently
if events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets might be
impaired. Impairment tests involve the use of judgmental estimates


related to the fair market value of the business operations with which
goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are associated, taking
into consideration both historical operating performance and anticipated
financial position and future earnings, discounted by the company’s weighted
average cost of capital. Annual impairment tests are performed by the company
in the second quarter of each year; the 2007 evaluation indicated that no
goodwill or intangible asset impairment adjustments were required.

Should
the operations of the businesses with which goodwill or indefinite-lived
intangible assets are associated incur significant declines in profitability
and cash flow in future years due to significant adverse changes in business
climate, adverse actions by regulators, unanticipated competition, loss of key
personnel, and/or changes in technology or markets, some or all of the recorded
goodwill or intangibles could be subject to impairment. See Note 6 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on goodwill and other
intangible assets.

Allowances for Doubtful Accounts:

Snap-on’s accounts receivable are reported net of estimated bad debt
allowances, which are regularly evaluated by management for adequacy. The
evaluations take into consideration various financial and qualitative factors that
may affect customers’ ability to pay. 
These factors may include customers’ financial condition, collateral,
debt-servicing ability, past payment experience and credit bureau information.  Snap-on regularly reviews the allowance
estimation process and adjusts the allowances as appropriate.  It is possible, however, that the accuracy of
Snap-on’s estimation process could be adversely impacted if the financial
condition of its customers were to deteriorate. 
The company does not believe that accounts receivable represent
significant concentrations of credit risk because of the diversified portfolio
of individual customers and geographical areas.

Inventory Valuation:

Snap-on
values its inventory at the lower of cost or market and adjusts for the value
of inventory that is estimated to be excess, obsolete or otherwise
unmarketable.  Inventory adjustments for
raw materials are largely based on analysis of raw material age and actual
physical inspection of raw material for fitness for use.  As part of evaluating work-in-progress and
finished goods, management reviews individual product stock-keeping units
(SKUs) by product category and product life cycle.  Cost adjustments for each product
category/product life-cycle state are generally established and maintained
based on a combination of historical experience, forecasted sales and
promotions, technological obsolescence, inventory age and other actual known
conditions and circumstances.  Should
actual product marketability and raw material fitness for use be affected by
conditions that are different from management estimates, further adjustments to
inventory allowances may be required.

Internal-use Software:

In accordance with
SOP 98-1,

“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software
Developed or Obtained for Internal Use,”

costs that are incurred
internally in creating software solutions and enhancements to those solutions
are expensed until technological feasibility has been established.

Warranty Accruals:

Snap-on
provides product warranties for specific product lines and accrues for
estimated future warranty costs in the period in which the sale is
recorded.  Snap-on calculates its accrual
requirements based on historic warranty loss experience that is periodically
adjusted for recent actual experience, including the timing of claims during
the warranty period and actual costs incurred. If actual return rates and/or
repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates,
adjustments to cost of sales may be required in future periods. See Note 15 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on Snap-on’s
warranty accrual.

Pension Benefits:

The
calculation of Snap-on’s pension expense and projected benefit obligation
requires the use of a number of assumptions. 
Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside
of Snap-on’s control and can have a significant effect on the amounts reported
in the financial statements.  Snap-on
believes that the two most critical assumptions are (i) the expected
return on plan assets; and (ii) the assumed discount rate.

Pension
expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases.  Lowering the expected rate of return
assumption for Snap-on’s domestic pension plan assets by 0.5% would have
increased Snap-on’s 2007 domestic pension expense by approximately $3.4
million.  At year-end 2007, Snap-on’s
domestic plan assets comprised approximately 87% of Snap-on’s worldwide pension
plan assets.  See Note 11 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on Snap-on’s pension
plans.


The
objective of Snap-on’s discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which
the pension benefits could be effectively settled.  In making this
determination, the company takes into account the timing and amount of benefits
that would be available under the plans.  The methodology for selecting
the discount rate as of year-end 2007 was to match the plan’s cash flows to
that of a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on long-term bonds
with an Aa rating or better for each maturity.  The selection of the 6.5%
weighted-average discount rate for Snap-on’s domestic pension plans represents
the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the
estimated benefit plan payments. Lowering Snap-on’s domestic discount rate
assumption by 0.5% would have increased Snap-on’s 2007 domestic pension expense
and projected benefit obligation by approximately $2.5 million and $35.1
million, respectively.  At year-end 2007, Snap-on’s domestic projected
benefit obligation comprised approximately 81% of Snap-on’s worldwide projected
benefit obligation.

Income Taxes:

The company
records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more
likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized.  While the company has
considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax
strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates
and assumptions change in the future, the company may be required to adjust its
valuation allowance.  This could result
in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is
made.

In
addition, the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is
subject to audit in these jurisdictions. 
The company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits
and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each
matter.

Stock-based Compensation:

Effective January 1,
2006, the company adopted SFAS No. 123(R),

“Share-Based
Payment,”

using the modified prospective method.  SFAS No. 123(R) requires entities
to recognize the cost of employee services in exchange for awards of equity
instruments based on the grant-date fair value of those awards (with limited
exceptions).  That cost, based on the
estimated number of awards that are expected to vest, will be recognized over
the period during which the employee is required to provide the service in
exchange for the award.  No compensation
cost is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite
service.  Upon adoption, the grant-date
fair value of employee share options and similar instruments was estimated
using the Black-Scholes valuation model.

The
Black-Scholes valuation model requires the input of subjective assumptions,
including the expected life of the stock-based award and stock price
volatility. The assumptions used are management’s best estimates, but the
estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management
judgment. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, the recorded and pro
forma stock-based compensation expense could have been materially different
from that depicted in the financial statements.

Outlook

Snap-on
expects to continue investing in its growth initiatives aimed at expanding
value provided to its traditional customers, penetrating new and adjacent
segments, and extending its presence in the emerging markets of Asia/Pacific
and Eastern Europe.  In addition, Snap-on
also expects to continue implementing its strategic growth, RCI and low-cost
sourcing initiatives intended to provide higher levels of growth and
profitability.  Snap-on anticipates 2008
restructuring costs to be in a range of $15 million to $20 million, down from
the $26 million incurred in 2007. 
Capital expenditures in 2008 are expected to be in a range of $55
million to $60 million.  Snap-on also
expects that its 2008 effective income tax rate on earnings before minority interests
and equity earnings (loss) will approximate 33%.  As a result, Snap-on expects full-year 2008
sales and operating earnings to improve over 2007 levels.


Item 7A:
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market, Credit and Economic Risks

Market risk is the potential economic
loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial
instruments.  Snap-on is exposed to
market risk from changes in both foreign currency exchange rates and interest
rates.  Snap-on monitors its exposure to
these risks and attempts to manage the underlying economic exposures through
the use of financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts and
interest rate swap agreements.  Snap-on
does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes.  Snap-on’s broad-based business activities
help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related
areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole.  Snap-on’s management takes an active role in
the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that
require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the
identification, assessment and control of various risks.

Foreign Currency Risk Management

Snap-on has significant
international operations and is subject to certain risks inherent with foreign
operations that include currency fluctuations and restrictions on movement of
funds. Foreign exchange risk exists to the extent that Snap-on has payment
obligations or receipts denominated in currencies other than the functional
currency.  To manage these exposures,
Snap-on identifies naturally offsetting positions and then generally purchases
hedging instruments to protect the residual net anticipated exposures.  Snap-on’s financial position and results of
operations have not been materially affected by such events to date.

See Note 10
to the Consolidated

Financial Statements for further
information on

foreign currency risk management.

Interest Rate Risk Management

Snap-on’s interest rate
risk management policies are designed to reduce the potential earnings
volatility that could arise from changes in interest rates. Through the use of
interest rate swaps, Snap-on aims to stabilize funding costs by managing the
exposure created by the differing maturities and interest rate structures of
Snap-on’s assets and liabilities.

See Note 10 to the Consolidated

Financial Statements for further information on

interest rate risk management.

Snap-on utilizes a Value-at-Risk (“VAR”) model to
determine the potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate and
foreign exchange-sensitive financial instruments from adverse changes in market
factors. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions
and a 95% confidence level. Snap-on’s computations are based on the
inter-relationships among movements in various currencies and interest rates
(variance/co-variance technique). These inter-relationships were determined by
observing interest rate and foreign currency market changes over the preceding
quarter.

The estimated maximum
potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the VAR model, at December 29,
2007, was

$0.5 million on interest
rate-sensitive financial instruments and $0.3 million on foreign
currency-sensitive financial instruments. The VAR model is a risk management
tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be
incurred by Snap-on, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable
changes in market factors.


Credit Risk

Credit risk is the
possibility of loss from a customer’s failure to make payments according to
contract terms.  Prior to granting
credit, each customer is evaluated, taking into consideration the borrower’s
financial condition, collateral, debt-servicing ability, past payment
experience, credit bureau information and other financial and qualitative
factors that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay.  Specific credit reviews and standard industry
credit scoring models are used in performing this evaluation. Loans that have
been granted are typically monitored through an asset-quality-review process
that closely monitors past due accounts and initiates collection actions when
appropriate.  In addition to its direct
credit risk exposure, Snap-on also has credit risk exposure for certain SOC
loan originations with recourse provisions against Snap-on (primarily for
franchisee van loans).  At December 29,
2007, $16.1 million of loans originated by SOC have a recourse provision to
Snap-on if the loans become more than 90 days past due.

For additional information on SOC,
refer to the section entitled “Consolidated Joint Venture” in this Management’s
Discussion and Analysis and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Commodity
Risk

The
company is a purchaser of certain commodities such as steel, natural gas and
electricity.  The company is also a
purchaser of components and parts that are integrated into the company’s
end products, as well as the purchaser of certain finished goods, all of
which may contain various commodities including steel, aluminum and
others.  Snap-on’s supply of raw
materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from
numerous suppliers.

The principal raw material used in the manufacture of our products is
steel, which we purchase in competitive, price-sensitive markets. To meet
Snap-on’s high quality standards, our steel needs range from specialized alloys,
which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers, to
commodity types of alloys. These raw materials have historically exhibited
price and demand cyclicality. Some of these materials have been, and in the
future may be, in short supply. As some steel alloys require specialized
manufacturing procedures, we could experience inventory shortages if we were
required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice.  Additionally, unexpected price increases
could result in higher prices to our customers or an erosion of the margins on
our products.

We believe our ability to sell our products is also
dependent on the number of vehicles on the road, the number of miles driven and
the general aging of vehicles. These factors affect the frequency, type and
amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians, and
therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians, the prosperity of
the technicians and, subsequently, the demand the technicians have for our
tools, other products and services, and the value they place on those products
and services. To the extent that gasoline prices increase, consumers may turn
to other, non-gasoline based, methods of transportation, including more
frequent use of public transportation.  A
decrease in the use of gasoline consuming vehicles may lead to fewer repairs
and less demand for our products.

To the
extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm
pricing agreements with its suppliers, the company may experience margin
declines to the extent that it is not able to increase the selling prices
of its products.

Item 9: Changes in and
Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

Item 9A: Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures

Snap-on
maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures that is designed to
provide reasonable assurance that material information relating to the company
and its consolidated subsidiaries is timely communicated to the officers who
certify Snap-on’s financial reports and to other members of senior management
and the Board, as appropriate.

In
accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(the “Exchange Act”), the company’s management evaluated, with the
participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the company’s disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act)
as of December 29, 2007.  Based upon
their evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure
controls and procedures were effective as of December 29, 2007 to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported, within the time period specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its
principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Changes in Internal Control

Snap-on is in the process of developing and implementing an
improved enterprise resource planning (ERP) management information system to
further enhance the operational capabilities of its businesses.  In 2007, the company has been
implementing this system at certain of its North American and
European locations.  As a result of, and in connection with, the
implementation of the new system and processes, the company modified its internal
control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)).
Additional implementations will occur at other worldwide
locations over a multi-year period.

Management’s Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).  Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

. Based on this assessment, the
company’s management believes that, as of December 29, 2007, our internal
control over financial reporting was effective. 
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December 29, 2007, has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which
is included herein.

Our
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does
not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all
error or fraud.  Because of inherent
limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide
only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Further, because of changes in conditions,
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Snap-on
Incorporated:

We
have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Snap-on
Incorporated and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 29, 2007,
based on criteria established in

Internal Control –
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness
exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by,
or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by
the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting,
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of
controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future
periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2007, based
on the criteria established in

Internal Control —  Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial
statements as of and for the year ended December 29, 2007, of the Company
and our report dated February 18, 2008, expressed an unqualified opinion
on those financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph relating to
the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

and FASB Statement No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
Postretirement Plans — an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106,
and 132(R)

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and
Shareholders of

Snap-on Incorporated:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Snap-on
Incorporated and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 29,
2007, and December 30, 2006, and the related consolidated statements of
earnings, shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 29, 2007. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Snap-on Incorporated and
subsidiaries as of December 29, 2007, and December 30, 2006, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 29, 2007, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

As described in Notes 1 and 13 to the consolidated financial
statements, effective January 1, 2006, the Company changed its method of
accounting for share-based compensation to adopt Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) Statement No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

.
As described in Notes 1, 11 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements,
the Company recognized the funded status of its benefit plans in accordance
with the provisions of FASB Statement No. 158,

Employers’
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans— an
amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)

, as of
December 30, 2006.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2007, based on the criteria
established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
and our report dated February 18, 2008, expressed an unqualified opinion
on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Note 1:

Summary of Accounting Policies

Principles
of consolidation and presentation:

The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Snap-on Incorporated (“Snap-on” or
“the company”), its majority-owned subsidiaries, and Snap-on Credit LLC
(“SOC”), a 50%-owned joint venture with The CIT Group, Inc. (“CIT”).  The consolidated financial statements do not
include the accounts of the company’s independent franchisees.  Snap-on’s consolidated financial statements
are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). 
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated.

Certain prior year amounts have
been reclassified on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings to conform to the
2007 presentation.  Minority interests of
$3.7 million in 2006 and $3.5 million in 2005, and pretax earnings of
unconsolidated affiliates of $2.1 million in 2005, all previously included in
“Other income (expense) — net,” are being presented after “Earnings before
minority interests and equity earnings (loss).” 
Previously reported “Other income (expense) — net” of $1.6 million in
2006 and $1.7 million in 2005 is now $5.3 million in 2006 and $3.1 million in
2005.  The Consolidated Statements of
Earnings have also been restated to reflect the company’s June 29, 2007,
sale of a non-strategic business as “Discontinued operations, net of tax.”  As a result of the above, “Income tax
expense” of $45.8 million in 2006 and $55.1 million in 2005 is now $45.9
million in 2006 and $55.2 million in 2005. 
See Note 16 for information on discontinued operations.

Fiscal
year accounting period:

Snap-on’s fiscal year ends on
the Saturday nearest December 31. The 2007, 2006 and 2005 fiscal years
each contained 52 weeks and ended on December 29, 2007, December 30,
2006, and December 31, 2005, respectively. 
Snap-on’s 2008 fiscal year will contain 53 weeks of operating results,
with the additional week occurring in the fourth quarter. The company does not
expect the impact of the additional week of operations on full-year 2008
operating earnings to be material.

Use
of estimates:

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue
recognition:

Snap-on derives revenue primarily from
the sale of tools, diagnostics and equipment solutions for professional
users.  Snap-on markets its products and
services through the worldwide franchise mobile van, company-direct,
distributor and Internet sales channels. 
Snap-on also derives revenue from various financing programs to
facilitate the sales of its products and services.

Snap-on recognizes revenue from
the sale of tools, diagnostics and equipment solutions when all of the
following conditions are satisfied: (i) persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists; (ii) the price is fixed or determinable; (iii) collectibility
is reasonably assured; and (iv) delivery has occurred or services have
been rendered.  Delivery generally occurs
when the title and the risks and rewards of ownership have substantially
transferred to the customer.  For sales
contingent upon customer acceptance or product installation, revenue
recognition is deferred until such obligations are fulfilled.  As required by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 48, “

Revenue Recognition When
Right of Return Exists,”

estimated product returns are recorded as a
reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale based upon historical
product return experience and assumptions for the gross profit margin and volume
of future sales returns.  Provisions for
customer volume rebates, discounts and allowances are also recorded as a
reduction of reported revenues at the time of sale based on historical
experience and known trends.  Revenue
related to maintenance and subscription agreements is recognized over the term
of the agreement.

Snap-on also recognizes revenue
related to multiple element arrangements, including sales of software and
software-related services.  Snap-on
follows the guidance under Statement of Position (“SOP”) 97-2,

“Software Revenue Recognition,”

as amended and Emerging
Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 03-5,

“Applicability
of SOP 97-2 to Non-software Deliverables Containing More than Incidental
Software”

for software and software-related elements,

and EITF Issue No. 00-21,

“Revenue
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,”

in conjunction with
Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,

“Revenue Recognition,”

for hardware and hardware-related
elements.  When a sales arrangement
contains multiple elements, such as hardware and software products and/or
services, Snap-on uses vendor specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair
value to allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value and,
when necessary, uses the residual method to assign value to the delivered
elements when VSOE only exists for the undelivered elements.  Snap-on limits the amount of revenue
recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the
future delivery of products or services. 
The amount assigned to future delivery of


products or services is
recognized when the product is delivered and/or when the services are
performed.  In instances where the
product and/or services are performed over an extended period, as is the case
with subscription agreements or the providing of ongoing support, revenue is
recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement, which
generally ranges from 12 to 60 months.

Purchased software and costs
incurred in the development of software that will ultimately be sold are
capitalized at the time technological feasibility has been attained and the
related product is ready for general release. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the
company capitalized $10.6 million, $5.0 million and $4.2 million, respectively,
of such costs. Amortization of capitalized software development costs was $4.9
million in 2007, $2.5 million in 2006, and $1.7 million in 2005. Unamortized
capitalized software development costs were $24.0 million at December 29,
2007, and $18.3 million at December 30, 2006.

Financial
services revenue:

In addition to its sales of tools,
diagnostics and equipment solutions, Snap-on also generates revenue from
various financing programs that include (i) loans to franchisees; (ii) loans
to the franchisees’ customers; and (iii) loans to Snap-on’s industrial and
other customers for the purchase of tools and equipment on an extended-term
payment plan.  These financing programs
are offered through SOC and the company’s wholly owned international finance
subsidiaries.  Financial services revenue
consists of SOC’s sales of originated contracts to CIT and service fee income,
as well as installment contract revenue and franchisee loan receivable revenue
derived from SOC and Snap-on’s wholly owned international finance
operations.  The decision to finance
through Snap-on or another financing entity is solely at the customers’
election.  When assessing customers for
potential financing, Snap-on considers various factors regarding ability to pay
including financial condition, collateral, debt-servicing ability, past payment
experience and credit bureau information. 
Contracts originated by SOC and subsequently sold to CIT are also
subject to the underwriting approval of CIT.

Financing revenue from SOC is
recognized primarily from the sale of originated contracts to CIT net of
various fees, including securitization, warehousing, bad debt and prepayment
fees.  SOC continues to service these contracts
for an estimated market-rate servicing fee. 
Servicing fees are paid to SOC by CIT and such revenue is recognized
over the contractual term of the loan, with a portion of the servicing fee
recognized at the time of origination.

Financing revenue from
originated loans that are retained is recognized over the life of the contract,
with interest computed on a daily basis. Snap-on’s wholly owned international
finance subsidiaries own all of the loans originated through their financing
programs. Revenue from interest income, at both SOC and Snap-on’s wholly owned
finance subsidiaries, is recognized over the life of the contract, with
interest computed on a daily basis.

Franchise fee revenue,
including nominal, non-refundable initial and ongoing monthly fees (primarily
for sales and business training and marketing and product promotion programs),
is recognized as the fees are earned.

Research
and engineering:

Research and engineering costs are
charged to expense in the year incurred. For 2007, 2006 and 2005, research and
engineering costs totaled $47.6 million, $44.0 million and $48.0 million,
respectively.

Shipping
and handling:

Amounts billed to customers for shipping
and handling are included as a component of sales.  Costs incurred by Snap-on for shipping and
handling are included as a component of cost of goods sold when the costs
relate to manufacturing activities.  In
2007, 2006 and 2005, Snap-on incurred shipping and handling charges of $26.7
million, $21.5 million and $17.9 million, respectively, that were recorded in
“Cost of goods sold” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Earnings.  Shipping and handling costs
incurred in conjunction with selling or distribution activities are included as
a component of operating expenses.  In
2007, 2006 and 2005, Snap-on incurred shipping and handling charges of $67.6
million, $66.3 million and $62.6 million, respectively, that were recorded in
“Operating expenses” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Internal-use
software:

In
accordance with SOP 98-1,

“Accounting for the Costs
of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use,”

costs
that are incurred internally in creating software solutions and enhancements to
those solutions are expensed until technological feasibility has been
established.

Advertising
and promotion:

Production costs of future media
advertising are deferred until the advertising occurs.  All other advertising and promotion costs are
generally expensed when incurred. For 2007, 2006 and 2005, advertising and
promotion expense totaled $58.9 million, $56.3 million and $47.1 million,
respectively.


Warranties:

Snap-on provides product warranties for specific product lines and accrues for
estimated future warranty costs in the period in which the sale is
recorded.  See Note 15 for further
information on warranties.

Minority
interests and equity earnings (loss) of unconsolidated affiliates:

“Minority interests and equity earnings (loss), net of tax” on the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Earnings is comprised of the following:

Minority interests in
consolidated subsidiaries of $17.3 million as of December 29, 2007, and
$16.8 million as of December 30, 2006, are included in “Other long-term
liabilities” on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Investments in unconsolidated affiliates of
$30.7 million as of December 29, 2007, and $30.6 million as of December 30,
2006, are included in “Other assets” on the accompanying Consolidated Balance
Sheets.

Foreign
currency translation:

The financial statements of
Snap-on’s foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars in accordance
with SFAS No. 52,

“Foreign Currency
Translation.”

Assets and
liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at current rates of
exchange, and income and expense items are translated at the average exchange
rate for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded
directly into “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” on the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Foreign exchange transactions
resulted in pretax losses of $1.7 million in 2007 and $1.2 million in 2006, and
a pretax gain of $0.7 million in 2005. 
Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses are reported in “Other
income (expense) - net” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings

.

Income
taxes:

In the
ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying income
tax positions. We assess income tax positions and record tax benefits for all
years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts,
circumstances and information available at the reporting dates. For those tax
positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be
sustained, we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50%
likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority
that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax
positions where it is not more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be
sustained, no tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements. When
applicable, associated interest and penalties are recognized as a component of
income tax expense.  Accrued
interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability in the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Deferred income taxes are
provided for temporary differences arising from differences in bases of assets
and liabilities for tax and financial reporting purposes.  Deferred income
taxes are recorded on temporary differences using enacted tax rates in effect
for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. The
effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  See Note 8 for further information on income
taxes.

Per
share data:

Basic earnings per share calculations were
computed by dividing net earnings by the corresponding weighted-average number
of common shares outstanding for the period. The dilutive effect of the
potential exercise of outstanding options to purchase common shares is
calculated using the treasury stock method. 
Snap-on had dilutive shares as of year-end 2007, 2006 and 2005, of
731,442 shares, 911,697 shares and 584,222 shares, respectively.  Options to purchase 493,544 shares, 23,000
shares and 612,892 shares of Snap-on common stock for the fiscal years ended
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, were not included in the computation of
diluted earnings per share as the exercise prices of the options were greater
than the average market price of the common stock for the respective year and,
as a result, the effect on earnings per share would be anti-dilutive.

Stock-based
compensation:

Effective January 1, 2006, the company
adopted SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” using the modified prospective method.  SFAS No. 123(R) requires entities to
recognize the cost of employee services in exchange for awards of equity
instruments based on the grant-date fair value of those awards (with limited
exceptions).  That cost, based on the
estimated number of awards that are expected to vest, is recognized over the
period during which the employee is required to provide the service in exchange
for the award.  No compensation cost is
recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite
service.  Upon adoption, the grant-date
fair value of employee share options and


similar instruments was
estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model.  Due to the prospective adoption of SFAS No.
123(R), results for prior periods have not been restated.

The Black-Scholes valuation
model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected life
of the stock-based award and stock price volatility. The assumptions used are
management’s best estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties
and the application of management judgment. As a result, if other assumptions
had been used, the recorded and pro forma stock-based compensation expense
could have been materially different from that depicted in the financial
statements.

Derivatives:

Snap-on utilizes derivative financial instruments, including interest rate
swaps and foreign exchange contracts, to manage its exposure to interest rate
and foreign currency exchange rate risks. 
Snap-on accounts for its derivatives in accordance with SFAS No. 133,

“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities,”

as amended by SFAS No. 138,

“Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging
Activities,”

and SFAS No. 149,

“Amendment
of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.”

Snap-on does not hold or issue financial
instruments for speculative or trading purposes. See Note 10 for further
information on derivatives.

Concentrations:

Snap-on is exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by the
counterparties to its interest rate swap and foreign exchange contracts.  Snap-on does not obtain collateral or other
security to support its financial instruments subject to credit risk, but
monitors the credit standing of the counterparties and enters into agreements
only with financial institution counterparties with a credit rating of A- or
better.  Snap-on does not anticipate
non-performance by its counterparties.

Snap-on’s accounts receivable
do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk because of the
diversified portfolio of individual customers and geographic areas.

Approximately 3,100
employees, or 27% of Snap-on’s worldwide workforce, are represented by unions
and/or covered under collective bargaining agreements.  Approximately 1,100 employees are covered
under agreements expiring in 2008. In recent years, Snap-on has not experienced
any significant work slow-downs, stoppages or other labor disruptions.

Cash
equivalents:

Snap-on considers all highly liquid
investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates market
value.

Accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts:

Snap-on’s accounts receivable are reported net of estimated bad debt
allowances, which are regularly evaluated by management for adequacy. The
evaluations take into consideration various financial and qualitative factors
that may affect customers’ ability to pay. 
These factors may include customers’ financial condition, collateral,
debt-servicing ability, past payment experience and credit bureau
information.  Snap-on regularly reviews
the allowance estimation process and adjusts the allowances as
appropriate.  It is possible, however,
that the accuracy of Snap-on’s estimation process could be adversely impacted
if the financial condition of its customers were to deteriorate.  The company does not believe that accounts
receivable represent significant concentrations of credit risk because of the
diversified portfolio of individual customers and geographical areas.

Inventories:

Snap-on values its inventory at the lower of cost or market and adjusts for the
value of inventory that is estimated to be excess, obsolete or otherwise
unmarketable.  Inventory adjustments for
raw materials are largely based on analysis of raw material age and actual
physical inspection of raw material for fitness for use.  As part of evaluating work-in-progress and
finished goods, management reviews individual product stock-keeping units
(SKUs) by product category and product life cycle.  Cost adjustments for each product
category/product life-cycle state are generally established and maintained
based on a combination of historical experience, forecasted sales and
promotions, technological obsolescence, inventory age and other actual known
conditions and circumstances.  Should
actual product marketability and raw material fitness for use be affected by
conditions that are different from management estimates, further adjustments to
inventory allowances may be required.

Snap-on adopted the “last-in,
first-out” (“LIFO”) inventory valuation method in 1973 for its U.S.
locations.  Snap-on’s U.S. inventories
accounted for on LIFO consist of purchased product and inventory manufactured
at the company’s heritage U.S. manufacturing facilities (primarily hand tools
and tool storage).  As Snap-on began
acquiring businesses in the 1990’s, the company retained the “first-in,
first-out” (“FIFO”) inventory valuation methodology used by the predecessor
businesses prior to their acquisition by Snap-on; the company does not adopt
the LIFO inventory valuation methodology for new acquisitions.  See Note 4 for further information on inventories.


Property
and equipment:

Property and equipment is stated at
cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and
amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives.
Major repairs that extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized, while
routine maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.  Capitalized software included in property and
equipment reflects costs related to internally developed or purchased software
for internal use and is amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated
useful lives. Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment in accordance with
the provisions of SFAS No. 144, “

Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

.”  See Note 5 for further information on
property and equipment.

Goodwill
and other intangible assets:

SFAS No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,”

requires the testing
of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, at least
annually. Snap-on evaluates annually, and when significant changes in expected
long-term performance or other events arise, the existence of goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment on the basis of whether the assets
are fully recoverable from projected, discounted cash flows of the related
business unit.  See Note 6 for further
information on goodwill and other intangible assets.

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss):

The components of “Accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss)” (“AOCI”) on the accompanying Consolidated
Balance Sheets as of fiscal year-end 2007 and 2006 are as follows:

New accounting standards:

The Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) released SFAS No. 141(R),

“Business Combinations,”

to establish accounting and reporting standards to improve the relevance,
comparability and transparency of financial information that an acquirer would
provide in its consolidated financial statements from a business
combination.  SFAS No. 141(R) is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008.  The company is currently assessing the impact
the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) will have on the company’s
consolidated financial position and results of operations.

The
FASB released SFAS No. 160,

“Noncontrolling Interests
in Consolidated Financial Statements - an amendment of Accounting Research
Bulletin No. 51,”

to improve the relevance, comparability and
transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in
its consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting
standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the
deconsolidation of a subsidiary.  SFAS No. 160
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008.  The company is currently assessing the impact
the adoption of SFAS No. 160 will have on the company’s consolidated
financial position and results of operations.

Effective
December 30, 2007, the beginning of the company’s 2008 fiscal year,
Snap-on adopted SFAS No. 157, “

Fair Value Measurements,”

to define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expand
disclosures about fair value measurements. 
The company does not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have
a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements.


Effective December 30, 2007, Snap-on adopted
SFAS No. 159,

“The Fair Value Option for
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an amendment of SFAS No. 115,”

to

allow
companies to choose to elect, at specified dates, to measure eligible financial
instruments at fair value.  At the date
of adoption of SFAS No. 159, the company did not elect the fair value
option for any of its financial assets or financial liabilities.

In
June 2007 the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 06-11, “

Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share-Based Payment
Awards.”

EITF Issue No. 06-11
specifies how companies should recognize the income tax benefit received on
dividends that are (i) paid to employees holding equity-classified
nonvested shares, equity-classified nonvested share units, or equity-classified
outstanding share options; and (ii) charged to retained earnings under
SFAS No. 123(R). The company does not believe the adoption of EITF Issue No. 06-11,
which is effective for Snap-on beginning in fiscal 2008, will have a material
impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements.

Effective
December 31, 2006, the beginning of the company’s 2007 fiscal year,
Snap-on adopted SFAS No. 156, “

Accounting
for Servicing of Financial Assets

,”

to simplify
accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing
liabilities.  The adoption of SFAS No. 156
did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial position
and results of operations.

Snap-on adopted FASB
Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48”), “

Accounting for Uncertainty
in Income Taxes: an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109,

”
at the beginning of its 2007 fiscal year. 
FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
recognized under SFAS No. 109, “

Accounting for Income
Taxes.”

FIN 48 prescribes a
recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement
recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a
tax return.  FIN 48 also provides
guidance on the accounting for and disclosure of unrecognized tax benefits,
including any related interest and penalties. 
The adoption and application of FIN 48 did not have a significant impact
on Snap-on’s consolidated financial statements. 
See Note 8 for further information on income taxes.

Effective December 30, 2006, the last day of
its 2006 fiscal year, Snap-on adopted the recognition provisions of SFAS No. 158,
“

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension
and Postretirement Plans: an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106,
and 132(R)

.”  SFAS No. 158
requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of
its year-end statement of financial position, and also requires an employer to
initially apply the requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations
as of the date of the employer’s fiscal year-end statement of financial
position for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008.  As the company uses the last day of its
fiscal year end as the measurement date for its plans, the adoption of the
measurement provisions of SFAS No. 158 will have no impact on the
company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations.  Retrospective application of the recognition
and fiscal year-end measurement date provisions of SFAS No. 158 is not
permitted.  The impact of adopting SFAS No. 158
resulted in a decrease of $89.0 million to “Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Income (Loss),” as shown on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Shareholders’ Equity and Comprehensive Income. 
See Notes 11 and 12 for information on the company’s pension and
postretirement plans.

Note 2: Acquisitions

On November 28, 2006,
Snap-on acquired the ProQuest Business Solutions business and certain net
assets (collectively, “Snap-on Business Solutions” or “Business Solutions”)
from ProQuest Company for an initial purchase price of $516.0 million of cash
and the assumption of approximately $19 million of debt. Subsequent to the November 28,
2006, closing date, the cash purchase price for Business Solutions increased by
$5.7 million to $521.7 million, primarily reflecting a higher level of
working capital received by Snap-on at closing.


Pro forma
Information

The
following unaudited pro forma information presents the results of operations of
Snap-on as if the Snap-on Business Solutions acquisition had taken place at the
beginning of fiscal 2005. The unaudited pro forma financial information is not
intended to represent or be indicative of the consolidated results of
operations of Snap-on that would have been reported had the acquisition been
completed as of the dates presented, and should not be taken as representative
of the future consolidated results of operations of Snap-on.

Note 3: Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable include
trade accounts, installment and other receivables, including the current
portion of franchisee financing receivables. The components of Snap-on’s
current accounts receivable as of fiscal year-end 2007 and 2006 are as follows:


The
long-term portion of accounts receivable is classified in “Other assets” on the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and is comprised of installment and
other receivables, including franchisee financing receivables, with payment
terms that are due beyond one year.  The
components of Snap-on’s long-term accounts receivable as of fiscal year-end
2007 and 2006 are as follows:

The following is a rollforward
of the allowance for doubtful accounts for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005:

(1) 
Represents write-offs of bad debts and the net impact of currency translation.

Note 4: Inventories

Inventories by major
classification as of fiscal year-end 2007 and 2006 are as follows:

Inventories
accounted for using the FIFO method as of December 29, 2007, and December 30,
2006, approximated 65% and 62%, respectively, of total inventories.  The company accounts for its non-U.S.
inventory on the FIFO basis.  As of December 29,
2007, 31% of the company’s U.S. inventory was accounted for using the FIFO
basis and 69% was accounted for using the LIFO basis.  LIFO inventory liquidations resulted in a
reduction of “Cost of goods sold” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements
of Earnings of $4.6 million for the year ended December 29, 2007, and $8.3
million for the year ended December 31, 2005. There were no LIFO inventory
liquidations for the year ended December 30, 2006.


Note 5: Property and Equipment

Snap-on’s property and
equipment values, which are carried at cost, as of fiscal year-end 2007 and 2006
are as follows:

The estimated service lives of
property and equipment are principally as follows:

Buildings
  and improvements

3 to 50
  years

Machinery,
  equipment and computer software

2 to 15
  years

Snap-on entered into a 20-year
capital lease for office and distribution facilities in Japan for the Snap-on
Tools Group in 2005.  The current portion
of the capital lease obligation is included in “Other accrued liabilities” and
the long-term portion is included in “Other long-term liabilities” on the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
The cost and accumulated depreciation as of December 29, 2007, and December 30,
2006, for this facility are as follows:

Depreciation expense of $53.5
million, $48.5 million and $49.5 million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively, includes $1.0 million of depreciation expense in each year for
the Japan capital lease.

Note 6:
Acquired Intangible Assets

The
changes in the carrying amount of segment goodwill for fiscal 2007 and 2006 are
as follows:


Additional
disclosures related to other intangible assets as of fiscal year-end 2007 and
2006 are as follows:

As of December 30, 2006,
the $192.9 million preliminary purchase price allocation for the intangible
assets acquired as part of the Business Solutions acquisition consisted of
$164.6 million in customer-relationship intangible assets with a 16 year
weighted-average life and $28.3 million of developed technology with a five year
weighted-average life.  As a result of
the resolution of certain post closing adjustments in the third quarter of
2007, Snap-on reduced the initial preliminary purchase price allocation for the
intangible assets acquired by $32.8 million to $160.1 million. Based on
exchange rates in effect at the date of the acquisition, the $160.1 million of
intangible assets acquired consist of $139.4 million of customer-relationship
intangible assets ($140.3 million at December 29, 2007 exchange rates) and
$20.7 million of developed technology ($21.0 million at December 29, 2007
exchange rates).  Snap-on is amortizing
the $139.4 million of customer-relationship intangible assets on an accelerated
basis over a 16 year weighted-average life and is amortizing the $20.7 million
of developed technology on a straight-line basis over a five year
weighted-average life

.

As of December 30, 2006, internally developed software
with a gross carrying value of $34.4 million ($18.3 million net of accumulated
amortization) was included in “Other assets” on the accompanying Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

The weighted-average amortization periods related to
other intangible assets are as follows:

The weighted-average amortization period for all
amortizable intangibles on a combined basis is 16 years.

The aggregate amortization expense for 2007, 2006 and
2005 was $22.2 million, $3.4 million and $2.7 million, respectively.  Based on current levels of amortizable
intangible assets,

estimated annual amortization expense is
expected to be $26.3 million in 2008, $25.9 million in 2009, $25.7 million in
2010, $17.5 million in 2011, and $17.3 million in 2012.


Note 7: Exit and Disposal Activities

Snap-on
recorded costs associated with exit and disposal activities of $26.3 million
and $21.8 million during 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Of the $26.3
million of costs incurred in 2007, $17.3 million qualified for accrual
treatment.  Of the $21.8 million of costs
incurred in 2006, $17.0 million qualified for accrual treatment.  Costs associated with exit and disposal
activities in 2007 primarily related to headcount reductions for (i) the
transfer of certain production activities from Sweden to lower-cost regions and
emerging markets; (ii) the third quarter 2007 closure of the Johnson City,
Tennessee, hand tool facility; (iii) the consolidation of multiple customer
call centers in the United States; and (iv) various other management,
distribution and production realignment actions at other Snap-on facilities.

Snap-on’s exit
and disposal accrual activity related to 2007 and 2006 actions were as follows:

Exit and disposal accrual usage
of $11.1 million in 2007 consisted of $10.8 million for severance payments and
$0.3 million for facility consolidation or closure costs.  Since
year-end 2006, Snap-on has reduced headcount by approximately 300 employees as
part of its restructuring actions.  While
the majority of the exit and disposal accrual will be utilized in 2008, certain
facility-related costs will extend beyond 2008 primarily due to longer-term
lease obligations.

Snap-on expects to fund the
remaining cash requirements of its exit and disposal activities with cash flows
from operations and borrowings under the company’s existing credit
facilities.  The estimated costs for the
exit and disposal activities were based on management’s best business judgment
under prevailing circumstances.


Note 8: Income Taxes

The source of earnings before
income taxes, minority interests and equity earnings (loss) consisted of the
following:

The provision (benefit) for
income taxes consisted of the following:

A reconciliation of the
statutory federal income tax rate to Snap-on’s effective tax rate is as
follows:


Temporary differences that give
rise to the net deferred tax asset are as follows:

At December 29, 2007,
Snap-on had tax net operating loss carryforwards totaling $221.0 million as
follows:

A valuation allowance totaling
$35.5 million, $43.7 million and $42.2 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively, has been established for deferred income tax assets related to
certain subsidiary loss carryforwards that may not be realized. Realization of
the net deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable
income prior to their expiration. Although realization is not assured,
management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets
will be realized. The amount of the net deferred tax assets considered
realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future
taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced.

The company adopted FIN 48 on December 31,
2006, the beginning of the company’s 2007 fiscal year; the company had unrecognized
tax benefits of $21.3 million as of the date of adoption.  Snap-on did not record any cumulative effect
adjustment to retained earnings as a result of adopting FIN 48. As of December 29,
2007, the company had unrecognized tax benefits of $18.7 million.


Following is a reconciliation
of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits:

Of the $18.7 million of
unrecognized tax benefits at the end of 2007, approximately $16.2 million would
impact the effective income tax rate if recognized.

Interest and penalties related
to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in income tax expense.  During
the years ended December 29, 2007, December 30, 2006, and December 31,
2005, the company recognized approximately $1.2 million, $0.5 million and
$(0.5) million in net interest expense (benefit), respectively.  The company has provided for approximately
$3.4 million, $2.2 million, and $1.7 million of accrued interest related to unrecognized
tax benefits at the end of fiscal year 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

During the next 12 months, the
company does not anticipate any significant changes to the total amount of
unrecognized tax benefits, other than the accrual of additional interest
expense in an amount similar to the prior year’s expense.

With few exceptions, Snap-on is
no longer subject to U.S. federal and state/local income tax examinations by
tax authorities for years prior to 2003, and Snap-on is no longer subject to
non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2001.

The undistributed earnings of
all non-U.S. subsidiaries totaled $338.5 million, $247.4 million and $173.6
million at the end of fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Snap-on has not
provided any deferred taxes on these undistributed earnings as it considers the
undistributed earnings to be permanently invested.  Determination of the amount of unrecognized
deferred income tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable.

The American Jobs Creation Act
of 2004 (the “AJCA”) created a one-time tax incentive for U.S. corporations to
repatriate accumulated foreign earnings by providing a tax deduction of 85% of
qualifying dividends received from foreign affiliates.  Under the provisions of the AJCA, Snap-on
repatriated approximately $93 million of qualifying dividends in 2005 that
resulted in additional income tax expense of $3.3 million for the year.

Note 9: Short-term and Long-term Debt

Notes payable
and long-term debt as of December 29, 2007, was $517.9 million; no
commercial paper was outstanding at December 29, 2007.  As of December 30, 2006, notes payable
and long-term debt was $549.2 million, including $314.9 million of commercial
paper. Snap-on presented $300 million of the December 30, 2006, outstanding
commercial paper as “Long-term debt” on the accompanying December 30,
2006, Consolidated Balance Sheet.

On January 12,
2007, Snap-on sold $300 million of unsecured notes consisting of $150 million
of floating rate notes that mature on January 12, 2010, and $150 million
of fixed rate notes that mature on January 15, 2017.  Interest on the floating rate notes accrues
at a rate equal to the three-month London Interbank offer rate plus 0.13% per
year and is payable quarterly.  Interest
on the fixed rate notes accrues at a rate of 5.50% per year and is payable
semi-annually.  Snap-on used the proceeds
from the sale of the notes, net of $1.5 million of transaction costs, to repay
commercial paper obligations issued to finance the acquisition of Business Solutions.
On January 12, 2007, the company also terminated a $250 million bridge
credit agreement that Snap-on established prior to its acquisition of Business
Solutions.


Average
commercial paper and bank notes outstanding were $124.9 million in 2007 and
$55.1 million in 2006.  The
weighted-average interest rate on these instruments was 5.59% in 2007 and 5.63%
in 2006.  As of December 29, 2007,
the weighted-average interest rate on outstanding bank notes was 8.78%.  At December 30, 2006, the
weighted-average interest rate on outstanding commercial paper and bank notes
was 5.42%.

Long-term debt
of $502.0 million as of December 29, 2007, includes $200 million of
unsecured 6.25% notes, $150 million of unsecured floating rate notes, $150
million of unsecured 5.50% notes, and $2.0 million of other long-term
debt.  Notes payable and current
maturities of long-term debt at December 29, 2007, of $15.9 million
included $10.1 million of notes payable and $5.8 million of current maturities
of long-term debt.

On August 10, 2007,
Snap-on entered into a five-year, $500 million multi-currency revolving credit
facility that terminates on August 10, 2012. This $500 million facility
replaces Snap-on’s previous $400 million multi-currency revolving credit
facility that was to terminate on July 27, 2009.  The $500 million revolving credit facility’s
financial covenant requires that Snap-on maintain, as of each fiscal quarter
end, (i) a ratio of total debt to the sum of total debt plus shareholders’
equity of not greater than 0.60 to 1.00; or (ii) a ratio of total debt to
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the
preceding four fiscal quarters then ended of not greater than 3.50 to 1.00. As of
December 29, 2007, Snap-on was in compliance with all covenants of this
revolving credit facility.

As of December 29,
2007, Snap-on also had $20 million of unused available debt capacity under its
committed bank lines of credit, including a $10 million line of credit that
expires on July 29, 2008, and a $10 million line of credit that expires
on   August 31, 2008.  As of December 29, 2007, Snap-on had
$520 million of unused available debt capacity under the terms of its revolving
credit facility and its committed bank lines of credit.

Snap-on’s long-term debt as of
fiscal year-end 2007 and 2006 consisted of the following:

* Includes $300 million of commercial paper at year-end 2006.

The annual maturities of
Snap-on’s long-term debt due in the next five years are $5.8 million in 2008,
$1.6 million in 2009, $150.0 million in 2010, $200.1 million in 2011, and no
maturities in 2012.

Note 10: Financial Instruments

Snap-on
accounts for its hedging activities under SFAS No. 133,

“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,”

as amended by SFAS No. 138 and SFAS No. 149.  These standards require that all derivative
instruments be reported in the consolidated financial statements at fair
value.  Changes in the fair value of
derivatives are to be recorded each period in earnings or on the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),”
depending on the type of hedged transaction and whether the derivative is
designated and effective as part of a hedged transaction. Gains or losses on derivative
instruments reported in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” must be
reclassified as earnings in the period in which earnings are affected by the
underlying hedged item and the ineffective portion of all hedges must be
recognized in earnings in the current period.


Snap-on uses
derivative instruments to manage well-defined interest rate and foreign
currency exposures. Snap-on does not use derivative instruments for speculative
or trading purposes.  The criteria used
to determine if hedge accounting treatment is appropriate are (i) the
designation of the hedge to an underlying exposure; (ii) whether or not
overall risk is being reduced; and (iii) if there is a correlation between
the value of the derivative instrument and the underlying obligation. On the
date a derivative contract is entered into, Snap-on designates the derivative
as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, a hedge of a net investment in a
foreign operation, or a natural hedging instrument whose change in fair value
is recognized as an economic hedge against changes in the values of the hedged
item.

Foreign currency derivative instruments:

Snap-on has operations in a number of countries that have transactions outside
their functional currencies and, as a result, is exposed to changes in foreign
currency exchange rates.  Snap-on also
has intercompany loans to foreign subsidiaries denominated in foreign
currencies.  Snap-on manages these
exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows for netting of certain
exposures to take advantage of natural offsets. 
Forward exchange contracts are generally used to hedge the net
exposures.  Gains or losses on net
foreign currency hedges are intended to offset losses or gains on the underlying
net exposures in an effort to reduce the earnings volatility resulting from
fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates.

At December 29,
2007, Snap-on had $156.1 million of net foreign exchange forward buy contracts
outstanding comprised of buy contracts of $65.1 million in Swedish kronor,
$44.4 million in euros, $21.8 million in Australian dollars, $16.4 million in
British pounds, $3.5 million in Canadian dollars, $2.7 million in Singapore
dollars and $5.7 million in other currencies, and sell contracts of $1.6
million in Hungarian forint and $1.9 million in other currencies.  At December 30, 2006, Snap-on had $80.1
million of net foreign exchange forward buy contracts outstanding comprised of
buy contracts of $31.4 million in Swedish kronor, $23.1 million in euros, $17.8
million in British pounds, $10.9 million in Australian dollars, $2.3 million in
Japanese yen, $2.1 million in Norwegian kroner, and $3.4 million in other
currencies, and sell contracts of $7.0 million in Canadian dollars and $3.9 million
in other currencies.  The majority of
Snap-on’s forward exchange contracts are not designated as hedges under SFAS No. 133.  The fair value changes of these contracts are
reported in earnings as foreign exchange gain or loss, which is included in
“Other income (expense) — net” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Earnings.

Interest rate swap agreements:

Snap-on enters
into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest costs and risks
associated with changing interest rates. Interest rate swap agreements are
accounted for as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges. The
differentials paid or received on interest rate swap agreements are recognized
as adjustments to interest expense.  For
fair value hedges, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the
derivative is recorded in “Long-term debt” on the accompanying Consolidated
Balance Sheets, while any ineffective portion is recorded as an adjustment to
interest expense.  For cash flow hedges,
the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative is recorded
in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” while any ineffective
portion is recorded as an adjustment to interest expense.  The notional amount of interest rate swaps
outstanding and designated as fair value hedges was $50 million at both December 29,
2007, and December 30, 2006.

Changes in the
fair value of derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting
are included in derivative assets or liabilities, with the corresponding gains
or losses reflected in earnings in the period of change.  An offsetting gain or loss is also reflected
in earnings based upon the changes of the fair value of the debt instrument
being hedged.  For all fair value hedges
qualifying for hedge accounting, the net accumulated derivative asset at December 29,
2007, was $0.1 million.  At December 29,
2007, the maximum maturity date of any fair value hedge was four years.  During the years ended December 29,
2007, and December 30, 2006, cash flow hedge and fair value hedge
ineffectiveness was not material.

Fair
value of financial instruments:

SFAS No. 107,

“Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
Instruments,”

requires Snap-on to disclose the fair value of
financial instruments for both on- and off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities
for which it is practicable to estimate that value. The following methods and
assumptions were used in estimating the fair value of financial instruments:

Installment
contracts

: A discounted cash flow analysis was
performed over the average life of a contract using a discount rate currently
available to Snap-on adjusted for credit quality, cost and profit factors. As
of December 29, 2007, and December 30, 2006, the fair value was
approximately $126 million and $109 million, respectively, versus a book value
of $122.6 million and $105.0 million, respectively.


Long-term
debt

: The fair value of long-term debt was estimated
using a discounted cash flow analysis based on quoted market rates for similar
instruments.  As of December 29,
2007, and December 30, 2006, the fair value was approximately $497 million
and $504 million, respectively, versus a book value of $500.0 million for both
periods.

All other
financial instruments

: The carrying amounts of all
cash equivalents, interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts
approximate fair value based upon quoted market prices or discounted cash
flows.  The fair value of trade accounts
receivable, accounts payable and other financial instruments approximates
carrying value due to their short-term nature.

Note 11:
Pension Plans

Snap-on adopted the reporting
and disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 158 as of December 30, 2006
(fiscal 2006 year end).  See Note 1 for
further discussion of SFAS No. 158.

Snap-on has several
non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering most U.S. employees and
certain employees in foreign countries. Snap-on also has foreign contributory
defined benefit pension plans covering certain foreign employees. Retirement
benefits are generally provided based on employees’ years of service and
average earnings or stated amounts for years of service. Normal retirement age
is 65, with provisions for earlier retirement. Snap-on recognizes retirement
plan expenses in accordance with SFAS No. 87, “

Employers’
Accounting for Pensions.

”

The status of Snap-on’s pension
plans as of fiscal year-end 2007 and 2006 are as follows:


Amounts recognized in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets consist of:

The amounts included AOCI on
the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows:

The accumulated benefit
obligation for Snap-on’s pension plans was $805.8 million and $831.3 million at
December 29, 2007, and December 30, 2006, respectively.

The projected benefit
obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for
Snap-on’s pension plans in which the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the
fair value of plan assets as of fiscal year-end 2007 and 2006 are as follows:

The components of net periodic
benefit cost and other amounts recognized in “Other comprehensive income
(loss)” (“OCI”) are as follows:


Snap-on
expects to recognize as components of net periodic benefit cost in 2008 the
following amounts included in AOCI as of December 29, 2007:

The worldwide weighted-average assumptions used to determine Snap-on’s
full-year pension costs are as follows:

The worldwide weighted-average assumptions used to determine Snap-on’s
projected benefit obligation as of fiscal year-end 2007 and 2006 are as
follows:

Snap-on uses the last day
of its fiscal year end as the measurement date for the majority of its plans. Snap-on
expects to make contributions of $10.0 million to its foreign pension plans and
$1.2 million to its domestic pension plans in 2008. Depending on market and
other conditions, Snap-on may elect to make discretionary cash contributions to
its domestic pension plans in 2008.

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service,
are expected to be paid as follows:


Snap-on’s domestic pension plans’ weighted-average asset allocation at December 29,
2007, and December 30, 2006, by asset category and fair value of plan
assets are as follows:

Snap-on’s domestic pension plans have a long-term investment horizon
and a total return strategy that emphasizes a capital growth objective. The
long-term investment performance objective for Snap-on’s domestic plan assets
is to achieve net of expense returns that meet or exceed the 8.5% domestic long-term,
rate-of-return-on-assets assumption used for reporting purposes.

The basis for determining the overall expected long-term,
rate-of-return-on-assets assumption applies a nominal returns forecasting
method. For each asset class, future returns are estimated by identifying the
premium of riskier asset classes over lower risk alternatives. The methodology
constructs expected returns using a “building block” approach to the individual
components of total return. These forecasts are stated in both nominal and real
(after inflation) terms. This process first considers the long-term historical
return premium based on the longest set of data available for each asset class.
These premiums are then adjusted based on current relative valuation levels and
macro-economic conditions.

For risk and correlation assumptions, the actual experience for each
asset class is reviewed for the longest time period available. Expected
relationships for a 10 to 20 year time horizon are determined based upon
historical results, with adjustments made for material changes. For example,
expected correlations for international equities relative to U.S. equities are
higher than historical averages due to the integration of the global economy.

Investments are broadly diversified to attempt to minimize the risk of
large losses. Since asset allocation is a key determinant of expected
investment returns, assets are periodically rebalanced to the targeted
allocation to correct significant deviations from the asset allocation policy
that are caused by market fluctuations and cash flow.

Snap-on has adopted a strategic asset allocation policy that is
intended to offer the highest probability of achieving the long-term investment
return goal with the lowest level of risk. Asset/liability studies are
conducted periodically to determine if any revisions to the strategic asset
allocation policy are necessary.

Snap-on’s foreign pension plans’ weighted-average asset allocation by
asset category and fair value of plan assets at December 29, 2007, and December 30,
2006, are as follows:


Snap-on’s primary investment objective for its foreign pension plan
assets is to meet the projected obligations to the beneficiaries over a long
period of time, and to do so in a manner that is consistent with the company’s
risk tolerance. The foreign asset allocation policies consider the company’s
financial strength and long-term asset class risk/return expectations, since
the obligations are long term in nature. The assets are well diversified and
are managed locally by professional investment firms.

The expected long-term rate of return on foreign plan assets reflects
management’s expectations of long-term average rates of return on funds
invested to provide benefits included in the projected benefit obligations. The
expected return is based on the outlook for inflation, fixed income returns and
equity returns, while also considering historical returns, asset allocation and
investment strategy.

Snap-on has several 401(k) plans covering certain U.S. employees. Snap-on’s
employer match to the 401(k) plans is made with cash contributions. For
2007, 2006 and 2005, Snap-on recognized $4.2 million, $2.7 million and $2.4
million, respectively, of expense related to its 401(k) plans.

Note 12: Retiree Health Care

Snap-on adopted the reporting and disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 158
as of December 30, 2006 (fiscal 2006 year end). See Note 1 for further
discussion of SFAS No. 158.

Snap-on provides certain health care benefits for certain retired U.S.
employees. The majority of Snap-on’s U.S. employees become eligible for those
benefits if they reach early retirement age while working for Snap-on; however,
the age and service requirements for eligibility under the plans have been
increased for certain employees hired on and after specified dates since 1992.
Generally, most plans pay stated percentages of covered expenses after a deductible
is met. There are several plan designs, with more recent retirees being covered
under a comprehensive major medical plan. In determining benefits, the plans
take into consideration payments by Medicare and other insurance coverage.

For employees retiring under the comprehensive major medical plans,
retiree contributions are required, and these plans contain provisions allowing
for benefit and coverage changes. The plans require retirees to contribute
either the full cost of the coverage or amounts estimated to exceed a capped
per-retiree annual cost commitment by Snap-on. Most employees hired since 1994
are required to pay the full cost.

Snap-on contributed $14.5 million to a Voluntary Employees Beneficiary
Association (“VEBA”) trust in 2007 for the funding of existing postretirement
health care benefits for certain non-salaried retirees in the United States;
all other retiree health care plans are unfunded.

Effective January 1, 2006, Snap-on established individual,
unfunded bookkeeping accounts equal to the actuarial present value of the
capped per-retiree annual cost for certain U.S. individuals retiring after
1988. Retirees are able to self-direct the spending of their account and may
consume, for qualifying medical expenses, the account balance at their
discretion. With the expected reduction in these individual accounts,
liabilities and expense in future years are expected to decline. This plan
change was recognized as a negative plan amendment that reduced the December 30,
2005, benefit obligation by approximately $2.0 million. The $2.0 million
benefit obligation reduction is being amortized to income over five years.

Snap-on
recognizes postretirement health care expense in accordance with SFAS No. 106,
“

Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other than Pensions

.”


The
status of Snap-on’s U.S. postretirement health care plans is as follows:

Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consist of:

The amounts included in
AOCI on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows:


The components of net periodic benefit cost and other amounts
recognized in OCI are as follows:

Snap-on
expects to recognize $1.0 million of unrecognized gain included in AOCI as of December 29,
2007, in net periodic benefit cost in 2008.

The weighted-average discount rates used to determine Snap-on’s
postretirement health care expense are as follows:

The
actuarial calculation assumes a health care cost trend rate of 9.0% in 2008,
decreasing gradually to 6.0% in 2011 and thereafter. As of December 29,
2007, a one-percentage-point increase in the health care cost trend rate for
future years would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation
by $1.9 million and the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost
components by $0.1 million. Conversely, a one-percentage-point decrease in the
health care cost trend rate for future years would decrease the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation by $0.9 million and the aggregate of the
service cost and interest cost components by $0.1 million.

The
following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are expected
to be paid as follows:


Note 13: Stock-based Compensation and Other Stock
Plans

The
2001 Incentive Stock and Awards Plan, as Amended (“2001 Plan”), which was
approved by shareholders in 2001 and amended and approved by shareholders in
2006, provides for the grant of stock options, performance share awards and
restricted stock awards. As of December 29, 2007, the 2001 Plan had 3,427,179
shares available for future grants; the company uses treasury stock to deliver
shares under these plans.

Effective
January 1, 2006, the company adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the
modified prospective method. SFAS No. 123(R) requires entities to
recognize the cost of employee services in exchange for awards of equity
instruments based on the grant-date fair value of those awards (with limited
exceptions). That cost, based on the estimated number of awards that are
expected to vest, is recognized over the period during which the employee is
required to provide the service in exchange for the award. No compensation cost
is recognized for awards for which the employees do not render the requisite
service. Upon adoption, the grant-date fair value of employee share options and
similar instruments was estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Due
to the prospective adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), results for prior periods
have not been restated.

The
compensation cost charged against income for the 2001 Plan was $19.0 million in
2007 and $16.6 million in 2006. The company recorded $5.5 million of expense
related to stock appreciation rights, performance share awards and restricted
stock awards that were valued using the intrinsic method under Accounting
Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “

Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees

,” and related interpretations for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2005. Cash received from option exercises
under all share-based payment arrangements was $39.2 million in 2007, $89.5
million in 2006 and $31.1 million in 2005. The tax benefit realized from the
exercise of the share-based payment arrangements was $7.1 million in 2007, $11.4
million in 2006 and $3.1 million in 2005.

Stock Options

Stock options are granted
with an exercise price equal to the market value of a share of common stock on
the date of grant and have a contractual term of ten years. Grants made prior
to 2007 vest in two annual increments beginning on the first anniversary
following the grant date of the award. Beginning in 2007, all stock option
grants vest over a three-year period, beginning on the first anniversary
following the grant date of the award, with the exception of the 2007 grant to
the company’s former Chief Executive Officer, which vested upon his retirement
on December 18, 2007.

The
fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes valuation model. The company uses historical data regarding
stock option exercise behaviors for different participating groups to estimate
the expected term of options granted (based on the period of time that options
granted are expected to be outstanding). Expected volatility is based on the
historical volatility of the company’s stock for the length of time
corresponding to the expected term of the option. The expected dividend yield
is based on the company’s historical dividend payments. The risk-free interest
rate is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve on the grant date for the
expected term of the option. The following weighted-average assumptions were
used in calculating the fair value of stock options granted during 2007, 2006
and 2005, using the Black-Scholes valuation model:


A summary of stock option activity as of December 29,
2007, is presented below:

* Weighted-average

The weighted-average grant date fair
value of options granted was $12.17 in 2007, $10.16 in 2006, and $8.70 in 2005.
The intrinsic value of options exercised was $19.3 million in 2007, $29.7
million in 2006, and $8.5 million in 2005. The fair value of stock options
vested was $4.2 million in 2007, $3.5 million in 2006, and $3.7 million in 2005.

As of December 29, 2007, there was
approximately $4.4 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to
non-vested stock option compensation arrangements granted under the 2001 Plan
that is expected to be recognized as a charge to earnings over a
weighted-average period of 1.7 years.

Performance Awards

Performance
awards granted in 2007 under the 2001 Plan are earned over a contractual term
of three years. Vesting of the performance awards will be dependent upon
performance relative to pre-defined goals for revenue growth and return on
assets for the years 2007 through 2009. Based on Snap-on’s performance relative
to these goals, the recipient can earn up to 100% of the performance awards. For
performance achieved above a certain level, the recipient may earn additional
cash awards not to exceed 50% of the number of performance awards initially granted.
Cash awards related to the 2007 performance shares represent the right to
receive cash of $50.22 per unit, which was the fair market value of the
performance awards at the date of grant.

Performance
awards granted in 2006 under the 2001 Plan are earned over a contractual term
of three years. Vesting of the performance awards will be dependent upon
performance relative to pre-defined goals for revenue growth and return on
assets for the years 2006 through 2008. Based on Snap-on’s performance relative
to these goals, the recipient can earn up to 100% of the performance awards. For
performance achieved above a certain level, the recipient may earn additional cash
awards not to exceed 50% of the number of performance awards initially granted.
Cash awards related to the 2006 performance shares represent the right to
receive cash of $39.35 per unit, which was the fair market value of the
performance awards at the date of grant.

Performance
awards granted in 2005 under the 2001 Plan vested as of December 29, 2007.
Vesting of the awards was dependent upon performance relative to pre-defined
goals for revenue growth and return on assets for the years 2005 through 2007. Based
on Snap-on’s performance relative to these goals, the recipient earned 100% of
the performance awards with an equal number of cash units that represented the
right to receive cash of $31.73 per unit, which was the stock price on the date
of grant. In addition, as performance was achieved above targeted levels, the
recipients earned additional cash units equal to approximately 68% of the cash
match.

The
fair value of each performance award is estimated on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes valuation model. The company uses the vesting period of the
performance awards as the expected term of performance awards granted. Expected
volatility is based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock for the
length of time corresponding to the expected term of the performance award. The
risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve on the grant
date for the length of time corresponding to the expected term of the
performance award. The following weighted-average assumptions were used in
calculating the fair value of performance awards granted during the last three
years using the Black-Scholes valuation model.


The weighted-average grant date fair
value of performance awards granted during 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $50.22, $35.74
and $28.69, respectively. Performance share awards vest only at the end of the
performance-award period. Vested performance share awards totaled 0.1 million
shares as of both December 29, 2007, and December 31, 2005; no
performance share awards vested during 2006. A summary of the status of the
company’s non-vested performance share awards as of December 29, 2007, and
changes during 2007, are as follows:

* Weighted-average fair value at date of grant

As of December 29,


, there was approximately $11.1 million of unrecognized compensation
cost related to non-vested performance share awards granted under the 2001 Plan
that is expected to be recognized as a charge to earnings over a weighted-average
period of 1.7 years.

Stock Appreciation

Rights

(“SARs”)

The company also issues SARs to certain key
non-U.S. employees. SARs are granted with an exercise price equal to the market
value of a share of Snap-on’s common stock on the date of grant and have a
contractual term of ten years and, for SARs granted prior to 2007, vest in two
annual increments beginning on the first anniversary following the grant date
of the award. SARs granted in 2007 vest over a three-year period beginning on
the first anniversary following the grant date of the award. SARs provide for
the cash payment of the excess of the fair market value of Snap-on’s common

stock

price on the date of exercise over the grant price. SARs have no effect
on dilutive shares or shares outstanding as any appreciation of Snap-on’s
common stock value over the grant price is paid in cash and not in common
stock.

The
fair value of each SAR is remeasured each reporting period using the
Black-Scholes valuation model. The company uses historical data regarding SARs
exercise behaviors for different participating groups to estimate the expected
term of the SARs granted based on the period of time that similar instruments
granted are expected to be outstanding. Expected volatility is based on the
historical volatility of the company’s stock for the length of time corresponding
to the expected term of the SARs. The expected dividend yield is based on the
company’s historical dividend payments. The risk-free interest rate is based on
the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect on the reporting date for the length of
time corresponding to the expected term of the SARs. The following
weighted-average assumptions were used in calculating the fair value of SARs
granted during 2007 and 2006, using the Black-Scholes valuation model.


The total intrinsic value of SARs exercised during both 2007 and 2006
was $1.8 million. The total fair value of SARs vested during 2007 and 2006 was
$1.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively. A summary of the status of the
company’s non-vested SARs as of December 29, 2007, and changes during 2007,
are as follows:

* Weighted-average

As
of December 29, 2007, there is approximately $0.8 million of unrecognized
compensation cost related to non-vested SARs granted under the 2001 Plan that is
expected to be recognized as a charge to earnings over a weighted-average
period of 1.8 years.

Restricted Stock Awards

The
company granted awards of 17,868 shares of restricted stock to the members of
the Board of Directors (“Board”) during the fiscal year ended December 29,
2007. All restrictions will lapse upon the recipient’s retirement from the
Board, death or a change in control.

Directors’ Fee Plan:

Under the
Directors’ Fee Plan, non-employee directors may elect up to 100% of their fees
and retainer in shares of Snap-on’s common stock. Directors may elect to defer
receipt of all or part of these shares. Issuances under the Directors’ Fee Plan
totaled 2,968 shares in 2007, 2,999 shares in 2006 and 7,289 shares in 2005. Additionally,
receipt of 5,147 shares, 4,101 shares and 3,923 shares was deferred in 2007, 2006
and 2005, respectively. At December 29, 2007, shares reserved for issuance
to directors under this plan totaled 169,535 shares.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan:

Employees
of Snap-on are eligible to participate in an employee stock purchase plan. The
employee purchase price of the common stock is the lesser of the mean of the
high and low price of the stock on the beginning date (May 15) or ending
date (the following May 14) of each plan year. For 2007, 2006 and 2005, issuances
under the employee stock ownership plan totaled 49,327 shares, 35,227 shares
and 30,876 shares, respectively. At December 29, 2007, shares reserved for
issuance to employees under this plan totaled 302,344 shares and Snap-on held
contributions of approximately $0.7 million for the purchase of common stock by
employees. Employees are able to withdraw from the plan and receive all
contributions made during the plan year. Compensation expense for plan
participants in 2007, 2006 and 2005 was not material.

Dealer Stock Purchase Plan:

Franchisees
are eligible to participate in a dealer stock purchase plan. The franchisee
purchase price of the common stock is the lesser of the mean of the high and
low price of the stock on the beginning date (May 15) or ending date (the
following May 14) of each plan year. For 2007, 2006 and 2005, issuances under
the dealer stock purchase plan totaled 43,009 shares, 48,444 shares and 43,911
shares, respectively. At December 29, 2007, shares reserved for issuance
to franchisees under this plan totaled 229,966 shares and Snap-on held
franchisee contributions of approximately $1.0 million for the purchase of
common stock by franchisees. Franchisees are able to withdraw from the plan and
receive all contributions made during the plan year. Expense for plan
participants in 2007, 2006 and 2005 was not material.

Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan:

Under this
plan, participating shareholders may invest the cash dividends from all or a
portion of their common stock to buy additional shares. The program also
permits new investors and current shareholders to make additional
contributions. For 2007, 2006 and 2005, issuances under the dividend
reinvestment and stock purchase plan totaled 21,730 shares, 25,279 shares and
30,941 shares, respectively. At December 29, 2007, shares available for
purchase under this plan totaled 1,586,852 shares.


Fair Value Disclosures – Prior to
Adoption of SFAS No. 123(R)

Prior to January 1, 2006, the
company accounted for its share-based instruments under the recognition and
measurement provisions of APB No. 25 and related interpretations. No
stock-based employee compensation costs related to stock options were
recognized prior to 2006. The following table illustrates the effect on net
earnings and earnings per share for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2005, as if Snap-on had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123
to stock-based employee compensation using the Black-Scholes valuation model:

Note 14: Capital Stock

Snap-on
has undertaken repurchases of Snap-on common stock from time to time to offset
dilution created by shares issued for employee and dealer stock purchase plans,
stock options, and other corporate purposes, as well as to repurchase shares
when market conditions are favorable. Snap-on repurchased 1,860,000 shares in
2007, following the repurchase of 2,616,618 shares in 2006 and 912,100 shares
in 2005. As of the end of 2007, Snap-on has remaining availability to
repurchase up to an additional $116.8

million
in common stock pursuant to the Board’s authorizations. The purchase of Snap-on
common stock is at the company’s discretion, subject to prevailing financial
and market conditions. In 2007, Snap-on’s average common stock repurchase price
was approximately $50.77 per share.

In
August 1997, the Board issued a dividend of one preferred stock purchase
right for each share of Snap-on’s outstanding common stock. The rights were exercisable
only if a person or group acquired 15% or more of Snap-on’s common stock (“Acquiring
Person”) or publicly announced a tender offer to become an Acquiring Person.
Each right could then be exercised by a shareholder, other than an acquiring
person, to purchase shares of Snap-on common stock, or a surviving corporation,
on advantageous terms. The rights expired on November 3, 2007.

Snap-on
created a Grantor Stock Trust (“GST”) in 1998 and sold 7.1 million shares of
treasury stock to the GST. The sale of these shares had no impact on
shareholders’ equity or on Snap-on’s Consolidated Statements of Earnings. As of
fiscal 2006 year end, the GST held 407,485 shares of common stock. In fiscal
2007, the GST distributed all remaining shares of common stock; no shares
remained in the GST as of December 29, 2007.

The
GST served as a funding mechanism for certain benefit programs and compensation
arrangements, including the 2001 Plan and employee and dealer stock purchase
plans. The GST is disclosed as “Grantor Stock Trust at fair market value” on
the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Shares owned by the GST were
accounted for as a reduction to shareholders’ equity until used in connection
with employee benefits. Each period, the shares owned by the GST were valued at
the closing market price, with corresponding changes in the GST balance
reflected in additional paid-in capital.


Note 15:
Commitments and Contingencies

Snap-on leases facilities and office equipment under non-cancelable
operating and capital leases that extend for varying amounts of time. Snap-on’s
future minimum lease commitments under these leases, net of sub-lease rental
income, are as follows:

Rent expense, net of sub-lease rental income, for worldwide facilities
and office equipment was $32.1 million, $26.8 million and $29.7 million in 2007,
2006 and 2005, respectively.

Snap-on has a multi-year, $4.5

million

purchase commitment with one of its suppliers.

Snap-on
has credit risk exposure for certain SOC-originated contracts with recourse
provisions against Snap-on (primarily for franchisee van loans). At December 29,
2007, and December 30, 2006, $16.1 million and $16.2 million of loans,
with terms ranging from six months to ten years, have a primary recourse
provision to Snap-on if the loans become more than 90 days past due. The asset
value of the collateral underlying these recourse loans would serve to mitigate
Snap-on’s loss in the event of default. The estimated fair value of the
guarantees for all loan originations with recourse as of December 29, 2007,
was not material.

Snap-on
provides product warranties for specific product lines and accrues for estimated
future warranty cost in the period in which the sale is recorded. Snap-on
calculates its accrual requirements based on historic warranty loss experience
that is periodically adjusted for recent actual experience, including the
timing of claims during the warranty period and actual costs incurred. The
following summarizes Snap-on’s product warranty accrual activity for 2007 and
2006:

On May 16, 2006, Snap-on reached an agreement to settle certain
legal matters related to certain then current and former franchisees on a class
basis. The court gave its final approval to the class settlement on October 27,
2006. Under the terms of the settlement, Snap-on agreed to make payments to
claimants and class counsel, plus incur certain other costs and expenses. Snap-on
recorded a $38.0 million pretax charge in 2006 representing its best estimate
to settle these legal matters. The majority of the settlement funds, including
payments to the class participants made in the first quarter of 2007, have been
disbursed. Snap-on has not admitted any wrongdoing by way of this settlement.

Snap-on is involved in various other legal matters that are being
litigated and/or settled in the ordinary course of business. Although it is not
possible to predict the outcome of these legal matters, management believes
that the results will not have a material impact on Snap-on’s consolidated
financial position or results of operations.


Note 16: Discontinued Operations

On June 29, 2007, Snap-on sold its Sun Electric Systems
(“SES”) business based in the Netherlands to Duinmaaijer B.V., a limited
liability company represented by an employee of SES, for a nominal cash
purchase price.   SES’s primary business is the research,
development and manufacture of test equipment in Europe for aircraft
hydraulics.  Snap-on divested of SES as it deemed SES to be non-core to
Snap-on’s ongoing business strategies.  The anticipated future capital and
other resources necessary to be expended in connection with the SES business
were not consistent with Snap-on’s growth plans. Certain prior year amounts were
reclassified on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings to reflect
the sale of SES as “Discontinued operations, net of tax.”

The company recorded an after-tax loss of $8.0 million, or $0.14 per
diluted share, in 2007 related to the sale and results of operations of
SES.  For segment reporting purposes, the results of operations of SES
were previously included in the Diagnostics & Information Group.

Note 17: Other Income (Expense)

“Other income (expense) –
net” on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings consists of the
following:

Note 18: Segments

Snap-on’s business
segments are based on the organization structure used by management for making
operating and investment decisions and for assessing performance. Snap-on’s
reportable business segments include: (i) the Commercial &
Industrial Group; (ii) the Snap-on Tools Group; (iii) the Diagnostics &
Information Group; and (iv) Financial Services. The Commercial &
Industrial Group consists of the business operations providing tools and
equipment products and equipment repair services to a broad range of industrial
and commercial customers worldwide through direct, distributor and other non-franchise
distribution channels. The Snap-on Tools Group consists of the business
operations serving the worldwide franchise van channel. The Diagnostics &
Information Group consists of the business operations providing diagnostics
equipment, vehicle service information, business management systems, electronic
parts catalogs, and other solutions for vehicle service to customers in the
worldwide vehicle service and repair marketplace. Financial Services consists
of the business operations of SOC and Snap-on’s wholly owned finance
subsidiaries in those international markets where Snap-on has franchise
operations.

Snap-on evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on
segment revenues and operating earnings. For the Commercial &
Industrial, Snap-on Tools, and Diagnostics & Information Groups,
segment net sales include both external and intersegment net sales. Snap-on
accounts for intersegment sales and transfers based primarily on standard costs
with reasonable mark-ups established between the segments. Identifiable assets
by segment are those assets used in the respective reportable segment’s
operations. Intersegment amounts are eliminated to arrive at consolidated
financial results.


Neither Snap-on nor any
of its segments, except Financial Services, depend on any single customer,
small group of customers or government for more than 10% of its revenues. As a
result of SOC’s relationship with CIT, Snap-on’s Financial Services business
segment depends on CIT for more than 10% of its revenues.

Financial data by segment:

* Includes $38.0 million pretax litigation
settlement charge.


Financial data by segment (continued):

Geographic regions:

*

Revenue is attributed to countries based on the
  origin of the sale.

**

Long-lived assets consist of Property and
  equipment-net, Goodwill and Other intangibles-net.

Products and services:

Snap-on
derives net sales from a broad line of products and complementary services that
are grouped into three categories: (i) tools; (ii) diagnostics and
repair information; and (iii) equipment. The tools category includes Snap-on’s
hand tools, power tools, tool storage units, saws, and cutting and pruning
tools product offerings. The diagnostics and repair information category includes
handheld and PC-based diagnostics products, service and repair information
products, diagnostic software solutions, including electronic parts catalogs,
business management and other


solutions to help dealerships manage and track performance. The
equipment category includes solutions for the diagnosis and service of
automotive and industrial equipment. Snap-on also derives revenue from
financing its products through SOC and through its wholly owned finance
subsidiaries. Snap-on utilizes various financing programs to facilitate the
