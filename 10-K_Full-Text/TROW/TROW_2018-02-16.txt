PART I

Item 1.

Business.

GENERAL.

T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. is a financial services holding company that provides global investment management services through its subsidiaries to investors worldwide. We provide an array of

T. Rowe Price U.S. mutual funds

(Price Funds),

other T. Rowe Price investment products

, subadvisory services, separate account management, recordkeeping, and related services to individuals, advisors, institutions, financial intermediaries, and retirement plan sponsors. We are focused on delivering global investment management excellence to help clients around the world achieve their long-term investment goals.

The late Thomas Rowe Price, Jr., founded our firm in 1937, and the common stock of T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. was first offered to the public in 1986. The T. Rowe Price Group corporate holding company structure was established in 2000.

We derive the vast majority of our consolidated net revenue and net income from investment advisory services provided by our subsidiaries, primarily T. Rowe Price Associates and T. Rowe Price International Ltd. Our revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management. Accordingly, fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management impact our revenues and results of operations. At

December 31, 2017

, we had

$991.1 billion

in assets under management, including

$606.3 billion

in the

T. Rowe Price U.S. mutual funds

and

$384.8 billion

in

other investment products

.


FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS.

U.S. stocks posted excellent returns in


. In fact, it was the ninth consecutive year of positive total returns for the S&P 500 Index. Most major stock indexes finished the year near record highs amid expectations that the new U.S. tax law would lift corporate profits and add to U.S. economic growth in 2018. The S&P 500 Index and the NASDAQ Composite Index, which is heavily weighted in technology companies, returned

21.8%

and

28.2%

, respectively, in


. Developed non-U.S. equity markets outperformed the broad U.S. market in


, as a weaker dollar enhanced returns to U.S. investors. Global bond returns were mostly positive in


.

The table below presents financial results on a U.S. GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis that adjusts for the impact of the Dell appraisal rights matter, the consolidated T. Rowe Price investment products, the supplemental savings plan, other non-operating income, and the non-recurring charge recognized in 2017 related to the enactment of U.S. tax reform. We believe the non-GAAP financial measures below provide relevant and meaningful information to investors about our core operating results.

See the reconciliation to the comparable U.S. GAAP measures at the end of the Results of Operations sections of Part II, Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

.

In 2016, we paid our clients $166.2 million to compensate them for the denial of their appraisal rights in connection with the 2013 leveraged buyout of Dell. We made claims with our insurance carriers and, on December 30, 2016

,

entered into an agreement with our primary insurance carrier to recover $100 million from the claim. The insurance proceeds were recognized as an offset to the related $166.2 million charge in 2016. In 2017, we received $50 million in additional recoveries from our insurance carriers and recognized a related reduction in operating expenses. In 2017, we recognized a non-recurring charge of

$71.1 million

to reflect the estimated effect of the U.S. tax law changes enacted on December 22, 2017, in a comprehensive tax reform bill originally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Reform"). The recognized charge was based on current interpretation of the tax law changes, and includes

$18.9 million

for the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and a

$52.2 million

tax liability for the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign sourced net earnings.

Assets Under Management.

Assets under management ended


at

$991.1 billion

, an

increase

of

$180.3 billion

from the end of


. During 2017, investors entrusted net inflows of

$14.0 billion

to our management and market appreciation and income, net of distributions not reinvested, added

$166.3 billion

. In


, our net cash flows include

$7.1 billion

in our

target date retirement products

, which provide shareholders with a single, diversified portfolio that invests in underlying

T. Rowe Price U.S. mutual funds

or collective investment trusts. The assets under management in these

products

totaled

$232.1 billion

at

December 31, 2017

, or

23.4%

of our managed assets at

December 31, 2017

, compared with

23.3%

at the end of


.

Capital Resources.

At

December 31, 2017

, we remain debt-free with ample liquidity, including cash and discretionary investments in T. Rowe Price products of

$2.7 billion

. We also have seed capital investments in

T. Rowe Price investment products

of

$1.2 billion

that are redeemable, although we generally expect to be invested for several years until unrelated third-party investors substantially reduce our relative ownership percentage. We paid

$2.28

per share in regular dividends in


, an increase of

5.6%

over the

$2.16

per share in regular dividends paid in


. Additionally, we expended

$458.1 million

to repurchase

6.6 million

shares, or

2.7%

, of our outstanding common stock in


. We invested

$186.1 million

during the year in capitalized technology and facilities.  These cash expenditures were made from existing cash balances.

Additional information concerning our assets under management, results of operations, and financial condition, during the past three years is contained in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7, as well as our consolidated financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

STRATEGIC INITIATIVES.

Our core capabilities have enabled us to deliver excellent operating results since our IPO in 1986. We maintain a client-centric culture that is focused on delivering excellent long-term investment performance and world-class service to our clients. We have distributed our broad array of active investment strategies through a diverse set of distribution channels to meet the needs of our clients. Our ongoing financial strength has allowed us to take advantage of attractive growth opportunities, invest in key capabilities, including investment professionals, technologies, and new product offerings; and, most importantly, provide our clients with strong investment management expertise and service.

The market in which we operate has been evolving quickly and a number of headwinds have arisen over the last few years, including a shifting demand from equities to income-oriented solutions as the population ages, demand for new vehicles to meet client needs, an accelerating regulatory landscape, and passive and alternative investments taking market share from active strategies.

Despite the headwinds, we believe there are significant opportunities that align to our core capabilities. As such, we are responding with several multi-year initiatives that are designed to strengthen our long-term competitive position and can be categorized into three areas: broadening our product offerings and vehicles; strengthening and deepening distribution across all channels; and strengthening our technology platform and digital capabilities. We have seen early, encouraging signs of success in the execution of these strategic imperatives.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES.

Distribution Channels.

We distribute our products in countries located within three broad geographical regions: North America, Europe Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and Asia Pacific (APAC). We accumulate our assets under management from a diversified client base across five primary distribution channels: U.S. financial intermediaries; EMEA and APAC financial intermediaries; individual U.S. investors on a direct basis; U.S. retirement plan sponsors for which we provide recordkeeping services; and institutional investors globally. Investors domiciled outside the U.S. represent nearly

6%

of total assets under management at the end of


. We service clients in


countries around the world. The following table outlines the types of products within each distribution channel through which our assets under management as of

December 31, 2017

, are sourced.

Investment Capabilities.

We manage a broad range of investment strategies in equity, fixed income, and asset allocation across sectors, styles and regions. Our strategies are designed to meet the varied and changing needs and objectives of investors and are delivered across a range of vehicles. For the Price Funds, investors select the fund based on the distinct objective that is described in each fund’s prospectus and can exchange balances among the funds as permitted when economic and market conditions or their investment needs change. The investment objectives and investment management approaches employed in our

other investment products

are similar to those in the Price Funds. We also offer specialized advisory services, including management of stable value investment contracts, modeled asset allocation solutions, and a distribution management service for the disposition of equity securities our clients receive from third-party venture capital investment pools.

Page



The following table sets forth our broad investment capabilities as of

December 31, 2017

.

We employ fundamental and quantitative security analysis in the performance of the investment advisory function through substantial internal equity and fixed income investment research capabilities. We perform original industry and company research using such sources as inspection of corporate activities, management interviews, company-published financial and other information, and field checks with suppliers and competitors in the same industry and particular business sector.

Our research staff operates primarily from offices located in the U.S. and England with additional staff based in Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore and Switzerland. We also use research provided by brokerage firms and security analysts in a supportive capacity and information received from private economists, political observers, commentators, government experts, and market analysts. Our securities selection process for some investment portfolios is based on quantitative analysis using computerized data modeling.

From time to time, we introduce new strategies, investment vehicles and other

products

to complement and expand our investment offerings, respond to competitive developments in the financial marketplace, and meet the changing needs of our investment advisory clients. We will introduce a new investment strategy if we believe that we have the appropriate investment management expertise and that its objective will be useful to investors over a long period.

We typically provide seed capital for new investment

products

to enable the portfolio manager to begin building an investment performance history in advance of the portfolio receiving sustainable client assets. The length of time we hold our seed capital investment will vary for each new investment

product

as it is highly dependent on how long it takes to generate cash flows into the

product

from unrelated investors. We attempt to ensure that the new investment

product

has a sustainable level of assets from unrelated shareholders before we consider redemption of our seed capital investment in order to not negatively impact the new investment

product

's net asset value or its investment performance record. At

December 31, 2017

, we had seed capital investments of

$1.2 billion

in our products.

Page



Conversely, we may also close or limit new investments across all

T. Rowe Price investment products

in order to maintain the integrity of the investment strategy and to protect the interests of its existing shareholders and investors. At present, the following strategies are generally closed to new investors:

Assets under Management.

The following table shows our assets under management (in billions), by distribution channel, vehicle, account type, and asset class:

Non-U.S. dollar denominated securities held in client accounts are

$135.7 billion

, of our total assets under management at

December 31, 2017

and

$95.4 billion

, or

11.8%

at

December 31, 2016

.

Investment Advisory Fees.

We provide investment advisory services through our subsidiaries to the Price Funds; clients on a separately managed or subadvised account basis; and

other T. Rowe Price products

, including collective investment trusts, target date retirement trusts, funds offered to investors outside the U.S., and portfolios offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the U.S.

-accounted for approximately

36%

of our investment advisory revenues in


, and approximately

29%

of our assets under management at

December 31, 2017

. Our largest client account relationship, apart from the Price Funds, is with a third-party financial intermediary that accounted for about

6%

of our investment advisory revenues in


.

Price Funds.

At

December 31, 2017

, assets under our management in the Price Funds aggregated

$606.3 billion

, an increase of

17.9%

or

$92.1 billion

from the beginning of the year. Investment advisory services are provided to each U.S. mutual fund under individual investment management agreements that grant the fund the right to use the T. Rowe Price name. The Boards of the respective funds, including a majority of directors who are not interested persons of the funds or of T. Rowe Price Group (as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940), must approve the investment management agreements annually. Fund shareholders must approve material changes to these investment management agreements. Each agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment (as defined in the Investment Company Act) and, generally, either party may terminate the agreement without penalty after a 60-day notice. The termination of one or more of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Independent directors and trustees of the Price Funds regularly review our fee structures.

The advisory fee paid monthly by each of the Price Funds is computed on a daily basis by multiplying a fund’s net assets by its effective fee rate. For the majority of the Price Funds, the fee rate is equal to the sum of a tiered group fee rate plus an individual fund rate. The tiered group rate is based on the combined net assets of nearly all of the Price Funds. If the combined net assets of these Price Funds exceed

$650 billion

, the weighted-average fee across pricing tiers is

28.6 basis points

for the first

$650 billion

of net assets plus

26.5 basis points

for net assets in excess of

$650 billion

. To the extent that the combined net assets of the funds included in the group rate calculation increase, the group charge component of a fund's advisory fee rate and the resulting advisory fee rate paid by each fund will decrease.

The individual fund rates are generally flat rates that are set based on the fund’s specific investment objective. Several funds including; the Blue Chip Growth, Equity Income, Growth Stock, and Mid-Cap Growth funds, have an effective tiered individual fund rate in which their base individual flat rate is reduced by about 15% on net assets in excess of $15 billion. The New Income and Value funds have their base individual flat rate reduced by about 15% on net assets in excess of $20 billion. The Capital Appreciation Fund has its base individual flat rate reduced by 10% on net assets in excess of $27.5 billion. The effective fee rates for each of the stock and bond funds on which we earned annual advisory fees of approximately

$6.0 million

or greater in


, varied from a low of


basis points for the Limited Duration Inflation Focused Bond fund to a high of


basis points for the Emerging Markets Stock and International Discovery funds.

The fee rate of several of the Price Funds, including the Index and Summit funds as well as specific funds offered solely to institutional investors, does not include a group fee component but rather an individual fund fee or an all-inclusive fee. An all-inclusive fee covers both the investment management fee and ordinary operating expenses incurred by the fund and, as a result, our management fee varies with the level of operating expenses a fund incurs. Each of the funds in the Spectrum Funds series and in the target date retirement funds series that we offer invests in a diversified portfolio of other Price Funds and has no separate investment advisory fee; rather, they indirectly bear the expenses of the funds in which they invest.

Each Price fund typically bears all expenses associated with its operation and the issuance and redemption of its securities. In particular, each fund pays investment advisory fees; shareholder servicing fees and expenses; fund accounting fees and expenses; transfer and sub-transfer agent fees; custodian fees and expenses; legal and auditing fees; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and shareholder reports to existing shareholders; registration fees and expenses; proxy and annual meeting expenses; and independent trustee or director fees and expenses.

Page



We usually provide that a newly organized fund’s expenses will not exceed a specified percentage of its net assets during an initial operating period. Generally, during the earlier portion of the period, we will waive advisory fees and absorb other fund expenses, such as those described above, in excess of these self-imposed limits. During the latter portion of the period, we may recover some or all of the waived fees and absorbed costs, but such recovery is not assured.

During 2015 and 2016, we voluntarily waived $47.6 million and $10.5 million, respectively, in money market related fees, including advisory fees and fund expenses in order to maintain a positive yield for investors. In 2017, money market waivers were negligible.

Other investment products

.

Our other investment

products

had assets under management of

$384.8 billion

at

December 31, 2017

, an increase of

$88.2 billion

from the beginning of the year. We charge fees for investment management to these clients based on, among other things, the specific investment services to be provided. Our standard form of investment advisory agreement with other T. Rowe Price products, that pay management fee on a daily basis, normally provides for termination with thirty day notice. Our standard separately managed account agreements provide for termination at any time and the refunding of any unearned fees paid in advance. Our standard subadvised client account agreement typically provides for termination with sixty days notice.

Our subsidiaries, T. Rowe Price (Luxembourg) Management Sàrl and T. Rowe Price International, provide management company and investment management services, respectively, to our Luxembourg-based SICAVs and FCPs and AUTs. T. Rowe Price (Luxembourg) Management Sàrl and T. Rowe Price International, provide authorized corporate depositor and investment management services, respectively, to our UK-based OEICs. Our subsidiaries, T. Rowe Price Associates and T.Rowe Price Hong Kong may also provide subadvised investment management services to these global investment

products

. We distribute these

products

outside the U.S. through distribution agents and other financial intermediaries. The fees we earn for distributing and marketing these products are part of our overall investment management fees for managing the

product

assets. We currently recognize any related distribution fees paid to these financial intermediaries in other operating expenses.

In addition to providing investment management services to the Price Funds, our subsidiaries, T. Rowe Price Associates and T. Rowe Price International, offer separately managed institutional investment management and subadvised investment management services to global intermediaries. Our subsidiary, T. Rowe Price Trust Company, offers and provides investment management services to our T. Rowe Price collective investment trusts, which are used in the investment portfolios of certain qualified U.S. retirement plans.

Our fees for managing these

other investment products

are computed using the value of assets under our management at a contracted annual fee rate. The value of assets under management billed is generally based on daily valuations, end of billing period valuations, or month-end average valuations. In


, approximately

76%

of our advisory fees were recognized based on daily portfolio valuations,

15%

were based on end of billing period valuations, and

9%

were based on month-end averages.

ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES.

We also provide certain administrative services as ancillary services to our investment advisory clients. These administrative services are provided by several of our subsidiaries and include mutual fund transfer agent, accounting, distribution, and shareholder services; participant recordkeeping and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans investing in

T. Rowe Price U.S. mutual funds

; recordkeeping services for defined contribution retirement plans investing in mutual funds outside the T. Rowe Price complex; brokerage; and trust services.

Our subsidiaries provide administrative services to the Price Funds and their shareholders. T. Rowe Price Services provides mutual fund transfer agency and shareholder services, including the staff, facilities, technology, and other equipment to respond to inquiries from fund shareholders. The Price Funds contract directly with BNY Mellon to provide mutual fund accounting services, including maintenance of financial records, preparation of financial statements and reports, daily valuation of portfolio securities, and computation of daily net asset values per share to the Price Funds.

T. Rowe Price Retirement Plan Services provides participant accounting and plan administration for defined contribution retirement plans that invest in the Price Funds, the T. Rowe Price collective investment trusts, and funds outside the T. Rowe Price complex. T. Rowe Price Retirement Plan Services also provides transfer agent services to the Price Funds. Plan sponsors and participants compensate us for some of the administrative services while the Price Funds and outside fund families compensate us for maintaining and administering the individual participant accounts for those plans that invest in the respective funds. As of

December 31, 2017

, we provided recordkeeping services for

$177 billion

in assets under administration, of which

$111 billion

are assets we manage.

Page



T. Rowe Price Trust Company provides administrative trustee services. Through this entity, which is a Maryland-chartered limited service trust company, we serve as trustee for employer sponsored retirement plans and other retirement products.

T. Rowe Price Trust Company may not accept deposits and cannot make personal or commercial loans.

We also provide non-discretionary advisory planning services to fund shareholders and potential investors through our subsidiary T. Rowe Price Advisory Services. These services are limited in scope and include retirement planning services, such as saving for retirement, transitioning into retirement, and income in retirement. An investment portfolio evaluation service is an integral part of these services. An ongoing checkup service is also available to assist an investor in staying on track to achieve their financial goals.

DISTRIBUTION AND SERVICING.

The Investor Class of all Price Funds can be purchased in the U.S. on a no-load basis, without a sales commission or 12b-1 fee. No-load mutual fund shares offer investors a low-cost and relatively easy method of directly investing in a variety of stock and fixed income

products

. The I Class of certain Price Funds is designed to meet the needs of institutionally oriented clients who seek investment products with lower shareholder servicing costs and lower expense ratios. This share class limits ordinary operating expenses (other than interest; expenses related to borrowings, taxes, and brokerage; and any non-extraordinary expenses) at 5 basis points for a period of time and there are no external payments for 12b-1 or administrative fee payments.

Certain of the Price Funds also offer Advisor Class and R Class shares that are distributed to investors and defined contribution retirement plans, respectively. These share classes pay 12b-1 fees of 25 and 50 basis points, respectively, for distribution, administration, and personal services. Our subsidiary, T. Rowe Price Investment Services (TRPIS), is the principal distributor of the Price Funds and hires third-party financial intermediaries to distribute these share classes. TRPIS enters into agreements with each intermediary under which each fund is responsible to pay the distribution and service fees directly to the applicable intermediaries. In addition, those Price Funds offered to investors through variable annuity life insurance plans have a share class that pays a 12b-1 fee of 25 basis points.

In accounting for 12b-1 fees, the applicable mutual fund share classes incur the related expense and we recognize the corresponding distribution and servicing fee revenue in our consolidated statements of income. We also recognize, as distribution and servicing costs in the consolidated statements of income, the corresponding cost paid to the third-party financial intermediaries who distribute these funds' share classes. The fee revenue that we recognize from the funds and the expense that we recognize for the fees paid to third-party intermediaries are equal in amount and, therefore, do not impact our net operating income.

We believe that our lower fund cost structure, distribution methods, and fund shareholder and administrative services help promote the stability of our fund assets under management through market cycles.

Except as noted above for 12b-1 fees, we bear all advertising and promotion expenses associated with the distribution of the Price Funds. These costs are recognized currently and include advertising and direct mail communications to potential fund shareholders, as well as substantial staff and communications capabilities to respond to investor inquiries. Marketing and promotional efforts are focused in print media, television, and Internet. In addition, we direct considerable marketing efforts to defined contribution plans that invest in mutual funds. Advertising and promotion expenditures vary over time based on investor interest, market conditions, new and existing investment offerings, and the development and expansion of new marketing initiatives, including the enhancement of our digital capabilities.

REGULATION.

All aspects of our business are subject to extensive federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to benefit or protect our clients and T. Rowe Price product shareholders. They generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of our business in the event that we fail to comply with laws and regulations. Possible sanctions that may be imposed on us, in the event that we fail to comply, include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain business activities for specified periods of time, revocation of our investment adviser and other registrations, censures, and fines.

T. Rowe Price International is also regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the United Kingdom and, in certain cases, by other foreign regulators in countries in which we have a license to conduct business. The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) also regulate T. Rowe Price Hong Kong and T. Rowe Price Singapore, respectively. T. Rowe Price (Canada) is also registered with several of the provincial securities commissions in Canada. T. Rowe Price (Luxembourg) Management Sàrl, the management company of our Luxembourg-based FCP (Fonds Commun de Placement) and SICAV funds is regulated by the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF).

COMPETITION.

As a member of the financial services industry, we are subject to substantial competition in all aspects of our business. A significant number of proprietary and other sponsors’ mutual funds are sold to the public by other investment management firms, broker-dealers, mutual fund companies, banks, and insurance companies. We compete with brokerage and investment banking firms, insurance companies, banks, mutual fund companies, hedge funds, and other financial institutions and funds in all aspects of our business and in every country in which we offer our advisory services. Many of these financial institutions have substantially greater resources than we do. We compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment

products

offered, investment performance, fees and related expenses, and the scope and quality of investment advice and other client services.

In recent years, we have faced significant competition from passive oriented investment strategies. As a result, such products have taken market share from active managers. While we cannot predict how much market share these competitors will gain, we believe there will always be demand for good active management.

In order to maintain and enhance our competitive position, we may review acquisition and venture opportunities and, if appropriate, engage in discussions and negotiations that could lead to the acquisition of a new equity or other financial relationship.

December 31, 2017

Our goal is to maintain our websites as a portal through which investors can easily find or navigate to pertinent information about us and as a channel of distribution for material company information, including but not limited to:

•

our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file that material with, or furnish them to the SEC;

•

our financial statement information from our periodic SEC filings in the form of XBRL data files that may be used to facilitate computer-assisted investor analysis;

•

corporate governance information including our governance guidelines, committee charters, senior officer code of ethics and conduct, and other governance-related policies;

•

other news and announcements that we may post from time to time that investors might find useful or interesting, including our monthly assets under management disclosure; and

•

opportunities to sign up for email alerts and RSS feeds to have information pushed in real time.

Unless otherwise expressly stated, information found on our website is not part of this or any other report we file with, or furnish to, the SEC.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

An investment in our common stock involves various risks, including those mentioned below and those that are discussed from time to time in our periodic filings with the SEC. Investors should carefully consider these risks, along with the other information contained in this report, before making an investment decision regarding our common stock. There may be additional risks of which we are currently unaware, or which we currently consider immaterial. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and value of our common stock.

RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AND THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY.

Our revenues are based on the market value and composition of the assets under our management, all of which are subject to fluctuation caused by factors outside of our control.

We derive our revenues primarily from investment advisory services provided by our subsidiaries to individual and institutional investors in the

T. Rowe Price U.S. mutual funds

and

other investment products

. Our investment advisory fees typically are calculated as a percentage of the market value of the assets under our management. We generally earn higher fees on assets invested in our equity funds and equity investment portfolios than we earn on assets invested in our fixed income funds and portfolios. Among equity

products

, there is a significant variation in fees earned from index-based

products

at the low end and emerging markets

products

at the high end. Fees also vary across the fixed income

products

, though not as widely as equity

products

, with stable value

products

and money market

products

at the lower end and non-U.S. dollar denominated bond

products

at the high end. As a result, our revenues are dependent on the value and composition of the assets under our management, all of which are subject to substantial fluctuation due to many factors, including:

•

Investor Mobility. Our investors generally may withdraw their funds at any time, without advance notice and with little to no significant penalty.

•

General Market Declines. A downturn in stock or bond prices would cause the value of assets under our management to decrease, and may also cause investors to withdraw their investments, thereby further decreasing the level of assets under our management.

•

Investment Performance. If the investment performance of our managed investment portfolios is less than that of our competitors or applicable third-party benchmarks, we could lose existing and potential customers and suffer a decrease in assets under management. Institutional investors in particular consider changing investment advisers based upon poor relative investment performance. Individual investors in contrast are more likely to react to poor absolute investment performance. Prolonged periods of strong relative investment performance may result in capacity constraints within certain strategies, which in turn may negatively impact our ability to achieve strong investment results in subsequent periods.

Page



•

Investing Trends. Changes in investing trends and, in particular, investor preference for passive or alternative investment

products

, retirement savings trends, including the prevalence of defined contribution retirement plans and target date retirement

products

, may reduce interest in our

products

and may alter our mix of assets under management.

•

Interest Rate Changes. Investor interest in and the valuation of our fixed income investment funds and portfolios are affected by changes in interest rates.

•

International Exposure. Our managed investment portfolios may have significant investments in international markets that are subject to risk of loss from political or diplomatic developments, government policies, civil unrest, currency fluctuations, and changes in legislation related to foreign ownership. International markets, particularly emerging markets, which are often smaller, may not have the liquidity of established markets, may lack established regulations, and may experience significantly more volatility than established markets.

A decrease in the value of assets under our management, or an adverse change in their composition, could have a material adverse effect on our investment advisory fees and revenues. For any period in which revenues decline, net income and operating margins will likely decline by a greater proportion because certain expenses will be fixed over that finite period and may not decrease in proportion to the decrease in revenues.

The performance of our money market

products

are impacted by the interest rate environment.

Our money market

products

' performance or yield is dependent on the income earned from the underlying securities exceeding the operating costs of the

product

. When interest rates are very low, the operating costs of the

product

s will become a greater portion of its net income, thereby reducing the yield to very low levels. The interest rate environment experienced from the second half of 2009 through 2016 led us to voluntarily waive our advisory and other fees earned on our money market

product

s in order to maintain yields at or above 0% for fund investors. The actual amount of fees we waived was dependent on a number of variables including, among others, changes in the net assets held by our money market

product

s, changes in market yields, changes in the expense levels of the

product

s, and our willingness to voluntarily continue such fee waivers. These waivers reduced our advisory fee income and net income. If a similar interest rate environment was to reocur, there is no guarantee that we would voluntarily waive fees again. For further discussion of the fees we waived in 2016, and the net cash flows of our money market

product

s, please see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7, of this Form 10-K.

A significant majority of our revenues are based on contracts with the Price funds that are subject to termination without cause and on short notice.

We provide investment advisory, distribution, and other administrative services to the Price Funds under various agreements. Investment advisory services are provided to each Price Fund under individual investment management agreements. The Board of each Price Fund must annually approve the terms of the investment management and service agreements and can terminate the agreement upon 60-days' notice. If a Price Fund seeks to lower the fees that we receive or terminate its contract with us, we would experience a decline in fees earned from the Price Funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income.

We operate in an intensely competitive industry. Competitive pressures may result in a loss of customers and their assets or compel us to reduce the fees we charge to clients, thereby reducing our revenues and net income.

We are subject to competition in all aspects of our business from other financial institutions. Many of these financial institutions have substantially greater resources than we do and may offer a broader range of financial products across more markets. Some competitors operate in a different regulatory environment than we do which may give them certain competitive advantages in the investment products and portfolio structures that they offer. We compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment

products

offered, investment performance, fees and related expenses, and the scope and quality of investment advice and other client services. Some institutions have proprietary products and distribution channels that make it more difficult for us to compete with them. Most of our investment

products

are available without sales or redemption fees, which means that investors may be more willing to transfer assets to competing

products

.

The market environment in recent years has led investors to increasingly favor lower fee passive products. As a result, investment advisors that emphasize passive products have gained and may continue to gain market share from active managers like us. While we cannot predict how much market share these competitors will gain, we believe there will always be demand for good active management.

Page



If current or potential customers decide to move their assets to one of our competitors, we could face a significant decline in market share, assets under management, revenues, and net income. In the event that we decide to reduce the fees we charge for investment advisory services in response to competitive pressures, which we have done selectively in the past, revenues and operating margins could be adversely impacted.

Our success depends on our key personnel and our financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services.

Our success depends on our highly skilled personnel, including our portfolio managers, investment analysts, sales and client relationship personnel, and corporate officers, many of whom have specialized expertise and extensive experience in our industry. Strong financial services professionals are in demand, and we face significant competition for highly qualified employees. Our U.S.-based associates do not have employments contracts, while our associates outside the U.S. have employment contracts where basic employment terms are confirmed in writing. Generally our associates can terminate their employment with us at any time. We cannot assure that we will be able to retain or replace key personnel. Due to the global nature of our investment advisory business, our key personnel may have reasons to travel to regions susceptible to higher risk of civil unrest, organized crime or terrorism and we may be unable to ensure the safety of personnel traveling to these regions. We have near- and long-term succession planning processes, including programs to develop our future leaders, which are intended to address future talent needs and minimize the impact of losing key talent. However, in order to retain or replace our key personnel, we may be required to increase compensation, which would decrease net income. The loss of key personnel could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to retain and attract new employees and investors. Losses of assets from our client investors would decrease our revenues and net income, possibly materially.

Our operations are complex and a failure to perform operational processes could have an adverse effect on our reputation and decrease our revenues.

We provide investment management,

product

administration,

product

recordkeeping, and tax reporting services to our clients. In certain cases, we rely on third-party vendors in the execution and delivery of these services.  There can be no assurance that these vendors will properly perform these processes or that there will not be interruptions in services from these third parties.

Failure to properly execute or oversee these services could subject us to regulatory sanctions, fines, penalties, or litigation. In some cases, we employ quantitative models to support investment decisions and processes, including those related to risk assessment, portfolio management, and activities. Undetected errors in the design, function or underlying assumptions used in these could lead to an adverse impact to T. Rowe Price’s business and reputation.

New investment

products

we introduce could increase the risk that our existing systems may not be adequate to control the risks introduced by such new investment

products

. In addition, our information systems and technology platforms might not be able to accommodate our continued growth, and the cost of maintaining such systems might increase from its current level. Materialization of these risks could disrupt our operations or result in financial exposure, regulatory inquiry or reputational damage.

Any damage to our reputation could harm our business and lead to a loss of revenues and net income.

We have spent many years developing our reputation for integrity, strong investment performance, and superior client service. Our brand is a valuable intangible asset, but it is vulnerable to a variety of threats that can be difficult or impossible to control, and costly or even impossible to remediate. Regulatory inquiries and rumors can tarnish or substantially damage our reputation, even if those inquiries are satisfactorily addressed. Additionally, we are subject to the risk that our employees or third parties acting on our behalf may circumvent controls or act in a manner inconsistent with our policies and procedures. Real or perceived conflicts between our clients’ interests and our own, as well as any fraudulent activity or other exposure of client assets or information, may impair our reputation and subject us to litigation or regulatory action. Any damage to our brand could impede our ability to attract and retain customers and key personnel, and reduce the amount of assets under our management, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income.

Our expenses are subject to significant fluctuations that could materially decrease net income.

Our operating results are dependent on the level of our expenses, which can vary significantly for many reasons, including:

•

expenses incurred in connection with our multi-year strategic plan to strengthen our long-term competitive position;

Page



•

variations in the level of total compensation expense due to, among other things, bonuses, stock-based awards, changes in employee benefit costs due to regulatory or plan design changes, changes in our employee count and mix, competitive factors, market performance, and inflation;

•

changes in the level of our advertising and promotion expenses, including the costs of expanding investment advisory services to investors outside of the U.S. and further penetrating U.S. distribution channels;

•

expenses and capital costs incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure, such as technology assets, depreciation, amortization, and research and development;

•

changes in the costs incurred for third-party vendors that perform certain administrative and operating services;

•

a future impairment of investments recognized in our consolidated balance sheet;

•

a future impairment of goodwill that is recognized in our consolidated balance sheet;

•

unanticipated material fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our operations abroad;

•

unanticipated costs incurred to protect investor accounts and client goodwill; and

•

disruptions of third-party services such as communications, power, and mutual fund transfer agent, investment management, trading, and accounting systems.

Under our agreements with the Price funds, we charge the funds certain administrative fees and related expenses based upon contracted terms. If we fail to accurately estimate our underlying expense levels or are required to incur expenses relating to the mutual funds that are not otherwise paid by the funds, our operating results will be adversely affected. While we are under no obligation to provide financial support to any

T. Rowe Price investment products

, any financial support provided would reduce capital available for other purposes and may have an adverse effect on revenues and net income

.

Amendments to Tax Laws may impact the marketability of the products and services we offer our clients or the financial position of the company.

We are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We cannot predict future changes in the tax regulations to which we are subject, and they could have a material impact on our liability or result in increased costs of our tax compliance efforts. Additionally, changes in the status of tax deferred investment options, including retirement plans, tax-free municipal bonds, the capital gains and corporate dividend tax rates, and other individual and corporate tax rates could cause investors to view certain investment

products

less favorably and reduce investor demand for

products

and services we offer, which could have an adverse effect on our assets under management and revenues.

On December 22, 2017, a comprehensive U.S. tax reform bill originally known as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (“Tax Reform”) was enacted into law. We are required to recognize the effect of Tax Reform in our 2017 financial statements, even though the effective date of the law for most provisions is January 1, 2018. We continue to evaluate the impact of Tax Reform and expect new regulations to be issued to address certain uncertainties in the application of the law. This might result in changes to our estimates and expectations given our inability to predict the impact of future regulations and other guidance.

Examinations and audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.

Based on the global nature of our business, from time to time we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes (and, in certain cases, interest, fines, or penalties). We have a process to evaluate whether to record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional income taxes will be due. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, however, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our estimates.

We have contracted with third-party financial intermediaries that distribute our investment

products

in the U.S. and abroad and such relationships may not be available or profitable to us in the future.

These contracted third-party intermediaries generally offer their clients various investment products in addition to, and in competition with, our investment

products

, and have no contractual obligation to encourage investment in our

products

. It would be difficult for us to acquire or retain the management of those assets without the assistance of the intermediaries, and we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain an adequate number of investment product offerings and successful distribution relationships. In addition, some investors rely on third-party financial planners, registered investment advisers, and

Page



other consultants or financial professionals to advise them on the choice of investment adviser and investment

product

. These professionals and consultants can favor a competing investment

product

as better meeting their particular client’s needs. We cannot assure that our investment

products

will be among their recommended choices in the future. Further, their recommendations can change over time and we could lose their recommendation and their clients' assets under our management. Mergers, acquisitions, and other ownership or management changes could also adversely impact our relationships with these third-party intermediaries. The presence of any of the adverse conditions discussed above would reduce revenues and net income, possibly by material amounts.

Natural disasters and other unpredictable events could adversely affect our operations.

Armed conflicts, terrorist attacks, cyber-attacks, power failures, and natural disasters could adversely affect our revenues, expenses, and net income by:

•

decreasing investment valuations in, and returns on, the investment portfolios that we manage,

•

causing disruptions in national or global economies that decrease investor confidence and make investment products generally less attractive,

•

incapacitating or inflicting losses of lives among our employees,

•

interrupting our business operations or those of critical service providers,

•

triggering technology delays or failures, and

•

requiring substantial capital expenditures and operating expenses to remediate damage, replace our facilities, and restore our operations.

A significant portion of our business operations are concentrated in the Baltimore, Maryland region and in London, England. We have developed various backup systems and contingency plans but we cannot be assured that they will be adequate in all circumstances that could arise, or that material interruptions and disruptions will not occur. We also rely to varying degrees on outside vendors for service delivery in addition to technology and disaster contingency support, and we cannot be assured that these vendors will be able to perform in an adequate and timely manner. If we lose the availability of any associates, or if we are unable to respond adequately to such an event in a timely manner, we may be unable to timely resume our business operations, which could lead to a tarnished reputation and loss of customers that results in a decrease in assets under management, lower revenues, and materially reduced net income.

Our investment income and asset levels may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in our investment portfolio.

We currently have a substantial investment portfolio. All of these investments are subject to investment market risk and our non-operating investment income could be adversely affected by the realization of losses upon the disposition of our investments or the recognition of significant other-than-temporary impairments in the case of our available-for-sale portfolio and the recognition of unrealized losses related to

T. Rowe Price products

that are consolidated, held as trading or accounted for under the equity method. In addition, related investment income has fluctuated significantly over the years depending upon the performance of our corporate investments, including the impact of market conditions and interest rates, and the size of our corporate money market and longer-term mutual fund holdings. Fluctuations in other investment income are expected to occur in the future.

We may review and pursue acquisition and venture opportunities in order to maintain or enhance our competitive position.

Any strategic transaction can involve a number of risks, including additional demands on our staff; unanticipated problems regarding integration of investor account and investment security recordkeeping, additional or new regulatory requirements, operating facilities and technologies, and new employees; adverse effects in the event acquired intangible assets or goodwill become impaired; and the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or otherwise known by us prior to closing a transaction.

We own a 26% investment in UTI Asset Management Company Ltd (UTI), an Indian asset management company, and we may consider non-controlling minority investments in other entities in the future. We may not realize future returns from such investments or any collaborative activities that may develop in the future.

Page



We are exposed to a number of risks arising from our international operations.

We operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the U.S. and have an equity investment in UTI. Our international operations require us to comply with the legal and regulatory requirements of various foreign jurisdictions and expose us to the political consequences of operating in foreign jurisdictions. Our foreign business operations are also subject to the following risks:

•

difficulty in managing, operating, and marketing our international operations;

•

fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may result in substantial negative effects on assets under our management, revenues, expenses, and assets in our U.S. dollar based financial statements; and

•

significant adverse changes in international legal and regulatory environments.

LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS.

Compliance within a complex regulatory environment imposes significant financial and strategic costs on our business, and non-compliance could result in fines and penalties.

If we are unable to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to criminal and civil liability, the suspension of our employees, fines, penalties, sanctions, injunctive relief, exclusion from certain markets, or temporary or permanent loss of licenses or registrations necessary to conduct our business. A regulatory proceeding, even if it does not result in a finding of wrongdoing or sanctions, could consume substantial expenditures of time and capital. Any regulatory investigation and any failure to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations could severely damage our reputation, adversely affect our ability to conduct business, and decrease revenue and net income.

Legal and regulatory developments in the mutual fund and investment advisory industry could increase our regulatory burden, impose significant financial and strategic costs on our business, and cause a loss of, or impact the servicing of, our clients and fund shareholders.

Our regulatory environment is frequently altered by new regulations and by revisions to, and evolving interpretations of, existing regulations. New regulations present areas of uncertainty susceptible to alternative interpretations; regulators and prospective litigants may not agree with reasoned interpretations we adopt. Future changes could require us to modify or curtail our investment offerings and business operations, or impact our expenses and profitability. Additionally, some regulations may not directly apply to our business but may impact the capital markets, service providers or have other indirect effects on our ability to provide services to our clients.

Potential impacts of current or proposed legal or regulatory requirements include, without limitation, the following:

•

As part of the debate in Washington, D.C. and in state legislatures, there has been increasing focus on the framework of the U.S. retirement system. We could experience adverse business impacts if legislative and regulatory changes limit retirement plans to certain products and services, or favor certain investment vehicles, that we do not offer or are not core to our business.

•

There remains uncertainty about the U.S. Department of Labor’s (DOL) final fiduciary rule. Further, in the wake of the DOL rules, there has been substantial regulatory and legislative activity at federal and state levels regarding standards of care for financial services firms, related to both retirement and taxable accounts. The ultimate action taken by the DOL, SEC or other applicable regulatory or legislative body may impact our business activities and increase our costs.

•

The Federal Reserve Board has adopted final regulations related to non-bank Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFIs), and other jurisdictions are contemplating similar regulation. It has been suggested that large mutual funds, particularly money market funds, should be designated as SIFIs. We do not believe that mutual funds should be deemed SIFIs. Further, we do not believe SIFI designation was intended for traditional asset management businesses. However, if any T. Rowe Price fund or T. Rowe Price affiliate is deemed a SIFI, increased regulatory oversight would apply, which may include enhanced capital, liquidity, leverage, stress testing, resolution planning, and risk management requirements.

•

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has adopted certain amendments to its rules that would limit the ability of

T. Rowe Price investment products

to use commodities, futures, swaps, and other derivatives without additional registration. If our use of these products on behalf of client accounts increases so as to require registration, we would be subject to additional regulatory requirements and costs associated with registration.

Page



•

There has been increased global regulatory focus on the manner in which intermediaries are paid for distribution of mutual funds. Changes to long-standing market practices related to fees or enhanced disclosure requirements may negatively impact sales of mutual funds by intermediaries, especially if such requirements are not applied to other investment products.

•

We remain subject to various state, federal and international laws and regulations related to data privacy and protection of data we maintain concerning our customers and employees. These requirements continue to evolve. For example, the European Union has adopted changes, effective in May 2018, which will, among other things, significantly increase the potential penalties for non-compliance.

•

Global regulations on over the counter derivatives are evolving, including new and proposed regulations under The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and European Market Infrastructure Regulation relating to central clearing counterparties, trade reporting, and repositories. In addition, the SEC has adopted new regulations that will require mutual funds to adopt liquidity risk management programs with specific requirements for measuring and reporting the liquidity of fund holdings. It also has proposed regulations detailing new exposure limits and asset coverage requirements for investments in derivatives, as well as adopting derivatives risk management programs. There remains uncertainty related to various requirements under these regulations and the exact manner in which they will impact current trading strategies for our clients.

•

The revised Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II Directive) and Regulation (MiFIR) (together “MiFID II”) applied across the European Union (“EU”) and member states of the European Economic Area beginning on January 3, 2018. Implementation of MiFID II has significantly impacted both the structure and operation of EU financial markets. Some of the main changes introduced under MiFID II include applying enhanced disclosure requirements, enhancing conduct of business and governance requirements, broadening the scope of pre and post trade transparency, increasing transaction reporting requirements, transforming the relationship between client commissions and research, and further regulation of trading venues. Although compliance with MiFID II will increase our costs, as we prepared for this by deciding in 2017 that we would pay for third-party investment research used by our UK-based investment manager, T. Rowe Price International Ltd, beginning in 2018.

We cannot predict the nature of future changes to the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business, nor the extent of the impacts that will result from current or future proposals. However, any such changes are likely to increase the costs of compliance and the complexity of our operations. They may also result in changes to our product or service offerings. The changing regulatory landscape may also impact a number of our service providers and, to the extent such providers alter their services or increase their fees, it may impact our expenses or those of the products we offer.

We may become involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that may not be covered by insurance.

We are subject to regulatory and governmental inquiries and civil litigation. An adverse outcome of any such proceeding could involve substantial financial penalties. From time to time, various claims against us arise in the ordinary course of business, including employment-related claims. There also has been an increase in litigation and in regulatory investigations in the financial services industry in recent years, including customer claims, class action suits, and government actions alleging substantial monetary damages and penalties.

We carry insurance in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate. We cannot be assured that our insurance will cover every liability and loss to which we may be exposed, or that our insurance policies will continue to be available at acceptable terms and fees. Certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods. As our insurance policies come up for renewal, we may need to assume higher deductibles or co-insurance liabilities, or pay higher premiums, which would increase our expenses and reduce our net income.

In 2016, we paid

$166.2 million

to compensate certain T. Rowe Price mutual funds, trusts, separately managed accounts, and subadvised clients (collectively, “Clients”) for the denial of their appraisal rights by the Delaware Chancery Court (Court) in connection with the 2013 leveraged buyout of Dell, Inc. (Dell). The Court ruled on May 11, 2016, that the Clients could not pursue an appraisal of any shares they held that were voted in favor of the Dell merger. The appraisal statute governing the transaction required the record holder to vote against or abstain from voting on the transaction in order to assert appraisal rights. After previously voting against prior transaction proposals, the voting instructions submitted on behalf of the Clients in connection with voting on the final proposed transaction were incorrectly submitted in favor of the transaction. On May 31, 2016, the Court determined that the fair value of Dell at the time of the merger was $17.62 per share, as opposed to the $13.75 price offered in the transaction. As a result, any shareholder perfecting appraisal rights is entitled to a payment at $17.62 per share plus statutory interest from the date the Dell transaction closed subject to possible appeal of the Court's decision. The

Page



compensation to Clients was intended to make them whole for the voting discrepancy that resulted in the denial of their appraisal rights. We recovered insurance proceeds totaling $150.0 million related to this matter.

In accordance with the compensation payment, the Clients agreed that in the event the findings made by the Court regarding the fair value of Dell or the amount of interest to be applied were modified by a final, non-appealable judgment, T. Rowe Price and the Clients would make an appropriate adjustment between themselves, calculated in a manner that is consistent with the methodology used to compensate Clients. In December 2016, several parties, including Dell and the successful appraisal petitioners, filed appeals to the Delaware Supreme Court to challenge the Court’s valuation ruling.

On December 14, 2017, the Delaware Supreme Court reversed the judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings.  It is not clear how the Court will eventually rule and what the ultimate valuation will be, although the Supreme Court’s opinion suggests that the deal price of $13.75 may be the ultimate outcome. Once the Court enters a final, non-appealable judgment, Clients will be required to repay any overpayment using the methodology used to calculate the original payment. We estimate that the first $15.2 million reclaimed would be paid back to T. Rowe Price Group. We would then be required to repay any additional reclaimed funds to our insurers.

Net capital requirements may impede the business operations of our subsidiaries.

Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to net capital requirements imposed by various federal, state, and foreign authorities. Each of our subsidiaries’ net capital meets or exceeds all current minimum requirements; however, a significant change in the required net capital, an operating loss, or an extraordinary charge against net capital could adversely affect the ability of our subsidiaries to expand or maintain their operations if we were unable to make additional investments in them.

United Kingdom exit from European Union.

We have a significant locally authorized and regulated presence in the United Kingdom (“UK”) to support our global investment management business. The ultimate impact of the UK exit (“Brexit”) from the European Union (“EU”), on our business operations in the UK and Europe could vary depending on the details of the separation agreement. We are preparing for multiple scenarios, and remain committed to our clients, associates and business expansion across the region.

TECHNOLOGY RISKS.

We require specialized technology to operate our business and would be adversely affected if we fail to maintain adequate infrastructure to conduct or expand our operations or if our technology became inoperative or obsolete.

We depend on highly specialized and, in many cases, proprietary or third-party licensed technology to support our business functions, including among others:

•

securities analysis,

•

securities trading,

•

portfolio management,

•

customer service,

•

accounting and internal financial reporting processes and controls, and

•

regulatory compliance and reporting.

All of our technology systems, including those provided by vendors, are vulnerable to disability or failures due to cyber-attacks such as hacking or viruses, natural disasters, power failures, acts of war or terrorism, sabotage, and other causes. A suspension or termination of vendor-provided software licenses or related support, upgrades, and maintenance could cause system delays or interruption. Although we have robust business and disaster recovery plans, if our technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way, we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions, which could lead to a loss of customers and could harm our reputation. A technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements, exposing us to disciplinary action and liability to our customers.

In addition, our continued success depends on our ability to effectively integrate operations across many countries, and to adopt new or adapt existing technologies to meet client, industry, and regulatory demands. We might be required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain competitive infrastructure. If we are unable to upgrade our infrastructure in a timely fashion,

Page



we might lose customers and fail to maintain regulatory compliance, which could affect our results of operations and severely damage our reputation.

We could be subject to losses if we fail to properly safeguard sensitive and confidential information.

As part of our normal operations, we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients, as well as, proprietary information relating to our business operations. We maintain a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that fraudulent activity, including misappropriation of assets, fraudulent financial reporting, and unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data is either prevented or detected in a timely manner. We also leverage cloud-based solutions for the transmission and storage of this information. Our systems, or those of third-party service providers we may use to maintain and transmit such information, could be victimized by unauthorized users or corrupted by computer viruses or other malicious software code. Additionally, authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release confidential or proprietary information. Such disclosure could, among other things:

•

seriously damage our reputation,

•

allow competitors access to our proprietary business information,

•

subject us to liability for a failure to safeguard client data,

•

result in the termination of contracts by our existing customers,

•

subject us to regulatory action, and

•

require significant capital and operating expenditures to investigate and remediate the breach.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

On February 14, 2017, T. Rowe Price Group, Inc., T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc., T. Rowe Price Trust Company, current and former members of the management committee, and trustees of the T. Rowe Price U.S. Retirement Program were named as defendants in a lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. The lawsuit alleges breaches of ERISA’s fiduciary duty and prohibited transaction provisions on behalf of a class of all participants and beneficiaries of the T. Rowe Price 401(k) Plan from February 14, 2011, to the time of judgment. The plaintiffs are seeking certification of the complaint as a class action. T. Rowe Price believes the claims are without merit and is vigorously defending the action. This matter is in the early stages of litigation and we cannot predict the eventual outcome or whether it will have a material negative impact on our financial results, or estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may arise from any negative outcome.

On April 27, 2016, certain shareholders in the T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund, T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation Fund, T. Rowe Price Equity Income Fund, T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund, T. Rowe Price International Stock Fund, T. Rowe Price High Yield Fund, T. Rowe Price New Income Fund and T. Rowe Price Small Cap Stock Fund (the “Funds”) filed a Section 36(b) complaint under the caption Zoidis v. T. Rowe Price Assoc., Inc., against T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. (“T. Rowe Price”) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaint alleges that the management fees for the identified funds are excessive because T. Rowe Price charges lower advisory fees to subadvised clients with funds in the same strategy. The complaint seeks to recover the allegedly excessive advisory fees received by T. Rowe Price in the year preceding the start of the lawsuit, along with investments’ returns and profits. In the alternative, the complaint seeks the rescission of each fund’s investment management agreement and restitution of any allegedly excessive management fees. T. Rowe Price believes the claims are without merit and is vigorously defending the action. This matter is in the early stages of litigation and we cannot predict the eventual outcome or whether it will have a material negative impact on our financial results, or estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may arise from any negative outcome.

In addition to the matters discussed above, various claims against us arise in the ordinary course of business, including employment-related claims. In the opinion of management, after consultation with counsel, the likelihood of an adverse determination in one or more of these pending ordinary course of business claims that would have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations is remote.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

GENERAL.

Our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory services provided to individual and institutional investors in

T. Rowe Price U.S. mutual funds

and

other investment products

. The

other investment products

include: separately managed accounts, subadvised funds, and

other T. Rowe Price products

including collective investment trusts, target date retirement trusts, open-ended investment products offered to investors outside the U.S., and

products

offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the U.S.

We manage a broad range of U.S., international and global stock, bond, and money market mutual funds and

other investment products

, which meet the varied needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors. Investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management. Accordingly, fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management affect our revenues and results of operations. We incur significant expenditures to develop new products and services and improve and expand our capabilities and distribution channels in order to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from our existing clients. These efforts often involve costs that precede any future revenues that we may recognize from an increase to our assets under management.

The general trend to passive investing has been persistent and accelerated in recent years, which has impacted our new client inflows. However, over the long term we expect well-executed active management to play an important role for investors. In this regard, we remain debt-free with ample liquidity and resources that allow us to take advantage of attractive growth opportunities. We are investing in key capabilities, including investment professionals, technologies, and new product offerings; and, most importantly, providing our clients with strong investment management expertise and service both now and in the future.

In 2018, we expect to advance our strategic priorities to sustain and deepen our investment talent, add investment capabilities both in terms of new strategies and new investment vehicles, expand capabilities through enhanced technology, and broaden our distribution reach globally. We currently expect

2018 non-GAAP operating expense growth to lessen relative to 2017, even as growth in market driven expenses and investments in the business continue. However,

we could elect to adjust our

expense growth should markets increase or decline significantly. In addition, other events not currently planned or expected could impact

our

expense level in 2018.

We are

carefully evaluating the impact the U.S. tax reform will have

,

and factoring in the potential investment, operating expense, and capital management implications.

BACKGROUND.

Lifted by favorable corporate earnings and economic growth, U.S. stocks posted excellent returns in 2017. In fact, it was the ninth consecutive year of positive total returns for the S&P 500 Index. Equities were also buoyed at times by hopes that President Trump’s proposals for lower tax rates, reduced regulation, and increased infrastructure spending would be enacted. The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates three times in 2017, but the central bank’s moves were widely expected and did not disrupt the equity markets. In the closing weeks of the year, Congress passed and President Trump signed legislation that reduces tax rates for corporations and closely held businesses and reduces marginal tax rates for individuals at most income levels. Most major stock indexes finished the year near record levels amid expectations that the new tax law would lift corporate profits and add to U.S. economic growth in 2018.

Developed non-U.S. equity markets outperformed the broad U.S. market, as a weaker dollar enhanced returns to U.S. investors. As measured by the

MSCI Japan Index

, Japanese stocks rose more than 24%, aided by an economic recovery and by the re-election of the reform-minded Prime Minister. European equity markets also generated strong returns, lifted in part by an economic recovery and continued European Central Bank stimulus. Shares in the UK rose, but lagged other markets, as Brexit-related uncertainty lingered for most of the year, growth remained sluggish, and elevated inflation prompted the Bank of England to raise short-term interest rates in November.

Emerging equity markets significantly outperformed developed markets. Most major regions featured several countries with very strong returns in dollar terms.

Results of several major equity market indexes for


are as follows:

Global bond returns were mostly positive in 2017. In the U.S., shorter-term Treasury yields increased while the 10-year Treasury note yield, which dipped as low as about 2.0% in early September, decreased from about 2.5% to 2.4% for the year. In the investment-grade universe, corporate bonds performed well as credit spreads tightened during the year. Long-term Treasuries produced gains, but shorter-term Treasuries struggled. Municipal bonds outperformed taxable bonds. High yield bonds outperformed high-quality issues, helped by their lower interest rate sensitivity and investors’ demand for securities with attractive yields.

Bonds in developed non-U.S. markets performed well in U.S. dollar terms in 2017, as the weaker dollar lifted returns to U.S. investors. In the UK, the 10-year government bond yield was little changed for the year. Late in the year, rising inflation prompted the Central Bank to raise short-term interest rates. In the eurozone, bond yields generally rose, as the economic recovery gained traction. Late in the year, the European Central Bank announced that it will continue its bond-buying program until September 2018, but that it will halve the size of its monthly purchases starting in January. In Japan, the Central Bank sought to keep the 10-year government bond yield around 0%. Bonds in developing markets produced good returns in dollar terms, as growth in the emerging markets universe generally improved. Local currency bonds outperformed dollar-denominated issues, thanks to strength in many emerging markets currencies versus the U.S. dollar.

December 31, 2017

, up from about 5% at December 31, 2016.

Our

target date retirement products

In all three years, the majority of the client transfers were from the T. Rowe Price U.S. mutual funds to the T. Rowe Price collective investment trusts, which are included in other investment products.

Net cash inflows into

T. Rowe Price U.S. mutual funds

before transfers over the last three years were sourced primarily from third-party financial intermediaries across various mandates. In each of the last three years, the net inflows in our

other investment products

resulted primarily from the client transfers received from the mutual funds. In 2015, the net outflows prior to the client transfers into these portfolios were largely concentrated among a small number of institutional clients who redeemed primarily from large-cap U.S. equity strategies. In 2016, other investment products' net cash outflows prior to client transfers were largely attributable to institutional and intermediary clients reallocating to passive investments and the impact of our closed investment strategies. In 2017,

other investment products

' net inflows prior to client transfers resulted primarily from flows into our subadvised accounts and Luxembourg domiciled investment products.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

The table below presents financial results on a U.S. GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis that adjusts for the impact of the Dell appraisal rights matter, the consolidated T. Rowe Price investment products, the supplemental savings plan, other non-operating income, and the non-recurring charge recognized in 2017 related to the enactment of U.S. tax reform. We believe the non-GAAP financial measures below provide relevant and meaningful information to investors about our core operating results.

(1)

See the reconciliation to the comparable U.S. GAAP measures at the end of the results of operations sections of this management's discussion and analysis.

Investment advisory revenues earned in


increased

15.0%

over the comparable


period, as average assets under our management

increase

d

$130.8 billion

, or

16.8%

, to

$909.0 billion

. The average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was

47.2 basis points

in


, compared with

47.9 basis points

earned in the


period. Our effective fee rate has declined primarily due to fee rate reductions we made to certain

T. Rowe Price investment products

since the end of 2015, and higher equity valuations in funds with tiered individual rates which decrease as assets under management grow. The impact of the fee reductions was offset in part by higher equity valuations, which resulted in a greater percentage of our assets under management being attributable to higher fee equity

products

. In addition, there were negligible money market fee waivers in 2017, versus waivers in


of

$10.5 million

.

Our operating expenses in


include a non-recurring operating charge, net of insurance recovery, of $66.2 million, or $.15 per share after tax, related to the Dell appraisal rights matter. During 2017, we recognized additional insurance recoveries totaling $50 million, or

$.12

per share after tax, from claims filed in


related to this matter. A summary of the financial impact of the Dell matter on our annual pre-tax operating expenses and pre-tax operating cash flows since the matter arose is as follows:

On a non-GAAP basis, our operating expenses increased

$299.0 million

, or

12.4%

, over the comparable 2016 period. About one-fourth of the increase is related to certain expenses, such as variable compensation and market-driven distribution and

Page



client servicing costs, that are higher in


as a result of the strong market performance. The remaining change is attributable to our investments in the strategic initiatives announced in early


and other growing operational and regulatory demands.

Our operating margin in


was

44.0%

compared to

41.0%

in the


period. Excluding the impact of the Dell appraisal rights matter, our operating margin in


and


would have been 43.0% and 42.6%, respectively. The increase in our operating margin is driven by the higher percentage growth in net revenue from strong market performance compared with the growth in operating expenses.

Net revenues

Investment advisory revenues earned from the

T. Rowe Price U.S. mutual funds

increased

13.5%

, or

$366.5 million

, to

$3.1 billion

. Average mutual fund assets in


were

$568.5 billion

, an

increase

of

14.7%

from the average for the comparable


period. Fee rate reductions of certain mutual funds were a factor in why advisory revenue grew slower than average assets under management during


.

Investment advisory revenues earned on the

other investment products

for


were

$1,215.8 million

,

an increase

of

$192.5 million

, or

18.8%

, from the

$1,023.3 million

earned in


. Average assets in these

products

were

$340.5 billion

during


,

up

20.4%

from the comparable


period.

We have reduced the management fees of certain mutual funds and other investment products since the end of 2015. These reductions were a factor in why investment advisory revenue grew slower than average assets under management during 2017. We regularly assess the competitiveness of our fees and will continue to make adjustments as deemed appropriate.

Administrative fee revenues

increase

d

$5.8 million

to

$358.3 million

in


. The increase is primarily attributable to transfer agent and other administrative servicing activities provided to the

T. Rowe Price U.S. mutual funds

and their investors. Changes in administrative fee revenues are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that are incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors.

In


and


, our advisory and administrative fees are presented net of

$5.6 million

and

$6.5 million

, respectively, related to the elimination of management fee and administrative fees earned from our consolidated

T. Rowe Price investment products

.

Distribution and servicing fee revenues earned from 12b-1 plans of the Advisor, R, and Variable Annuity II Class shares of certain

T. Rowe Price investment products

were

$147.0 million

in


,

an increase

of

$5.3 million

from the comparable


period, on higher average assets under management in these share classes. The 12b-1 fees earned are offset entirely by the costs paid to third-party intermediaries who source these assets. These costs are reported as distribution and servicing costs in the consolidated income statements.

Operating expenses

Compensation and related costs were

$1,664.9 million

in


,

an increase

of

$170.9 million

, or

11.4%

, compared to the


period. The largest part of the change is attributable to a

$116.9 million

increase in salaries and related benefit expenses, which resulted primarily from a modest increase in salaries at the beginning of


, combined with a

6.4%

increase in average headcount from


. The higher employee benefit costs also includes greater payroll taxes associated with option exercises and restricted stock vesting that results from the significant rise in our stock price in


, as well as increased health care costs. Higher average headcount also drove recruiting costs to be up in


, compared with the


period. Our annual variable compensation in the


period rose

$59.8 million

over the


period. Stronger markets in 2017 increased the supplemental savings plan liability resulting in additional compensation expense of $

21.1 million

in


compared with the


period. The changes in these compensation and related costs were offset in part by higher labor capitalization related to internally developed software in


compared with the


period, as we continue to invest in our technology capabilities. We had a reduction in our noncash stock based compensation expense in 2017, as we shifted our annual grant from twice a year to a single grant in December.

Advertising and promotion costs were

$92.0 million

in


, an increase of

$12.1 million

, or

15.1%

, compared to


. We increased our spend in


in support of efforts to broaden our distribution reach and in response to investor sentiment and the strong market environment.

Occupancy and facility costs, together with depreciation expense,

increased

$32.3 million

, or

10.5%

, compared to


.  The increase is due primarily to added costs to update and enhance technology capabilities, including related maintenance programs, as well as expanded office facilities and new locations.

Page



Other operating expenses were

$491.8 million

in


,

an increase

of

$90.3 million

from


. About half of this increase is attributable to professional fees incurred to support our continued investment in our operating capabilities and growth in regulatory demands. The remainder of the change from


results from higher distribution and client servicing costs that were driven by the strong market performance in 2017, as well as increased operational and regulatory business demands.

Non-operating income

Net non-operating investment activity during


resulted in income of

$396.3 million

compared with

$227.1 million

in


. The following table details the components of non-operating income (in millions) during


and


.

During


, non-operating income includes $30.8 million in gains realized from the disposition of certain available-for-sale investments and $23.6 million in unrealized gains recognized on T. Rowe Price trading investments that result from our decision to economically hedge the market exposure associated with our supplemental savings plan liability. In order to fund the hedge portfolio, we used the proceeds from the sale of certain available-for-sale investments in certain

T. Rowe Price U.S. mutual funds

as well as designated a mutual fund that was held as available-for-sale. The designation of the T. Rowe Price mutual fund as an economic hedge transferred its accounting classification from an available-for-sale security to a trading security, and resulted in the reclassification of the investment's unrealized holding gain at the date of designation to the income statement from the balance sheet where it was previously recognized.

The impact of consolidating certain

T. Rowe Price investment products

on the individual lines of our consolidated statements of income for 2016 and


is as follows:

Page



Provision for income taxes

Our 2017 income tax provision includes a non-recurring charge of

$71.1 million

to reflect the estimated effect of the U.S. tax law changes enacted on December 22, 2017, in a comprehensive U.S. tax reform bill originally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Reform"). The recognized charge is based on current interpretation of the tax law changes, and includes

$18.9 million

for the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and a

$52.2 million

tax liability for the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign sourced net earnings. The increase in our 2017 effective tax rate resulting from this charge was offset in part by higher than expected tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options, vesting of restricted stock, and net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests related to our consolidated

T. Rowe Price investment products

, as these earnings are not taxable to us. The following reconciles the statutory federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate for


:

(1)

State income benefits totaling

(.4)%

are reflected in the total benefits for net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests and stock-based compensation plans activity.

We currently estimate that the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate (

from 35% to 21%

) in 2018, combined with other miscellaneous tax changes that effect certain tax deductions, will reduce our 2018 effective tax rate to a range of

24.0%

to

27.0%

. Our effective tax rate will continue to experience volatility in future periods as the tax benefits recognized from stock based compensation are impacted by market fluctuations in our stock price and timing of option exercises. The rate will also be impacted by changes in our consolidated investment products that are driven by market fluctuations and changes in the proportion of their net income that is attributable to non-controlling interests.

We continue to evaluate the impact of the Tax Reform on our estimates and expectations due to changes in our interpretations of the law, assumptions used in applying the law, and additional guidance concerning the law that may be issued.

2016 versus 2015

The table below presents financial results on a U.S. GAAP basis, as well as a non-GAAP basis to adjust for the non-recurring charge related to the Dell appraisal rights matter, the impact of the consolidated

T. Rowe Price investment products

, and other non-operating income. We believe the non-GAAP financial measures below provide relevant and meaningful information to investors about our core operating results.

(1)

Non-operating income varies from year to year due to a number of factors; accordingly the percentage change in non-operating income is not believed to be meaningful.

(2)

See the reconciliation to the comparable U.S. GAAP measures at the end of the results of operations sections of this management's discussion and analysis.

As detailed in the table above, the percentage increase in investment advisory revenues in


was in line with the increase in our average assets under management. We waived

$10.5 million

in money market-related fees (including advisory fees and fund expenses) in 2016, a decrease of

$37.1 million

from the

$47.6 million

waived in the


period. The fee waivers in 2016 represent less than .5% of total investment advisory revenues earned during the same period. These fees were waived from certain of our money market mutual funds and trusts, which had combined net assets of $15.7 billion at

December 31, 2016

. The annual fee rate earned on our assets under management was

47.9 basis points

in 2016, virtually unchanged from the

48.0 basis points

earned in 2015. The impact on our effective fee rate from the reduction in money market waivers in 2016 was offset by effective fee rate reductions in certain of

T. Rowe Price U.S. mutual funds

.

Our 2016 operating expenses include a non-recurring charge, net of insurance recovery, of $66.2 million, or

$.15

per share after tax related to the Dell appraisal rights matter. In 2016, we paid our clients $166.2 million to compensate them for the denial of their appraisal rights in connection with the 2013 leveraged buyout of Dell. We made claims to our insurance carriers and, on December 30, 2016

,

entered into an agreement with our primary insurance carrier to recover $100 million from the claim. The insurance proceeds were recognized as an offset to the related $166.2 million charge recognized in the second quarter of 2016. Remaining insurance claims pending as of December 31, 2016, resulted in an additional recovery of $50 million in the first quarter of 2017.

Our operating margin in


was

41.0%

compared to

45.2%

in the 2015 period. Without the impact of the non-recurring charge relating to the Dell appraisal rights matter, our operating margin in 2016 would have been 42.6%. The additional decline in our 2016 operating margin resulted primarily from the investments we have been making to broaden and deepen our investment management, distribution, and service capabilities around the world.

had on the individual lines of our 2016 consolidated statement of income was as follows:

Net revenues

Investment advisory revenues earned from

T. Rowe Price U.S. mutual funds

increased

1.4%

, or

$37.5 million

, to

$2.7 billion

. Average mutual fund assets in


were

$495.5 billion

, an

increase

of

.4%

from the average for the comparable


period. The increase in advisory revenues was due in part to the reduction in money market fee waivers realized in


compared with


.

Investment advisory revenues earned on the

other investment products

for


were

$1,023.3 million

,

an increase

of

$3.9 million

, or

.4%

, from the

$1,019.4 million

earned in


. Average assets in these

products

were

$282.7 billion

during


,

up

3.1%

from the comparable


period. In 2016, our advisory revenues are presented net of

$7.0 million

related to the elimination of management fees earned on the net assets of certain of our consolidated

T. Rowe Price investment products

. We eliminated these advisory fees in preparing our consolidated financial statements.

Administrative fee revenues

decrease

d

$9.3 million

to

$352.5 million

in


. The decrease was primarily attributable to transfer agent servicing activities provided to the mutual funds and their investors, as well as the shift of fund accounting and portfolio recordkeeping operations to BNY Mellon that, prior to August 2015, we provided to the

T. Rowe Price U.S. mutual funds

. Changes in administrative fee revenues were generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that were incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors.

Distribution and servicing fee revenues earned from 12b-1 plans of the Advisor, R, and Variable Annuity II Class shares of the

T. Rowe Price U.S. mutual funds

were

$141.7 million

in


,

a decrease

of

$9.8 million

from the comparable


period on lower average assets under management in these share classes. The 12b-1 fees earned are offset entirely by the costs paid to third- party intermediaries who source these assets. These costs are reported as distribution and servicing costs in the consolidated income statements.

Operating expenses

Compensation and related costs were

$1,494.0 million

in


,

an increase

of

$50.4 million

, or

3.5%

, compared to the


period. The largest part of the

increase

was attributable to a

$56.7 million

increase

in salaries and related benefits, which resulted from a modest increase in salaries at the beginning of


combined with a

3.2%

increase in average headcount from


. Noncash stock-based compensation expense and annual variable compensation were up

$12.6 million

and

$4.9 million

, respectively. These increases were offset by a higher level of technology labor capitalized in 2016 compared with 2015 and a reduction in temporary labor cost as the 2016 projects used more professional service resources. The overall increase in compensation and related costs and our average staff size from


were muted by lower compensation costs resulting from shifting 210 associates in August 2015 to BNY Mellon and for the ongoing transition support we provide to them. However, these lower compensation costs were generally offset by increases in costs paid to BNY Mellon to provide these administrative services and other transition-related activities, which are reflected in other operating expenses.

Advertising and promotion costs were

$79.9 million

in


compared with

$79.7 million

in


.

Occupancy and facility costs, together with depreciation expense,

increased

$20.7 million

, or

7.3%

, compared to


. The increase was primarily attributable to the added costs to update and enhance technology capabilities, including related maintenance programs.

Page



Other operating expenses were

$401.5 million

in


,

an increase

of

$60.1 million

from


. About half of this increase was attributable to costs paid to BNY Mellon since August 2015 for the performance of certain administrative services, as mentioned above. The increase also included

$6.5 million

in operating expenses, net of investment advisory fees earned by us, of those

T. Rowe Price investment products

that we began consolidating at the beginning of 2016. The remaining balance of the change was due to increased business demands and our continued investment in capabilities.

Non-operating income

Net non-operating investment activity during


resulted in income of

$227.1 million

compared with

$103.5 million

in


. The following table details the components of non-operating income (in millions) during


and


.

The increase in investment gains on T. Rowe Price products that are accounted for as an equity method or trading investments was driven by an increase in the number of equity method investments as well as market gains. The investment income on consolidated

T. Rowe Price investment products

increased in


as the number of

products

we consolidated increased significantly upon the adoption of the new consolidation accounting guidance.

Provision for income taxes

Our effective tax rate for 2016 was

36.0%

compared to

38.9%

in 2015. The decrease in the effective tax rate was related in part to the increase in net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interest related to our consolidated

T. Rowe Price investment products

, as we do not recognize taxes associated with these earnings. Additionally, the estimated effective tax rate declined as a result of adopting the new stock-based compensation accounting guidance. Under the new guidance, tax benefits and shortfalls on exercised options and vested restricted stock relative to the stock-based compensation expense recognized are included in the provision for income taxes rather than as additional paid in capital on the consolidated balance sheet. Our effective income tax rate also reflected the relative contribution of pretax income generated by our foreign subsidiaries that are subject to tax rates lower than our U.S. rates.

Non-GAAP information and reconciliation

We believe the non-GAAP financial measures below provide relevant and meaningful information to investors about our core operating results. These measures have been established in order to increase transparency for the purpose of evaluating our core business, for comparing current results with prior period results, and to enable more appropriate comparison with industry peers. However, non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be calculated differently by other companies. The following schedule reconciles (in millions, except for per-share amounts) U.S. GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP measures for each of the last five years.

Page



(1)

The non-GAAP adjustments add back the management fees that we earn from the consolidated

T. Rowe Price investment products

and subtract the investment income and operating expenses of these

products

that have been included in our U.S. GAAP consolidated statements of income. We believe the consolidated

T. Rowe Price investment products

may impact the reader's ability to understand our core operating results. The following table details the calculation of net income of consolidated

T. Rowe Price investment products

, net of redeemable non-controlling interests:

(2)

This non-GAAP adjustment removes the impact of market movements on the supplemental savings plan liability and related investments designated as economic hedges of the liability beginning July 1, 2017. Amounts deferred under the supplemental savings plan are adjusted for appreciation (depreciation) of hypothetical investments chosen by the employees. Since we economically hedge the exposure to these market movements, we believe it is useful to offset the non-operating investment income earned on the hedges against the related compensation expense to increase comparability period to period. The following table details the supplemental savings plan related items:

(3)

This non-GAAP adjustment removes the non-operating income that remains after eliminating the portion related to the consolidated

T. Rowe Price investment products

and investments designated as an economic hedge of our supplemental savings plan liability. We believe excluding non-operating income helps the reader's ability to understand our core operating results and increases comparability to prior years. Additionally, we do not emphasize the impact of non-operating income when managing our firm and evaluating our performance. The following table details the calculation of other non-operating income:

(4)

In the second quarter of 2016, we recognized a nonrecurring charge of $166.2 million related to our decision to compensate certain clients in regard to the Dell appraisal rights matter. We also recognized an offset to this charge during the fourth quarter of 2016 for related insurance recoveries totaling $100 million. In the first quarter of 2017, we recognized additional insurance recoveries of $50 million as a reduction in operating expenses from claims that were filed in relation to the matter. We believe it is useful to readers of our consolidated statements of income to adjust for these charges and non-recurring insurance recoveries in arriving at adjusted operating expenses and net income attributable to T. Rowe Price Group and diluted earnings per share.

(5)

These were calculated using the effective tax rate applicable to each non-GAAP adjustment before tax reform.

(6)

In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recognized a nonrecurring charge of

$71.1 million

to reflect the effect of the U.S. tax law changes enacted on December 22, 2017. We believe it is useful to readers of our consolidated statements of income to adjust

Page



for this nonrecurring charge in arriving at net income attributable to T. Rowe Price Group and diluted earnings per share.

(7)

This non-GAAP measure was calculated by applying the two-class method to adjusted net income attributable to T. Rowe Price Group, divided by the weighted-average common shares outstanding assuming dilution.

. These dividends and repurchases were expended using existing cash balances and cash generated from operations. We will generally repurchase our common stock over time to offset the dilution created by our equity-based compensation plans.

As detailed below, we have returned

$4.3 billion

to stockholders over the last three years through stock repurchases, our regular quarterly dividends, and a special dividend in 2015.

We remain debt-free with ample liquidity, including cash and investments in T. Rowe Price products as follows:

Our seed capital investments are redeemable, although we generally expect to be invested for several years until unrelated third-party investors substantially reduce our relative ownership percentage. Cash and discretionary investments in T. Rowe Price products held by our subsidiaries outside the U.S. were

$365.9 million

at

December 31, 2016

, and

$424.5 million

at

December 31, 2017

.

The following table details the line items of the consolidated balance sheet as of

December 31, 2017

, where our cash and investments are presented. The investment presentation on the consolidated balance sheet is based on the type of investment, as well as how we account for the investment.

Page



Our consolidated balance sheet reflects the cash and cash equivalents, investments, other assets and liabilities of those

T. Rowe Price investment products

we consolidate, as well as redeemable non-controlling interests for the portion of these

T. Rowe Price investment products

that are held by unrelated third-party investors. Although we can redeem our net interest in these

T. Rowe Price investment products

at any time, we cannot directly access or sell the assets held by the portfolios to obtain cash for general operations. Additionally, the assets of these

T. Rowe Price investment products

are not available to our general creditors. Our interest in these

T. Rowe Price investment products

was used as initial seed capital and is recategorized as discretionary when it is determined by management that the seed capital is no longer needed. We assess the discretionary investment portfolio and when we liquidate our interest, we attempt to do so in a way as to not impact the portfolio, and, ultimately the unrelated third-party investors.

We anticipate property and equipment expenditures in


to be up to

$180 million

, of which about two-thirds is planned for technology initiatives. Given the availability of our financial resources, we expect to fund our anticipated capital expenditures with operating resources.

versus


.

Operating activities attributable to T. Rowe Price Group during


provided cash flows of

$1,551.8 million

,

an increase

of

$208.1 million

from the


period. The increase is largely attributable to higher net income attributable to T. Rowe Price Group as well as the timing differences of cash flows related to the Dell appraisal rights matter. We paid $166.2 million to certain T. Rowe Price clients during 2016 and received related insurance recoveries of $150.0 million during 2017 relating to this matter. These changes in cash flows were offset by cash outflows in the 2017 period for new investments made into

T. Rowe Price investment products

held as trading totaling

$218.6 million

in order to economically hedge our supplemental savings plan liability. The net cash provided by operating activities attributable to T. Rowe Price Group was offset in part by the net change in trading securities held in

T. Rowe Price consolidated investment products

’ underlying investment

products

.

Net cash used in investing activities that are attributable to T. Rowe Price Group totaled

$33.9 million

in


,

an increase

of

$185.8 million

from the comparable 2016 period. During


, we realized $

184.2 million

more net proceeds from the purchases and sales of our available-for-sale investments compared with


. This net increase in investing cash flows was offset by an $83.5 million decrease in proceeds from the sales of equity method investments and a $37.8 million increase in property and equipment expenditures during


compared with the


period. Additionally, the amount of seed capital investments we provided in


decreased by

$147.4 million

compared with the


period. Since we consolidate these

T. Rowe Price investment products

, our investment was eliminated in preparing our consolidated statement of cash flow. The cash flow attributable to consolidated

T. Rowe Price investment products

of

$64.2 million

represents the aggregate net cash removed during 2017 from our balance sheet upon consolidating and deconsolidating

products

. During the


period, the comparable cash flow activity added

$41.4 million

to our balance sheet.

Net cash used in financing activities attributable to T. Rowe Price Group totaled

$820.1 million

in


compared with

$1,091.4 million

in


. The decrease in cash used in financing activities is related in part to a reduction of

$218.8 million

expended in common stock repurchases as the sharp increase in our stock price led us to repurchase fewer shares in


. This decrease in cash flows was offset by a

$74.8 million

increase in proceeds from option exercises, as a greater number of options were exercised due to the sharp increase in our stock price in


. The remaining change in reported cash flows from financing activities is primarily attributable to a

$366.6 million

increase in net subscriptions received from redeemable non-controlling interest holders of our consolidated

T. Rowe Price investment products

during


compared to the


period.


versus


.

Operating activities attributable to T. Rowe Price Group during 2016 provided cash flows of $1,343.7 million, a decrease of $186.8 million from the 2015 period. The decline was primarily related to the payments totaling $166.2 million we made in 2016 to compensate certain clients in regard to the Dell appraisal rights matter. We entered into an agreement on December 30, 2016, for a $100 million insurance recovery that we received in January 2017. The net cash provided by operating activities attributable to T. Rowe Price Group was offset in part by the net change in trading securities held in

T. Rowe Price consolidated investment products

’ underlying investment

products

.

Net cash used in investing activities that are attributable to T. Rowe Price Group totaled $219.7 million in 2016. In 2016, we provided $284.5 million in seed capital to new and existing

T. Rowe Price investment products

. We utilized a portion of the $219.5 million in proceeds from the sale of certain available-for-sale investments and equity method investments in 2016 to fund these seed capital investments. Since we consolidate these

T. Rowe Price investment products

, the seed capital that we provided was eliminated in preparing our consolidated statement of cash flow. In 2015, cash proceeds from the sale of certain

T. Rowe Price U.S. mutual funds

holdings, net of new investments, resulted in investing cash flows of $269.7 million. Additionally, our net property and equipment additions were $148.3 million in 2016 compared to $151.3 million in the 2015 period. The cash flow attributable to consolidated

T. Rowe Price investment products

of $41.4 million represents the net cash added to our consolidated balance sheet from consolidating and deconsolidating

products

in 2016.

Net cash used in financing activities attributable to T. Rowe Price Group was $1,091.4 million in 2016 compared with $1,973.3 million in the 2015 period. The decline in cash used in financing activities is largely related to the $2.00 per share, or $524 million, special dividend we paid in April 2015. We also expended $310.9 million less in common stock purchases in 2016 compared to the 2015 period. The cash proceeds received from stock option exercises were higher in 2016 by $52.8 million compared with the 2015 period. The net cash used in financing activities attributable to T. Rowe Price Group was largely offset by the $915.0 million of net subscriptions into the consolidated

T. Rowe Price investment products

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS.

The following table presents a summary of our future obligations (in millions) under the terms of existing operating leases and other contractual cash purchase commitments at

December 31, 2017

. Other purchase commitments include contractual amounts that will be due for the purchase of goods or services to be used in our operations and may be cancelable at earlier times than those indicated, under certain conditions that may involve termination fees. Because these obligations are generally of a normal recurring nature, we expect that we will fund them from future cash flows from operations. The information presented does not include operating expenses or capital expenditures that will be committed in the normal course of operations in


and future years. The information also excludes the

$7.6 million

of unrecognized tax benefits discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements because it is not possible to estimate the time period in which a payment might be made to the tax authorities.

We also have outstanding commitments to fund additional contributions to investment partnerships totaling

$38.8 million

at

December 31, 2017

. The vast majority of these additional contributions will be made to investment partnerships in which we have an existing investment. In addition to such amounts, a percentage of prior distributions may be called under certain circumstances.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES.

The preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives. Further, significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, the revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of income, and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to consolidated financial statements. Making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time. Accordingly, actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements, significant accounting policies, and notes.

We present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this


Annual Report. In the following discussion, we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements.

Consolidation.

We consolidate all subsidiaries and

T. Rowe Price investment products

in which we have a controlling interest. We are generally deemed to have a controlling interest when we own the majority of the voting interest of an entity or are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (VIE). VIEs are entities that lack sufficient equity to finance its activities or the equity holders do not have defined power to direct the activities of the entity normally associated with an equity investment. Our analysis to determine whether an entity is a VIE or a voting interest entity (VOE) involves judgment and considers several factors, including an entity’s legal organization, capital structure, the rights of the equity investment holders, our ownership interest in the entity, and our contractual involvement with the entity. We continually review and reconsider our VIE or VOE conclusions upon the occurrence of certain events, such as changes to our ownership interest, changes to an entity’s legal structure, or amendments to governing documents. Our VIEs are primarily

T. Rowe Price investment products

and our variable interest consists of our equity ownership in and investment management fees earned from these entities.

We are the primary beneficiary if we have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant. Our SICAV funds and other

T. Rowe Price investment products

regulated outside the U.S. are determined to be VIEs. At

December 31, 2017

, we consolidated VIEs with net assets of

$1,800.1 million

.

Other-than-temporary impairments of available-for-sale securities

. We generally classify our investment holdings in

T. Rowe Price investment products

as available-for-sale if we are not deemed to a have a controlling financial interest nor exercise significant influence over its operating and financial policies. At the end of each quarter, we mark the carrying amount of each

Page



investment to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss as a component of comprehensive income within the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. We review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment is other than temporary.

In determining whether a mutual fund holding is other-than-temporarily impaired, we consider many factors, including the duration of time the impairment has existed, the severity of the impairment, any subsequent changes in value, and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value. Subject to the other considerations noted above, we believe a fund holding with an unrealized loss that has persisted daily throughout the six months between quarter-ends is generally presumed to have an other-than-temporary impairment. We may also recognize an other-than-temporary impairment for losses that have existed for less than six months in our consolidated statements of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a near-term recovery is possible.

Other-than-temporary impairments of equity method investments

. We evaluate our equity method investments, including our investment in UTI and certain investments in

T. Rowe Price investment products

, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value, and the decline in fair value is other than temporary.

Goodwill

. We internally conduct, manage, and report our operations as one investment advisory business. We do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business. Accordingly, we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit—our investment advisory business.

We evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach. Goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business. Our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business (our market capitalization) exceeds our carrying amount (our stockholders’ equity) and, therefore, no impairment exists. Should we reach a different conclusion in the future, additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the noncash impairment charge to be recognized. We must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred. The maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our consolidated balance sheets,

$665.7 million

.

Stock options

. We recognize stock option-based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of income using a fair value-based method. Fair value methods use a valuation model for shorter-term, market-traded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading and are of longer duration. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations, including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date; the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period; and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time. Our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted. Unlike most of our expenses, the resulting charge to earnings using a fair value-based method is a noncash charge that is never measured by, or adjusted based on, a cash outflow.

Provision for income taxes

. After compensation and related costs, our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense. We operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income, expenses, and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions. Accordingly, our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations. Annually, we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities. Each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations. From time to time, we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to, or in the process of, being audited by various tax authorities. Because the determination of our annual provision is subject to judgments and estimates, it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements. As a result, we recognize additions to, or reductions of, income tax expense during a reporting period that pertain to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled. We recognize any such prior period adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined.

NEWLY ISSUED BUT NOT YET ADOPTED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE.

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION.

From time to time, information or statements provided by or on behalf of T. Rowe Price, including those within this report, may contain certain forward-looking information, including information or anticipated information relating to: our revenues, net income, and earnings per share on common stock; changes in the amount and composition of our assets under management; our expense levels; the impact of U.S. tax reform enacted in December 2017, including on our estimated effective income tax rate; and our expectations regarding financial markets, future transactions, dividends, investments, capital expenditures, and other conditions. Readers are cautioned that any forward-looking information provided by or on behalf of T. Rowe Price is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward-looking information because of various factors including, but not limited to, those discussed below and in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K Annual Report. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

Our future revenues and results of operations will fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of assets under our management. Such changes result from many factors, including, among other things: cash inflows and outflows in the

T. Rowe Price U.S. mutual funds

and

other investment products

, fluctuations in global financial markets that result in appreciation or depreciation of the assets under our management, our introduction of new mutual funds and investment

products

, and changes in retirement savings trends relative to participant-directed investments and defined contribution plans. The ability to attract and retain investors’ assets under our management is dependent on investor sentiment and confidence; the relative investment performance of the Price mutual funds and other managed investment

products

as compared to competing offerings and market indexes; the ability to maintain our investment management and administrative fees at appropriate levels; competitive conditions in the mutual fund, asset management, and broader financial services sectors; and our level of success in implementing our strategy to expand our business. Our revenues are substantially dependent on fees earned under contracts with the Price funds and could be adversely affected if the independent directors of one or more of the Price funds terminated or significantly altered the terms of the investment management or related administrative services agreements. Non-operating investment income will also fluctuate primarily due to the size of our investments, changes in their market valuations, and any other-than-temporary impairments that may arise or, in the case of our equity method investments, our proportionate share of the investees' net income.

Our future results are also dependent upon the level of our expenses, which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons: changes in the level of our advertising and promotion expenses in response to market conditions, including our efforts to expand our investment advisory business to investors outside the U.S. and to further penetrate our distribution channels within the U.S.; the pace and level of spending to support key strategic priorities; variations in the level of total compensation expense due to, among other things, bonuses, restricted stock units and other equity grants, other incentive awards, changes in our employee count and mix, and competitive factors; any goodwill or other asset impairment that may arise; fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our international operations; expenses and capital costs, such as technology assets, depreciation, amortization, and research and development, incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure; unanticipated costs that may be incurred to protect investor accounts and the goodwill of our clients; and disruptions of services, including those provided by third parties, such as fund and

product

recordkeeping, facilities, communications, power, and the mutual fund transfer agent and accounting systems.

Our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation, and changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax, and compliance requirements may have a substantial effect on our operations and results, including, but not limited to, effects on costs that we incur and effects on investor interest in

T. Rowe Price investment products

and investing in general or in particular classes of mutual funds or other investments.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

The following table presents the equity price risk from our investments in

T. Rowe Price investment products

as they are carried at fair value. Investments in these

products

generally moderate market risk as they are diversified and invest in a number of different financial instruments. T. Rowe Price further manages its exposure to market risk by diversifying its investments among many domestic and international

product

s  as well as diversification among equity and fixed income portfolios. In addition, investment holdings may be altered from time to time in response to changes in market risks and other factors, as management deems appropriate.

We have chosen to use a variant of each

product

's net asset value to quantify the equity price risk, as we believe the volatility in each

product

's net asset value best reflects the underlying risk potential as well as the market trends surrounding each of its investment objectives. The potential future loss of value, before any income tax benefits, of these investments at year-end was determined by using the lower of each

product

’s lowest net asset value per share during


or its net asset value per share at

December 31, 2017

, reduced by 10%. In considering this presentation, it is important to note that: Not all

product

s experienced their lowest net asset value per share on the same day; it is likely that the composition of the investment portfolio would be changed if adverse market conditions persisted; and we could experience future losses in excess of those presented below.

For available-for-sale investments, any losses arising from changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income, net of tax, until the investment is disposed of, or if the investment is determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired. We review the carrying amount of each investment on a quarterly basis and recognize an impairment charge in non-operating income (loss) whenever an unrealized loss is considered other than temporary.

The direct investment in consolidated

T. Rowe Price investment products

represents our portion of the net assets of the

product

. Upon consolidation of these

products

, our direct investment is eliminated and the net assets of the

products

are combined in our consolidated balance sheet, together with redeemable non-controlling interests, which represents the portion of the

products

that is owned by unrelated third-party investors. Any losses arising from the change in fair value of our direct investments in consolidated

T. Rowe Price investment products

would result in a corresponding decrease, net of tax, in our net income attributable to T. Rowe Price Group.

Certain of our investments, including a few consolidated

T. Rowe Price investment products

, expose us to foreign currency translation risk when their foreign denominated financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars (USD). Our most significant exposure relates to the translation of the financial statements of our equity method investment in UTI (

$155.8 million

at

December 31, 2017

). UTI's financial statements are denominated in Indian rupees (INR) and are translated to USD each reporting period. We do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this foreign currency risk, so both positive and negative fluctuations in the INR against the USD will affect accumulated other comprehensive income and the carrying amount of our investment. We had a cumulative translation

loss

, net of tax, of

$30.6 million

at

December 31, 2017

, related to our investment in UTI. Given the nature of UTI’s business, should conditions deteriorate in markets in which they operate, we are at risk for loss up to our carrying amount.

We operate in several foreign countries of which the United Kingdom is the most prominent. We incur operating expenses and have foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities associated with these operations, although our revenues are predominately realized in USD. We do not believe that foreign currency fluctuations materially affect our results of operations.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES.

T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. derives its consolidated revenues and net income primarily from investment advisory services that its subsidiaries provide to individual and institutional investors in the

T. Rowe Price U.S. mutual funds

and

other investment products

, including separately managed accounts, subadvised funds, and

other T. Rowe Price products

. We also provide our investment advisory clients with related administrative services, including distribution, mutual fund transfer agent, accounting and shareholder services; participant recordkeeping and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans; brokerage, and trust services.

Investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management. Accordingly, fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management impact our revenues and results of operations.

BASIS OF PREPARATION.

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared by our management in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These principles require that we make certain estimates and assumptions. Actual results may vary from our estimates.

In 2017, we recognized in our income tax provision a non-recurring charge of

$71.1 million

to reflect the estimated effect of the U.S. tax law changes enacted on December 22, 2017. The charge is a reasonable estimate based on current interpretation of the tax law changes and includes

$18.9 million

for the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and a

$52.2 million

tax liability for the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign sourced net earnings. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the tax law changes on our estimates and expectations due to changes in our interpretations of the law, assumptions used in applying the law, and additional guidance concerning the law that may be issued. We will report any applicable adjustments to these estimates in 2018 after our estimates are finalized. Refer to Note 7 for more information on the impact of tax reform on our 2017 financial statements and effective tax rate.

NEWLY ISSUED BUT NOT YET ADOPTED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE.

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 — Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and subsequently has issued several related accounting standard updates clarifying several aspects of ASU 2014-09, including technical corrections and improvements (ASC 606). The standard update provides a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers to improve comparability within industries, across industries, and across capital markets. It contains principles to apply to determine the measurement of revenue and the timing of when it is recognized. We will adopt the new standard on its effective date, January 1, 2018, using the retrospective approach with adjustments to each prior period. We concluded that the new standards do not materially change the timing of revenue recognition. However, the presentation of certain revenue related expenses totaling about

$60 million

in 2016 and 2017 will change from being recognized net against the related revenues to being reported within operating expenses. Additionally, we plan to enhance disclosures in accordance with the standard's disclosure requirements in 2018.

In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01 — Financial Instruments — Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. This standard update addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments and requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. We will adopt the new standard on its effective date, January 1, 2018. Upon adoption, we will reclassify net unrealized holding gains recognized on investments in

T. Rowe Price products

totaling

$7.9 million

from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. After January 1, 2018, the change in the fair value of investments in

T. Rowe Price investment product

s previously accounted for as available-for-sale investments will be recognized in our consolidated income statement rather than our consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The impact upon implementation of the standard on our investments without a readily determinable fair value is not material.

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 — Leases (Topic 842). The standard update seeks to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The standards update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our financial position and results of operations.

Page



We have considered all other newly issued accounting guidance that is applicable to our operations and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, including guidance which we have not yet adopted. We do not believe that any such guidance will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operation.

CONSOLIDATION.

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries and

T. Rowe Price investment products

in which we have a controlling interest. We are generally deemed to have a controlling interest when we own the majority of a voting interest entity (VOE) or are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (VIE). We perform an analysis of our investments to determine if the investment entity is a VOE or VIE. Our analysis involves judgment and considers several factors, including an entity’s legal organization, capital structure, the rights of the equity investment holders, our ownership interest in the entity, and our contractual involvement with the entity. We continually review and reconsider our VOE or VIE conclusions upon the occurrence of certain events, such as changes to our ownership interest, changes to an entity’s legal structure, or amendments to governing documents. Upon consolidation of

T. Rowe Price investment products

, we retain the specialized investment company accounting principles of the underlying funds. All material accounts and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated in consolidation.

Variable interest entities

VIEs are entities that, by design: (i

)

lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities independently or (ii) have equity holders that do not have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance, the obligation to absorb the entity’s losses, or the rights to receive the entity’s residual returns. We consolidate a VIE when we are the primary beneficiary, which is the party that has both (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant. Our Luxembourg-based SICAV funds and other

T. Rowe Price investment products

regulated outside the U.S. were determined to be VIEs.

Along with VIEs that we consolidate, we also hold variable interests in other VIEs, including several investment partnerships that are not consolidated because we are not the primary beneficiary.

Redeemable non-controlling interests

We recognize redeemable non-controlling interests for the portion of the net assets of our consolidated

T. Rowe Price investment products

held by unrelated third-party investors as their interest is convertible to cash and other assets at their option. As such, we reflect redeemable non-controlling interests as temporary equity in our consolidated balance sheets.

Investments in

T. Rowe Price money market mutual funds

We do not consider our investments in

T. Rowe Price money market mutual funds

when performing our consolidation analysis as the guidance provides a scope exception for interests in entities that are required to comply with, or operate in accordance with, requirements similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds.

CASH EQUIVALENTS.

Cash equivalents consist primarily of short-term, highly liquid investments in

T. Rowe Price money market mutual funds

. The cost of these funds is equivalent to fair value.

INVESTMENTS.

T. Rowe Price investment products

that are accounted for as available-for-sale investments have been made for both general corporate investment purposes and to provide seed capital for newly formed

product

s. These investments are carried at fair value using the quoted closing net asset value (NAV) per share of each fund as of the balance sheet date. Changes in net unrealized holding gains or losses on these investments are recognized in other comprehensive income.

We review the carrying amount of each investment on a quarterly basis and recognize an impairment charge in non-operating investment income whenever an unrealized loss is considered other than temporary. In determining whether a holding is other-than-temporarily impaired, we consider various factors, including the duration of time it has existed, the severity of the impairment, any subsequent changes in value, and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value. Subject to the other considerations noted above, we believe a holding with an unrealized loss that has persisted daily throughout the

six months

between quarter-ends is generally presumed to have an other-than-temporary impairment. We may also recognize an other-than-temporary impairment if particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a near-term recovery is possible.

Page



Equity method investments

consist of investments in entities, including

T. Rowe Price investment products

, for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. The carrying values of these investments are adjusted to reflect our proportionate share of the investee's net income or loss, any unrealized gain or loss resulting from the translation of foreign-denominated financial statements into U.S. dollars, and dividends received. Our proportionate share of income or loss is included in non-operating income in our consolidated statements of income. As permitted under existing accounting guidance, we adopted a policy by which we recognize our share of UTI Asset Management Company Limited’s (UTI) earnings on a quarter lag as current financial information is not available in a timely manner. The basis difference between our carrying value and our proportionate share of UTI’s book value is primarily related to consideration paid in excess of the stepped-up basis of assets and liabilities on the date of purchase.

Cost method investments consist of investments in entities for which we do not exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. We evaluate our equity and cost method investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value, and the decline in fair value is other than temporary.

T. Rowe Price investment products

held as trading include seed and discretionary investments in mutual funds and separately managed account products that are carried at fair value. These investments are valued in accordance with the valuation and pricing policy used to value our assets under management and as further described in the Revenue Recognition section below.

Investments held by consolidated

T. Rowe Price investment products

are considered trading securities that are carried at fair value with corresponding changes in the investments’ fair values reflected in non-operating income in our consolidated statements of income. These investments are valued in accordance with the valuation and pricing policy used to value our assets under management and further described in the Revenue Recognition section below.

CONCENTRATION OF RISK.

Concentration of credit risk in accounts receivable is believed to be minimal in that our clients generally have substantial assets, including those in the investment portfolios that we manage for them.

Our investments held as trading expose us to market risk, that is, the potential future loss of value that would result from a decline in the fair value of each investment or its underlying net assets. The underlying holdings of our assets under management are also subject to market risk, which may arise from changes in equity prices, credit ratings, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT.

Property and equipment is stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation and amortization computed using the straight-line method. Provisions for depreciation and amortization are based on the following weighted-average estimated useful lives: computer and communications software and equipment,


years; buildings and improvements,


years; leasehold improvements,


years; furniture and other equipment,


years; and leased land,


years.

GOODWILL.

We evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach. Our evaluations have indicated that no impairment exists.

We internally conduct, manage, and report our operations as one investment advisory business. We do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business. Accordingly, we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit—our investment advisory business.

REVENUE RECOGNITION.

Fees for investment advisory services, which are based on a percentage of assets under management, and related administrative services that we provide to investment advisory clients, including the

T. Rowe Price U.S. mutual funds

and

other investment products

, are recognized in the period that our services are provided.

Our assets under management are valued in accordance with a valuation and pricing policy that defines the valuation and pricing processes for each major type of investment held in

T. Rowe Price U.S. mutual funds

and

other investment products

. Fair values used in our processes are primarily determined from quoted market prices; prices furnished by dealers who make

Page



markets in such securities; or from data provided by an independent pricing service that considers yield or price of investments of comparable quality, coupon, maturity, and type. Investments for which market prices are not readily available are not a material portion of our total assets under management.

Distribution and servicing fees earned from 12b-1 plans of the Advisor Class, R Class, and Variable Annuity II Class shares of certain

T. Rowe Price U.S. mutual funds

are recognized in the period that they are earned, which is the same period that the related products recognize their expense. These fees are offset entirely by the distribution and servicing costs paid to third-party financial intermediaries that source the assets of these share classes.

We provide all services to the

T. Rowe Price U.S. mutual funds

under contracts that are subject to periodic review and approval by the funds’ Boards. Regulations require that the funds’ shareholders also approve material changes to investment advisory contracts.

Taxes billed to our clients based on our fees for services rendered are not included in revenues.

ADVERTISING.

Costs of advertising are expensed the first time that the advertising takes place.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.

We maintain

three

stockholder-approved employee long-term incentive plans (2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan, 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, and 2001 Stock Incentive Plan, collectively the LTI Plans) and

two

stockholder-approved non-employee director plans (2007 Non-Employee Director Equity Plan and 2017 Non-Employee Director Equity Plan, collectively the Director Plans). We believe that our stock-based compensation programs align the interests of our employees and directors with those of our common stockholders. As of

December 31, 2017

, a total of

18,445,397

shares were available for future grant under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 2017 Non-Employee Director Equity Plan (2017 Plan).

Under our LTI Plans, we have issued restricted shares and restricted stock units to employees that settle in shares of our common stock after vesting. Vesting of these awards is based on the individual continuing to render service over an average

5.0

year graded schedule. All restricted shareholders and restricted stock unitholders receive non-forfeitable cash dividends and cash dividend equivalents, respectively, on our dividend payable date. We are also authorized to grant qualified incentive and nonqualified fixed stock options with a maximum term of


years. We have not granted options to employees since 2015.

We grant performance-based restricted stock units to certain executive officers in which the number of restricted stock units ultimately retained is determined based on achievement of certain performance thresholds. The number of restricted stock units retained is also subject to the same time-based vesting requirement as the other restricted stock units described above. Cash dividend equivalents are accrued and paid to the holders of performance-based restricted stock units only after the performance period has lapsed and the performance thresholds have been met.

Under the Director Plans, we may grant options with a maximum term of


years, restricted shares, and restricted stock units to non-employee directors. Under the 2017 Plan, awards generally vest over

one

year and, in the case of restricted stock units, are settled upon the non-employee directors’ departure from the Board. For restricted shares, cash dividends are accrued and paid on only after the award vests. Restricted stock unit holders receive dividend equivalents in the form of unvested stock units that vest over the same period as the underlying award. We did not grant options to non-employee directors in 2017.

We recognize the grant-date fair value of these awards as compensation expense ratably over the awards' requisite service period. Compensation expense recognized for performance-based restricted shares and units includes an estimate regarding the probability of the performance thresholds being met. Both time-based and performance-based units are valued on the grant-date using the closing market price of our common stock. The expense recognized prior to 2016 includes an estimate of awards that will be forfeited. Upon implementation of the new stock-based compensation accounting guidance in 2016, we elected to account for forfeitures as they occur.

Page



We used the following inputs to the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of each option granted in 2015 and 2016.

Our expected life assumptions are based on the vesting period for each option grant and our historical experience with respect to the average holding period from vesting to option exercise. The assumptions for expected volatility are based on historical experience for the same periods as our expected lives. Dividend yields are based on recent historical experience and future expectations. Risk-free interest rates are set using grant-date U.S. Treasury yield curves for the same periods as our expected lives.

EARNINGS PER SHARE.

We compute our basic and diluted earnings per share under the two-class method, which considers our outstanding restricted shares and stock units, on which we pay non-forfeitable dividends as if they were a separate class of stock.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

The components of comprehensive income are presented in a separate statement following our consolidated statements of income and include net income, the change in net unrealized security holding gains (losses), and the change in our currency translation adjustments. The currency translation adjustments result from translating our proportionate share of the financial statements of UTI, our equity method investment, and certain consolidated

T. Rowe Price investment products

into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using year-end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated using weighted-average exchange rates for the period.

The changes in accumulated balances of each component of other comprehensive income, the deferred tax impacts of each component, and information about significant items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income are presented in the notes to the financial statements. The notes also indicate the line item of our consolidated statements of income to which the significant reclassifications were recognized.

NOTE 3 – INVESTMENTS.

The carrying values of investments we do not consolidate at December 31 are as follows:

At the end of the second quarter of 2017, we made the decision to economically hedge the market exposure associated with our supplemental savings plan liability with certain

T. Rowe Price investment products

. In order to fund the hedge portfolio, we used the proceeds from the sale of certain

T. Rowe Price investment products

held as available-for-sale as well as designated a

T. Rowe Price U.S. mutual fund

that was held as available-for-sale.

During the last three years, certain

T. Rowe Price investment products

in which we provided initial seed capital at the time of formation were deconsolidated, as we no longer had a controlling interest. Depending on our ownership interest, we are now reporting our residual interests in these

T. Rowe Price investment products

as either equity method or available-for-sale investments. Additionally, during


and


, certain

T. Rowe Price investment products

that were being accounted for as equity method investments were consolidated, as we regained a controlling interest. The net impact of these changes on our consolidated balance sheets and income statements as of the dates the portfolios were deconsolidated or reconsolidated is detailed below.

The losses and gains recognized upon deconsolidation were the result of reclassifying currency translation adjustments accumulated on certain

T. Rowe Price investment products

with non-USD functional currencies from accumulated other comprehensive income to non-operating income.

NOTE 4

– FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.

We determine the fair value of our cash equivalents and certain investments using the following broad levels of inputs as defined by related accounting standards:

Level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical securities.

Level 2 – observable inputs other than Level 1 quoted prices including, but not limited to, quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, and credit risk. These inputs are based on market data obtained from independent sources.

Level 3 – unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions based on the best information available. We do not value any investments using Level 3 inputs.

These levels are not necessarily an indication of the risk or liquidity associated with our investments. There have been no transfers between the levels. The following table summarizes our investments that are recognized in our consolidated balance sheets using fair value measurements determined based on the differing levels of inputs.

NOTE 5 – CONSOLIDATED

T. ROWE PRICE INVESTMENT PRODUCTS

.

The

T. Rowe Price investment products

that we consolidate in our consolidated financial statements are generally those products we provided initial seed capital at the time of their formation and have a controlling interest. Our

T. Rowe Price U.S. mutual funds

are considered voting interest entities, while those regulated outside the U.S. are considered variable interest entities.

The following table details the net assets of the consolidated

T. Rowe Price investment products

:

Cash and cash equivalents includes

$8.8 million

and

$6.2 million

Investments include

$4.2 million

and

$15.0 million

at

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively, of

T. Rowe Price investment products

.

Although we can redeem our net interest in these

T. Rowe Price investment products

at any time, we cannot directly access or sell the assets held by these

products

to obtain cash for general operations. Additionally, the assets of these investment

products

are not available to our general creditors.

Since third-party investors in these investment

products

have no recourse to our credit, our overall risk related to the net assets of consolidated

T. Rowe Price investment products

is limited to valuation changes associated with our net interest. We, however, are required to recognize the valuation changes associated with all underlying investments held by these

products

in our consolidated statements of income and disclose the portion attributable to third-party investors as net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests.

The operating results of the consolidated

T. Rowe Price investment products

, are reflected in our consolidated statements of income as follows:

The operating expenses of these consolidated

products

are reflected in other operating expenses. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we eliminated operating expenses of

$6.5 million

and

$5.6 million

in


and


, respectively, against the investment advisory and administrative fees earned from these

products

. The net investment income reflected in non-operating income includes dividend and interest income and realized and unrealized gains and losses on the underlying securities held by the consolidated

T. Rowe Price investment products

.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.

We determine the fair value of investments held by consolidated

T. Rowe Price investment products

using the following broad levels of inputs as defined by related accounting standards:

Level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical securities.

Level 2 – observable inputs other than Level 1 quoted prices including, but not limited to, quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, and credit risk. These inputs are based on market data obtained from independent sources.

Level 3 – unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions based on the best information available. The value of investments using Level 3 inputs is insignificant.

These levels are not necessarily an indication of the risk or liquidity associated with these investment holdings. There have been no material transfers between the levels during 2016 and 2017. The following table summarizes the investment holdings held by our consolidated

T. Rowe Price investment products

NOTE 7

– INCOME TAXES.

The provision for income taxes consists of:

Our income tax provision for 2017 includes a non-recurring charge of

$71.1 million

to reflect the effect of the U.S. tax law changes enacted on December 22, 2017.  The recognized charge is our reasonable estimate based on current interpretation of the tax law changes and includes

$18.9 million

for the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and a

$52.2 million

U.S. federal and state tax charge for the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign sourced net earnings. The federal tax portion will be payable over the next

8 years

.  We will continue to evaluate the impact of the tax law changes on our estimates and expectations due to changes in our interpretations of the law, assumptions used in applying the law, and additional guidance concerning the law that may be issued. We will report any applicable adjustments to these estimates in 2018 after our estimates are finalized.

Deferred income taxes and benefits arise from temporary differences between taxable income for financial statement and income tax return purposes. The deferred income taxes (tax benefits) recognized as part of our provision for income taxes is related to:

The following table reconciles the statutory federal income tax rate to our effective income tax rate.

The net deferred tax assets recognized in our consolidated balance sheets in other assets as of December 31 relate to the following:

We have not recognized a state deferred tax liability for unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as T. Rowe Price intends to indefinitely reinvest these earnings outside the U.S.  The unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries are estimated to be approximately

$604 million

at

December 31, 2017

If these earnings were distributed to the U.S. in the form of dividends or otherwise, or if any of the entities were sold or otherwise transferred, we would be subject to state and local income taxes.

NOTE 10

– EARNINGS PER SHARE CALCULATIONS.

The following table presents the reconciliation of net income attributable to T. Rowe Price Group to net income allocated to our common stockholders and the weighted-average shares that are used in calculating the basic and diluted earnings per share on our common stock. Weighted-average common shares outstanding assuming dilution reflect the potential dilution, determined using the treasury stock method, that could occur if outstanding stock options were exercised and non-participating stock awards vested.

The following table shows the weighted-average outstanding stock options that are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share as the inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive.

NOTE 12 – DELL APPRAISAL RIGHTS MATTER.

In 2016, we paid

$166.2 million

to compensate certain T. Rowe Price mutual funds, trusts, separately managed accounts, and subadvised clients (collectively, Clients) for the denial of their appraisal rights by the Delaware Chancery Court (Court) in connection with the 2013 leveraged buyout of Dell, Inc. (Dell).

The Court ruled on May 11, 2016, that the Clients could not pursue an appraisal of any shares they held that were voted in favor of the Dell merger. The appraisal statute governing the transaction required the record holder to vote against or abstain from voting on the transaction in order to assert appraisal rights. After previously voting against prior transaction proposals, the voting instructions submitted on behalf of the Clients in connection with voting on the final proposed transaction were incorrectly submitted in favor of the transaction. On May 31, 2016, the Court determined that the fair value of Dell at the time of the merger was

$17.62

per share, as opposed to the

$13.75

price offered in the transaction. As a result, any shareholder perfecting appraisal rights is entitled to a payment at

$17.62

per share plus statutory interest from the date the Dell transaction closed subject to possible appeal of the Court’s decision. The compensation to Clients was intended to make them whole for the voting discrepancy that resulted in the denial of their appraisal rights.

Page



On December 30, 2016, we entered into a settlement agreement for

$100.0 million

with our insurance carrier for insurance proceeds related to this matter. We recognized the proceeds as a reduction to the

$166.2 million

nonrecurring charge that we recognized earlier in 2016 and received the proceeds in January 2017. We received an additional

$50 million

in insurance proceeds from other insurance carriers in early 2017 and recognized a related reduction in operating expenses.

In accordance with the compensation payment, the Clients agreed that in the event the findings made by the Court regarding the fair value of Dell or the amount of interest to be applied were modified by a final, non-appealable judgment, T. Rowe Price and the Clients would make an appropriate adjustment between themselves, calculated in a manner that is consistent with the methodology used to compensate Clients. In December 2016, several parties, including Dell and the successful appraisal petitioners, filed appeals to the Delaware Supreme Court to challenge the Court’s valuation ruling. On December 14, 2017, the Delaware Supreme Court reversed the Court's judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings. It is not clear how the Court will eventually rule and what the ultimate valuation will be, although the Supreme Court’s opinion suggests that the deal price of

$13.75

may be the ultimate outcome.

Once the Court enters a final, non-appealable judgment, Clients will be required to repay any overpayment using the methodology used to calculate the original payment. We estimate that the first

$15.2 million

reclaimed from our Clients would be paid back to T. Rowe Price Group. We would then be required to repay any additional reclaimed funds to our insurers in a specific order.

NOTE 13 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES.

On February 14, 2017, T. Rowe Price Group, Inc., T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc., T. Rowe Price Trust Company, current and former members of the management committee, and trustees of the T. Rowe Price U.S. Retirement Program were named as defendants in a lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. The lawsuit alleges breaches of ERISA’s fiduciary duty and prohibited transaction provisions on behalf of a class of all participants and beneficiaries of the T. Rowe Price 401(k) Plan from February 14, 2011, to the time of judgment. The plaintiffs are seeking certification of the complaint as a class action. T. Rowe Price believes the claims are without merit and is vigorously defending the action. This matter is in the early stages of litigation and we cannot predict the eventual outcome or whether it will have a material negative impact on our financial results, or estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may arise from any negative outcome.

On April 27, 2016, certain shareholders in the T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund, T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation Fund, T. Rowe Price Equity Income Fund, T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund, T. Rowe Price International Stock Fund, T. Rowe Price High Yield Fund, T. Rowe Price New Income Fund and T. Rowe Price Small Cap Stock Fund (the “Funds”) filed a Section 36(b) complaint under the caption Zoidis v. T. Rowe Price Assoc., Inc., against T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. (“T. Rowe Price”) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaint alleges that the management fees for the identified funds are excessive because T. Rowe Price charges lower advisory fees to subadvised clients with funds in the same strategy. The complaint seeks to recover the allegedly excessive advisory fees received by T. Rowe Price in the year preceding the start of the lawsuit, along with investments’ returns and profits. In the alternative, the complaint seeks the rescission of each fund’s investment management agreement and restitution of any allegedly excessive management fees. T. Rowe Price believes the claims are without merit and is vigorously defending the action. This matter is in the early stages of litigation and we cannot predict the eventual outcome or whether it will have a material negative impact on our financial results, or estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may arise from any negative outcome.

In addition to the matters discussed above, various claims against us arise in the ordinary course of business, including employment-related claims. In the opinion of management, after consultation with counsel, the likelihood of an adverse determination in one or more of these pending ordinary course of business claims that would have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations is remote.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the Stockholders of T. Rowe Price Group, Inc.:

We, together with other members of management of T. Rowe Price Group, Inc., are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over the company’s financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is the process designed under our supervision, and effected by the company’s Board of Directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility that misstatements may not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, even effective internal controls over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Furthermore, the effectiveness of internal controls can change with circumstances.

Management has evaluated the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2017

, in relation to criteria described in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on management’s assessment, we believe that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2017

.

KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited our financial statements that are included in this annual report and expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. KPMG has also expressed an unqualified opinion on the effective operation of our internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2017

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors

T. Rowe Price Group, Inc.:

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. and subsidiaries’ (the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2017

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2017

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of

December 31, 2017

and


, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended

December 31, 2017

, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated

February 16, 2018

, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying

Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
