PART I

Item 1. Business.

T. Rowe Price Group is a financial services holding company that derives its consolidated revenues
and net income primarily from investment advisory services that its subsidiaries provide to
individual and institutional investors in the sponsored T. Rowe Price mutual funds and other
investment portfolios. Our investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and
composition of assets under our management. Accordingly, fluctuations in financial markets and in
the composition of assets under management impact our revenues and results of operations.

We operate our investment advisory business through our subsidiary companies, primarily T. Rowe
Price Associates, T. Rowe Price International, and T. Rowe Price Global Investment Services. The
late Thomas Rowe Price, Jr., began our advisory business in 1937, and the common stock of T. Rowe
Price Associates was first offered to the public in 1986. The T. Rowe Price Group corporate
holding company structure was established in late 2000.

Total assets under our management increased $34.3 billion over the course of 2005 and ended the
year at an all-time record of $269.5 billion, including $178 billion held in retirement accounts
and variable annuity investment portfolios. Assets under our management at the end of 2005
included $208.3 billion of equity securities and $61.2 billion of debt securities. The five
largest Price funds at December 31, 2005 — Equity Income, Mid-Cap Growth, Growth Stock, Blue Chip
Growth and Small-Cap Stock — account for 24% of assets under management at that time and nearly 30%
of 2005 investment advisory revenues.

Our assets under management are accumulated from a diversified client base that is accessed across
four primary distribution methods. Our assets under management are sourced approximately 20-30%
from each of the following: third-party financial intermediaries that distribute our managed
investment portfolios in the U.S. and foreign countries, individual U.S. investors on a direct
basis, U.S. defined contribution retirement plans, and institutional investors in the U.S. and
foreign countries. Our largest client account relationship, excluding the T. Rowe Price funds, is
with a third-party financial intermediary that accounted for 4% of our investment advisory revenues
in 2005.

In 2001, our U.K. investment advisory subsidiary, T. Rowe Price Global Investment Services,
expanded our investment advisory business to Europe where we now offer separate account management
to institutional investors, subadvisory services, and a series of Luxembourg-domiciled mutual funds
with share classes for institutional investors and for individuals reached through third party
intermediaries. These initiatives complement those that we began in 1999 in Japan through which we
subadvise investment assets for Daiwa SB Investments. We hold a 10% interest in Daiwa SB. Our
international clients account for 5% of our total assets under management at December 31, 2005.

We manage a broad range of U.S. domestic and international stock, bond, and money market mutual
funds and other investment portfolios that are designed to meet the varied and changing needs and
objectives of individual and institutional investors. For example, mutual fund shareholders can
exchange balances among mutual funds as permitted when economic and market conditions and their
investment needs change.

From time to time, we introduce new funds and other investment portfolios to complement and expand
our investment offerings, respond to competitive developments in the financial marketplace, and
meet the changing needs of our
investment advisory clients. We will open a new mutual fund if we believe that its objective will
be useful for investors over a long period. Conversely, we may also limit new investments into a
mutual fund in order to maintain the integrity of the fund’s investment strategy and to protect the
interests of its existing shareholders. At present, the following funds are closed to new
investors.

Investment objectives for our managed investment portfolios, including the Price funds, accommodate
a variety of strategies. Investors select from among the mutual funds based on the distinct
objective that is described in each fund’s prospectus. Investment management of other client
portfolios includes approaches similar to those employed in the Price funds. Equity investment
strategies may emphasize large-cap, mid-cap or small-cap investing; growth, value or core
investing; and U.S., global, or international investing. We also offer systematic, tax-efficient,
and blended equity investment strategies as well as active, systematic and municipal tax-free
management strategies for fixed income investments. Our specialized advisory services include
management of stable value investment contracts and a distribution management service for the
disposition of equity securities received from third-party venture capital investment pools.

We employ fundamental and quantitative security analyses in the performance of the investment
advisory function. We maintain substantial internal equity and fixed income investment research
capabilities. We perform original industry and company research using such sources as inspection
of corporate activities, management interviews, company-published financial and other information,
financial newspapers and magazines, corporate rating services, and field checks with suppliers and
competitors in the same industry and particular business sector. Our research staff operates
primarily from offices located in the United States and Great Britain with additional staff
resident in Argentina, Hong Kong, Japan, and Singapore. We also use research provided by brokerage
firms in a supportive capacity and information received from private economists, political
observers, commentators, government experts, and market and security analysts. Our stock selection
process for some investment portfolios is based on quantitative analyses using computerized data
modeling.

Prior to 2005, we made modest use of fully permissible payments by brokers to obtain
non-broker-dealer third-party investment research and related services. After careful evaluation
during 2004, we decided to phase out these arrangements and to pay for these services directly.

We also provide certain administrative services as ancillary services to our investment advisory
clients. These administrative services are provided by several of our subsidiary companies and
include mutual fund transfer agent, accounting, and shareholder services; participant recordkeeping
and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans investing in our sponsored
mutual funds; discount brokerage; and trust services. About 90% of
our administrative revenues in 2005 were based on the recovery of expenses incurred to provide the
related services. Administrative revenues, therefore, do not significantly affect our net income.

Information concerning our revenues, results of operations, total assets, and investment assets
under our management during the past three years is contained in our consolidated financial
statements and in note 5 thereto, which are both included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

2005 DEVELOPMENTS.

Financial market results in the United States during 2005 were mixed with the three major stock
market indexes falling below end of 2004 levels for much of the year. There were periods of
strength, however, as all three indexes reached four-year highs before falling back late in the
year. Investor concerns about rising interest rates and record high fuel prices were compounded by
the hurricane damage to the Gulf Coast region of the United States. Military action, terrorism and
the uncertainties surrounding the strength of the U.S. economy also continued to weigh on the
financial markets. The S&P 500 closed 2005 with the best performance among the indexes, posting a
modest 3% return for the year. The NASDAQ index, which is heavily weighted with technology
companies, ended the year up only 1.4% while the Dow Jones Industrials closed down .6% for the
year.

Foreign equity markets were stronger in 2005, with the Dow Jones Latin America, Asia/Pacific, and
Europe Indexes all outperforming their U.S. counterparts. Lower global interest rates, higher
corporate profits, and stronger economic conditions, including those in emerging markets, broadly
presented favorable conditions for the financial markets outside the United States.

As for fixed income securities, yields for 10-year U.S. Treasuries rose only 4% to close 2005 at
4.39%. By year-end, the yield curve had inverted with short-term rates exceeding long-term rates
and investors worried about the possibility of a pending economic downturn. The Federal Reserve
continued its series of .25% increases in 2005, pushing the target
short-term rate up 200 basis points over the
course of the year to 4.25%. As 2006 began, the Federal Reserve signaled that its series of
tightening moves was slowing and nearing an end.

-3-

Despite this less than robust financial environment in 2005, total assets under our management
ended 2005 at a record $269.5 billion, up $34.3 billion during the year. Strong relative
investment performance and brand awareness contributed significantly to investors entrusting $16.1
billion of net cash inflows to our management in 2005, down from the $20.7 billion record net cash
inflows in 2004. Net cash inflows during 2005 included nearly $400 million resulting from the July
merger of the TD Waterhouse Index Funds into four of the T. Rowe Price index funds. Higher market
valuations and income increased assets under our management by $18.2 billion during 2005.

Assets under management at December 31, 2005 include $170.2 billion in the T. Rowe Price mutual
funds distributed in the United States and $99.3 billion in other investment portfolios that we
manage, including separately managed accounts, sub-advised funds, and other sponsored investment
funds offered to investors outside the U.S. and through variable annuity life insurance plans.

In particular, the investment advisory results for the T. Rowe Price funds have been strong. At
least 70% of the funds across their share classes surpassed their Lipper peer group averages on a
total return basis for the one-, three-, five-, and 10-year periods ended December 31, 2005. In
addition, 59% of our rated mutual funds in the U.S. ended the year with an overall rating of
four or five stars from Morningstar, compared with 32.5%
for the overall industry.

Our series of target date Retirement Funds, which are designed to provide shareholders with single,
diversified portfolios that invest in underlying T. Rowe Price funds and automatically shift asset
allocations between funds as the investor ages, continue to be a significant part of asset growth.
Total assets in the Retirement Funds reached $8.4 billion at December 31, 2005, an increase of $4.8
billion over the course of 2005.

PRICE FUNDS. We provide investment advisory, distribution and other administrative services to the
Price funds under various agreements. Investment advisory services are provided to each fund under
individual investment management agreements that grant the fund the right to use the T. Rowe Price
name. The boards of the respective funds, including a majority of directors who are not interested
persons of the funds or of T. Rowe Price Group (as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended), must approve the investment management agreements annually. Fund shareholders must
approve material changes to these investment management agreements. Each agreement automatically
terminates in the event of its assignment (as defined in the Investment Company Act) and,
generally, either party may terminate the agreement without penalty after a 60-day notice. The
termination of one or more of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations.

Advisory Services. Investment advisory revenues are based upon the daily net assets managed in
each fund. Additional fees are earned for advisory-related administrative services as discussed
below. Independent directors and trustees of the Price funds regularly review our fee structures.

The advisory fee paid by each of the Price funds generally is computed each day by multiplying a
fund’s net assets by a specific fee. For the majority of the Price funds, the fee is equal to the
sum of a group charge that is set based on the combined net assets of those funds and an individual
fund charge that is set based on the fund’s specific investment objective. The 2005 fee rates
determined in this manner varied from a low of 31 basis points for the U.S. Treasury Money to a
high of 106 basis points for the Emerging Markets Stock, Emerging Europe & Mediterranean,
International Discovery, and Latin America funds. To the extent that the combined net assets of
the funds increase, the group charge component of the fee and each overall fund fee decreases.
Details of each fund’s fee arrangement are available in its prospectus.

Each of the Price funds has a distinct investment objective that has been developed as part of our
strategy to provide a broad, comprehensive selection of investing opportunities. The Investor
class of all Price funds can be purchased in the United States on a no-load basis, without a sales
commission or 12b-1 fee. No-load mutual fund shares offer investors a low-cost and relatively easy
method of directly investing in a variety of stock and bond portfolios.

Certain of the T. Rowe Price mutual funds also offer an Advisor and/or R class of shares that are
distributed to mutual fund shareholders through third-party financial intermediaries. These share
classes incur 12b-1 fees of 25 and 50 basis points, respectively, for distribution, administration,
and personal services. Our subsidiary, T. Rowe Price Investment Services, is the principal
distributor of the T. Rowe Price mutual fund shares. We recognize 12b-1 fee revenue on these
classes of fund shares pursuant to the funds’ 12b-1 plans. Payment of the fee is made to each
intermediary pursuant to the 12b-1 plans and each intermediary’s agreement with T. Rowe Price
Investment Services.

-4-

In accounting for the 12b-1 fees, the applicable mutual fund share classes
incur the related expense and we recognize the corresponding administrative revenue in our
consolidated statement of income. We also recognize the corresponding expense for the payments to
each third-party financial intermediary in our consolidated statement of income as part of other
operating expenses. The revenue that we recognize from the funds and the expense that we recognize
for the fees paid to third party intermediaries are equal in amount and, therefore, do not impact
our net operating income.

We do not receive any 12b-1 fees on the primary Investor class of T. Rowe Price mutual fund shares.

We believe that our lower fund cost structure, distribution methods, and fund shareholder and
administrative services help promote the stability of our fund assets under management through
market cycles.

Each Price fund typically bears all expenses associated with its operation and the issuance and
redemption of its securities. In particular, each fund pays investment advisory fees; shareholder
servicing fees and expenses; fund accounting fees and expenses; transfer agent fees; custodian fees
and expenses; legal and auditing fees; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and
shareholder reports to existing shareholders; registration fees and expenses; proxy and annual
meeting expenses; and independent trustee or director fees and expenses.

Several of the Price funds have different fee arrangements. The Equity Market Index funds and the
Summit funds each have single, all-inclusive fees covering all investment management and operating
expenses. Each of the funds in the Spectrum series and the Retirement date series of mutual funds
invest in a broadly diversified portfolio of other Price funds and have no separate investment
advisory fee. However, they indirectly bear the expenses of the funds in which they invest.
Mutual funds for institutional investors each have separate advisory fee arrangements.

We usually provide that a newly organized fund’s expenses will not exceed a specified percentage of
its net assets during an initial operating period. We absorb all advisory fees and other mutual
fund expenses in excess of these self-imposed limits.

Except as noted above for 12b-1 fees, we bear all advertising and promotion expenses associated
with our distribution of the Price funds. These costs are recognized currently, and include
advertising and direct mail communications to potential fund shareholders as well as substantial
staff and communications capabilities to respond to investor inquiries. Marketing and promotional
efforts are focused in the print media, television, and the Internet. In addition, we direct
considerable marketing efforts to defined contribution plans that invest in mutual funds.
Advertising and promotion expenditures vary over time based on investor interest, market
conditions, new investment offerings, and the development and expansion of new marketing
initiatives, including those arising from international expansion and enhancements to our web site.

Administrative Services. We provide advisory-related administrative services to the Price funds
through our subsidiaries. T. Rowe Price Services provides mutual fund transfer agency and
shareholder services, including maintenance of staff, facilities, and technology and other
equipment to respond to inquiries from fund shareholders. T. Rowe Price Associates provides mutual
fund accounting services, including maintenance of financial records, preparation of financial
statements and reports, daily valuation of portfolio securities and computation of daily net asset
values per share. T. Rowe Price Retirement Plan Services provides participant accounting, plan
administration and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans that invest
in the Price funds. Plan sponsors and participants compensate us for some services while the Price
funds compensate us for maintaining and administering the individual participant accounts for those
plans that invest in the funds.

Our trustee services are provided by another subsidiary, T. Rowe Price Trust Company. Through this
Maryland-chartered limited-service trust company, we offer common trust funds for investment by
qualified retirement plans and serve as trustee for retirement plans and IRAs. T. Rowe Price Trust
Company may not accept deposits and cannot make personal or commercial loans. Another subsidiary,
T. Rowe Price Savings Bank, issues federally insured certificates of deposit.

We also provide investment advisory services to shareholders and potential investors in the Price
funds through our subsidiary T. Rowe Price Advisory Services. These services currently include an
Investment Checkup of an individual’s financial situation, the Retirement Income Manager for
developing an individual’s personal income and investment strategy during retirement, and a
Rollover Investment Service for investing retirement plan distributions.

Fund Assets. At December 31, 2005, assets under our management in the Price funds aggregated
$170.2 billion, an increase of nearly $25 billion from the beginning of the year. The following
table presents the net assets (in millions) of our largest funds (net assets in excess of $250
million) at December 31, 2004 and 2005 and the year each fund was started. The Spectrum and
Retirement series of funds are not listed in the table because their assets are included in the
underlying funds.

OTHER INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS. We managed $99.3 billion at December 31, 2005 in other client
investment portfolios, up $9.6 billion from the beginning of the year. We provide investment
advisory services to these clients through our subsidiaries on a separately managed or subadvised
account basis and through sponsored investment portfolios generally organized by us such as common
trust funds, partnerships, the Luxembourg-based mutual funds, and variable annuity life insurance
plans. At December 31, these portfolios included the following investment assets:

Our fees for managing these investment portfolios are computed using the value of assets under our
management. In 2005, more than 60% of these advisory fees were recognized based on daily
valuations. The balance of these managed investment portfolios are generally billed quarterly.
End of billing period valuations generated about 30% of the 2005 advisory fees from other managed
portfolios while beginning of billing period values were the basis for less than 10% of these fees.

We charge fees for investment management based on, among other things, the specific investment
services to be provided. Our standard form of investment advisory agreement for client accounts
provides that the agreement may be terminated at any time and that any unearned fees paid in
advance will be refunded.

REGULATION. T. Rowe Price Associates, T. Rowe Price International, T. Rowe Price Global Investment
Services, T. Rowe Price Global Asset Management, T. Rowe Price (Canada), and T. Rowe Price Advisory
Services are registered with the SEC as investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of
1940. T. Rowe Price Global Investment Services, T. Rowe Price Global Asset Management, and T. Rowe
Price International are regulated by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) in Great Britain and,
in certain cases, by other foreign regulators. Our transfer agent services subsidiaries are
registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and our trust company is regulated by the
State of Maryland, Commissioner of Financial Regulation. T. Rowe Price Savings Bank is regulated
by the Office of Thrift Supervision, U.S. Department of the Treasury. T. Rowe Price (Canada) is
also registered with the Ontario and Manitoba securities commissions.

T. Rowe Price Investment Services is a registered broker-dealer and member of the National
Association of Securities Dealers and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation. We provide
discount brokerage services through this subsidiary primarily to complement the other services
provided to shareholders of the Price funds. Pershing, a third-party clearing broker, maintains
all our discount brokerage’s customer accounts and clears all their transactions.

All aspects of our business are subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations. These
laws and regulations are primarily intended to benefit or protect our clients and the Price funds’
shareholders. They generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers,
including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of our business in the event that we fail to
comply with laws and regulations. Possible sanctions that may be imposed on us in the event that
we fail to comply include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in
certain business activities for specified periods of time, revocation of our investment adviser and
other registrations, censures, and fines.

Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to net capital requirements including those of various
federal, state, and foreign regulatory agencies. Our subsidiaries’ net capital, as defined, meets
or exceeds all minimum requirements.

COMPETITION. As a member of the financial services industry, we are subject to substantial
competition in all aspects of our business. A significant number of proprietary and other
sponsors’ mutual funds are sold to the public by other investment management firms, broker-dealers,
mutual fund companies, banks and insurance companies. We compete with brokerage and investment
banking firms, insurance companies, banks, and other financial institutions in all aspects of our
business and in every country in which we offer our advisory services. Many of these financial
institutions have substantially greater resources than we do. We compete with other providers of
investment management services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment
portfolios offered, investment performance, and the scope and quality of our services.

We believe that competition within the investment management industry will increase as a result of
consolidation and acquisition activity. In order to maintain and enhance our competitive position,
we may review acquisition and venture opportunities and, if appropriate, engage in discussions or
negotiations that could lead to acquisitions or new financial relationships.

-7-

EMPLOYEES. At December 31, 2005, we employed 4,372 associates, up 5.6% from the end of 2004. We
may add additional temporary and part-time personnel to our staff from time to time to meet
periodic and special project demands, primarily for technology and mutual fund administrative
services.

SEC FILINGS. We make available free of charge through our Internet web site our annual report on
Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those
reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably
practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and
Exchange Commission. To obtain any of this information, access our Internet home page at

Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

An investment in our common stock involves various risks, including those mentioned below and those
that are discussed from time-to-time in our other periodic filings with the SEC. Investors should
carefully consider these risks, along with the other information contained in this report, before
making an investment decision regarding our common stock. There may be additional risks of which
we are currently unaware, or which we currently consider immaterial. All of these risks could have
a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and value of our
common stock.

RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AND THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY

Our revenues are based on the market value and composition of the assets under our management,
all of which are subject to fluctuation caused by factors outside of our control.

We derive our revenues primarily from investment advisory services provided by our subsidiaries to
individual and institutional investors in the T. Rowe Price mutual funds and other investment
portfolios. Our investment advisory fees typically are calculated as a percentage of the market
value of the assets under our management. We generally earn higher fees on assets invested in our
equity funds and equity investment portfolios than we earn on assets invested in our fixed income
funds and portfolios. Among equity investments, there is a significant variation in fees earned
from index-based investments at the low end and emerging markets funds and portfolios at the high
end. Fees also vary across the fixed income funds and portfolios, though not as widely as equity
investments, with money market securities at the low end and non-U.S. bonds at the high end. As a
result, our revenues are dependent on the value and composition of the assets under our management,
all of which are subject to substantial fluctuation due to many factors, including:

•

Investor Mobility. Our investors generally may withdraw their funds at any time, on very short
notice and without any significant penalty.

•

General Market Declines. A general downturn in stock or bond prices would cause the value of
assets under our management to decrease, and may also cause investors to withdraw their
investments, thereby further decreasing the level of assets under our management.

•

Investment Performance. If the investment performance of our managed portfolios is less than that
of our competitors or applicable third-party benchmarks, we could lose existing and potential
customers and suffer a decrease in assets under management. Institutional investors in particular consider changing
investment advisors based upon poor relative investment performance. Individual investors in
contrast are more likely to react to poor absolute investment performance.

•

Global Economies. National and international political and economic events may cause financial
market declines that lower the value of assets under our management, and may cause investors to
withdraw funds.

•

Investing Trends. Changes in investing trends and, in particular, retirement savings trends may
reduce interest in our funds and portfolios and may alter our mix of assets.

•

Interest Rate Changes. Investor interest in and the valuation of our fixed income investment
funds and portfolios are affected by changes in interest rates.

•

Tax Regulation Changes. Changes in the status of tax deferred retirement plan investments and
tax-free municipal bonds, the capital gains and corporate dividend tax rates, and other individual
and corporate tax rates and regulations could adversely affect investor behavior and may cause
investors to view certain investment offerings less favorably and withdraw their investment assets,
thereby decreasing the level of assets under our management.

A decrease in the value of assets under our management, or adverse change in their composition,
could have a material adverse effect on our investment advisory fees and revenues. For any period
in which revenues decline, net income and operating margins will likely decline by a greater
proportion because certain expenses will be fixed over that finite period.

-8-

A significant majority of our revenues are based on contracts with the Price funds that are
subject to termination without cause and on short notice.

We provide investment advisory, distribution and other administrative services to the Price funds
under various agreements. Investment advisory services are provided to each Price fund under
individual investment management agreements. The board of each Price fund must annually approve
the terms of the investment management and service agreements and can terminate the agreement upon
60-day notice. If a Price fund seeks to lower the fees that we receive or terminate its contract
with us, we would experience a decline in fees earned from the Price funds, which could have a
material adverse effect on our revenues and net income.

We operate in an intensely competitive industry, which could cause a loss of customers and
their assets, thereby reducing our assets under management and our revenues and net income.

We are subject to competition in all aspects of our business from:

•

asset
management firms,

•

mutual fund companies,

•

commercial banks and thrift
institutions,

•

insurance companies,

•

hedge funds,

•

exchange traded funds,

•

brokerage and investment banking
firms, and

•

other financial institutions including multinational firms and subsidiaries of diversified
conglomerates.

Many of these financial institutions have substantially greater resources than
we do and may offer a broader range of products or operate in more markets. Some operate in a
different regulatory environment than we do which may give them certain competitive advantages in
the investment products and portfolio structures that they offer. We compete with other providers
of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the
investment portfolios offered, our investment performance, and the scope and quality of our
investment advice and other client services. Some institutions have proprietary products and
distribution channels that make it more difficult for us to compete with them. We believe that
competition within the investment management industry will increase as a result of consolidation
and acquisition activity and because new competitors face few barriers to entry. Most of our
investment portfolios are available without sales or redemption fees, which means that investors
may be more willing to transfer assets to competing funds.

If current or potential customers decide to use one of our competitors, we could face a significant
decline in market share, assets under management, revenues, and net income. If we are required to
lower our fees in order to remain competitive, our net income could be significantly reduced
because some of our expenses are fixed, especially over shorter periods of time, and others may not
decrease in proportion to the decrease in revenues.

Our success depends on our key personnel and our financial performance could be negatively
affected by the loss of their services.

Our success depends on our highly skilled personnel, including our portfolio and fund managers,
investment analysts, management and client relationship personnel, and corporate officers, many of
whom have specialized expertise and extensive experience in our industry. Financial services
professionals are in high demand, and we face significant competition for qualified employees. Our
key employees do not have employment contracts, and generally can terminate their employment with
us at any time. We cannot assure that we will be able to retain or replace key personnel. In
order to retain or replace our key personnel, we may be required to increase compensation, which
would decrease net income. The loss of key personnel could damage our reputation and make it more
difficult to retain and attract new employees and investors. Losses of assets from our client
investors would decrease our revenues and net income, possibly materially.

Certain of the Price funds and other investment portfolios are vulnerable to market-specific
risks that could adversely affect investment performance, our reputation and our revenues.

Several of the Price funds and investment portfolios, particularly the emerging market and non-U.S.
investments, are subject to political and economic instability, exchange-rate fluctuations,
illiquid and highly volatile markets, and other risks that could materially decrease the investment
returns available in foreign markets. A significant decrease in the investment return or net asset
value of any Price fund or investment portfolio could harm our reputation and cause a decrease in
assets under management, including from client asset withdrawals. The result could be a material
decline in our revenues and net income.

-9-

Our operations are complex and a failure to perform operational tasks or the misrepresentation
of products and services could have an adverse affect on our reputation and subject us to
regulatory sanctions, fines, penalties, and litigation.

Operating risks include:

•

failure to properly perform fund or portfolio recordkeeping responsibilities,
including portfolio accounting, security pricing, corporate actions, investment restrictions
compliance, daily net asset value computations, account reconciliations, required distributions to
fund shareholders to comply with tax regulations;

•

failure to properly perform transfer agent and participant recordkeeping responsibilities,
including transaction processing, tax reporting and record retention; and failure to identify
excessive trading in mutual funds by our customers or plan participants;

•

sales and marketing risks, including the intentional or unintentional misrepresentation of
products and services in advertising materials, public relations information, or other external
communications, and failure to properly calculate and present investment performance data
accurately and in accordance with established guidelines and regulations.

Any damage to our reputation could harm our business and lead to a loss of revenues and net
income.

We have spent many years developing our reputation for integrity, strong investment performance,
and superior client services. Our brand is a valuable intangible asset, but it is vulnerable to a
variety of threats that can be difficult or impossible to control, and costly or even impossible to
remediate. Regulatory inquiries and rumors can tarnish or substantially damage our reputation,
even if they are satisfactorily addressed. Any damage to our brand could impede our ability to
attract and retain customers and key personnel, and reduce the amount of assets under our
management, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income.

Our expenses are subject to significant fluctuations that could materially decrease net
income.

Our operating results are dependent on the level of our expenses, which can vary significantly for
many reasons, including:

•

changes in the level of our advertising expenses, including the costs of expanding investment
advisory services to investors outside of the United States and further penetrating U.S.
distribution channels,

•

variations in the level of total compensation expense due to, among other things, bonuses, stock
option grants, stock awards, changes in employee benefit costs due to regulatory or plan design
changes, changes in our employee count and mix, and competitive factors,

•

a future impairment of goodwill recognized in our balance sheet,

•

material fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our operations
abroad,

•

expenses and capital costs incurred to enhance our administrative and operating services
infrastructure, such as technology assets, depreciation, amortization, and research and
development,

•

unanticipated costs incurred to protect investor accounts and client goodwill, and

•

disruptions of third-party services such as communications, power, and mutual fund transfer agent
and accounting systems.

Under our agreements with our mutual funds, we charge our mutual funds certain administrative and
other expenses based upon contracted terms. If we fail to accurately estimate our underlying expense levels or otherwise are required to incur expenses
relating to the mutual funds that are not paid by the funds, our operating results will be
adversely affected.

-10-

We have contracted with third-party financial intermediaries that distribute our investment
portfolios, and such relationships may not be available or profitable to us in the future.

About 30% of our assets under management are sourced from third-party financial intermediaries that
distribute our managed investment portfolios in the U.S. and abroad. These intermediaries
generally offer their clients various investment products in addition to, and in competition with,
our investment offerings, and have no contractual obligation to encourage investment in our
portfolios. It would be difficult for us to acquire or retain the management of those assets
without the assistance of the intermediaries, and we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain
an adequate number of successful distribution relationships. In addition, some investors rely on
third party financial planners, registered investment advisers, and other consultants or financial
professionals to advise them on the choice of investment adviser and investment portfolio. These
professionals and consultants can favor a competing investment portfolio as better meeting their
particular client’s needs. We cannot assure that our investment offerings will be among their
recommended choices in the future. Further, their recommendations can change over time and we
could lose their recommendation and the related client assets under management. Mergers,
acquisitions, and other ownership or management changes could also adversely impact our
relationships with these third party intermediaries. The presence of any of the adverse conditions
discussed above would reduce revenues and net income, possibly by material amounts.

Natural disasters and other unpredictable events could adversely affect our operations.

Armed conflict, terrorist attacks, power failures, and natural disasters could adversely affect our
revenues, expenses and net income by:

•

decreasing
investment returns on our portfolios,

•

causing disruptions in national or global economies that decrease investor confidence and make
investment products generally less attractive,

•

inflicting losses in human
capital,

•

interrupting our business
operations,

•

triggering technology delays or
failures, and

•

requiring substantial capital expenditures and operating expenses to remediate damage, replace
facilities, and restore operations.

We have developed various backup systems and contingency plans to deal with these possible events
but we cannot be assured that they will be adequate in all circumstances that could arise or that
material interruptions and disruptions will not occur. In addition, we rely to varying degrees on
outside vendors for disaster contingency support, and we cannot be assured that these vendors will
be able to perform in an adequate and timely manner. If we lose any employees, or if we are unable
to respond adequately to such an event in a timely manner, we may be unable to continue our
business operations, which could lead to a tarnished reputation and loss of customers that results
in a decrease in assets under management, lower revenues and materially reduced net income.

Our investment income and asset levels may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in our
investment portfolio.

We currently have a substantial portion of our assets invested in our money market, stock, and bond mutual funds. All of these investments are subject to investment market
risk and our income from these investments could be adversely affected by a decline in value. In
addition, related investment income has fluctuated significantly over the years depending upon the
performance of our investment portfolio, including the impact of market conditions, liquid
corporate positions, and the size of our longer-term investment portfolio. Fluctuations in other
investment income can be expected to occur in the future.

The investment performance of our savings bank subsidiary could adversely affect our assets and
results of operations.

We have a propriety savings bank subsidiary, which accepts deposits from our customers, pays a
fixed rate of interest to our depositors and invests in fixed income securities. Although we
generally hold our fixed income investments to maturity on a basis which correlates to the
maturities of our customer deposits, fluctuations in interest rates could result in losses in these
fixed income investments and could result in a mismatch between the interest rate return on our
investment portfolio and the interest paid on our customer deposits. To the extent that this
occurs, our assets and results of operations could be adversely affected.

-11-

We may elect to pursue growth in the United States and abroad through acquisitions or joint
ventures, which exposes us to risks inherent in assimilating new operations and in expanding into
new jurisdictions.

In order to maintain and enhance our competitive position, we may review and pursue acquisition and
venture opportunities. We cannot assure that we will identify and consummate any such transactions
on acceptable terms or have sufficient resources to accomplish such a strategy. In addition, any
strategic transaction can involve a number of risks, including: additional demands on our staff;
unanticipated problems regarding integration of investor account and investment security
recordkeeping, different facilities and technologies, and new employees; adverse affects in the
event acquired intangible assets or goodwill become impaired; and the existence of liabilities or
contingencies not disclosed to or otherwise known by us prior to closing a transaction.

LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS

Compliance with a complex regulatory environment imposes significant financial and strategic
costs on our business, and non-compliance could result in fines and penalties.

We are subject to extensive regulation by foreign and domestic governments, regulatory agencies
such as the SEC in the United States and the FSA in United Kingdom, and self-regulatory
organizations such as the NASD. Our ability to conduct our business is in large part dictated by
such regulation, including federal laws such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the USA Patriot Act
of 2001, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), regulations relating to the
mutual fund industry specifically and securities laws generally, accounting rules, and banking and
tax laws. Compliance with these complex regulations and our disclosure and financial reporting
obligations requires significant investments of time and money and could limit our ability to enter
into new lines of business. Further, the regulations imposed by one jurisdiction may conflict with
the regulations imposed by another, and these differences may be difficult or impossible to
reconcile.

Our regulatory environment is frequently altered by new regulations and by revisions to, and
evolving interpretations of, existing regulations. Future changes could require us to modify or
curtail our investment offerings and business operations.

If we are unable to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject
to criminal and civil liability, the suspension of our employees, fines, penalties, sanctions,
injunctive relief, exclusion from certain markets, or temporary or permanent loss of licenses or
registrations necessary to conduct our business. A regulatory proceeding, even if it does not
result in a finding of wrongdoing or sanctions, could consume substantial expenditures of time and
capital. Any regulatory investigation, and any failure to maintain compliance with applicable laws
and regulations, could severely damage our reputation, adversely affect our ability to conduct
business, and decrease revenue and net income.

Legal and regulatory developments in the mutual fund and investment advisory industry could
increase our regulatory burden, cause a loss of mutual fund investors, and reduce our revenues.

Because of trading abuses at several investment management firms, regulators have shown increasing
interest in the oversight of the mutual fund and investment advisory industry. Federal agencies
have adopted regulations designed to strengthen controls and restore investor confidence in the
industry and more rules are expected in the future. These new and proposed rules will place
greater compliance and administrative burdens on us, which could increase our expenses without
increasing revenues. In addition, proposed regulations could require the Price funds to reduce the
level of certain mutual fund fees paid to us or require us to bear additional expenses, which would
affect our operating results. Further, adverse results of regulatory investigations of mutual fund
and investment advisory firms could tarnish the reputation of mutual funds and investment advisers
generally, causing investors to avoid further fund investments or redeem their balances.
Redemptions would decrease the assets under our management, which would reduce our advisory
revenues and net income.

We may in the future be involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that may not be covered by
insurance.

We are subject to regulatory and governmental inquiries and civil litigation. An adverse outcome
of any such proceeding could involve substantial financial penalties. There has been increased
incidence of litigation and regulatory investigations in the financial services industry in recent
years, including customer claims and class action suits alleging substantial monetary damages.
From time to time, various claims against us arise in the ordinary course of business, including
employment-related claims.

-12-

We carry insurance in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate. We cannot
assure that our insurance will cover all liabilities and losses to which we may be exposed, or that
our insurance policies will continue to be available on acceptable terms. Certain insurance
coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods. As our
insurance policies come up for renewal, we may need to assume higher deductibles or other
co-insurance liability, or pay higher premiums, which would increase our expenses and reduce our
net income.

Net capital requirements may impede the business operations of our subsidiaries.

Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to net capital requirements imposed by various federal,
state, and foreign authorities. Our subsidiaries’ net capital meets or exceeds all minimum
requirements; however, a significant operating loss or extraordinary charge against net capital
could adversely affect the ability of our subsidiaries to expand or even maintain their operations
if we were unable to make additional investments in them.

TECHNOLOGY RISKS

We require specialized technology to operate our business and would be adversely affected if
our technology became inoperative or obsolete.

We depend on highly specialized and, in many cases, proprietary technology to support our business
functions, including, among other functions:

All of our technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses,
natural disasters, power failures, acts of war or terrorism, and other causes. Some of our
software is licensed from and supported by outside vendors upon whom we rely to prevent operating
system failure. A suspension or termination of these licenses or the related support, upgrades and
maintenance could cause system delays or interruption. If our technology systems were to fail and
we were unable to recover in a timely way, we would be unable to fulfill critical business
functions, which could lead to a loss of customers and could harm our reputation. Technological
breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other
regulatory requirements, exposing us to disciplinary action and to liability to our customers.

In addition, our continued success depends on our ability to effectively integrate operations
across many countries, and to adopt new or adapt existing technologies to meet client, industry and
regulatory demands. We might be required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain
competitive technology. If we are unable to upgrade our technology in a timely fashion, we might
lose customers and fail to maintain regulatory compliance, which could affect our results of
operations and severely damage our reputation.

We could be subject to losses if we fail to properly safeguard sensitive and confidential
information.

As part of our normal operations, we maintain and transmit confidential information about our
clients as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations. Our systems could
be victimized by unauthorized users or corrupted by computer viruses or other malicious software
code, or authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release confidential or
proprietary information. Such disclosure could, among other things:

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.

We did not receive any written comments during 2005 from the Commission staff regarding our
periodic and current reports under the Act. There are no comments that remain unresolved from any
prior period.

-13-

Item 2. Properties.

The lease on our corporate offices, which include almost 377,000 square feet at 100 East Pratt
Street in Baltimore, expires in mid-2017. We plan to make tenant improvements to these offices
over the next two to three years and the lessor is obligated under the terms of the lease to
provide partial funding for some of those improvements. Our London and other offices as well as
our customer service call center in Tampa, Florida are also leased.

Our operating and servicing facilities include properties in suburban campus settings comprising
about 650,000 square feet in Owings Mills, Maryland and 140,000 square feet in Colorado Springs.
We also are expanding our technology center to about 124,000 square feet on a separate parcel of
owned land in Owings Mills in proximity to the campus facilities. Acreage that we own on which
these facilities are located will accommodate additional future development.

We maintain investor centers for walk-in traffic and investor meetings in leased facilities located
in the Baltimore; Boston (Wellesley, Massachusetts); Chicago (Oak Brook, Illinois); Los Angeles
(Woodland Hills, California); New Jersey/New York City (Short Hills, New Jersey); San Francisco
(Walnut Creek, California); Tampa; and Washington (Washington, D.C. and McLean, Virginia) areas.
We also have investor centers in our owned facilities in Colorado Springs and Owings Mills. We are
currently building out and, later in 2006, expect to begin operating two additional leased centers
in Northbrook, Illinois and Garden City, New York. These investor centers allow us to be available
to a large number of our investors.

Information concerning our anticipated capital expenditures in 2006 and our future minimum rental
payments under noncancelable operating leases at December 31, 2005 is set forth in the capital
resources and liquidity discussion in Item 7 of this Form 10-K.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

In September 2003, a purported class action (T.K. Parthasarathy, et al., including Woodbury, v. T.
Rowe Price International Funds, Inc., et al.) was filed in the Circuit Court, Third Judicial
Circuit, Madison County, Illinois, against T. Rowe Price International and the T. Rowe Price
International Funds with respect to the T. Rowe Price International Stock Fund. The basic
allegations in the case were that the T. Rowe Price defendants did not make appropriate value
adjustments to the foreign securities owned by the T. Rowe Price International Stock Fund prior to
calculating the Fund’s daily share prices, thereby allegedly enabling market timing traders to
trade the Fund’s shares in such a way as to disadvantage long-term investors. The plaintiffs
sought monetary damages. The case was removed on April 22, 2005 to the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of Illinois, which dismissed the case on May 27, 2005. The Plaintiff appealed to
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. The appeal was stayed pending the outcome of a
petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court in a related case. That petition has now been
granted, but the Court of Appeals has not indicated whether it will now decide this case or await
further developments in the related case.

From time to time, various claims against us arise in the ordinary course of business, including
employment-related claims. In the opinion of management, after consultation with counsel, it is
unlikely that any adverse determination in one or more pending claims would have a material adverse
effect on our financial position or results of operations.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

None during the fourth quarter of 2005.

Item. Executive officers of the registrant.

The following information includes the names, ages, and positions of our executive officers. There
are no arrangements or understandings pursuant to which any person serves as an officer. The first
six individuals are members of our management committee.

We expect to declare and pay cash dividends at the $.28 per-share quarterly rate for the first
three quarters of 2006. The increase made to our quarterly dividend rate in December 2005 was the
twentieth consecutive annual increase since we became a public company in April 1986. There can be
no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at increasing rates or at all.

Our common stockholders have approved all of our equity compensation plans. These plans provide
for the issuance of up to 33,922,121 shares of our common stock at December 31, 2005, including
22,948,424 shares that may be issued upon the exercise of outstanding stock options, which have a
weighted average exercise price of $42.84, and 10,973,697 shares that remain available for future
issuance. Under the terms of the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, the number
of shares provided and available for future issuance will increase as we repurchase common stock in
the future from the proceeds of stock option exercises.

During 2005, our only repurchases of common shares were in the first half of the year when we
repurchased 1,300,000 shares for $75.9 million in open market transactions. As of December 31,
2005, a 2003 board of directors’ resolution still allowed us to repurchase up to 4,146,010 shares
of our common stock.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

GENERAL.

Our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory services provided to
U.S. individual and institutional investors in our sponsored mutual funds and other managed
investment portfolios. Investment advisory clients outside the United States account for 5% of our
assets under management at December 31, 2005.

We manage a broad range of U.S. and international stock, bond, and money market mutual funds and
other investment portfolios which meet the varied needs and objectives of individual and
institutional investors. Investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and
composition of assets under our management. Accordingly, fluctuations in financial markets and in
the composition of assets under management impact our revenues and results of operations.

Financial market results in the United States during 2005 were mixed with the three major stock
market indexes falling below end of 2004 levels for much of the year. There were periods of
strength, however, as all three indexes reached four-year highs before falling back late in the
year. Investor concerns about rising interest rates and record high fuel prices were compounded by
the hurricane damage to the Gulf Coast region of the United States. Military action, terrorism and
the uncertainties surrounding the strength of the U.S. economy also continued to weigh on the
financial markets. The S&P 500 closed 2005 with the best performance among the indexes, posting a
modest 3% return for the year. The NASDAQ index, which is heavily weighted with technology
companies, ended the year up only 1.4% while the Dow Jones Industrials closed down .6% for the
year.

Foreign equity markets were stronger in 2005, with the Dow Jones Latin America, Asia/Pacific, and
Europe Indexes all outperforming their U.S. counterparts. Lower global interest rates, higher
corporate profits, and stronger economic conditions, including those in emerging markets, broadly
presented favorable conditions for the financial markets outside the United States.

As for fixed income securities, yields for 10-year U.S. Treasuries rose only 4% to close 2005 at
4.39%. By year-end, the yield curve had inverted with short-term rates exceeding long-term rates
and investors worried about the possibility of a pending economic downturn. The Federal Reserve
continued its series of .25% increases in 2005, pushing the target short-term rate up 200 basis
points over the course of the year to 4.25%. As 2006 began, the Federal Reserve signaled that its
series of tightening moves was slowing and nearing an end.

Despite this less than robust financial environment in 2005, total assets under our management
ended 2005 at a record $269.5 billion, up $34.3 billion during the year. Strong relative
investment performance and brand awareness contributed significantly to investors entrusting $16.1
billion of net cash inflows to our management in 2005, down from the $20.7 billion record net cash
inflows in 2004. Higher market valuations and income increased assets under our management by
$18.2 billion during 2005.

Assets under management at December 31, 2005 include $208.3 billion in equity securities and $61.2
billion in bond and money market holdings. The underlying investment portfolios consist of $170.2
billion in the T. Rowe Price mutual funds distributed in the United States and $99.3 billion in
other investment portfolios that we manage, including separately managed accounts, sub-advised
funds, and other sponsored investment funds offered to investors outside the U.S. and through
variable annuity life insurance plans.

In an improving market environment for 2006, we would expect to increase our expenditures to
attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from our existing clients.
These efforts may involve significant costs that precede the recognition of any future revenues
that we may realize from increases to our assets under management.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

2005 versus 2004.

Investment advisory revenues were up 20%, or nearly $207 million, to
more than $1.2 billion due to the $40.2 billion increase in average assets under management. Net
revenues increased $235 million to $1.5 billion. Net operating income increased nearly 25% to $655
million from $525 million. Net income increased nearly $94 million to almost $431 million, up 28%
from $337 million. Diluted earnings per share increased 25.5% from $2.51 to $3.15.

-16-

Investment advisory revenues earned from the T. Rowe Price mutual funds distributed in the United
States increased $164.2 million to $900 million. Average mutual fund assets were $156.2 billion
during 2005, $28.1 billion, or 22%, higher than the $128.1 billion average during 2004. Mutual
fund assets ended 2005 at $170.2 billion, up $24.7 billion during the year. Additions to the U.S.
mutual funds from the financial intermediary, individual direct and defined contribution retirement
plan channels were $12.5 billion, basically unchanged from our 2004 experience when $12.7 billion
was added to the funds. Investors added $9.7 billion into the U.S. stock funds, $2.1 billion into
our international stock funds, and $.7 billion into our bond and money market funds. The Growth
Stock, Capital Appreciation and Equity Income funds each added more than $1 billion of net investor
inflows and, together, accounted for $6.5 billion of the funds’ net inflows. Cash inflows during
2005 also included nearly $400 million resulting from the merger of the TD Waterhouse Index Funds
into four of the T. Rowe Price index funds. Higher market valuations and income, net of dividends
not reinvested, added $12.2 billion to fund assets in 2005.

Investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage increased
$42.4 million to $335 million. Average assets in these portfolios were $90.9 billion, up $12.1
billion, or 15%, from $78.8 billion in 2004. Ending assets in these portfolios were $99.3 billion,
up $9.6 billion from the beginning of 2005. Market gains and income added $6.0 billion while net
investor inflows were $3.6 billion, down from $8.0 billion in 2004. Net inflows from subadvised
and separate account clients investing in U.S. securities more than offset the net outflows from
investors in some of our international investment portfolios.

Administrative fees and other income increased $28.3 million to $276 million. The change in these
revenues includes $23.9 million from our servicing activities including shareholder account and
transaction volume in our transfer agent and defined contribution plan recordkeeping services for
the mutual funds and their investors. Additionally, revenues increased $4.4 million from 12b-1
distribution fees received on greater assets under management in the Advisor and R classes of our
sponsored mutual fund shares. These changes in administrative fees are generally offset by similar
changes in related operating expenses that we incur to provide these services and distribute the
Advisor and R classes of mutual fund shares through third party financial intermediaries.

Operating expenses in 2005 were $105.4 million more than in 2004. Our largest expense,
compensation and related costs, increased $64.5 million, or 14%, from 2004. The number of our
associates, their total compensation, and the costs of their employee benefits have all increased.
Our bonus compensation is based on our operating results for the year, which for 2005 reflect our
strong relative and risk-adjusted investment performance, continued growth in assets under
management including new investment inflows, and sustained high-quality investor services. Base
salaries for our associates are increased modestly at the beginning of each year, and we increased
our average staff size 7% versus 2004, primarily to handle increased volume-related activities and
growth. At December 31, 2005, we employed 4,372 associates, up 3% from the 2005 average staffing
level.

Advertising and promotion expenditures were up 16% or $11.9 million versus 2004. We expect our
advertising and promotion expenditures in the first quarter of 2006 will be up about $3 million
versus the comparable 2005 first quarter. While market conditions will dictate the exact level of
our spending, we expect that our advertising and promotion expenditures for 2006 will be 5% to 10%
higher than in 2005. We vary our level of spending based on market conditions and investor demand
as well as our efforts to expand our investor base in the United States and abroad.

Occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increased more than $10.2 million.
Our costs for rented office facilities, including increased space, and related maintenance and
operating costs have increased along with our staff size and business needs. Longer-lived
buildings and non-depreciable land account for nearly two-thirds of the net book value of our
property and equipment at December 31, 2005.

Other operating expenses increased $18.8 million, including $4.4 million of distribution expenses
recognized on greater assets under management sourced from financial intermediaries who distribute
our Advisor and R classes of mutual fund shares. These distribution costs are offset by an equal
increase in our administrative revenues recognized from 12b-1 fees as discussed above. The cost of
information services increased $7.3 million from 2004, primarily because of our decision to pay for
non-broker-dealer third-party investment research and related services beginning in 2005. We
previously made modest use of fully permissible payments by brokers to obtain these services.
Other operating expenses also rose in 2005 to include a $2 million increase in charitable
contributions to our corporate foundation and to meet increased business demands.

-17-

Our net non-operating income, which includes the recognition of investment gains and losses as
well as interest income and credit facility expenses, increased $15.9 million to $24.4 million.
Larger money market and other mutual fund investment balances along with higher interest rates
added $12.2 million to our investment income. Other net investment gains added $3.1 million,
including $1.8 million realized as a result of the third-party acquisition of an entity in which we
had invested. Credit facility costs were down $.6 million as we reduced the size and ongoing cost
of our credit facility in mid-2004.

The 2005 provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is 36.6% down from 36.8% in
2004 due largely to the $1.4 million reversal of the valuation allowance for foreign net operating
loss carryforwards that is discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements. We currently expect
our effective tax rate to rise to 37.2% in 2006 with the adoption of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment

(SFAS 123R).

2004 versus 2003.

Both net revenues and total revenues increased more than $281 million to
nearly $1.3 billion. Net operating income increased $160 million to $525 million from $365
million. Net income increased about $110 million to $337 million, up more than 48% from $227.5
million in 2003. Diluted earnings per share increased nearly 42% from $1.77 to $2.51.

Investment advisory revenues were up 32% or $251 million in 2004 compared to 2003. Increased
assets under management drove the change as average mutual fund assets were more than $128 billion,
almost $29 billion higher than the $99.4 billion average in 2003. Average assets in other managed
portfolios were almost $79 billion in 2004, up more than $18 billion versus the average of $60.5
billion in 2003. Total average assets under management increased $47.0 billion during 2004 to end
the year at nearly $207 million.

Investment advisory revenues earned from the T. Rowe Price mutual funds distributed in the United
States increased $178 million. Mutual fund assets ended 2004 at $145.5 billion, up $28 billion
from the beginning of the year. Market appreciation and income, net of dividends paid and not
reinvested, added $15.3 billion to mutual fund assets during 2004 and net investor inflows added
another $12.7 billion. Net cash flows during 2004 were supported broadly by the financial
intermediary, individual direct, and defined contribution retirement plan channels, and were
concentrated in the U.S. domestic stock mutual funds. The Mid-Cap Value, Equity Income, Growth
Stock, Capital Appreciation, and Mid-Cap Growth funds each added more than $1 billion of net
investor inflows and, together, accounted for $9.5 billion of the funds’ net inflows in 2004. Bond
and money market funds added $1 billion of net investor flows while the international stock funds
had net outflows of less than $500 million.

Investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage increased
more than $73 million to almost $293 million in 2004. Ending assets in these portfolios were $89.7
billion, up $17.2 billion since the beginning of the year. Net inflows to these portfolios were $8
billion while market appreciation and income added $9.2 billion in 2004. Investment activity
through financial intermediaries in the United States, Japan and Europe, and new institutional
investors, including assignments from Europe and Australia, were responsible for these new
investment dollars.

Administrative fees and other income increased $30 million during 2004 to nearly $248 million. The
change in these revenues includes $20 million from our mutual fund transfer agent services,
including our defined contribution plan recordkeeping service. Additionally, revenues increased
$7.5 million
from 12b-1 distribution fees received on greater assets under management in the Advisor and R
classes of our sponsored mutual fund shares.

Operating expenses in 2004 were $121 million more than in the prior year. Our largest expense,
compensation and related costs, increased 20% or $75 million from 2003. The number of our
associates, their compensation, and the costs of their employee benefits have all increased. Our
2004 bonus program was higher than the prior year based on our better operating results and the
strong relative investment performance that our investment managers achieved. Base salaries for
our associates were increased modestly on January 1, and we added more than 350 associates during
2004, primarily to handle volume-related activities and business growth. At December 31, 2004, we
employed 4,139 associates.

Advertising and promotion expenditures during 2004 were up $15 million compared to 2003. We vary
our promotional spending based on market conditions and investor demand as well as our efforts to
expand our investor base in the United States and abroad.

Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $5 million in 2004, offsetting the increase of $3.9
million in other occupancy and facility costs.Longer-lived buildings and non-depreciable land
account for two-thirds of the net book value of our property and equipment at December 31,
2004. Costs of rented facilities and related operating costs were higher in 2004.

-18-

Other operating expenses in 2004 increased $32.4 million, including $7.5 million paid based on
greater assets under management that are sourced through financial intermediaries that distribute
our Advisor and R classes of mutual fund shares. These costs are funded from an equal increase in
our administrative revenues recognized from 12b-1 fees as discussed above. For 2004, we increased
our charitable contribution to our corporate foundation by $6 million. Other operating expenses
this year have risen to meet increased business demands. They include, among other things, travel
costs, information services, and professional fees for legal, audit, and consulting services and
regulatory compliance.

Overall, net operating income for 2004 increased $160 million, or 44%, from 2003.

Our net non-operating income increased $8 million from 2003 to $8.5 million. Greater cash balances
and higher interest rates in 2004 added $2.5 million, greater returns on fund investments added
$1.6 million, and gains recognized from the sale of investments in sponsored mutual funds added
$1.2 million. Foreign currency balances produced exchange rate gains of more than $1 million in
2004 compared with losses of $1 million on our yen-denominated debt before it was repaid in late
2003. Interest and related credit facility costs were down $.7 million in 2004 as we repaid all
outstanding debt in 2003 and reduced the size and cost of our credit facilities on an ongoing basis
in 2004.

The 2004 provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is 36.8% for 2004, down 1%
from 2003. Greater tax-exempt and non-taxable dividend income, use of foreign net operating loss
carryforwards, and settlements of prior year taxes at lower rates all contributed to this lower
rate.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY.

During 2005, stockholders’ equity increased from $1.7 billion to $2.0 billion. Available liquid
assets, including our mutual fund investments, exceed $1 billion at December 31, 2005. A $300
million undrawn, committed credit facility expiring in June 2007 is also available to the company.

Operating activities provided cash flows of $539 million in 2005, up $165 million versus 2004. Net
income accounted for nearly $94 million of the increase while timing differences in the cash
settlements of our assets and liabilities added $66 million. Net cash used in investing activities
totaled nearly $92 million, up $16 million from 2004. Capital spending for property and equipment
was $52 million in 2005, up nearly $9 million from 2004 levels. Our mutual fund net investments
were $37 million in 2005, an increase of $5 million from 2004. Net cash used in financing
activities totaled $144 million in 2005, up $109 million from 2004. We expended $76 million in
2005 to repurchase 1.3 million shares of our common stock compared to $18 million for 400,000
shares in 2004. We also distributed $23 million more to our stockholders in 2005 based on our
larger per-share quarterly dividend and collected $27 million less from option exercises that, at a
lower rate in 2005, resulted in 1.8 million fewer shares being issued versus in 2004.

Comparatively, operating activities provided cash flows of $374 million in 2004, up $77 million
from 2003, including $110 million of increased net income. Net cash used in investing activities
totaled $76 million and net cash used in financing activities totaled $35 million in 2004.

Net cash expended in investing activities increased $22 million in 2004 versus 2003. Our net cash
investments in sponsored mutual funds increased $25 million and our capital expenditures increased
$11 million. Offsetting these amounts was $11 million of lower net savings bank investments due to
lower net depositor inflows in 2004. Net cash used in financing activities decreased $83 million
versus 2003. Increased stock option exercises due to our higher common stock valuations generated
$48 million of greater cash proceeds in 2004. In 2003 we also repaid our last outstanding debt of
nearly $57 million. Offsetting these changes were the larger $11 million of new savings bank
deposits received in 2003 and $12.5 million more in dividends paid in 2004.

Property and equipment expenditures in 2006, including those for the build-out of our expanded
corporate and business continuity facilities and supporting operations, are anticipated to be about
$90 million and are expected to be funded from operating cash flows, including lessor payments
associated with leasehold improvements.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS.

The following table (in millions) presents a summary of our future obligations under the terms of
existing operating leases and other contractual cash purchase commitments at December 31, 2005.
Other purchase commitments include contractual amounts that will be due for the purchase of goods
or services to be used in our operations and may be cancelable at earlier times than those
indicated under certain conditions that may involve termination fees. Because these obligations
are of a normal recurring nature, we expect that we will fund them from future cash flows from
operations. The information presented does not include operating expenses or capital expenditures
that will be committed in the normal course of operations in 2006 and future years.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES.

The preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of
specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives. Further,
significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and
policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our balance sheet, the revenues and
expenses in our statement of income, and the information that is contained in our significant
accounting policies and notes to the financial statements. Making these estimates and judgments
requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts
and circumstances that may change over time. Accordingly, actual amounts or future results can
differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial
statements and notes.

We present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated
financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2005 Annual Report. In
the following discussion, we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most
critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements.

Other than temporary impairments of available-for-sale securities.

We classify our
investment holdings in sponsored mutual funds and the debt securities held for investment by our
savings bank subsidiary as available-for-sale. At the end of each quarter, we mark the carrying
amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss in other
comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity. We next review each individual security position
that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment is other than temporary.

A mutual fund holding that has had an unrealized loss for more than six months is presumed to have
an other than temporary impairment and a loss is recognized in our statement of income unless there
is persuasive evidence, such as an increase in value subsequent to quarter end, to overcome that
presumption. We may also recognize an other than temporary loss of less than six months in our
statement of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our
belief that a near-term recovery is possible.

A debt security held by our savings bank subsidiary that is impaired is considered to have an other
than temporary loss that we recognize in our statement of income whenever we determine that we will
probably not collect all contractual amounts due under the terms of the security based on the
issuer’s financial condition and our ability and intent to hold these investments until fair value
recovers, which may mean until maturity, and to collect all contractual cash flows. Minor
impairments of 5% or less that arise from changes in interest rates and not credit quality are
generally considered temporary.

Goodwill

. We evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our balance sheet for possible
impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach. We
attribute all goodwill to our single reportable business segment and reporting unit, our investment
advisory business. Goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount
exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business.

Our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business exceeds
the carrying amount (basically, our stockholders’ equity) and, therefore, that no impairment
exists. Should we reach a different conclusion in the future, additional work would be performed
to ascertain the amount of the non-cash impairment charge to be recognized. We must also perform
impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more
likely than not that an impairment has been incurred. The maximum future impairment of goodwill
that we could incur is the amount recognized in our balance sheet, $665.7 million.

-20-

Provision for income taxes

. After compensation and related costs, our provision for income
taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense. We operate in several states and several
countries through our various subsidiaries, and must allocate our income, expenses, and earnings
under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions. Accordingly, our
provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred for
doing business each year in all of our locations. Annually, we file tax returns which represent
our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities. Each jurisdiction
has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and
expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations. From time-to-time, we may also provide
for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject
to, or in the process of, being audited by various tax authorities. Because the determinations of
our annual provisions are subject to judgments and estimates, it is likely that actual results will
vary from those recognized in our financial statements. As a result, additions to, or reductions
of, income tax expense will occur each year for prior reporting periods as our estimates change and
actual tax returns and tax audits are settled. We recognize any such prior year adjustment in the
discrete quarterly period in which it is determined.

Stock options

. The summary of significant accounting policies includes certain pro forma
disclosures as if a fair value based method had been used to recognize compensation expense
associated with our stock option grants. Fair value methods use a valuation model for
shorter-term, market-traded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even
though they are not available for trading purposes and are of longer duration. The Black-Scholes
option pricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on
future expectations, including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date,
the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period, and the rate of
dividends that we will pay during that time. Our estimates of these variables are made for the
purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not
subsequently adjusted. Unlike most of our expenses, the resulting charge to earnings using a fair
value based method is a non-cash charge that is never measured by or adjusted based on a cash
outflow.

PENDING CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK OPTION-BASED COMPENSATION.

On January 1, 2006, we will adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R, and begin recognizing stock
option-based compensation expense in our 2006 consolidated statement of income using the fair value
based method applied on a modified prospective basis. It is important to note that this change to
the fair value based method will not diminish stockholders’ equity.

The following table (in thousands) presents the future compensation expense attributable to the
9,458,900 nonvested options and 31,500 restricted shares outstanding at December 31, 2005. Future
stock-based compensation expense is estimated in a manner similar to that used in making our
historical pro forma disclosures discussed above, except that, in order to conform to the
requirements of SFAS 123R, we have also included a reduction for estimated future forfeitures of
our stock incentive awards. Estimated future compensation expense will change to reflect future
option grants including reloads, future share awards, changes in estimated forfeitures, and
adjustments for actual forfeitures. The estimated income tax benefits presented will also vary as
compensation expense changes and employees disqualify their incentive stock options, as well as to
reflect changes in our
effective income tax rate.

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION.

From time to time, information or statements provided by or on behalf of T. Rowe Price, including
those within this report, may contain certain forward-looking information, including information or
anticipated information relating to changes in our revenues and net income, changes in the amount
and composition of our assets under management, our expense levels, and our expectations regarding
financial markets and other conditions. Readers are cautioned that any forward-looking information
provided by or on behalf of T. Rowe Price is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results
may differ materially from those in forward-looking information because of various factors
including, but not limited to, those discussed below and in Item 1A of this Form 10-K Annual Report
under the caption Risk Factors. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on
which they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to
reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of
unanticipated events.

Our future revenues and results of operations will fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total
value and composition of assets under our management. Such changes result from many factors
including, among other things: cash inflows and outflows in the T. Rowe Price mutual funds and
other managed investment portfolios; fluctuations in the financial markets around the world that
result in appreciation or depreciation of the assets under our management; our introduction of new
mutual funds and investment portfolios; and changes in retirement savings trends favoring
participant-directed investments and defined contribution plans. The ability to attract and retain
investors’ assets under our management is dependent on investor sentiment and confidence; the
relative investment performance of the Price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios
as compared to competing offerings and market indexes; the ability to maintain our investment
management and administrative fees at appropriate levels; competitive conditions in the mutual
fund, asset management, and broader financial services sectors; and our level of success in
implementing our strategy to expand our business. Our revenues are substantially dependent on fees
earned under contracts with the Price funds and could be adversely affected if the independent
directors of one or more of the Price funds terminated or significantly altered the terms of the
investment management or related administrative services agreements.

Our future results are also dependent upon the level of our expenses, which are subject to
fluctuation for the following or other reasons: changes in the level of our advertising expenses in
response to market conditions, including our efforts to expand our investment advisory business to
investors outside the United States and to further penetrate our distribution channels within the
United States; variations in the level of total compensation expense due to, among other things,
bonuses, stock option grants, stock awards, changes in
our employee count and mix, and competitive factors; any goodwill impairment that may arise;
fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our international
operations; expenses and capital costs, such as technology assets, depreciation, amortization, and
research and development, incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating
services infrastructure; unanticipated costs that may be incurred to protect investor accounts and
the goodwill of our clients; and disruptions of services, including those provided by third
parties, such as facilities, communications, power, and the mutual fund transfer agent and
accounting systems.

Our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation, and changes in legal,
regulatory, accounting, tax, and compliance requirements may have a substantial effect on our
operations and results, including but not limited to effects on costs that we incur and effects on
investor interest in mutual funds and investing in general, or in particular classes of mutual
funds or other investments.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Our revenues and net income are based primarily on the value of assets under our management.
Accordingly, declines in financial market values directly and negatively impact our investment
advisory revenues and net income.

We invest in our sponsored mutual funds, which are market risk sensitive financial instruments held
for purposes other than trading; we do not invest in derivative financial or commodity instruments.
Mutual fund investments have inherent market risk in the form of equity price risk; that is, the
potential future loss of value that would result from a decline in the fair values of the mutual
fund shares. Each fund and its underlying net assets are also subject to market risk which may
arise from changes in equity prices, credit ratings, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest
rates.

-22-

The following table (in thousands of dollars) presents the equity price risk from investments
in sponsored mutual funds by assuming a hypothetical decline in the fair values of mutual fund
shares. This potential future loss of value, before any income tax benefits, reflects the
valuation of mutual fund investments at year end using each fund’s lowest fair value per share
during 2005. In considering this presentation, it is important to note that: all funds did not
experience their lowest fair value per share on the same day; it is likely that the composition of
the mutual fund investment portfolio would be changed if adverse market conditions persisted; and
we could experience future losses in excess of those presented below.

The comparable potential loss of value presented in our 2004 annual report was $29 million on
sponsored mutual fund investments of $215 million at December 31, 2004. During 2005, we actually
experienced net unrealized gains of $12 million.

Investments in mutual funds generally moderate market risk because funds, by their nature, are
diversified investment portfolios that invest in a number of different financial instruments. T.
Rowe Price further manages its exposure to market risk by diversifying its investments among many
domestic and international funds. In addition, investment holdings may be altered from time to
time, in response to changes in market risks and other factors, as deemed appropriate by
management.

The investment portfolio and customer deposit liabilities of our savings bank subsidiary are
subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates change 1%, the change in the net value of these
assets and liabilities would not be material.

We also have other investments of $7.5 million at December 31, 2005 that are included in our
balance sheet in other assets. We are at risk for losses on these investments should market
conditions deteriorate; however, our risk of future loss on these investments cannot exceed the
amount recognized in our balance sheet. Additionally, we recognize our yen investment in a 10%
interest of Daiwa SB Investments (Japan) at $15 million using the historical cost basis of
accounting. Our market risk on this investment is primarily limited to foreign currency exchange
rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen.

We operate in several foreign countries, most prominent among which is Great Britain. We incur
operating expenses and have foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities associated with
these operations, though our revenue stream is predominately realized in U.S. dollar receipts. We
do not believe that foreign currency fluctuations materially impact our results of operations.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

T. Rowe Price Group, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December
31, 2005. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the effectiveness of T. Rowe Price Group, Inc.’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO), and our report dated February 9, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s
assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial reporting.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

T. Rowe Price Group derives its consolidated revenues and net income primarily from investment
advisory services that its subsidiaries provide to individual and institutional investors in the
sponsored T. Rowe Price mutual funds and other investment portfolios. We also provide our
investment advisory clients with related administrative services, including mutual fund transfer
agent, accounting and shareholder services; participant recordkeeping and transfer agent services
for defined contribution retirement plans; discount brokerage; and trust services. The investors
that we serve are primarily domiciled in the United States of America.

Investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our
management. Accordingly, fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under
management impact our revenues and results of operations.

BASIS OF PREPARATION.

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared by our management in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States which require the use of estimates.
Actual results may vary from those estimates.

Our financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries in which we have a majority or
controlling interest. All material intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in
consolidation.

We are not the primary beneficiary of two variable interest entities that are high-yield
collateralized bond obligations (CBOs) and do not consolidate them into our financial statements.
The CBOs are non-recourse, limited liability companies in which we hold a portion, though not a
majority, of the interests in their residual returns. We are also the collateral manager of each
CBO and receive investment advisory fees for performance of that service. At December 31, 2005,
the CBOs had assets of $533 million. We do not have any exposure to future losses from these CBOs
because we have fully recovered our carrying amount, after previously recognized other than
temporary impairments in 2001 and 2002.

CASH EQUIVALENTS.

Cash equivalents consist primarily of short-term, highly liquid investments in sponsored money
market mutual funds. The cost of these funds is equivalent to fair value.

INVESTMENTS.

Investments in sponsored mutual funds and debt securities held by our savings bank subsidiary are
classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value. Changes in net unrealized
security holding gains are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income.

We also hold other investments that are included in other assets and are recognized using the cost
or equity methods of accounting, as appropriate.

We review the carrying amount of each investment on a quarterly basis and recognize an impairment
in our statement of income whenever an unrealized loss is considered other than temporary.

CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK.

Concentration of credit risk in accounts receivable is believed to be minimal in that our clients
generally have substantial assets, including those in the investment portfolios that we manage for
them.

Our investments in sponsored mutual funds expose us to market risk in the form of equity price
risk; that is, the potential future loss of value that would result from a decline in the fair
values of the mutual funds. Each fund and its underlying net assets are also subject to market
risk which may arise from changes in equity prices, credit ratings, foreign currency exchange
rates, and interest rates.

Investments by our savings bank subsidiary in debt securities expose us to market risk which may
arise from changes in credit ratings and interest rates.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT.

Property and equipment is stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation and amortization computed
using the straight-line method. Provisions for depreciation and amortization are based on the
following weighted average estimated useful lives: computer and communications software and
equipment, 3.3 years; buildings, 31.5 years; leasehold improvements, 7.7 years; furniture and other
equipment, 4.9 years; and leased land, 99 years.

GOODWILL.

We evaluate goodwill for possible impairment using the fair value approach during the third quarter
of each year. Our evaluations have not indicated that an impairment exists. We operate in one
reportable business segment — that of the investment advisory business — and all goodwill is
attributed to that segment.

-29-

REVENUE RECOGNITION.

Fees for investment advisory services which are based on assets under management and related
administrative services that we provide to investment advisory clients are recognized in the period
that our services are provided. Administrative revenues from distribution of our sponsored mutual
funds’ Advisor and R class shares, and the corresponding operating expense for payments to
third-party financial intermediaries that distribute those share classes, are recognized in the
period that they are earned from the mutual funds (that is, the same period that the related funds
recognize their expense).

ADVERTISING.

Costs of advertising are expensed the first time that the advertising takes place.

EARNINGS PER SHARE.

Basic earnings per share excludes the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and nonvested
restricted stock, and is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average common shares
outstanding of 123,423,000 in 2003, 127,419,000 in 2004, and 130,266,000 in 2005. Diluted earnings
per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if outstanding stock options were
exercised and restricted stock vests. It is computed by increasing the denominator of the basic
calculation by potential dilutive common shares, determined using the treasury stock method, of
4,866,000 in 2003, 6,716,000 in 2004, and 6,332,000 in 2005.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

Total comprehensive income is reported in our consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity and
includes net income and the change in unrealized
security holding gains, net of income taxes.

STOCK OPTIONS AND AWARDS.

Our stockholders have approved seven stock-based compensation plans (the 1990, 1993, 1996, 2001 and
2004 Stock Incentive Plans and the 1995 and 1998 Director Stock Option Plans). Under these plans,
we have granted qualified incentive and nonqualified fixed stock options with a maximum term of 10
years to employees and directors. These option grants have been accounted for using the intrinsic
value based method. Vesting of employee options is based solely on the individual continuing to
render service and generally occurs over a five-year graded schedule. The exercise price of each
option granted is equivalent to the market price of the common stock at the date of grant.
Accordingly, no compensation expense related to stock option grants has been recognized in our
consolidated statements of income.

The following disclosures are made as if we had applied the fair value based method to account for
our stock option grants. Forfeitures of options are recognized in these disclosures during the
year in which they occurred.

In preparing the above information, we used the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the

The weighted-average assumptions noted above for expected lives are based on the vesting period for
each option grant and our historical experience with respect to the average holding period from
vesting to option exercise. The assumptions for expected volatility and dividend yield are based
on recent historical experience for our common shares over the same time periods as our expected
lives. Risk-free interest rates are set using grant-date U.S. Treasury yield curves for the same
periods as our expected lives.

At December 31, 2005, we have 31,500 outstanding restricted shares of our common stock that were
awarded to our employees in October 2005 at the grant date fair value of $65.24 per share. These
shares vest 50% in each of December 2006 and 2007, and must be returned to the company should employment terminate before
vesting. In December 2005, we also awarded our employees 38,000 unrestricted shares at the grant
date fair value of $74.73 per share. Compensation expense of $3,164,000 related to these 69,500
shares has been recognized in our 2005 consolidated statement of income.

On January 1, 2006, we will adopt the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123R,

Share-Based Payment

(SFAS 123R), and begin recognizing stock option-based compensation
expense in our 2006 consolidated statement of income using the fair value based method applied on a
modified prospective basis. It is important to note that this change to the fair value based
method will not diminish stockholders’ equity nor will it change the accounting for our stock
awards.

The following table (in thousands) presents the future compensation expense to be recognized over
the vesting period of the 9,458,900 nonvested options and 31,500 restricted shares outstanding at
December 31, 2005. Future stock-based compensation expense has been estimated in a manner similar
to that used in making our historical pro forma disclosures, except that, in order to conform to
the requirements of SFAS 123R, we have also included a reduction for estimated future forfeitures
of our stock incentive awards. Estimated future compensation expense will change to reflect future
option grants including reloads, future share awards, changes in estimated forfeitures, and
adjustments for actual forfeitures. The estimated income tax benefits presented will also vary as
compensation expense changes and employees disqualify their incentive stock options, as well as to
reflect changes in our effective income tax rate.

The unrealized losses in these investments were generally caused by interest rate increases and not
changes in credit quality. We have the ability and intent to hold these investments until a
recovery of fair value, which may mean until maturity, and to collect all contractual cash flows.
Accordingly, impairment of these investments is considered temporary.

Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between taxable income for financial
statement and income tax return purposes. Significant temporary differences in 2003 included
deferred tax benefits of $7.2 million related to accrued compensation offset by $3.2 million
related to investment income. Deferred tax benefits in 2004 include $4.1 million related to
investment income offset by deferred taxes of $1.9 million related to accrued compensation.

Deferred tax benefits in 2005 include $5.3 million related to property and equipment offset by
deferred taxes of $1.5 million related to accrued compensation. Deferred benefits in 2005 also
include $3.8 million arising from foreign net operating loss carryforwards, including $2.4 million
from 2005 operations and $1.4 million from the reversal of a previously provided valuation
allowance on prior year losses. During 2005, we developed a tax-planning strategy that makes it
more likely than not that we would be able to realize a substantial portion of this deferred tax
benefit.

Our net deferred tax liability is included in income taxes payable and includes the following
components at December 31.

our stock options reduced the income taxes that would have otherwise been payable by $26,984,000 in
2003, $63,459,000 in 2004, and $52,315,000 in 2005. These amounts have been added to stockholders’
equity as part of additional capital in excess of par value.

We provide all services to the sponsored U.S. mutual funds under contracts that are subject to
periodic review and approval by each of the funds’ boards. Regulations require that the funds’
shareholders also approve material changes to the investment advisory contracts.

NOTE 6
— BORROWINGS AND CREDIT FACILITY.

We fully repaid the remaining balances of our yen- and dollar-denominated bank borrowings during
2003. Foreign currency losses arising from the yen borrowing of $988,000 in 2003 are included in
non-operating investment income.

In 2004, we replaced two existing credit facilities with a new three-year, $300 million syndicated
credit facility among eight banks for which JPMorgan Chase Bank serves as administrative agent.
The interest rate on borrowings under this facility will float .27% to .575% above the Eurodollar
base rate depending on our financial condition. At December 31, 2005, we are in compliance with
the covenants contained in our credit facility agreement.

NOTE 7 — OTHER DISCLOSURES.

We occupy certain office facilities and rent computer and other equipment under noncancelable
operating leases. Related rental expense was $19,710,000 in 2003, $21,292,000 in 2004, and
$23,492,000 in 2005. Future minimum rental payments under these leases aggregate $21,033,000 in
2006, $19,047,000 in 2007, $18,371,000 in 2008, $18,493,000 in 2009, $18,673,000 in 2010 and
$123,705,000 in later years.

Customer deposits at our savings bank subsidiary have defined maturities of up to five years. The
estimated fair value of these customer deposits, based on discounting their expected cash flows at
maturity using current interest rates offered for deposits with the same date of maturity, was
$102.4 million at December 31, 2004 and $103.9 million at December 31, 2005.

Investments accounted for under the cost method are included in other assets and total $19,860,000
at December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2005, we had outstanding commitments to fund additional
investments totaling $6.7 million.

Our consolidated stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2005 includes $43 million which is restricted
as to use by various regulations and agreements arising in the ordinary course of our business.

From time to time, various claims against us arise in the ordinary course of business, including
employment-related claims. In the opinion of management, after consultation with counsel, it is
unlikely that any adverse determination in one or more pending claims would have a material adverse
effect on our financial position or results of operations.

Expenses for our defined contribution retirement plans were $24,815,000 in
2003, $32,777,000 in 2004, and $36,954,000 in 2005.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.

None.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.

Our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, has evaluated
the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2005. Our
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including this Form 10-K annual report, is appropriately recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial officers
have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2005 are effective at
the reasonable assurance level.

Our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, has evaluated
any change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter
of 2005, and has concluded that there was no change during the fourth quarter of 2005 that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

Management’s report on our internal control over financial reporting and the related
attestation report of KPMG LLP follow.

Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

To the Stockholders of T. Rowe Price Group, Inc.:

We, together with other members of management of T. Rowe Price Group, are responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over the company’s financial reporting.
Internal control over financial reporting is the process designed under our supervision, and
effected by the company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the company’s
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
including the possibility that misstatements may not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, even
effective internal controls over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with
respect to financial statement preparation. Furthermore, the effectiveness of internal controls
can change with circumstances.

Management has evaluated the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005 in relation to criteria described in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on
management’s assessment, we believe that the company’s internal control over financial reporting
was effective as of December 31, 2005.

KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited our financial statements
that are included in this annual report and expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. KPMG LLP has
also expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of, and the effective operation
of, our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

T. Rowe Price Group, Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in their accompanying report on internal control
over financial reporting, that T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). T. Rowe Price Group, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Also, in our opinion,
T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December
31, 2005, and our report dated February 9, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion on those
consolidated financial statements.
