PART I

Item 1.

Business.

T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. is a financial services holding company that provides global investment management services through its subsidiaries to investors worldwide. We provide an array of

U.S. mutual funds

, subadvised funds, separately managed accounts, and

other T. Rowe Price products

. The other T. Rowe Price products include: collective investment trusts, open-ended investment products offered to investors outside the U.S., and

products

offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the U.S. We also provide certain investment advisory clients with related administrative services, including distribution, mutual fund transfer agent, accounting, and shareholder services; participant recordkeeping and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans; brokerage; and trust services. We are focused on delivering global investment management excellence to help clients around the world achieve their long-term investment goals.

The late Thomas Rowe Price, Jr., founded our firm in 1937, and the common stock of T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. was first offered to the public in 1986. The T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. corporate holding company structure was established in 2000.

Our core capabilities have enabled us to deliver excellent operating results since our initial public offering. We maintain a strong corporate culture that is focused on delivering strong long-term investment performance and world-class service to our clients. We distribute our broad array of active investment strategies through a diverse set of distribution channels and vehicles to meet the needs of our clients globally. Our ongoing financial strength and discipline has allowed us to take advantage of attractive growth opportunities and invest in key capabilities. Our investments have been focused on increasing our investment professional headcount globally, expanding our product offerings, expanding our global distribution footprint to strengthen our regional relationships and brand, and investing in new technology and the core infrastructure of the firm.

The industry in which we operate has been evolving quickly and a number of headwinds have arisen over the last few years, including passive investments taking market share from traditional active strategies; continued downward fee pressure; demand for new investment vehicles to meet client needs; and an ever-changing regulatory landscape.

Despite the headwinds, we believe there are significant opportunities that align to our core capabilities. As such, we have been responding with several multi-year initiatives that are designed to strengthen our long-term competitive position and to:

•

Maintain our position as a premier active asset manager, delivering durable value to clients.

•

Build T. Rowe Price into a more globally diversified asset manager.

•

Extend and leverage our retirement expertise globally while becoming an ever more integrated investment solutions provider.

•

Embed best practices for sustainability and environmental, social and corporate governance throughout the company.

•

Maintain strong processes and controls, which is increasingly important with growing business complexity and regulation.

•

Remain a destination of choice for top talent, with a culture of empowerment, accountability and collaboration.

•

Deliver attractive financial results and balance sheet strength for our stockholders over the long term.

Financial Overview / Assets Under Management

We derive the vast majority of our consolidated net revenues and net income from investment advisory services provided by our subsidiaries, primarily T. Rowe Price Associates and T. Rowe Price International Ltd. Our revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of our assets under management. Accordingly, fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management impact our revenues and results of operations.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES.

Distribution Channels and Products

We distribute our products across three broad geographical regions: Americas, Europe Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"), and Asia Pacific ("APAC"). We service clients in


countries around the world. Investors domiciled outside the U.S. represented nearly

7%

of total assets under management at the end of


.

We accumulate our assets under management from a diversified client base across five primary distribution channels: Americas financial intermediaries, EMEA and APAC financial intermediaries, individual U.S. investors on a direct basis, U.S. retirement plan sponsors for which we provide recordkeeping services, and institutional investors globally. The following table outlines as of

Investment Capabilities

We manage a broad range of investment strategies in equity, fixed income, and multi-asset across sectors, styles and regions. Our strategies are designed to meet the varied and changing needs and objectives of investors and are delivered across a range of vehicles. We also offer specialized advisory services, including management of stable value investment contracts, modeled multi-asset solutions, and a distribution management service for the disposition of equity securities our clients receive from third-party venture capital investment pools.


Page



C^<l3Q6*4v9%C:Mg

The following table sets forth our broad investment capabilities as of

December 31, 2019

.

We employ fundamental and quantitative security analysis in the performance of the investment advisory function through substantial internal equity and fixed income investment research capabilities. We perform original industry and company research using such sources as inspection of corporate activities, management interviews, company-published financials and other information, and field checks with suppliers and competitors in the same industry and particular business sector. Our dedicated, in-house research analysts consider tangible investment factors such as financial information, valuation, and macroeconomics in tandem with intangible environmental, social, and corporate governance investment factors.

Our research staff operates primarily from offices located in the U.S. and U.K. with additional staff based in Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, and Switzerland. We also use research provided by brokerage firms and security analysts in a supportive capacity and information received from private economists, political observers,


Page



C^<l3Q6*4v9%C:Mg

commentators, government experts, and market analysts. Our securities selection process for some investment portfolios is based on quantitative analysis using computerized data modeling.

From time to time, we introduce new strategies, investment vehicles, and other

products

to complement and expand our investment offerings, respond to competitive developments in the financial marketplace, and meet the changing needs of our investment advisory clients. We will introduce a new investment strategy if we believe that we have the appropriate investment management expertise and that its objective will be useful to investors over a long period. In 2019, we introduced six new strategies and several new vehicles and share classes of existing strategies.

We typically provide seed capital for new investment

products

to enable the portfolio manager to begin building an investment performance history in advance of the portfolio receiving sustainable client assets. The length of time we hold our seed capital investment will vary for each new investment

product

as it is highly dependent on how long it takes to generate cash flows into the

product

from unrelated investors. We attempt to ensure that the new investment

product

has a sustainable level of assets from unrelated shareholders before we consider redemption of our seed capital investment in order to not negatively impact the new investment

product

's net asset value or its investment performance record. At

December 31, 2019

, we had seed capital investments in our products of

$1.3 billion

.

Conversely, we may also close or limit new investments to new investors across

T. Rowe Price investment products

in order to maintain the integrity of the investment strategy and to protect the interests of its existing shareholders and investors. At present, the following strategies, which represent about

20%

of total assets under management at

December 31, 2019

, are generally closed to new investors:

* This fund will re-open for new accounts in the second quarter of 2020.

Investment Advisory Fees

We provide investment advisory services through our subsidiaries to the U.S. mutual funds; clients on a subadvised or separately managed account basis; and

other T. Rowe Price products

, including collective investment trusts, funds offered to investors outside the U.S., and portfolios offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the U.S.

Nearly 70% of our investment advisory fees are earned from our U.S. mutual funds, while about 30% of our investment advisory fees are earned from our other investment portfolios. Ten of our


U.S. mutual funds -

Blue Chip Growth

,

Growth Stock

,

Capital Appreciation

,

Mid-Cap Growth

,

New Horizons

,

Value

,

Emerging Markets Stock

,

Overseas Stock

,

Equity Income

, and

Institutional Large-Cap Growth

- accounted for approximately

35%

of our investment advisory revenues in


, and approximately

27%

of our assets under management at

December 31, 2019

. Our largest client account relationship, apart from the U.S. mutual funds, is with a third-party financial intermediary that accounted for about

7%

of our investment advisory revenues in


.

U.S. Mutual Funds

At

December 31, 2019

, assets under our management in the U.S. mutual funds aggregated

$682.7 billion

, an

increase

of

20.9%

or

$118.2 billion

from the beginning of the year. Investment advisory services are provided to each U.S. mutual fund under individual investment management agreements that grant the fund the right to use the


Page



C^<l3Q6*4v9%C:Mg

T. Rowe Price name. The Boards of the respective funds, including a majority of directors who are not interested persons of the funds or of T. Rowe Price Group (as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940), must approve the investment management agreements annually. Fund shareholders approve material changes to these investment management agreements. Each agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment (as defined in the Investment Company Act) and, generally, either party may terminate the agreement without penalty after a 60-day notice. The termination of one or more of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Independent directors and trustees of the U.S. mutual funds regularly review our fee structures.

The advisory fee paid monthly by each of the U.S. mutual funds is computed on a daily basis by multiplying a fund’s net assets by its effective fee rate. For the majority of the U.S. mutual funds, the fee rate is equal to the sum of a tiered group fee rate plus an individual fund rate. The tiered group rate is based on the combined net assets of nearly all of the U.S. mutual funds. If the combined net assets of these U.S. mutual funds exceed

$650 billion

, the weighted-average fee across pricing tiers is

28.6 basis points

for the first

$650 billion

of net assets plus

26.5 basis points

for net assets in excess of

$650 billion

. To the extent that the combined net assets of the funds included in the group rate calculation increase, the group charge component of a fund's advisory fee rate and the resulting advisory fee rate paid by each fund will decrease.

The individual fund rates are generally flat rates that are set based on the fund’s specific investment objective. Several funds, including the Blue Chip Growth, Equity Income, Growth Stock, and Mid-Cap Growth funds, have an effective tiered individual fund rate in which their base individual flat rate is reduced by about 15% on net assets in excess of $15 billion. The New Income and Value funds have their base individual flat rate reduced by about 15% on net assets in excess of $20 billion. The Capital Appreciation Fund has its base individual flat rate reduced by 10% on net assets in excess of $27.5 billion. The effective fee rates for each of the stock and bond funds on which we earned annual advisory fees of approximately

$6.0 million

or greater in


, varied from a low of


basis points for the U.S Treasury Long-Term Fund to a high of


basis points for the Emerging Markets Stock and International Discovery funds.

The fee rate of several of the U.S. mutual funds, including the Index funds as well as specific funds offered solely to institutional investors, does not include a group fee component but rather an individual fund fee or an all-inclusive fee. An all-inclusive fee covers both the investment management fee and ordinary operating expenses incurred by the fund and, as a result, our management fee varies with the level of operating expenses a fund incurs. The funds in the Spectrum Funds series and in the multiple target date retirement funds series that we offer have no separate investment advisory fee; rather, they indirectly bear the expenses of the funds in which they invest.

Each U.S. mutual fund typically bears all expenses associated with its operation and the issuance and redemption of its securities. In particular, each fund pays investment advisory fees; shareholder servicing fees and expenses; fund accounting fees and expenses; transfer and sub-transfer agent fees; custodian fees and expenses; legal and auditing fees; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and shareholder reports to existing shareholders; registration fees and expenses; proxy and annual meeting expenses; and independent trustee or director fees and expenses.

We usually provide that a newly organized fund’s expenses will not exceed a specified percentage of its net assets during an initial operating period. Generally, during the earlier portion of the period, we will waive advisory fees and absorb other fund expenses, such as those described above, in excess of these self-imposed limits. During the latter portion of the period, we may recover some or all of the waived fees and absorbed costs, but such recovery is not assured.

Additionally, we have contractual management fee waivers for certain U.S mutual funds, including nearly all money market funds, which could occur under certain specified circumstances. Unlike traditional expense limits for newly organized funds, these waivers will not be recovered by T. Rowe Price in the future.

Subadvised and separate accounts and other investment products

Our subadvised and separate accounts and other investment

products

had assets under management of

$524.1 billion

at

December 31, 2019

, an

increase

of

$126.3 billion

from the beginning of the year. Other investment products include collective investment trusts, open-ended investment products offered to investors outside the U.S., and products offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the U.S. We earn investment management fees from these clients based on, among other things, the specific investment services to be provided and are computed using the value of assets under management at a contracted annual fee rate or the products' effective fee rate for those with a tiered-fee rate structure. The value of assets under management billed is generally based on daily valuations, end of billing period valuations, or month-end average valuations. In


, approximately

79%

of our advisory fees were recognized based on daily portfolio valuations,

13%

were based on end of billing period valuations, and

8%

were based on month-end averages.

Our standard form of investment advisory agreement with other T. Rowe Price products that pay management fees on a daily basis normally provides for termination with thirty days notice. Our standard separately managed account agreements provide for termination at any time and the refunding of any unearned fees paid in advance. Our standard subadvised client account agreement typically provides for termination with sixty days notice.

The following table details the services provided by certain of our subsidiaries based on our non-U.S. global investment products:

Our subsidiaries T. Rowe Price Associates, T. Rowe Price International, T. Rowe Price Hong Kong, as well as T. Rowe Price Australia and T. Rowe Price Japan, may also provide subadvised investment management services to those global investment

products

listed in the table above.

We distribute the

products

listed in the table above outside the U.S. through distribution agents and other financial intermediaries. The fees we earn for distributing and marketing these products are part of our overall investment management fees for managing the

product

assets. We currently recognize any related distribution fees paid to these financial intermediaries in distribution and servicing costs.

In addition to providing investment management services to the U.S. mutual funds, our subsidiaries, T. Rowe Price Associates and T. Rowe Price International offer separately managed institutional investment management and subadvised investment management services to global intermediaries. Our subsidiary, T. Rowe Price Trust Company, offers and provides investment management services to our T. Rowe Price collective investment trusts, which are used in the investment portfolios of certain qualified U.S. retirement plans.

ADMINISTRATIVE, DISTRIBUTION, AND SERVICING FEES.

Administrative Services

We also provide certain administrative services as ancillary services to our investment advisory clients. These administrative services are provided by several of our subsidiaries and include mutual fund transfer agent, accounting, distribution, and shareholder services; participant recordkeeping and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans investing in

U.S. mutual funds

; recordkeeping services for defined contribution retirement plans investing in mutual funds outside the T. Rowe Price complex; brokerage; and trust services.

T. Rowe Price Services provides the U.S. mutual funds transfer agency and shareholder services, including the staff, facilities, technology, and other equipment to respond to inquiries from fund shareholders. The U.S. mutual funds contract directly with BNY Mellon to provide mutual fund accounting services, including maintenance of financial records, preparation of financial statements and reports, daily valuation of portfolio securities, and computation of each mutual fund's daily net asset value per share.

C^<l3Q6*4v9%C:Mg

T. Rowe Price Retirement Plan Services provides participant accounting and plan administration for defined contribution retirement plans that invest in the U.S. mutual funds, the T. Rowe Price collective investment trusts, and funds outside the T. Rowe Price complex. T. Rowe Price Retirement Plan Services also provides transfer agent services to the U.S. mutual funds. The pricing on these transfer agent services is based on basis points of the related assets under management. Plan sponsors and participants compensate us for some of the administrative services while the U.S. mutual funds and outside fund families compensate us for maintaining and administering the individual participant accounts for those plans that invest in the respective funds. As of

December 31, 2019

, we provided recordkeeping services for

$210 billion

in assets under administration, of which nearly

$128 billion

are assets we manage.

T. Rowe Price Trust Company provides administrative trustee services. Through this entity, which is a Maryland-chartered limited service trust company, we serve as trustee for employer sponsored retirement plans and other retirement products. T. Rowe Price Trust Company may not accept deposits and cannot make personal or commercial loans.

We also provide non-discretionary advisory planning services to fund shareholders and potential investors through our subsidiary T. Rowe Price Advisory Services. These services are limited in scope and include retirement planning services, such as saving for retirement, transitioning into retirement, and income in retirement. An investment portfolio evaluation service is an integral part of these services. An ongoing checkup service is also available to assist investors in staying on track to achieve their financial goals.

Distribution and Servicing

The Investor Class of all U.S. mutual funds can be purchased in the U.S. on a no-load basis, without a sales commission or 12b-1 fee. No-load mutual fund shares offer investors a low-cost and relatively easy method of directly investing in a variety of equity, fixed income, and multi-asset strategies. The I Class of certain U.S. mutual funds is designed to meet the needs of institutionally oriented clients who seek investment products with lower shareholder servicing costs and lower expense ratios. This share class limits ordinary operating expenses (other than interest; expenses related to borrowings, taxes, and brokerage; and any non-extraordinary expenses) to 5 basis points for a period of time and there are no external 12b-1 or administrative fee payments.

Certain of the U.S. mutual funds also offer Advisor Class and R Class shares that are distributed to investors and defined contribution retirement plans, respectively. These share classes pay 12b-1 fees of 25 and 50 basis points, respectively, for distribution, administration, and personal services. Our subsidiary, T. Rowe Price Investment Services ("TRPIS"), is the principal distributor of the U.S. mutual funds and contracts with third-party financial intermediaries who distribute these share classes. TRPIS enters into agreements with each intermediary under which each fund is responsible to pay the distribution and service fees directly to the applicable intermediaries. In addition, those U.S. mutual funds offered to investors through variable annuity life insurance plans have a share class that pays a 12b-1 fee of 25 basis points.

In accounting for 12b-1 fees, the applicable mutual fund share classes incur the related expense and we recognize the corresponding distribution and servicing fee revenue in the administrative, distribution, and servicing fees line of

our consolidated statements of income. We also recognize the corresponding cost paid to the third-party financial intermediaries who distribute these funds' share classes within the distribution and servicing costs line of the consolidated statements of income. The fee revenue that we recognize from the funds and the expense that we recognize for the fees paid to third-party intermediaries are equal in amount and, therefore, do not impact our net operating income.

We believe that our lower fund cost structure, distribution methods, and fund shareholder and administrative services help promote the stability of our fund assets under management through market cycles.

Except as noted above for 12b-1 fees earned from the mutual funds, we bear all advertising and promotion expenses associated with the distribution of our investment products. These costs are recognized when incurred and include advertising and direct mail communications to potential shareholders, as well as substantial staff and communications capabilities to respond to investor inquiries. Marketing and promotional efforts are focused in print media, television, and digital and social media. Advertising and promotion expenditures vary over time based on investor interest, market conditions, new and existing investment offerings, and the development and expansion of new marketing initiatives, including the enhancement of our digital capabilities.

REGULATION.

All aspects of our business are subject to extensive federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to benefit or protect our clients and T. Rowe Price product shareholders. They generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of our business in the event that we fail to comply with laws and regulations. Possible sanctions that may be imposed on us, in the event that we fail to comply, include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain business activities for specified periods of time, revocation of our investment adviser and other registrations, censures, and fines.

T. Rowe Price UK, the authorized corporate director of our UK OEIC funds, is also regulated by the FCA. The Securities and Futures Commission ("SFC") and Monetary Authority of Singapore ("MAS") also regulate T. Rowe Price Hong Kong and T. Rowe Price Singapore, respectively. T.

COMPETITION.

As a member of the financial services industry, we are subject to substantial competition in all aspects of our business. A significant number of proprietary and other sponsors’ mutual funds are sold to the public by other investment management firms, broker-dealers, mutual fund companies, banks, and insurance companies. We compete with brokerage and investment banking firms, insurance companies, banks, mutual fund companies, hedge funds, and other financial institutions and funds in all aspects of our business and in every country in which we offer our advisory services. Some of these financial institutions have substantially greater resources than we do. We compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment

products

offered, investment performance, fees and related expenses, and the scope and quality of investment advice and other client services.

In recent years, we have faced significant competition from passive oriented investment strategies. As a result, such products have taken market share from active managers. While we cannot predict how much market share these competitors will gain, we believe there will always be demand for good active management.

In order to maintain and enhance our competitive position, we may review acquisition and venture opportunities and, if appropriate, engage in discussions and negotiations that could lead to the acquisition of a new equity or other financial relationship.

EMPLOYEES.

December 31, 2019

Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

An investment in our common stock involves various risks, including those mentioned below and those that are discussed from time to time in our periodic filings with the SEC. Investors should carefully consider these risks, along with the other information contained in this report, before making an investment decision regarding our common stock. There may be additional risks of which we are currently unaware, or which we currently consider immaterial. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and value of our common stock.

RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AND THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY.

Our revenues are based on the market value and composition of the assets under our management, all of which are subject to fluctuation caused by factors outside of our control.

We derive our revenues primarily from investment advisory services provided by our subsidiaries to individual and institutional investors in the

U.S. mutual funds

and

other investment products

. Our investment advisory fees typically are calculated as a percentage of the market value of the assets under our management. We generally earn higher fees on assets invested in our equity funds and equity investment portfolios than we earn on assets invested in our fixed income funds and portfolios. Among equity

products

, there is a significant variation in fees earned from index-based

products

at the low end and emerging markets

products

at the high end. Fees also vary across the fixed income

products

, though not as widely as equity

products

, with stable value

products

and money market

products

at the lower end and non-U.S. dollar denominated bond

products

at the high end. As a result, our revenues are dependent on the value and composition of the assets under our management, all of which are subject to substantial fluctuation due to many factors, including:

•

Investment Performance. If the investment performance of our managed investment portfolios is less than that of our competitors or applicable third-party benchmarks, we could lose existing and potential customers and suffer a decrease in assets under management. Institutional investors in particular, consider changing investment advisers based upon poor relative investment performance. Individual investors in contrast are more likely to react to poor absolute investment performance.

•

General Market Declines. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from advisory fees on sponsored portfolios. A downturn in stock or bond prices would cause the value of assets under our management to decrease, and may also cause investors to withdraw their investments, thereby further decreasing the level of assets under our management. A decline in equity market valuations may cause investors to transition to lower-fee portfolios such as fixed income, reducing our overall profitability. In addition, international markets, particularly emerging markets, which are often smaller, may not have the liquidity of established markets, may lack established regulations, and may experience significantly more volatility than established markets.

•

Investor Mobility. Our investors generally may withdraw their funds at any time, without advance notice and with little to no significant penalty.

•

Capacity Constraints. Prolonged periods of strong relative investment performance and/or strong investor inflows has resulted in and may result in capacity constraints within certain strategies, which can lead to, among other things, the closure of those strategies from additional investor inflows. If certain of our strategies are capacity constrained, our investment results in subsequent periods may be negatively impacted.

•

Investing Trends. Changes in investing trends, particularly investor preference for passive or alternative investment

products

, and in retirement savings trends, may reduce interest in our

products

and may alter our mix of assets under management.

•

Interest Rate Changes. Investor interest in and the valuation of our fixed income investment funds and portfolios are affected by changes in interest rates.

•

Geo-Political Exposure. Our managed investment portfolios may have significant investments in international markets that are subject to risk of loss from political or diplomatic developments, government policies, civil unrest, currency fluctuations, illiquidity and capital controls, and changes in legislation related to foreign ownership.

A decrease in the value of assets under our management, or an adverse change in their composition, particularly in market segments where our assets are concentrated, could have a material adverse effect on our investment advisory fees and revenues. For any period in which revenues decline, net income and operating margins will likely


Page



C^<l3Q6*4v9%C:Mg

decline by a greater proportion because certain expenses will be fixed over that finite period and may not decrease in proportion to the decrease in revenues.

A significant majority of our revenues are based on contracts with the U.S. mutual funds that are subject to termination without cause and on short notice.

We provide investment advisory, distribution, and other administrative services to the U.S. mutual funds under various agreements. Investment advisory services are provided to each T. Rowe Price mutual fund under individual investment management agreements. The Board of each T. Rowe Price mutual fund must annually approve the terms of the investment management and service agreements and can terminate the agreement upon 60-days' notice. If a T. Rowe Price mutual fund seeks to lower the fees that we receive or terminate its contract with us, we would experience a decline in fees earned from the U.S. mutual funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income.

We operate in an intensely competitive industry. Competitive pressures may result in a loss of customers and their assets or compel us to reduce the fees we charge to clients, thereby reducing our revenues and net income.

We are subject to competition in all aspects of our business from other financial institutions. Some of these financial institutions have substantially greater resources than we do and may offer a broader range of financial products across more markets. Some competitors operate in a different regulatory environment than we do which may give them certain competitive advantages in the investment products and portfolio structures that they offer. We compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment

products

offered, investment performance, fees and related expenses, and the scope and quality of investment advice and other client services. Some institutions have proprietary products and distribution channels that make it more difficult for us to compete with them. Substantially all of our investment

products

are available without sales or redemption fees, which means that investors may be more willing to transfer assets to competing

products

.

The market environment in recent years has led investors to increasingly favor lower fee passive investment products. As a result, investment advisors that emphasize passive products have gained and may continue to gain market share from active managers like us. While we believe there will always be demand for good active management, we cannot predict how much market share these competitors will gain.

If current or potential customers decide to move their assets to one of our competitors, we could face a significant decline in market share, assets under management, revenues, and net income. In the event that we decide to reduce the fees we charge for investment advisory services in response to competitive pressures, which we have done selectively in the past, revenues and operating margins could be adversely impacted.

Our success depends on our key personnel and our financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services.

Our success depends on our highly skilled personnel, including our portfolio managers, investment analysts, sales and client relationship personnel, and corporate officers, many of whom have specialized expertise and extensive experience in our industry. Strong financial services professionals are in demand, and we face significant competition for highly qualified employees. Our U.S.-based associates do not have employment contracts, while our associates outside the U.S. have employment contracts where basic employment terms are confirmed in writing. Generally, our associates can terminate their employment with us at any time. We cannot assure that we will be able to attract or retain key personnel.

Due to the global nature of our investment advisory business, our key personnel may have reasons to travel to regions susceptible to higher risk of civil unrest, organized crime or terrorism and we may be unable to ensure the safety of personnel traveling to these regions. We have near- and long-term succession planning processes, including programs to develop our future leaders, which are intended to address future talent needs and minimize the impact of losing key talent. However, in order to retain or replace our key personnel, we may be required to increase compensation, which would decrease net income. The loss of key personnel could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to retain and attract new employees and investors. Losses of assets from our client investors would decrease our revenues and net income, possibly materially.

C^<l3Q6*4v9%C:Mg

Our operations are complex and a failure to perform operational processes could have an adverse effect on our reputation and decrease our revenues.

We provide investment management,

product

administration,

product

recordkeeping, and tax reporting services to our clients. In certain cases, we rely on third-party vendors in the execution and delivery of these services.  There can be no assurance that these vendors will properly perform these processes or that there will not be interruptions in services from these third parties. Failure to properly execute or oversee these services could subject us to regulatory sanctions, fines, penalties, or litigation.

New investment strategies, investment vehicles, distribution channels, or other evolutions of our business may increase the risk that our existing systems may not be adequate to control the risks introduced by such changes. Significant business changes may require us to update our processes or technology and may increase risk to meeting our business objectives. In addition, our information systems and technology platforms might not be able to accommodate our continued growth, and the cost of maintaining such systems might increase from its current level. If any of these factors were to arise it could disrupt our operations, increase our expenses or result in financial exposure, regulatory inquiry or reputational damage.

The quantitative models we use may contain errors, which could result in financial losses or adversely impact product performance and client relationships.

We use various quantitative models to support investment decisions and processes, including those related to risk assessment, portfolio management, and activities. Any errors in the underlying models or model assumptions could have unanticipated and adverse consequences on our business and reputation.

Changes to benchmark indices may impact our business.

The manner in which certain reference rates are calculated could impact the investment portfolios we manage. The withdrawal and replacement of widely used benchmark indices such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) with alternative benchmark rates may introduce a number of risks for our business. The FCA in the U.K., which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it will no longer compel panel banks to submit rates for LIBOR after 2021. Changes in the method pursuant to which LIBOR is determined or the discontinuance of LIBOR may adversely affect the amount of interest payable or interest receivable on certain portfolio investments. These changes may also impact the market liquidity and market value of these portfolio investments.

Any damage to our reputation could harm our business and lead to a loss of revenues and net income.

We have spent many years developing our reputation for integrity, strong investment performance, and superior client service. Our brand is a valuable intangible asset, but it is vulnerable to a variety of threats that can be difficult or impossible to control, and costly or even impossible to remediate. Regulatory inquiries and rumors can tarnish or substantially damage our reputation, even if those inquiries are satisfactorily addressed. Additionally, we are subject to the risk that our employees or third parties acting on our behalf may circumvent controls or act in a manner inconsistent with our policies and procedures. Real or perceived conflicts between our clients’ interests and our own, as well as any fraudulent activity or other exposure of client assets or information, may impair our reputation and subject us to litigation or regulatory action. Any damage to our brand could impede our ability to attract and retain customers and key personnel, and reduce the amount of assets under our management, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income.

Our expenses are subject to significant fluctuations that could materially decrease net income.

Our operating results are dependent on the level of our expenses, which can vary significantly for many reasons, including:

•

expenses incurred in connection with our multi-year strategic plan to strengthen our long-term competitive position;

•

variations in the level of total compensation expense due to, among other things, changes in bonuses, stock-based awards, changes in employee benefit costs due to regulatory or plan design changes, changes in our employee count and mix, competitive factors, market performance, and inflation;


Page



C^<l3Q6*4v9%C:Mg

•

changes in the level of our advertising and promotion expenses, including the costs of expanding investment advisory services to investors outside of the U.S. and further penetrating U.S. distribution channels;

•

expenses and capital costs incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure, such as technology assets, depreciation, amortization, and research and development;

•

changes in the costs incurred for third-party vendors that perform certain administrative and operating services;

•

changes in expenses that are correlated to our assets under management, such as distribution and servicing fees;

•

a future impairment of investments that is recognized in our consolidated balance sheet;

•

a future impairment of goodwill that is recognized in our consolidated balance sheet;

•

unanticipated material fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our operations abroad;

•

unanticipated costs incurred to protect investor accounts and client goodwill; and

•

future changes to legal and regulatory requirements and potential litigation;

•

disruptions of third-party services such as communications, power, and mutual fund transfer agent, investment management, trading, and accounting systems.

Under our agreements with the U.S. mutual funds, we charge the funds certain administrative fees and related expenses based upon contracted terms. If we fail to accurately estimate our underlying expense levels or are required to incur expenses relating to the mutual funds that are not otherwise paid by the funds, our operating results will be adversely affected. While we are under no obligation to provide financial support to any

T. Rowe Price investment products

, any financial support provided would reduce capital available for other purposes and may have an adverse effect on revenues and net income

.

Amendments to Tax Laws may impact the marketability of the products and services we offer our clients or the financial position of the company.

We are subject to income taxes as well as non-income-based taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We cannot predict future changes in the tax regulations to which we are subject, and these regulations could have a material impact on our liability or result in increased costs of our tax compliance efforts.

Additionally, changes in the status of tax deferred investment options, including retirement plans, tax-free municipal bonds, the capital gains and corporate dividend tax rates, and other individual and corporate tax rates could cause investors to view certain investment

products

less favorably and reduce investor demand for

products

and services we offer, which could have an adverse effect on our assets under management and revenues.

Examinations and audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.

Based on the global nature of our business, from time to time, we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes (and, in certain cases, interest, fines, or penalties). We have a process to evaluate whether to record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional income taxes will be due. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, however, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our estimates.

We have contracted with third-party financial intermediaries that distribute our investment

products

and such relationships may not be available or profitable to us in the future.

These contracted third-party intermediaries generally offer their clients various investment products in addition to, and in competition with, our investment

products

, and have no contractual obligation to encourage investment in our

products

. It would be difficult for us to acquire or retain the management of those assets without the assistance of the intermediaries, and we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain an adequate number of investment product offerings and successful distribution relationships. In addition, some investors rely on third-party financial


Page



C^<l3Q6*4v9%C:Mg

planners, registered investment advisers, and other consultants or financial professionals to advise them on the choice of investment adviser and investment

product

. These professionals and consultants can favor a competing investment

product

as better meeting their particular clients' needs. We cannot assure that our investment

products

will be among their recommended choices in the future. Further, their recommendations can change over time and we could lose their recommendation and their clients' assets under our management. Mergers, acquisitions, and other ownership or management changes could also adversely impact our relationships with these third-party intermediaries. The presence of any of the adverse conditions discussed above would reduce revenues and net income, possibly by material amounts.

Natural disasters and other unpredictable events could adversely affect our operations.

Armed conflicts, trade wars, tariffs or sanctions, terrorist attacks, cyber-attacks, power failures, climate change, and natural disasters could adversely affect our revenues, expenses, and net income by:

•

decreasing investment valuations in, and returns on, the investment portfolios that we manage,

•

causing disruptions in national or global economies that decrease investor confidence and make investment products generally less attractive,

•

incapacitating or inflicting losses of lives among our employees,

•

interrupting our business operations or those of critical service providers,

•

triggering technology delays or failures, and

•

requiring substantial capital expenditures and operating expenses to remediate damage, replace our facilities, and restore our operations.

A significant portion of our business operations are concentrated in the Baltimore, Maryland region and in London, England. In addition, we maintain offices with associates in many other global locations such as Sydney, Australia; Hong Kong; Singapore; Tokyo, Japan; and Luxembourg. We have developed various backup systems and contingency plans, but we cannot be assured that those preparations will be adequate in all circumstances that could arise, or that material interruptions and disruptions will not occur. We also rely to varying degrees on outside vendors for service delivery in addition to technology and disaster contingency support, and we cannot be assured that these vendors will be able to perform in an adequate and timely manner. If we lose the availability of any associates, or if we are unable to respond adequately to such an event in a timely manner, we may be unable to timely resume our business operations, which could lead to a tarnished reputation and loss of customers that results in a decrease in assets under management, lower revenues, and materially reduced net income.

Our investment income and asset levels may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in our investment portfolio.

We currently have a substantial investment portfolio. All of these investments are subject to investment market risk, and our non-operating investment income could be adversely affected by the realization of losses upon the disposition of our investments or the recognition of significant impairments and the recognition of unrealized losses related to

T. Rowe Price products

that are consolidated or accounted for under the equity method. In addition, related investment income has fluctuated significantly over the years depending upon the performance of our corporate investments, including the impact of market conditions and interest rates, and the size of our corporate money market and longer-term mutual fund holdings. Fluctuations in other investment income are expected to occur in the future.

We may review and pursue strategic transactions in order to maintain or enhance our competitive position and these could pose risks.

From time to time, we consider strategic opportunities, including potential acquisitions, dispositions, consolidations, organizational restructurings, joint ventures or similar transactions, any of which may impact our business. We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify, consummate and successfully complete such transactions, and no assurance can be given with respect to the timing, likelihood or business effect of any possible transaction. These initiatives typically involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges to our ongoing business operations. In addition, acquisitions and related transactions involve risks, including unanticipated problems regarding integration of investor account and investment security recordkeeping, additional or new


Page



C^<l3Q6*4v9%C:Mg

regulatory requirements, operating facilities and technologies, and new employees; adverse effects on our earnings in the event acquired intangible assets or goodwill become impaired; and the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or otherwise known by us prior to closing a transaction.

We own a 26% investment in UTI Asset Management Company Ltd ("UTI"), an Indian asset management company, and we may consider non-controlling minority investments in other entities in the future. We may not realize future returns from such investments or any collaborative activities that may develop in the future.

We are exposed to risks arising from our international operations.

We operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the U.S. and have an equity investment in UTI. Our international operations require us to comply with the legal and regulatory requirements of various foreign jurisdictions and expose us to the political consequences of operating in foreign jurisdictions. Our foreign business operations are also subject to the following risks:

•

difficulty in managing, operating, and marketing our international operations;

•

fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may result in substantial negative effects on assets under our management, revenues, expenses, and assets in our U.S. dollar based financial statements; and

•

significant adverse changes in international legal and regulatory environments.

LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS.

Compliance within a complex regulatory environment imposes significant financial and strategic costs on our business, and non-compliance could result in fines and penalties.

If we are unable to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to criminal and civil liability, the suspension of our employees, fines, penalties, sanctions, injunctive relief, exclusion from certain markets, or temporary or permanent loss of licenses or registrations necessary to conduct our business. A regulatory proceeding, even if it does not result in a finding of wrongdoing or sanctions, could consume substantial expenditures of time and capital. Any regulatory investigation and any failure to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations could severely damage our reputation, adversely affect our ability to conduct business, and decrease revenue and net income.

Legal and regulatory developments in the mutual fund and investment advisory industry could increase our regulatory burden, impose significant financial and strategic costs on our business, and cause a loss of, or impact the servicing of, our clients and fund shareholders.

Our regulatory environment is frequently altered by new regulations and by revisions to, and evolving interpretations of, existing regulations. New regulations present areas of uncertainty susceptible to alternative interpretations; regulators and prospective litigants may not agree with reasoned interpretations we adopt. Future changes could require us to modify or curtail our investment offerings and business operations or impact our expenses and profitability. Additionally, some regulations may not directly apply to our business but may impact the capital markets, service providers or have other indirect effects on our ability to provide services to our clients.

Potential impacts of current or proposed legal or regulatory requirements include, without limitation, the following:

•

As part of the debate in Washington, D.C. and in state legislatures, there has been increasing focus on the framework of the U.S. retirement system. We could experience adverse business impacts if legislative and regulatory changes limit retirement plans to certain products and services, or favor certain investment vehicles, that we do not offer or are not core to our business.

•

There has been substantial regulatory and legislative activity at federal and state levels regarding standards of care for financial services firms, related to both retirement and taxable accounts. Actions taken by applicable regulatory or legislative bodies may impact our business activities and increase our costs.

•

The Federal Reserve Board has adopted final regulations related to non-bank Systemically Important Financial Institutions ("SIFIs"), and other jurisdictions are contemplating similar regulation. At this time, US


Page



C^<l3Q6*4v9%C:Mg

regulators have not designated mutual funds or traditional asset managers as non-bank SIFIs. However, if any T. Rowe Price fund or T. Rowe Price affiliate was deemed a SIFI, increased regulatory oversight would apply to our business, which may include enhanced capital, liquidity, leverage, stress testing, resolution planning, and risk management requirements.

•

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC") has adopted certain amendments to its rules that would limit the ability of

T. Rowe Price investment products

to use futures, swaps, and other derivatives without additional registration. As such, we intend to register certain subsidiaries with the CFTC which would subject us to additional regulatory requirements and costs associated with registrations.

•

There has been increased global regulatory focus on the manner in which intermediaries are paid for distribution of mutual funds. Changes to long-standing market practices related to fees or enhanced disclosure requirements may negatively impact sales of mutual funds by intermediaries, especially if such requirements are not applied to other investment products.

•

We remain subject to various state, federal and international laws and regulations related to data privacy and protection of data we maintain concerning our customers and employees. These requirements continue to evolve. For example, California has adopted regulations, effective in January 1, 2020, which, among other things, significantly increased the potential penalties for non-compliance.

•

After the 2008 financial crisis, global regulations on over-the-counter derivatives spearheaded by The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in the United States and European Market Infrastructure Regulation in the European Union ("EU") have imposed clearing, margin, trade reporting, electronic trading and recordkeeping requirements on market participants. Alongside their general stabilizing and risk-reducing effect on the markets, these requirements have introduced operational complexity and additional costs to derivatives portfolios.

•

The revised Markets in Financial Instruments Directive ("MiFID II Directive") and Regulation ("MiFIR") (together “MiFID II”) applied across the EU and member states of the European Economic Area beginning on January 3, 2018. Implementation of MiFID II has significantly impacted both the structure and operation of EU financial markets. Some of the main changes introduced under MiFID II include applying enhanced disclosure requirements, enhancing conduct of business and governance requirements, broadening the scope of pre and post trade transparency, increasing transaction reporting requirements, transforming the relationship between client commissions and research, and further regulation of trading venues. Compliance with MiFID II has increased operational complexity and increased our costs. For example, we began to pay for third-party investment research used by our UK-based investment manager, T. Rowe Price International Ltd, in 2018, and we now pay for all the research needs of our investment professionals globally.

We cannot predict the nature of future changes to the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business, nor the extent of the impacts that will result from current or future proposals. However, any such changes are likely to increase the costs of compliance and the complexity of our operations. They may also result in changes to our product or service offerings. The changing regulatory landscape may also impact a number of our service providers and, to the extent such providers alter their services or increase their fees, it may impact our expenses or those of the products we offer.

We may become involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that may not be covered by insurance.

We are subject to regulatory and governmental inquiries and civil litigation. An adverse outcome of any such proceeding could involve substantial financial penalties. From time to time, various claims against us arise in the ordinary course of business, including employment-related claims. There also has been an increase in litigation and in regulatory investigations in the financial services industry in recent years, including customer claims, class action suits, and government actions alleging substantial monetary damages and penalties.

We carry insurance in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate. We cannot be assured that our insurance will cover every liability and loss to which we may be exposed, or that our insurance policies will continue to be available at acceptable terms and fees. Certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods. As our insurance policies come up for renewal, we may need to assume higher deductibles or co-insurance liabilities, or pay higher premiums, which would increase our expenses and reduce our net income.


Page



C^<l3Q6*4v9%C:Mg

Net capital requirements may impede the business operations of our subsidiaries.

Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to net capital requirements imposed by various federal, state, and foreign authorities. Each of our subsidiaries’ net capital meets or exceeds all current minimum requirements; however, a significant change in the required net capital, an operating loss, or an extraordinary charge against net capital could adversely affect the ability of our subsidiaries to expand or maintain their operations if we were unable to make additional investments in them.

United Kingdom exit from European Union.

We have a significant locally authorized and regulated presence in the United Kingdom (“UK”) to support our global investment management business. The ultimate impact of the UK exit (“Brexit”) from the European Union (“EU”), on our business operations in the UK and Europe could vary depending on the details of the separation agreement or any subsequent trade relationship between the UK and EU. While we cannot predict the outcome at this time, we have realigned our EU and UK operations so that we are as prepared if the EU and UK are unable to reach a separation agreement or future trade agreement.  We remain committed to our clients, associates and business expansion across the region.

TECHNOLOGY RISKS.

We require specialized technology to operate our business and would be adversely affected if we fail to maintain adequate infrastructure to conduct or expand our operations or if our technology became inoperative or obsolete.

We depend on highly specialized and, in many cases, proprietary or third-party licensed technology to support our business functions, including among others:

•

securities analysis,

•

securities trading,

•

portfolio management,

•

customer service,

•

accounting and internal financial reporting processes and controls, and

•

regulatory compliance and reporting.

All of our technology systems, including those provided by vendors, are vulnerable to disability or failures due to cyber-attacks, natural disasters, power failures, acts of war or terrorism, sabotage, and other causes. A suspension or termination of vendor-provided software licenses or related support, upgrades, and maintenance could cause system delays or interruption. Although we have robust business and disaster recovery plans, if our technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way, we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions, which could lead to a loss of customers and could harm our reputation. A technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements, exposing us to disciplinary action and liability to our customers.

In addition, our continued success depends on our ability to effectively integrate operations across many countries, and to adopt new or adapt existing technologies to meet client, industry, and regulatory demands. We might be required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain competitive infrastructure. If we are unable to upgrade our infrastructure in a timely fashion, we might lose customers and fail to maintain regulatory compliance, which could affect our results of operations and severely damage our reputation.

A cyberattack or a failure to implement effective information and cybersecurity policies, procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses.

We are dependent on the effectiveness of the information and cybersecurity policies, procedures and capabilities we maintain to protect our systems and data. An externally caused information security incident, such as a


Page



C^<l3Q6*4v9%C:Mg

cyberattack, a phishing scam, virus, ransomware attack or denial-of-service attack, could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential client or competitive information. In addition, our third-party vendors and other intermediaries with which we conduct business and transmit data could be subject to a successful cyberattack or other information security event, and we cannot ensure that such third parties have all appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of information in the custody of those third parties.

There have been increasing numbers of publicized cybersecurity incidents in recent years impacting other financial services firms as well as firms in other industries. Our use of third-party vendors and cloud technologies could heighten this risk. Should our technology operations be compromised, we may have to make significant investments to upgrade, repair or replace our technology infrastructure and may not be able to make such investments on a timely basis. Although we maintain insurance coverage that we believe is reasonable, prudent and adequate for the purpose of our business, it may be insufficient to protect us against all losses and costs stemming from breaches of security, cyberattacks and other types of unlawful activity, or any resulting disruptions from such events.

We could be subject to losses if we fail to properly safeguard and maintain sensitive and confidential information.

As part of our normal operations, we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients, associates and other parties, as well as, proprietary information relating to our business operations. We maintain a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that fraudulent activity, including misappropriation of assets, fraudulent financial reporting, and unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data, is either prevented or detected in a timely manner. We also leverage cloud-based solutions for the transmission and storage of this information. Our systems, or those of third-party service providers we may use to maintain and transmit such information, could be victimized by unauthorized users or corrupted by computer viruses or other malicious software code. Additionally, authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release confidential or proprietary information. Such disclosure could, among other things:

•

seriously damage our reputation,

•

allow competitors access to our proprietary business information,

•

subject us to liability for a failure to safeguard personal or confidential data,

•

result in the termination of contracts by our existing customers,

•

subject us to regulatory action, and

•

require significant capital and operating expenditures to investigate and remediate the breach.

Furthermore, if any person, including any of our employees, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to personal or confidential data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions.

We are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information, such as U.S. federal and state laws and foreign regulations governing the protection of personal or confidential data. In addition to

the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation

, other governmental authorities throughout the U.S. and around the world are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA"), came into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices, and allows consumers to opt out of any sales of their data to third parties and provides a new cause of action for data breaches. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the collection, use, dissemination and security of data. Each of these privacy, security, and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations, require changes to our business, or restrict our use or storage of personal information, which may increase our compliance expenses and make our business more costly or less efficient to conduct.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

On February 14, 2017, T. Rowe Price Group, Inc., T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc., T. Rowe Price Trust Company, current and former members of the management committee, and trustees of the T. Rowe Price U.S. Retirement Program were named as defendants in a lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. The lawsuit alleges breaches of ERISA’s fiduciary duty and prohibited transaction provisions on behalf of a class of all participants and beneficiaries of the T. Rowe Price 401(k) Plan from February 14, 2011, to the time of judgment. The matter has been certified as a class action. T. Rowe Price believes the claims are without merit and is vigorously defending the action. This matter is in the discovery phase of litigation and we cannot predict the eventual outcome, or whether it will have a material negative impact on our financial results, or estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may arise from any negative outcome.

On April 27, 2016, certain shareholders in the T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund, T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation Fund, T. Rowe Price Equity Income Fund, T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund, T. Rowe Price International Stock Fund, T. Rowe Price High Yield Fund, T. Rowe Price New Income Fund and T. Rowe Price Small Cap Stock Fund (the “Funds”) filed a Section 36(b) complaint under the caption Zoidis v. T. Rowe Price Assoc., Inc., against T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. (“T. Rowe Price”) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaint alleges that the management fees for the identified funds are excessive because

T. Rowe Price charges lower advisory fees to subadvised clients with funds in the same strategy. The complaint seeks to recover the allegedly excessive advisory fees received by T. Rowe Price in the year preceding the start of the lawsuit, along with investments’ returns and profits. In the alternative, the complaint seeks the rescission of each fund’s investment management agreement and restitution of any allegedly excessive management fees.

T. Rowe Price believes the claims are without merit and is vigorously defending the action. This matter is in the discovery phase of litigation and we cannot predict the eventual outcome, or whether it will have a material negative impact on our financial results, or estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may arise from any negative outcome.

In addition to the matters discussed above, various claims against us arise in the ordinary course of business, including employment-related claims. In the opinion of management, after consultation with counsel, the likelihood of an adverse determination in one or more of these pending ordinary course of business claims that would have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations is remote.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

OVERVIEW.

Our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory services provided to individual and institutional investors in

U.S. mutual funds

, subadvised funds, separately managed accounts, and

other T. Rowe Price products

. The other T. Rowe Price products include: collective investment trusts, open-ended investment products offered to investors outside the U.S., and

products

offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the U.S.

We manage a broad range of U.S., international and global stock, bond, and money market mutual funds and

other investment products

, which meet the varied needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors. Investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management. Accordingly, fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management affect our revenues and results of operations. Additionally, approximately one-third of our operating expenses are impacted by financial markets. We incur significant expenditures to develop new products and services and improve and expand our capabilities and distribution channels in order to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from our existing clients. These efforts often involve costs that precede any future revenues that we may recognize from an increase to our assets under management.

The general trend to passive investing has been persistent and accelerated in recent years, which has negatively impacted our new client inflows. However, over the long term we expect well-executed active management to play an important role for investors. In this regard, we remain debt-free with ample liquidity and resources that allow us to take advantage of attractive growth opportunities. We are investing in key capabilities, including investment professionals, technologies, and new product offerings; and, most importantly, we provide our clients with strong investment management expertise and service both now and in the future.

MARKET TRENDS.

U.S. stocks surged in 2019, as equities bounced back strongly from deep losses in the fourth quarter of 2018. A major driver of market performance was the Federal Reserve’s decision to keep short-term interest rates steady in the first half of the year, then reduce rates three times starting in late July as a “midcycle adjustment” of its monetary policy. Many other central banks around the world also reduced rates in response to slowing economic growth. The trade conflict between the U.S. and China was another major driver of market sentiment. Markets wavered at times through much of the year as both sides announced new tariffs on the other’s goods. Speculation then arose in the fall that the U.S. and China were close to reaching an agreement, but a preliminary “phase one” trade deal was not reached until December.

Stocks in developed non-U.S. equity markets rose strongly but underperformed U.S. shares. European stocks were widely positive. UK shares advanced more than 21% but lagged the region as Brexit-related uncertainty persisted for most of the year. Boris Johnson succeeded Theresa May as Prime Minister during the summer, but the House of Commons did not vote in favor of the United Kingdom’s Withdrawal Agreement with the European Union until December, shortly after the Conservative Party decisively won a general election. Returns in developed Asian markets were broadly positive in U.S. dollar terms. Hong Kong underperformed the region with a 10% gain. Hong Kong’s economy and stock market have been hurt by ongoing protests that were triggered by a controversial extradition bill.

Emerging markets stocks underperformed shares in developed markets. Asian equities were mostly positive in U.S. dollar terms, but most markets significantly lagged strong returns in China and Taiwan. In emerging Europe, Russian stocks surged about 53%; Turkish stocks lagged with a 12% gain. In Latin America, stocks in Colombia and Brazil posted very strong returns, but shares in Argentina and Chile fell sharply.

Results of several major equity market indexes for


are as follows:

(1)

Returns exclude dividends

Global bond returns were broadly positive, as longer-term government bond yields in developed markets declined and various central banks enacted new stimulus measures. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds target rate to a range of 1.50%-1.75% by the end of the year. The 10-year Treasury note yield decreased from 2.69% to 1.92% at year-end, though above its late-summer lows, which were around 1.50%.

In the U.S., the investment-grade bond market, long-term Treasuries and corporate bonds fared best. Mortgage-backed securities advanced to a lesser extent, hindered by an increase in mortgage prepayments and refinancing activity. Municipal bonds did well amid solid demand but slightly underperformed taxable securities. High yield bonds advanced strongly for the year as investors embraced riskier assets and searched for higher yields because of falling interest rates.

Bonds in developed non-U.S. markets produced positive returns in U.S. dollar terms, as the dollar weakened against most major currencies and government bond yields generally declined. In the eurozone, the European Central Bank decided to cut its short-term benchmark rate deeper into negative territory in September. On November 1, the European Central Bank resumed its quantitative easing program and began purchasing €20 billion of securities every month. Emerging markets debt appreciated strongly in dollar terms. Bonds denominated in U.S. dollars outperformed local currency debt, as a few key emerging markets currencies declined against the dollar.

Results Overview

Investment advisory revenues.

Investment advisory fees are earned based on the value and composition of our assets under management, which change based on fluctuations in financial markets and net cash flows. As our average assets under management increase or decrease in a given period, the level of our investment advisory fee revenue for that same period generally fluctuates in a similar manner. Our annualized effective fee rates can be impacted by market or cash flow related shifts among asset and share classes, price changes in existing products, and asset level changes in products with tiered-fee structures.

Investment advisory revenues earned in


increased

5.4%

over the comparable

2018 period

as average assets under our management

increase

d

$72.8 billion

, or

7.0%

, to

$1,109.3 billion

. The average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was

46.1 basis points

in


, compared with

46.8 basis points

earned in


. Our effective fee rate has declined largely due to client transfers within the complex to lower fee vehicles or share classes over the last year and, to a lesser extent, fee reductions we made to certain mutual funds and other products since


. We regularly assess the competitiveness of our investment advisory fees and will continue to make adjustments as deemed appropriate.

contributing to our lower effective fee rate in

.

Operating expenses.

Operating expenses were

$3,230.9 million

in


, an increase of

7.3%

over the comparable

2018 period

. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to greater market-related compensation expense related to the supplemental savings plan liability, higher salaries and benefits, higher bonus and stock-based compensation expense and the cost of our continued strategic investments. The 2018 period also includes the non-recurring $15.2 million reduction in operating expenses related to the conclusion of the Dell appraisal rights matter. The higher expense related to the supplemental savings plan in


is partially offset by non-operating gains earned on the investments used to hedge the related liability.

For


, operating expenses were

$3,011.2 million

as compared with

$2,746.1 million

in the


period. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to our continued strategic investments and higher bonus and stock-based compensation, which were driven by our


operating results.

On a non-GAAP basis, our operating expenses in


increased

4.1%

to

$3,149.8 million

compared with


. In


, our non-GAAP operating expenses increased

8.9%

to

$3,025.5 million

compared with


. Our non-GAAP operating expenses exclude the impacts of our supplemental savings plan, investment income related to certain other investments, our consolidated T. Rowe Price investment products, and certain non-recurring items. See our non-GAAP reconciliations later in this Management's Discussion and Analysis section.

Our 2017 and 2018 operating expenses include certain financial impacts related to the Dell appraisal rights matter as further discussed in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. A summary of the financial impact of the Dell appraisal rights matter on our annual pre-tax operating expenses and pre-tax operating cash flows since the matter arose in 2016 is as follows:

There was no operating expense or cash flows impact related to the Dell appraisal rights matter in 2019.

In


, we expect to advance our strategic priorities to sustain and deepen our investment talent, add investment capabilities both in terms of new strategies and new investment vehicles, expand capabilities through enhanced technology, and broaden our distribution reach globally. We currently expect our


non-GAAP operating expenses to grow in the range of 6% to 9%. This expense growth guidance includes continued investments in the business and technology capabilities, our cost optimization efforts, and the final part of the phased implementation of paying for all third-party investment research. As such, 2020 operating expenses will reflect a full year of all third-party investment research costs globally. We could elect to adjust our expense growth should unforeseen circumstances arise, including significant market movements.

Operating margin.

Our operating margin in


was

42.5%

, compared with

44.0%

in


and

43.4%

in


. The decrease in our operating margin in


compared with


is primarily driven by the higher compensation expense growth related to our supplemental savings plan as compared with the percentage growth in net revenues during


. The increase in our operating margin in


compared to


was driven by the higher percentage growth in net revenue attributable primarily to increases in our average assets under management compared with the percentage growth in operating expenses.

Diluted earnings per share was

$8.70

in


,

$7.27

in


, and

$5.97

in


. The

19.7%

increase in diluted earnings per share in


compared to 2018 was primarily driven by higher non-operating income, the benefit realized from increased share buybacks, which lowered the weighted-average shares outstanding, and a lower effective tax rate. The 21.8% increase in diluted earnings per share in


compared with


was driven by higher operating income and the benefit realized from a lower corporate tax rate under U.S. Tax Reform.


Page



C^<l3Q6*4v9%C:Mg

On a non-GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share were

$8.07

in


,

$7.15

in 2018, and

$5.43

in 2017. The 12.9% increase in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily driven by higher operating income, higher investment income earned on our cash and discretionary investment portfolio, and lower weighted-average shares outstanding. See our non-GAAP reconciliations later in this Management's Discussion and Analysis section.

Net revenues

Investment advisory fees.

Investment advisory fees are earned based on the value and composition of our assets under management, which change based on fluctuations in financial markets and net cash flows. As our average assets under management increase or decrease in a given period, the level of our investment advisory fee revenue for that same period generally fluctuates in a similar manner. The relationship between the change in average assets under management and the change in investment advisory fee revenue for


,


and


are presented below.

Market fluctuations and net cash flows can shift the asset and share class mix among different fee rates and products including those with tiered-fee structures. Over the last few years, we have also reduced the management fees of certain products.

While equity markets outperformed fixed income markets in 2019 and resulted in a shift of the U.S. mutual fund average asset mix to higher fee equity products over 2018, lower incremental fee tiered rates and certain fund price reductions created lower incremental revenues. Strong market returns in 2019 and U.S. mutual fund to trust transfers have primarily increased average assets under management for our subadvised and separate accounts and other products. However, lower incremental fee rates on higher average assets and growth in lower fee share classes resulted in slower revenue growth in 2019 over 2018.

In 2018, investment advisory fees earned on our subadvised and separate accounts and other investment products grew slower relative to average assets under management as a result of the significant client transfers from mutual funds to lower fee vehicles.

Administrative, distribution, and servicing fees.

Administrative, distribution, and servicing fees

represent fees earned from providing administrative and distribution services to our investment advisory clients, primarily U.S. mutual funds and their investors. For


, these fees were

$505.4 million

,

a decrease

of

$16.6 million

from the comparable

2018 period

. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower 12b-1 revenue earned on certain share classes, including the Advisor and R classes, of the U.S. mutual funds as client transfers to lower fee vehicles and share classes has reduced assets under management in these share classes. The decrease in 12b-1 revenue is offset entirely by a reduction in the costs paid to third-party intermediaries that source these assets and is reported in distribution and servicing expense. In addition, higher recordkeeping fees and transaction fees were partially offset by lower mutual fund service revenues.

For


, administrative, distribution, and servicing fees were

$522.0 million

, a

decrease

of

$37.1 million

from the comparable


period. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower assets under management in the U.S. mutual funds resulting from client transfers among vehicles and share classes and the sharp market decline at the end of 2018.

Net revenues include the elimination of

$6.8 million

for


,

$6.2 million

Compensation and related costs.

Compensation and related costs

increased

$160.6 million

, or

8.9%

, for


as compared with


. Nearly half of the increase in compensation and related costs is attributable to $78.8 million in higher expense related to our supplemental savings plan given the strong equity market returns experienced in


compared with the sharp equity market declines in late 2018. The higher expense related to the supplemental savings plan is partially offset by the non-operating gains earned on the investments used to economically hedge the related liability. We also experienced increases in base salaries, benefits, and related employee costs, of $66.0 million as our average staff size grew

3.1%

in 2019 and we modestly increased base salaries at the beginning of


. Our 2019 operating results led to a $28.8 million increase in annual variable compensation, primarily bonus compensation, as well as a $9.5 million increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense. These increases in compensation and related costs were offset in part by the absence of the one-time $9.0 million bonus paid to certain associates in the second quarter of 2018 and $10.0 million in higher labor capitalization related to internally developed software in 2019.

For


, compensation and related costs increased

$143.7 million

, or

8.6%

, as compared with


. The largest part of the increase was an increase base salaries, benefits and related employee costs of $77.1 million, resulting from an increase of 6.2% in average headcount, combined with a modest increase in salaries at the beginning of 2018. Our operating results led to a $68.0 million increase in variable compensation and contributed to the $45.0 million increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense as the annual grant value was higher in


. Additionally, our


equity grant reflected the adoption of more favorable post-retirement vesting provisions, which shifted a greater percentage of the expense related to the annual grant to be recognized for


. The



Page



C^<l3Q6*4v9%C:Mg

period also included $9.0 million in one-time bonuses paid to certain associates from U.S. tax reform benefits. These increases were partially offset by lower market-related expense of $30.3 million from our supplemental savings plan and higher labor capitalization related to internally developed software.

Distribution and servicing costs.

Distribution and servicing

costs includes those costs incurred to distribute the T. Rowe Price products as well as client and shareholder servicing, recordkeeping, and administrative services. Distribution and servicing costs were

$262.5 million

for


,

a decrease

of

$18.7 million

, or

6.7%

, compared to


. The decrease for


from


was primarily driven by client transfers, largely from Advisor and R classes, to lower fee vehicles or share classes during


, which resulted in lower assets under management in those mutual funds on which we pay distribution and servicing costs. These costs include those distribution and servicing costs paid to third-party intermediaries that source the assets of certain share classes of our U.S. mutual funds and is offset entirely by the 12b-1 revenue we earn and report in administrative, distribution, and servicing fees.

Distribution and servicing costs were

$281.2 million

for


,

an increase

of

$18.6 million

, or

7.1%

, compared with

Advertising and promotion costs were

$96.8 million

a decrease

of

During


, non-operating income included the impact of sharp market declines in the later part of 2018, which resulted in unrealized losses on our investment portfolio, including our consolidated products, compared with unrealized gains recognized during 2017. Partially offsetting these losses was the recognition during 2018 of a realized gain in other investment income associated with the sale of our 10% holding in Daiwa SB Investments Ltd. Additionally, on January 1, 2018, we implemented new accounting guidance that eliminated the available-for-sale investment category for equity securities. As a result of this change, realized gains of $83.1 million from the sale of certain available-for-sale investments recognized in 2017 did not reoccur in 2018.

Provision for income taxes

Our effective tax rate for


was

23.2%

, compared with

25.8%

for


and 36.9% for


. The decrease in our effective tax rate in 2019 from 2018 was primarily due to higher net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests related to our consolidated T. Rowe Price investment products, as these earnings are not taxable to us, as well as a lower state tax rate from the Maryland state legislation in 2018, and the absence in 2019 of the 2018 nonrecurring charges related to the enactment of U.S. tax reform. The decrease in our effective tax rate in 2018 from 2017 was primarily due to the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% on January 1, 2018 following the enactment on December 22, 2017, of a comprehensive U.S. tax reform bill known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Reform"). For


and 2017, the income tax provision includes nonrecurring charges of $20.8 million and

$71.1 million

, respectively, related to the enactment of U.S. tax reform as we adjusted our deferred tax asset and liability estimates.

On April 24, 2018, the state of Maryland enacted new state tax legislation. This new state tax legislation, effective in


, adopted a five-year phase-in of the single sales factor method of apportionment for calculating income tax for multi-state companies doing business in Maryland and is expected to result in a net benefit over time. Accordingly, we recognized a nonrecurring charge of $7.9 million during


for the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the effect of this Maryland state tax legislation. Based on information currently available, we expect that the Maryland state tax legislation will reduce our effective state tax rate over the five-year phase-in period to less than 3%.

State income tax benefits are reflected in the total benefits for net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests and stock-based compensation plans activity.

Our effective tax rate will continue to experience volatility in future periods as the tax benefits recognized from stock-based compensation are impacted by market fluctuations in our stock price and timing of option exercises. The rate will also be impacted by changes in our consolidated investment products that are driven by market fluctuations and changes in the proportion of their net income that is attributable to non-controlling interests. We currently estimate our effective tax rate for the full-year


will be in the range of

23%

NON-GAAP INFORMATION AND RECONCILIATION.

We believe the non-GAAP financial measures below provide relevant and meaningful information to investors about our core operating results. These measures have been established in order to increase transparency for the purpose of evaluating our core business, for comparing current results with prior period results, and to enable more appropriate comparison with industry peers. However, non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be calculated differently by other companies.

The following schedules reconcile certain U.S. GAAP financial measures for each of the last five years.

C^<l3Q6*4v9%C:Mg

(1)

These non-GAAP adjustments remove the impact the consolidated T. Rowe Price investment products have on our U.S. GAAP consolidated statements of income. Specifically, we add back the operating expenses and subtract the investment income of the consolidated T. Rowe Price investment products. The adjustment to our operating expenses represents the operating expenses of the consolidated products, net of the elimination of related management and administrative fees. The adjustment to net income attributable to T. Rowe Price Group represents the net income of the consolidated products, net of redeemable non-controlling interest. We remove the impact of the consolidated

T. Rowe Price investment products as we believe they impact the reader’s ability to understand our core operating results.

(2)

These non-GAAP adjustments remove the compensation expense from market valuation changes in the supplemental savings plan liability and the related net gains (losses) on investments designated as an economic hedge against the related liability. Amounts deferred under the supplemental savings plan are adjusted for appreciation (depreciation) of hypothetical investments chosen by participants. We use T. Rowe Price investment products to economically hedge the exposure to these market movements. We believe it is useful to offset the non-operating investment income (loss) realized on the hedges against the related compensation expense and remove the net impact to help the reader's ability to understand our core operating results and to increase comparability period to period.

(3)

This non-GAAP adjustment represents the other non-operating income (loss) and the net gains (losses) earned on our non-consolidated investment portfolio that are not designated as economic hedges of the supplemental savings plan liability, and, beginning in the second quarter of 2018, non-consolidated seed investments and other investments that are not part of the cash and discretionary investment portfolio. In the second quarter of 2018, we decided to retain the investment gains recognized on our non-consolidated cash and discretionary investments as these assets and related income (loss) are considered part of our core operations. The impact on previously reported non-GAAP measures is immaterial. We believe adjusting for these non-operating income (loss) items helps the reader’s ability to understand our core operating results and increases comparability to prior years. Additionally, we do not emphasize the impact of the portion of non-operating income (loss) removed when managing and evaluating our core performance.

(4)

During the second quarter of 2018, we recognized a nonrecurring charge of $20.8 million for an adjustment made to the charge taken in 2017 related to the enactment of U.S. tax reform. We believe it is useful to readers of our consolidated statements of income to adjust for this nonrecurring charge in arriving at net income attributable to

T. Rowe Price Group and diluted earnings per share.

(5)

During the second quarter of 2018, we recognized a nonrecurring charge of $7.9 million for the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the effect of Maryland state tax legislation enacted on April 24, 2018. We believe it is useful to readers of our consolidated statements of income to adjust for this nonrecurring charge in arriving at net income attributable to T. Rowe Price Group and diluted earnings per share.

(6)

In 2016, we recognized a nonrecurring charge, net of insurance recoveries, of $66.2 million related to our decision to compensate certain clients in regard to the Dell appraisal rights matter. In 2017, we recognized additional insurance recoveries of $50 million as a reduction in operating expenses. During 2018, we recognized an additional reduction in operating expenses of $15.2 million upon recovering a portion of the payments we made to our clients in 2016. We believe it is useful to our readers of our consolidated statements of income to adjust for these charges and nonrecurring recoveries in arriving at adjusted operating expenses, net operating income, provision for income taxes, net income attributable to T. Rowe Price Group and diluted earnings per share.

The income tax impacts were calculated in order to achieve an overall non-GAAP effective tax rate of 24.0% for 2019, 24.1% for 2018, 34.7% for 2017, 36.6% for 2016, and 38.9% for 2015. We estimate that our effective tax rate for the full-year 2020 on a non-GAAP basis will be in the range of

23.5%

to

25.5%

.

This non-GAAP measure was calculated by applying the two-class method to adjusted net income attributable to

T. Rowe Price Group divided by the weighted-average common shares outstanding assuming dilution. The calculation of net income allocated to common stockholders is as follows:

Sources of Liquidity

We remain debt-free with ample liquidity, including cash and investments in T. Rowe Price products as follows:

Our discretionary investment portfolio is comprised primarily of short duration bond funds, which typically yield higher than money market rates, and asset allocation products. Cash and discretionary investments generated income of $126.0 million in

$665.8 million

at

December 31, 2019

, and

$634.5 million

at

December 31, 2018

. Given the availability of our financial resources and cash expected to be generated through future operations, we do not maintain an available external source of additional liquidity.

Our seed capital investments are redeemable, although we generally expect to be invested for several years for the products to build an investment performance history and until unrelated third-party investors substantially reduce our relative ownership percentage.

The cash and investment presentation on the consolidated balance sheet is based on how we account for the cash or investment. The following table details how T. Rowe Price Group’s interests in cash and T. Rowe Price investment products relate to where they are presented in the consolidated balance sheet as of

, include assets of

$2,276.9 million

less liabilities of

$39.2

million as reflected in the consolidated balance sheet in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.

Our consolidated balance sheet reflects the cash and cash equivalents, investments, other assets and liabilities of those

T. Rowe Price investment products

we consolidate, as well as redeemable non-controlling interests for the portion of these

T. Rowe Price investment products

that are held by unrelated third-party investors. Although we can redeem our net interest in these

T. Rowe Price investment products

at any time, we cannot directly access or sell the assets held by the

products

to obtain cash for general operations. Additionally, the assets of these

T. Rowe Price investment products

are not available to our general creditors. Our interest in these

T. Rowe Price investment products

was used as initial seed capital and is recategorized as discretionary when it is determined by management that the seed capital is no longer needed. We assess the discretionary products and, when we decide to liquidate our interest, we seek to do so in a way as to not impact the product and, ultimately, the unrelated third-party investors.

Uses of Liquidity

We paid

$3.04

per share in regular dividends in


, an increase of

8.6%

over the

$2.80

per share paid in


. Additionally, we expended

$708.8 million

in


to repurchase

7.0 million

shares, or

2.9%

, of our outstanding common stock at an average price of

$101.65

per share. These dividends and repurchases were expended using existing cash balances and cash generated from operations. We will generally repurchase our common stock over time to offset the dilution created by our equity-based compensation plans.

Since the end of 2016, we have returned

$4.3 billion

to stockholders through stock repurchases and our regular quarterly dividends, as follows:

We anticipate property and equipment expenditures for the full-year


to be up to

$210 million

,

an increase

of

$24.2 million

from the


period. Operating cash flows increased by $334.6 million on higher net income after adjusting for significant non-cash activity including depreciation expense and stock-based compensation expense. This increase was offset in part by higher market gains on investments of

$303.2 million

due to stronger equity market returns compared to 2018. During 2019, we invested an additional $126.0 million in certain investment products that act as an economic hedge of our supplemental savings plan liability. This level of investment is comparable to the amount invested in 2018. Timing differences on the cash settlement of our assets and liabilities also increased operating cash flows by

$10.7 million

. The remaining change in reported cash flows from operating activities was attributable to the net change in trading securities held in our consolidated investment products’ underlying portfolios.

Operating activities attributable to T. Rowe Price Group during


provided cash flows of $2,178.1 million, an increase of $626.3 million from the


period. The increase in these operating cash flows was driven by $641.6 million of higher net income after adjusting for significant non-cash activity including depreciation expense, stock-based compensation expense and market gains on investments. Adjustments for market gains on investments decreased during


in part due to a change in accounting guidance that we adopted on January 1, 2018. The remaining decrease in investment gain activity is due to lower gains as a result of weaker equity markets in


compared with


. Additionally, during


, we invested $218.6 million into certain investment products to establish an economic hedge of our supplemental savings plan liability and invested an additional $129.5 million in


in order to maintain it. The remaining $104.4 million decrease in operating cash flows attributable to T. Rowe Price Group relates to timing differences on the cash settlement of our assets and liabilities, including the settlement of insurance receivables during 2017 related to the Dell appraisal rights matter. The remaining change in reported cash flows from operating activities was attributable to the net change in trading securities held in our consolidated investment products’ underlying portfolios.

$36.1 million

, an

$89.2 million

increase in the level of seed capital provided, and the absence of the proceeds from the sale of our 10% interest in Daiwa SB Investments Ltd. received in 2018 and included in other investing activity.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS.

The following table presents a summary of our future obligations under the terms of our supplemental savings plan, existing operating leases, and other contractual cash purchase commitments at

December 31, 2019

. The information presented does not include operating expenses or capital expenditures that will be committed in the normal course of operations in


and future years. The information also excludes the

$23.9 million

of unrecognized tax benefits discussed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements because it is not possible to estimate the time period in which a payment might be made to the tax authorities.

(1)

These obligations represent the amount of future expected funding requirements related to our supplemental savings plan. Payment periods are based on deferral elections made by participants. If no deferral election has been made, the obligation has been included in the "Thereafter" column as the timing of distributions will be determined upon termination of employment. We economically hedge this liability and the related market exposure with investments in certain T. Rowe Price products. The carrying value of these investments at December 31, 2019 was

$561.1 million

and was reported within the Investments line on our consolidated balance sheet. Either these investments or future cash flows from operations are expected to be used to fund the future liability payments.

(2)

Other purchase commitments include contractual amounts that will be due for the purchase of goods or services to be used in our operations and may be cancelable at earlier times than those indicated, under certain conditions that may involve termination fees. Because these obligations are generally of a normal recurring nature, we expect that we will fund them from future cash flows from operations.

We also have outstanding commitments to fund additional contributions to investment partnerships totaling

$18.1 million

at

December 31, 2019

. The vast majority of these additional contributions will be made to investment partnerships in which we have an existing investment. In addition to such amounts, a percentage of prior distributions may be called under certain circumstances.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES.

The preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives. Further, significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, the revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of income, and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to the consolidated financial statements. Making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time. Accordingly, actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements, significant accounting policies, and notes.

We present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this


Annual Report. In the following discussion, we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements.


Page



C^<l3Q6*4v9%C:Mg

Consolidation

We consolidate all subsidiaries and

T. Rowe Price investment products

in which we have a controlling interest. We are generally deemed to have a controlling interest when we own the majority of the voting interest of an entity or are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity ("VIE"). VIEs are entities that lack sufficient equity to finance its activities or the equity holders do not have defined power to direct the activities of the entity normally associated with an equity investment. Our analysis to determine whether an entity is a VIE or a voting interest entity ("VOE") involves judgment and considers several factors, including an entity’s legal organization, capital structure, the rights of the equity investment holders, our ownership interest in the entity, and our contractual involvement with the entity. We continually review and reconsider our VIE or VOE conclusions upon the occurrence of certain events, such as changes to our ownership interest, changes to an entity’s legal structure, or amendments to governing documents. Our VIEs are primarily

T. Rowe Price investment products

and our variable interest consists of our equity ownership in and investment management fees earned from these entities.

We are the primary beneficiary if we have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant. Our SICAV funds and other

T. Rowe Price investment products

regulated outside the U.S. are determined to be VIEs. At

December 31, 2019

, we consolidated VIEs with net assets of

$1.9 billion

.

Other-than-temporary impairments of equity method investments

We evaluate our equity method investments, including our investment in UTI and certain investments in

T. Rowe Price investment products

, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value, and the decline in fair value is other than temporary.

Goodwill

We internally conduct, manage, and report our operations as one investment advisory business. We do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business. Accordingly, we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit—our investment advisory business.

We evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach. Goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business. Our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business (our market capitalization) exceeds our carrying amount (our stockholders’ equity) and, therefore, no impairment exists. Should we reach a different conclusion in the future, additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the noncash impairment charge to be recognized. We must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred. The maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our consolidated balance sheets,

$665.7 million

as of

December 31, 2019

.

Provision for income taxes

After compensation and related costs, our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense. We operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income, expenses, and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions. Accordingly, our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations. Annually, we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities. Each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations. From time to time, we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to, or in the process of, being audited by various tax authorities. Because the determination of our annual provision is subject to judgments and estimates, it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements. As a result, we recognize additions to, or reductions of, income tax expense during a reporting period that pertain to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled. We recognize any such prior period adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined.

NEWLY ISSUED BUT NOT YET ADOPTED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE.

See

Note 1 - Basis of Preparation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

within Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a discussion of newly issued but not yet adopted accounting guidance.

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION.

From time to time, information or statements provided by or on behalf of T. Rowe Price, including those within this report, may contain certain forward-looking information, including information or anticipated information relating to: our revenues, net income, and earnings per share on common stock; changes in the amount and composition of our assets under management; our expense levels; our tax rate; and our expectations regarding financial markets, future transactions, dividends, stock repurchases, investments, capital expenditures, and other conditions. Readers are cautioned that any forward-looking information provided by or on behalf of T. Rowe Price is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those in forward-looking information because of various factors including, but not limited to, those discussed below and in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K Annual Report. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

Our future revenues and results of operations will fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of assets under our management. Such changes result from many factors, including, among other things: cash inflows and outflows in the

U.S. mutual funds

and subadvised and separately managed accounts and

other investment products

, fluctuations in global financial markets that result in appreciation or depreciation of the assets under our management, our introduction of new mutual funds and investment

products

, and changes in retirement savings trends relative to participant-directed investments and defined contribution plans. The ability to attract and retain investors’ assets under our management is dependent on investor sentiment and confidence; the relative investment performance of the T. Rowe Price funds and other managed investment

products

as compared with competing offerings and market indexes; the ability to maintain our investment management and administrative fees at appropriate levels; competitive conditions in the mutual fund, asset management, and broader financial services sectors; and our level of success in implementing our strategy to expand our business. Our revenues are substantially dependent on fees earned under contracts with the T. Rowe Price funds and could be adversely affected if the independent directors of one or more of the T. Rowe Price funds terminated or significantly altered the terms of the investment management or related administrative services agreements. Non-operating investment income will also fluctuate primarily due to the size of our investments, changes in their market valuations, and any other-than-temporary impairments that may arise or, in the case of our equity method investments, our proportionate share of the investees' net income.

Our future results are also dependent upon the level of our expenses, which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons: changes in the level of our advertising and promotion expenses in response to market conditions, including our efforts to expand our investment advisory business to investors outside the U.S. and to further penetrate our distribution channels within the U.S.; the pace and level of spending to support key strategic priorities; variations in the level of total compensation expense due to, among other things, bonuses, restricted stock units and other equity grants, other incentive awards, our supplemental savings plan, changes in our employee count and mix, and competitive factors; any goodwill or other asset impairment that may arise; fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our international operations; expenses and capital costs, such as technology assets, depreciation, amortization, and research and development, incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure; the timing of the assumption of all third party research payments, unanticipated costs that may be incurred to protect investor accounts and the goodwill of our clients; and disruptions of services, including those provided by third parties, such as fund and

product

recordkeeping, facilities, communications, power, and the mutual fund transfer agent and accounting systems.

Our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation, and changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax, and compliance requirements may have a substantial effect on our operations and results, including, but not limited to, effects on costs that we incur and effects on investor interest in

T. Rowe Price investment products

and investing in general or in particular classes of mutual funds or other investments.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

EQUITY PRICE RISK.

The following table presents the equity price risk from our investments in

T. Rowe Price investment products

as they are carried at fair value. Investments in these

products

generally moderate market risk as they are diversified and invest in a number of different financial instruments. T. Rowe Price manages its cash and discretionary investments exposure to market risk by diversifying its investments among equity and fixed income portfolios. In addition, investment holdings may be altered from time to time in response to changes in market risks and other factors, as management deems appropriate. Seed capital investments, which are used for new product offerings, experience market volatility as we do not actively manage the market risk for these investments.

In order to quantify the sensitivity of our investments to changes in market valuations, we have chosen to use a variant of each

product

's net asset value to quantify the equity price risk, as we believe the volatility in each

product

's net asset value best reflects the underlying risk potential as well as the market trends surrounding each of its investment objectives. The potential future loss of value, before any income tax benefits, of these investments at

December 31, 2019

was determined by using the lower of each

product

’s lowest net asset value per share during


or its net asset value per share at

December 31, 2019

, reduced by 10%. In considering this presentation, it is important to note that: Not all

product

s experienced their lowest net asset value per share on the same day; it is likely that the composition of the investment portfolio would be changed if adverse market conditions persisted; and we could experience future losses in excess of those presented below.

Any losses arising from the change in fair value of investments in T. Rowe Price products would result in a corresponding decrease, net of tax, in our net income attributable to T. Rowe Price Group. The direct investment in consolidated

T. Rowe Price investment products

represents our portion of the net assets of the

product

. Upon consolidation of these

products

, our direct investment is eliminated, and the net assets of the

products

are combined in our consolidated balance sheet, together with redeemable non-controlling interests, which represents the portion of the

products

that is owned by unrelated third-party investors. Any losses arising from the change in fair value of our direct investments in consolidated

T. Rowe Price investment products

would also result in a corresponding decrease, net of tax, in our net income attributable to T. Rowe Price Group.

C^<l3Q6*4v9%C:Mg

CURRENCY TRANSLATION RISK.

Certain of our investments, including a few consolidated

T. Rowe Price investment products

, expose us to currency translation risk when the financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars ("USD"). Our most significant exposure relates to the translation of the financial statements of our equity method investment in UTI (

$164.5 million

at

December 31, 2019

). UTI's financial statements are denominated in Indian rupees ("INR") and are translated to USD each reporting period. We do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this currency risk, so both positive and negative fluctuations in the INR against the USD will affect accumulated other comprehensive income and the carrying amount of our investment. We had a cumulative translation

loss

, net of tax, of

$46.9 million

at

December 31, 2019

, related to our investment in UTI. Given the nature of UTI’s business, should conditions deteriorate in markets in which they operate, we are at risk for loss up to our carrying amount.

We operate in several countries outside the U.S. of which the United Kingdom is the most prominent. We incur operating expenses and have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than USD associated with these operations, although our revenues are predominately realized in USD. The majority of our currency translation risk on our consolidated balance sheet at

December 31, 2019

, related to cash and non-consolidated investments of $284.6 million that are denominated in foreign currencies. We do not believe that foreign currency fluctuations materially affect our results of operations.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 –

BASIS OF PREPARATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES.

T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. derives its consolidated revenues and net income primarily from investment advisory services that its subsidiaries provide to individual and institutional investors in the T. Rowe Price

U.S. mutual funds

("U.S. mutual funds"), subadvised funds, separately managed accounts, and

other T. Rowe Price products

. We also provide certain investment advisory clients with related administrative services, including distribution, mutual fund transfer agent, accounting and shareholder services; participant recordkeeping and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans; brokerage, and trust services.

Investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management. Accordingly, fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management impact our revenues and results of operations.

BASIS OF PREPARATION.

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

These principles require that we make certain estimates and assumptions. Actual results may vary from our estimates.

NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE.

We adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 — Leases (Topic 842) on January 1, 2019. The update required the recognition of right-of-use lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and the disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information about leasing arrangements. We adopted this standard using a modified retrospective approach without restating prior comparative periods. We also elected to use certain practical expedients that allowed us to not perform the following: (1) reassess whether expired or existing non-lease contracts that commenced before January 1, 2019 contained an embedded lease, (2) reevaluate the accounting classification of our existing operating leases, and (3) determine whether initial direct costs related to existing leases should be capitalized under this guidance.

On January 1, 2019, we recognized operating lease assets totaling

$

168.7

million

and corresponding operating lease liabilities of

$

168.7

million

related primarily to our real estate leases. At implementation, we also reclassified

$

27.7

million

in deferred rent liabilities related to these leases, reducing the recognized operating lease assets to

$

141.0

million

. The adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations; however, the initial recognition of our operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities on January 1, 2019, represented a non-cash investing activity that affected the amount reported in other changes in assets and liabilities in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Our leases accounting policy is included in the

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

section below. Additional information on our operating leases is included in Note 7 - Leases.

NEWLY ISSUED BUT NOT YET ADOPTED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE.

In August 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-15 — Intangibles—Goodwill and Other— Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract. This update provides additional guidance on the accounting for costs of implementation activities performed in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We will adopt this guidance on January 1, 2020, using the prospective method of adoption. We do not expect any material impact on our financial position and results of operations in future periods.

We have considered all other newly issued accounting guidance that is applicable to our operations and the preparation of our consolidated statements, including those we have not yet adopted. We do not believe that any such guidance has or will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.

C^<l3Q6*4v9%C:Mg

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES.

Consolidation

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries and

T. Rowe Price investment products

in which we have a controlling interest. We are deemed to have a controlling interest when we own the majority of a voting interest entity ("VOE") or are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity ("VIE"). We perform an analysis of our investments to determine if the investment entity is a VOE or a VIE. Our analysis involves judgment and considers several factors, including an entity’s legal organization, capital structure, the rights of the equity investment holders, our ownership interest in the entity, and our contractual involvement with the entity. We continually review and reconsider our VOE or VIE conclusions upon the occurrence of certain events, such as changes to our ownership interest, changes to an entity’s legal structure, or amendments to governing documents. All material accounts and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated in consolidation.

Variable interest entities

VIEs are entities that, by design: (i)

lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities independently or (ii) have equity holders that do not have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance, the obligation to absorb the entity’s losses, or the rights to receive the entity’s residual returns. We consolidate a VIE when we are the primary beneficiary, which is the party that has both (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant. Our Luxembourg-based SICAV funds and other

T. Rowe Price investment products

regulated outside the U.S. were determined to be VIEs.

Along with VIEs that we consolidate, we also hold variable interests in other VIEs, including several investment partnerships that are not consolidated because we are not the primary beneficiary.

Redeemable non-controlling interests

We recognize redeemable non-controlling interests for the portion of the net assets of our consolidated

T. Rowe Price investment products

held by unrelated third-party investors as their interests are convertible to cash and other assets at their option. As such, we reflect redeemable non-controlling interests as temporary equity in our consolidated balance sheets.

Investments in

T. Rowe Price money market mutual funds

We do not consider our investments in

T. Rowe Price money market mutual funds

when performing our consolidation analysis as the guidance provides a scope exception for interests in entities that are required to comply with, or operate in accordance with, requirements similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds.

Cash equivalents

Cash equivalents consist primarily of short-term, highly liquid investments in

T. Rowe Price money market mutual funds

. The cost of these funds is equivalent to fair value.

Investments

Investments held at fair value

Investments in

T. Rowe Price investment products

have been made for both general corporate investment purposes and to provide seed capital for newly formed

product

s. Those investments that we do not consolidate are carried at fair value using the quoted closing NAV per share of each fund as of the balance sheet date. The underlying investments held by our consolidated

T. Rowe Price investment products

retain investment company specialized accounting in consolidation, are considered securities held in a trading account for cash flow reporting purposes and are valued in accordance with the valuation and pricing policy used to value our assets under management which is further described in the Revenue Recognition policy below.

We elected to value our interest in investment partnerships, for which market prices or quotations are not readily available, at fair value using the NAV per share as a practical expedient.


Page



C^<l3Q6*4v9%C:Mg

Changes in the fair values of all these investments are reflected in non-operating income in our consolidated statements of income.

Equity method investments

Equity method investments

consist of investments in entities, including

T. Rowe Price investment products

, for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. The carrying values of these investments are adjusted to reflect our proportionate share of the investee's net income or loss, any unrealized gain or loss resulting from the translation of foreign-denominated financial statements into U.S. dollars, and dividends received. Our proportionate share of income or loss is included in non-operating income in our consolidated statements of income. As permitted under existing accounting guidance, we adopted a policy by which we recognize our share of UTI Asset Management Company Limited’s ("UTI") earnings on a quarter lag as current financial information is not available in a timely manner. The basis difference between our carrying value and our proportionate share of UTI’s book value is primarily related to consideration paid in excess of the stepped-up basis of assets and liabilities on the date of purchase.

Concentration of risk

Concentration of credit risk in accounts receivable is believed to be minimal in that our clients generally have substantial assets, including those in the investment portfolios we manage for them.

Our investments held at fair value expose us to market risk, that is, the potential future loss of value that would result from a decline in the fair value of each investment or its underlying net assets. The underlying holdings of our assets under management are also subject to market risk, which may arise from changes in equity prices, credit ratings, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates.

Leases

We review new arrangements at inception to evaluate whether we substantially obtain all the economic benefits of and have the right to control the use of an asset. If we determine that an arrangement qualifies as a lease, we recognize a lease liability and a corresponding asset on the lease’s commencement date. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term using the rate implicit in the arrangement or, if not available, our incremental borrowing rate. An operating lease asset is measured initially at the value of the lease liability less any lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred.

Our leases qualify as operating leases and consist primarily of real estate leases for corporate offices, data centers, and other facilities. We measure our operating lease liabilities using an estimated incremental borrowing rate as there is no rate implicit in any of our operating lease arrangements. Since we do not have any outstanding borrowings, we estimate our incremental borrowing rate using an estimated credit rating and available market information. Additionally, certain of our leases contain options to extend or terminate the lease term that, if exercised, would result in the remeasurement of the operating lease liability.

Our operating leases contain both lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components are distinct elements of a contract that are not related to securing the use of the lease assets, such as common area maintenance and other management costs. We elected to measure the lease liability of our real estate operating leases by combining the lease and non-lease components into one single lease component. As such, we included the fixed payments and any payments that depend on a rate or index related to our lease and non-lease components in measuring the operating lease liability.

We recognize operating lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term as part of technology, occupancy, and facility costs in our consolidated statements of income.

Property and equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation and amortization computed using the straight-line method. Provisions for depreciation and amortization are based on the following weighted-average estimated useful lives: computer and communications software and equipment,


years; buildings and improvements,


years; leasehold improvements,


years; furniture and other equipment,


years; and leased land,


years.

C^<l3Q6*4v9%C:Mg

Goodwill

We evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach. Our evaluations have indicated that no impairment exists.

We internally conduct, manage, and report our operations as one investment advisory business. We do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business. Accordingly, we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit—our investment advisory business.

Revenue recognition

Our revenue is earned from investment advisory, administrative, and distribution services we provide to our clients. Each distinct service we promise in our agreements is considered a performance obligation and is the basis for determining when we recognize revenue. The fees are allocated to each distinct performance obligation and we recognize revenue when, or as, we satisfy our promises. The consideration for our services is generally variable and included in net revenues, when it is improbable that a significant reversal could occur in the future. For certain client agreements, we have the discretion to hire a third party to provide services to our clients. In these circumstances, we are generally deemed to control the services before transferring them to our clients, and accordingly present the revenues gross of the related third-party costs. The timing of when we bill our clients and related payment terms vary in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms. For the majority of our agreements, billing occurs after we have recognized revenue, which results in accounts receivable and accrued revenue. For an insignificant portion of our contracts, billing occurs in advance of providing services, which results in deferred revenue within the accounts payable and accrued expenses line of our consolidated balance sheets.

Taxes billed to our clients based on our fees for services rendered are not included in revenues.

Investment advisory fees

The majority of our investment advisory agreements, including those with the U.S. mutual funds, have a single performance obligation as the promised services are not separately identifiable from other promises in the agreements and, therefore, are not distinct. Substantially all performance obligations for providing advisory services are satisfied over time and revenue is recognized as time passes.

Investment advisory agreements with T. Rowe Price investment products regulated outside the U.S. generally have two performance obligations; one for investment management and one for distribution. For these agreements, we allocate the management fee to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone fee of each of these services. The performance obligation for providing investment management services, like our other advisory contracts, is satisfied over time and revenue is recognized as time passes. The performance obligation for distribution is satisfied at the point in time when an investor makes an investment into the product. Accordingly, a portion of the investment advisory fees earned from these products relate to distribution performance obligations that were satisfied during prior periods. These distribution fees are reported within the investment advisory fees line of our consolidated statements of income.

The management fee for our investment advisory agreements are based on our assets under management, which change based on fluctuations in financial markets and net cash flows from investors, and represents variable consideration. Therefore, investment advisory fees are generally constrained, and excluded from revenue, until the asset values on which our client is billed are no longer subject to financial market volatility. Investment advisory fees for investment products are presented net of fees waived pursuant to the contractual expense limitations of the product. Our assets under management are valued in accordance with valuation and pricing processes for each major type of investment. Fair values used in our processes are primarily determined from quoted market prices; prices furnished by dealers who make markets in such securities; or from data provided by an independent pricing service that considers yield or price of investments of comparable quality, coupon, maturity, and type. Investments for which market prices are not readily available are not a material portion of our total assets under management.

We provide all services to the

U.S. mutual funds

under contracts that are subject to periodic review and approval by the funds’ Boards. Regulations require that the funds’ shareholders also approve material changes to investment advisory contracts.

C^<l3Q6*4v9%C:Mg

Administrative, distribution, and servicing fees

Administrative fees

The administrative services we provide include distribution, mutual fund transfer agent, accounting and shareholder services; participant recordkeeping and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans; brokerage, and trust services.

The administrative service agreements with the

U.S. mutual funds

for accounting oversight, transfer agency, and recordkeeping services generally have one performance obligation as the promised services in each agreement are not separately identifiable from other promises in the agreement and, therefore, are not distinct. The fees for performing these services are generally equal to the costs incurred and represent variable consideration. The fees are generally constrained and are recognized as revenue when costs are incurred to perform the services. These fees are generally offset by the costs incurred to provide such services.

Other administrative service agreements for participant recordkeeping and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans; brokerage services, and trust services generally have one performance obligation as the promised services in each agreement are not separately identifiable from other performance obligations in the contract and, therefore, are not distinct. Our performance obligation in each agreement is satisfied over time and revenue is recognized as time passes. The fees for these services vary by contract and are both fixed and variable.

Distribution and servicing fees

The agreements for distribution and servicing fees earned from 12b-1 plans of the Advisor Class, R Class, and Variable Annuity II Class shares of the

U.S. mutual funds

have one performance obligation, as distribution services are not separately identifiable from shareholder servicing promises in the agreements and, therefore, are not distinct. Our performance obligation is satisfied at the point in time when an investor makes an investment into these share classes of the

U.S. mutual funds

. The fees for these distribution and servicing agreements are based on the assets under management in these share classes, which change based on fluctuations in financial markets, and represent variable consideration. These fees are generally constrained, and excluded from revenue, until the asset values on which our client is billed are not subject to financial market volatility. Accordingly, the majority of the distribution and servicing revenue disclosed in Note 3 - Information about Receivables, Revenues and Services relates to distribution and servicing obligations that were satisfied during prior periods. These fees are offset entirely by the distribution and servicing costs paid to third-party financial intermediaries that source the assets of these share classes.

Advertising

Costs of advertising are expensed the first time that the advertising takes place.

Stock-based compensation

We maintain

three

stockholder-approved employee long-term incentive plans (2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan, 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, and 2001 Stock Incentive Plan, collectively the LTI Plans) and

two

stockholder-approved non-employee director plans (2017 Non-Employee Director Equity Plan and 2007 Non-Employee Director Equity Plan, collectively the Director Plans). We believe that our stock-based compensation programs align the interests of our employees and directors with those of our common stockholders. As of

December 31, 2019

, a total of

22,213,930

shares were available for future grant under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 2017 Non-Employee Director Equity Plan (2017 Plan).

Under our LTI Plans, we have issued restricted shares and restricted stock units to employees that settle in shares of our common stock after vesting. Vesting of these awards is based on the individual continuing to render service over an average

5.0

year graded schedule. All restricted stockholders and restricted stock unit holders receive non-forfeitable cash dividends and cash dividend equivalents, respectively, on our dividend payable date. We are also authorized to grant qualified incentive and nonqualified fixed stock options with a maximum term of


years. We have not granted options to employees since 2015.

We grant performance-based restricted stock units to certain executive officers in which the number of restricted stock units ultimately retained is determined based on achievement of certain performance thresholds. The number of restricted stock units retained is also subject to similar time-based vesting requirements as the other restricted


Page



C^<l3Q6*4v9%C:Mg

stock units described above. Cash dividend equivalents are accrued and paid to the holders of performance-based restricted stock units only after the performance period has lapsed and the performance thresholds have been met.

Under the Director Plans, we may grant options with a maximum term of


years, restricted shares, and restricted stock units to non-employee directors. Under the 2017 Plan, awards generally vest over

one year

and, in the case of restricted stock units, are settled upon the non-employee directors’ departure from the Board. For restricted shares, cash dividends are accrued and paid only after the award vests. Restricted stock unit holders receive dividend equivalents in the form of unvested stock units that vest over the same period as the underlying award. We have not granted options to non-employee directors since 2016.

We recognize the grant-date fair value of these awards as compensation expense ratably over the awards' requisite service period. Compensation expense recognized for performance-based restricted units includes an estimate regarding the probability of the performance thresholds being met. We account for forfeitures as they occur. Both time-based and performance-based restricted stock units are valued on the grant-date using the closing market price of our common stock.

Earnings per share

We compute our basic and diluted earnings per share under the two-class method, which considers our outstanding restricted shares and stock units, on which we pay non-forfeitable dividends as if they were a separate class of stock.

Comprehensive income

The components of comprehensive income are presented in a separate statement following our consolidated statements of income and include net income and the change in our currency translation adjustments. The currency translation adjustments result from translating our proportionate share of the financial statements of our equity method investment in UTI, and certain consolidated

T. Rowe Price investment products

into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using year-end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated using weighted-average exchange rates for the period. Prior to 2018, comprehensive income also included the change in net unrealized security holding gains (losses) on investments classified as available-for-sale.

The changes in accumulated balances of each component of other comprehensive income, the deferred tax impacts of each component, and information about significant items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income are presented in the notes to the financial statements. The notes also indicate the line item of our consolidated statements of income in which the significant reclassifications were recognized.

We reclassify income tax effects relating to currency translation adjustments to tax expense when there is a reduction in our ownership interest in the related investment. The amount of the reclassification depends on the investment’s accounting treatment before and after the change in ownership percentage. Prior to 2018, tax effects relating to each available-for-sale investment’s unrealized holding gain or loss were reclassified upon the sale of the investment.

and


, certain

T. Rowe Price investment products

in which we provided initial seed capital at the time of formation were deconsolidated, as we no longer had a controlling interest. Depending on our ownership interest, we are now reporting our residual interests in these

as either an equity method investment or an investment held at fair value. Additionally, during the years ended

that were being accounted for as equity method investments were consolidated, as we regained a controlling interest.

The net impact of these changes on our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income as of the dates the portfolios were deconsolidated or reconsolidated is detailed below.

The gains recognized upon deconsolidation were the result of reclassifying currency translation adjustments accumulated on certain

T. Rowe Price investment products

with non-USD functional currencies from accumulated other comprehensive income to non-operating income.

In 2018, we sold our

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.

We determine the fair value of our cash equivalents and certain investments using the following broad levels of inputs as defined by related accounting standards:

Level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical securities.

Level 2 – observable inputs other than Level 1 quoted prices including, but not limited to, quoted prices for similar

securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, and credit risk. These inputs are based on market data

obtained from independent sources.

Level 3 – unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions based on the best information available. We do not

value any investments using Level 3 inputs.

These levels are not necessarily an indication of the risk or liquidity associated with our investments.

The following table summarizes our investments that are recognized in our consolidated balance sheets using fair value measurements determined based on the differing levels of inputs. This table excludes investments held by

CONSOLIDATED

T. ROWE PRICE INVESTMENT PRODUCTS

.

The

T. Rowe Price investment products

that we consolidate in our consolidated financial statements are generally those products we provided initial seed capital at the time of their formation and have a controlling interest. Our

U.S. mutual funds

are considered voting interest entities, while those regulated outside the U.S. are considered variable interest entities.

The following table details the net assets of the consolidated

Although we can redeem our net interest in the

T. Rowe Price investment products

at any time, we cannot directly access or sell the assets held by these

products

to obtain cash for general operations. Additionally, the assets of these investment

products

are not available to our general creditors.

Since third-party investors in these investment

products

have no recourse to our credit, our overall risk related to the net assets of consolidated

T. Rowe Price investment products

is limited to valuation changes associated with our net interest. We, however, are required to recognize the valuation changes associated with all underlying investments held by these

products

in our consolidated statements of income and disclose the portion attributable to third-party investors as net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests.

INCOME TAXES.

The provision for income taxes consists of:

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted a comprehensive tax reform bill. The Tax Reform included numerous changes to existing tax laws, including a permanent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the income tax provision includes nonrecurring charges of

$

20.8

million

and

$

71.1

million

, respectively, related to the enactment of Tax Reform. As of December 31, 2018, we have completed our accounting for the income tax effects of Tax Reform.

On April 24, 2018, the state of Maryland enacted new state tax legislation. This new state tax legislation, effective in 2018, adopted a five-year phase-in of the single sales factor method of apportionment for calculating income tax for multi-state companies doing business in Maryland and is expected to result in a net benefit over time. We recognized a nonrecurring charge of

$

7.9

million

during 2018 for the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the effect of this Maryland state tax legislation.

The net deferred tax assets recognized in our consolidated balance sheets in other assets as of December 31 relate to the following:

$


million

at

December 31, 2019

.  These earnings as well as our pro rata share of the earnings of foreign corporations in which T. Rowe Price owns

10%

or more were subject to the repatriation tax enacted with the U.S. tax reform and are treated as PTEP. As such, we did not record a deferred tax liability with respect to the U.S. federal or foreign withholding taxes as the PTEP should not be taxed in these jurisdictions. We did recognize a state deferred tax liability of

$

0.7

million

for the intended repatriation as states have varying rules on taxation of these amounts.

Other assets include tax refund receivables of

EARNINGS PER SHARE CALCULATIONS.

The following table presents the reconciliation of net income attributable to T. Rowe Price Group to net income allocated to our common stockholders and the weighted-average shares that are used in calculating the basic and diluted earnings per share on our common stock. Weighted-average common shares outstanding assuming dilution reflect the potential dilution, determined using the treasury stock method, that could occur if outstanding stock options were exercised and non-participating stock awards vested.

The following table shows the weighted-average outstanding stock options that are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share as the inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive.

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

The following table presents the impact of the components of other comprehensive income or loss on deferred tax benefits (income taxes).

(1)

On January 1, 2018, we implemented new accounting guidance that eliminated the available-for-sale investment category for equity securities and required unrealized holding gains on equity securities to be recognized in the consolidated income statement. Prior to this guidance, unrealized holding gains for available-for-sale equity securities were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to the consolidated income statement upon sale of the investment. As a result of this change, reclassification of unrealized holding gains from accumulated other comprehensive income did not occur in 2019 or 2018.


Page



C^<l3Q6*4v9%C:Mg

The changes in each component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), including reclassification are presented below.

(1)

On January 1, 2018, we implemented new accounting guidance that eliminated the available-for-sale investment category for equity securities and required unrealized holding gains on most equity securities to be recognized in the consolidated income statement. Prior to this guidance, unrealized holding gains for available-for-sale equity securities were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. Upon adoption, we reclassified the accumulated net of tax unrealized holding gain related to our available-for-sale investment portfolio from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings.

(2)

Includes the reclassification of

$

1.7

million

of stranded income taxes on available-for-sale investments resulting from U.S. tax law changes enacted on December 22, 2017, from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings.

DELL APPRAISAL RIGHTS MATTER.

In 2016, we paid

$

million

to compensate certain

U.S. mutual funds

, trusts, subadvised clients, and separately managed accounts (collectively, "Clients") for the denial of their appraisal rights by the Delaware Chancery Court ("Court") in connection with the 2013 leveraged buyout of Dell, Inc. ("Dell"). Later in 2016 and 2017, we entered into settlement agreements totaling

$

150.0

million

with our insurance carrier. These insurance proceeds were recognized in operating expenses as an offset to the charge we recognized for compensation paid to Clients in operating expenses.

In 2018, all parties settled with Dell, and the Court approved final adjustments to the compensation paid to Clients in final non-appealable judgments. As a result, we obtained repayments from Clients, of which we retained the first

$

15.2

million

and paid the remaining amount received back to our insurers. We recognized

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES.

On February 14, 2017, T. Rowe Price Group, Inc., T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc., T. Rowe Price Trust Company, current and former members of the management committee, and trustees of the T. Rowe Price U.S. Retirement Program were named as defendants in a lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. The lawsuit alleges breaches of ERISA’s fiduciary duty and prohibited transaction provisions on behalf of a class of all participants and beneficiaries of the T. Rowe Price 401(k) Plan from February 14, 2011, to the time of judgment. The matter has been certified as a class action. T. Rowe Price believes the claims are without merit and is vigorously defending the action. This matter is in the discovery phase of litigation and we cannot predict the eventual outcome, or whether it will have a material negative impact on our financial results, or estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may arise from any negative outcome.

On April 27, 2016, certain shareholders in the T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund, T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation Fund, T. Rowe Price Equity Income Fund, T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund, T. Rowe Price International Stock Fund, T. Rowe Price High Yield Fund, T. Rowe Price New Income Fund and T. Rowe Price Small Cap Stock Fund (the “Funds”) filed a Section 36(b) complaint under the caption Zoidis v. T. Rowe Price Assoc., Inc., against T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. (“T. Rowe Price”) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaint alleges that the management fees for the identified funds are excessive because

T. Rowe Price charges lower advisory fees to subadvised clients with funds in the same strategy. The complaint seeks to recover the allegedly excessive advisory fees received by T. Rowe Price in the year preceding the start of the lawsuit, along with investments’ returns and profits. In the alternative, the complaint seeks the rescission of each fund’s investment management agreement and restitution of any allegedly excessive management fees. T. Rowe Price believes the claims are without merit and is vigorously defending the action. This matter is in the discovery phase of litigation and we cannot predict the eventual outcome, or whether it will have a material negative impact on our financial results, or estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may arise from any negative outcome.

In addition to the matters discussed above, various claims against us arise in the ordinary course of business, including employment-related claims. In the opinion of management, after consultation with counsel, the likelihood of an adverse determination in one or more of these pending ordinary course of business claims that would have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations is remote.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors

T. Rowe Price Group, Inc.:

Opinion on the Consolidated

Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of

December 31, 2019

and


, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended

December 31, 2019

, and the related notes (collectively, “the consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of

December 31, 2019

and


, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended

December 31, 2019

, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated

February 13, 2020

, expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated

financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that:

(1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated

financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgment. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated

financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Evaluation of the assets under management data used in the calculation of investment advisory fees revenue

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes fees for its investment advisory agreements based on a percentage of its assets under management (AUM). AUM represents a significant input to the calculation of investment advisory fees. The Company recognized

$3.5 billion

in investment advisory fees related to T. Rowe Price U.S. mutual funds (Funds) during the year ended December 31, 2019. Specifically as it pertains to the Funds, AUM is transmitted through multiple information technology (IT) systems used in the calculation of investment advisory fee revenue.


Page



C^<l3Q6*4v9%C:Mg

We identified the evaluation of AUM for the Funds transmitted through multiple IT systems as a critical audit matter given the importance of maintaining the AUM data to be input into the calculation of investment advisory fee revenues. There is a high degree of effort involved in performing procedures to address the Company’s use of multiple IT systems to maintain the AUM data. Such procedures require specialized skills to test the AUM data as it is processed through multiple IT systems.

The primary procedures we performed to address the critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company’s revenue processes, including manual controls that reconcile AUM between IT systems. We involved IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in the testing of general IT controls and the interface of data between multiple IT systems used to maintain AUM. To assess the AUM, we compared AUM used in the calculation of investment advisory fees to the source IT systems and to audited financial statements, for a selection of Funds.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the Stockholders of T. Rowe Price Group, Inc.:

We, together with other members of management of T. Rowe Price Group, Inc., (the "Company")are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over the Company’s financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is the process designed under our supervision, and effected by the Company’s Board of Directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility that misstatements may not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, even effective internal controls over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Furthermore, the effectiveness of internal controls can change with circumstances.

Management has evaluated the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

, in relation to criteria described in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on management’s assessment, we believe that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2019

.

KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited our financial statements that are included in this annual report and expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. KPMG has also expressed an unqualified opinion on the effective operation of our internal control over financial reporting as of

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors

T. Rowe Price Group, Inc.:

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. and subsidiaries’ (the "Company") internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of

December 31, 2019

and


, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended

December 31, 2019

, and the related notes (collectively, "the consolidated financial statements"), and our report dated

February 13, 2020

expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
