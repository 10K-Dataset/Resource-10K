B. UTILITY ENERGY OPERATIONS

Wisconsin Segment

The Wisconsin segment includes the electric and natural gas utility operations of WE, WPS, WG, and UMERC.

Electric Utility Operations

For the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our electric utility operations included operations of WE, WPS and UMERC.

•

WE generates and distributes electric energy to customers located in southeastern Wisconsin (including the metropolitan Milwaukee area), east central Wisconsin, and northern Wisconsin. WE also served an iron ore mine customer, Tilden, in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, through March 31, 2019 when Tilden became a customer of UMERC.

•

WPS generates and distributes electric energy to customers located in northeastern and central Wisconsin.

•

UMERC generates and distributes electric energy to customers located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. UMERC began generating electricity when its new natural gas-fired generation achieved commercial operation on March 31, 2019.

Operating Revenues

The following table shows electric utility operating revenues, including steam operations, for our Wisconsin segment disaggregated by customer class for the year ended December 31, 2017. For information about our operating revenues disaggregated by customer class for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, see

Note 4, Operating Revenues

.

(1)

Includes distribution sales for customers who have purchased power from an alternative electric supplier in Michigan.

(2)

Includes SSR revenues, amounts collected from (refunded to) customers for certain fuel and purchased power costs that exceed a 2% price variance from costs included in rates, and other revenues, partially offset by revenues from Tilden that were addressed in WE's December 2019 Wisconsin rate order.

Electric Sales

Our electric energy deliveries included supply and distribution sales to retail, wholesale, and resale customers, and distribution sales to those customers who switched to an alternative electric supplier in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. In


, retail revenues accounted for 90.4% of total electric operating revenues, wholesale revenues accounted for 4.4% of total electric operating revenues, and resale revenues accounted for 3.8% of total electric operating revenues. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations – Wisconsin Segment Contribution to Operating Income for information on MWh sales by customer class.

Our electric utilities are authorized to provide retail electric service in designated territories in the state of Wisconsin, as established by indeterminate permits and boundary agreements with other utilities, and in certain territories in the state of Michigan pursuant to franchises granted by municipalities.

Our electric utilities buy and sell wholesale electric power by participating in the MISO Energy Markets. The cost of our individual generation offered into the MISO Energy Markets compared to our competitors affects how often our generating units are dispatched and whether we buy or sell power, based on our customers' needs. We provide wholesale electric service to various customers, including electric cooperatives, municipal joint action agencies, other investor-owned utilities, municipal utilities, and energy marketers. For more information, see E. Regulation.

The majority of our sales for resale are sold into an energy market operated by MISO at market rates based on availability of our generation and market demand. Retail fuel costs are reduced by the amount that revenue exceeds the costs of sales derived from these opportunity sales.

Steam Sales

WE has a steam utility that generates, distributes, and sells steam supplied by the VAPP to customers in metropolitan Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Steam is used by customers for processing, space heating, domestic hot water, and humidification. Annual sales of steam fluctuate from year to year based on system growth and variations in weather conditions.

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


Electric Sales Forecast

Our service territory experienced a decline in weather-normalized retail electric sales in 2019 due primarily to reduced industrial sales. We currently forecast retail electric sales volumes, excluding the Tilden mine located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, to grow between 1% and 1.5% over the next five years, assuming normal weather. Electric peak demand is expected to grow between flat and 0.5% over the next five years.

Customers

Electric Commercial and Industrial Retail Customers

We provide electric utility service to a diversified base of customers in industries such as metals and other manufacturing, paper, governmental, food products, health services, education, and retail.

Electric Generation and Supply Mix

Our electric supply strategy is to provide our customers with energy from plants using a diverse fuel mix that is expected to balance a stable, reliable, and affordable supply of electricity with environmental stewardship. Through our participation in the MISO Energy Markets, we supply a significant amount of electricity to our customers from power plants that we own. We supplement our internally generated power supply with long-term power purchase agreements, including the Point Beach power purchase agreement discussed under the heading "Power Purchase Commitments," and through spot purchases in the MISO Energy Markets. We also sell excess power supply into the MISO Energy Markets when it is economical, which reduces net fuel costs by offsetting costs of purchased power. All options, including owned generation resources and purchased power opportunities, are continually evaluated on a real-time basis to select and dispatch the lowest-cost resources available to meet system load requirements.

The table below indicates our sources of electric energy supply as a percentage of sales for the three years ended December 31, as well as estimates for


:

(1)

The values included in the estimate assume a natural gas price based on the February 2020 NYMEX.

(2)

Includes hydroelectric, biomass, and wind generation.

Electric Generation Facilities

Our generation portfolio is a mix of energy resources having different operating characteristics and fuel sources designed to balance providing energy that is stable, reliable, and affordable with environmental stewardship. We own approximately

7,118

MW of generation capacity, including owned and jointly owned facilities. Our facilities include coal-fired plants, natural gas-fired plants, and renewable generation. Certain of our natural gas fired generation units have the ability to burn oil if natural gas is not available due to delivery constraints. For more information about our facilities, see Item 2. Properties.

On March 31, 2019, we added to our electric generation portfolio when UMERC's new natural gas-fired generation with a 187 MW rated capacity in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan achieved commercial operation.

See Note 25, Regulatory Environment, for more information

.

Reshaping our Generation Fleet

The planned reshaping of our generation fleet balances reliability and customer cost with environmental stewardship. Taken as a whole, this plan should reduce costs to customers, preserve fuel diversity, and lower carbon emissions. Generation reshaping includes retiring older fossil fuel generation units, building state-of-the-art natural gas generation, and investing in cost-effective zero-carbon generation. In 2019, we met and exceeded our 2030 goal of reducing CO


emissions by 40% below 2005 levels and are re-evaluating our longer-term CO


reduction goals. We have already retired more than

1,800

MW of coal-fired generation since the beginning of 2018, and expect to continue adding natural gas-fired generating units and renewable generation, including utility-scale solar projects. The generation reshaping plan included the 2018 retirements of the Pleasant Prairie power plant, the Pulliam power plant, and the jointly-owned Edgewater Unit 4 generating units as well as the March 2019 retirement of the Presque Isle power plant. For more information related to these power plant retirements, see

Note 6, Property, Plant, and Equipment

.

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


Renewable Generation

Our electric utilities meet a portion of their electric generation supply with various renewable energy resources, including wind, hydroelectric, biomass, and in the future, solar projects. This helps our electric utilities maintain compliance with renewable energy legislation. These renewable energy resources also help us maintain diversity in our generation portfolio, which effectively serves as a price hedge against future fuel costs, and will help mitigate the risk of potential unknown costs associated with any future carbon restrictions for electric generators.

I

n December 2018, WE received approval from the PSCW for the Dedicated Renewable Energy Resource pilot program, a program for customers who wish to access a large-scale renewable project located in Wisconsin that WE would operate. The project will contribute toward meeting WE's peak demand, adding up to 150 MW of renewables to WE's portfolio.

Solar

I

n December 2018, WE received approval from the PSCW for the Solar Now pilot program, which is expected to add 35 MW of solar generation to WE's portfolio and will allow non-profit and government entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers to site solar arrays on their property.

Under this program, in 2019, WE constructed 5 MW of solar generation and expects to construct more than double that amount in 2020.

As part of our commitment to invest in zero-carbon generation, we have either filed for or received approval to invest in 300 MW of utility-scale solar within our Wisconsin segment.

•

In April 2019, WPS, along with an unaffiliated utility, received approval from the PSCW to acquire ownership interests in two utility-scale solar projects in Wisconsin. Badger Hollow I is located in Iowa County, Wisconsin, and Two Creeks is located in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin. Once constructed, WPS will own 100 MW of the output of each project for a total of 200 MW. Construction began at Two Creeks and Badger Hollow I in August 2019 and October 2019, respectively. Commercial operation of both projects is targeted for the end of 2020.

•

In August 2019, WE, along with an unaffiliated utility, filed an application with the PSCW for approval to acquire an ownership interest in a proposed solar project, Badger Hollow II, that will be located in Iowa County, Wisconsin. At its meeting on February 20, 2020, the PSCW approved the acquisition of this project. The approval is still subject to WE's receipt and review of a final written order from the PSCW. Once constructed, WE will own 100 MW of the output of this project. Commercial operation of Badger Hollow II is targeted for the end of 2021.

Electric System Reliability

The PSCW requires us to maintain a planning reserve margin above our projected annual peak demand forecast to help ensure reliability of electric service to our customers. These planning reserve requirements are consistent with the MISO calculated planning reserve margin. In 2008, the PSCW established a 14.5% reserve margin requirement for long-term planning (planning years two through ten). For short-term planning (planning year one), the PSCW requires Wisconsin utilities to follow the planning reserve margin established by MISO. MISO has a 16.8% installed capacity reserve margin requirement for the planning year from June 1,


, through May 31,


, and an 18.0% installed capacity reserve margin requirement for the planning year from June 1,


, through May 31,


. MISO's short-term reserve margin requirements experience year-to-year fluctuations, primarily due to changes in the generation resource mix and average forced outage rate of generation within the MISO footprint.

Michigan legislation requires all electric providers to demonstrate to the MPSC that they have enough resources to serve the anticipated needs of their customers for a minimum of four consecutive planning years beginning in the upcoming planning year June 1,


, through May 31,


. The MPSC has established future planning reserve margin requirements based on the same study conducted by MISO that determines the short-term reserve margin requirements.

In both of our Wisconsin and Michigan jurisdictions, we have adequate capacity through company-owned generation units and power purchase contracts to meet the MISO calculated planning reserve margin during the current planning year. We also fully anticipate that we will have adequate capacity to meet the planning reserve margin requirements for the upcoming planning year in both jurisdictions.

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


Fuel and Purchased Power Costs

Our retail electric rates in Wisconsin are established by the PSCW and include base amounts for fuel and purchased power costs. The electric fuel rules set by the PSCW allow us to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, under- or over-collections of actual fuel and purchased power costs that exceed a 2% price variance from the costs included in the rates charged to customers. Prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs are recovered dollar-for-dollar from our Michigan retail electric customers. For more information about the fuel rules, see E. Regulation.

Our average fuel and purchased power costs per MWh by fuel type were as follows for the years ended December 31:

WE and WPS purchase coal under long-term contracts, which helps with price stability. In the past, coal and associated transportation services were exposed to volatility in pricing due to changing domestic and world-wide demand for coal and diesel fuel. WE and WPS have PSCW approval for a hedging program to moderate this volatility exposure. This program allows them to hedge, over a 36-month period, up to 75% of their potential risks related to rail transportation fuel surcharge exposure. The results of this hedging program, when used, are reflected in the average costs of purchased power.

We purchase natural gas for our plants on the spot market from natural gas marketers, utilities, and producers, and we arrange for transportation of the natural gas to our plants. We have firm and interruptible transportation, as well as balancing and storage agreements, intended to support our plants' variable usage. WE and WPS also have PSCW approval for a hedging program to moderate volatility related to natural gas price risk. This program allows them to hedge, over a 36-month period, up to 75% of their estimated natural gas use for electric generation. The results of this hedging program are reflected in the average costs of natural gas.

Coal Supply

We diversify the coal supply for our electric generating facilities and jointly-owned plants by purchasing coal from several mines in Wyoming and Pennsylvania, as well as from various other states. For


, all of our total projected coal requirements of 10.1 million tons are contracted under fixed-price contracts.

See Note 23, Commitments and Contingencies, for more information

on amounts of coal purchases and coal deliveries under contract.

The annual tonnage amounts contracted for the next three years are as follows. We have not entered into any coal contracts for years after 2022.

Coal Deliveries

All of our


coal requirements are expected to be shipped by our owned or leased unit trains under existing transportation agreements. The unit trains transport the coal for electric generating facilities from mines in Wyoming and Pennsylvania. Additional small volume agreements may also be used to supplement the normal coal supply for our facilities.

Power Purchase Commitments

We enter into short and long-term power purchase commitments to meet a portion of our anticipated electric energy supply needs. Our power purchase commitments with unaffiliated parties are

1,387

MW for 2020,

1,379

MW for 2021, and

1,133

MW per year for 2022 through 2024, which exclude planning capacity purchases. These amounts include 1,033 MW per year related to a long-term power purchase agreement for electricity generated by Point Beach. As part of our generation reshaping plan, we recently retired

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


some of our older, less efficient coal-fired generation. To procure additional planning capacity, we purchased capacity from the MISO annual auction to ensure that we maintain our compliance with planning reserve requirements as established by the PSCW, MPSC, and MISO.

Natural Gas Utility Operations

WE, WG, and WPS are authorized to provide retail natural gas distribution service in designated territories in the state of Wisconsin, as established by indeterminate permits and boundary agreements with other utilities. Our Wisconsin natural gas utilities operate throughout the state of Wisconsin, including the City of Milwaukee and surrounding areas, northeastern Wisconsin, and in large areas of both central and western Wisconsin. In addition, UMERC is authorized to provide retail natural gas distribution service in designated territories in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

Our Wisconsin segment natural gas utilities provide service to residential, commercial and industrial, and transportation customers. Major industries served include governmental, food products, paper, education, and metals manufacturing. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations – Wisconsin Segment Contribution to Operating Income for information on natural gas sales volumes by customer class in Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

Includes amounts refunded to customers for purchased gas adjustment costs.

Natural Gas Sales Forecast

Our combined Wisconsin service territories experienced growth in weather-normalized retail natural gas deliveries (excluding natural gas deliveries for electric generation) in


due to customer growth. We currently forecast retail natural gas delivery volumes to grow at a rate between 0.5% and 1.0% over the next five years, assuming normal weather.

Customers

Natural Gas Supply, Pipeline Capacity and Storage

We have been able to meet our contractual obligations with both our suppliers and our customers. For more information on our natural gas utility supply and transportation contracts, see

Note 23, Commitments and Contingencies

.

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


Pipeline Capacity and Storage

The interstate pipelines serving Wisconsin originate in major natural gas producing areas of North America: the Oklahoma and Texas basins, western Canada, and the Rocky Mountains. We have contracted for long-term firm capacity from a number of these sources. This strategy reflects management's belief that overall supply security is enhanced by geographic diversification of the supply portfolio.

Due to variations in natural gas usage in Wisconsin, we have also contracted for substantial underground storage capacity, primarily in Michigan. We target storage inventory levels at approximately 40% of forecasted demand for November through March. Diversity of natural gas supply enables us to manage significant changes in demand and to optimize our overall natural gas supply and capacity costs. We generally inject natural gas into storage during the spring and summer months and withdraw it in the winter months.

In June 2017, we completed the acquisition of Bluewater. Bluewater owns natural gas storage facilities in Michigan that provide approximately one-third of the current storage needs for our Wisconsin natural gas utilities.

See Note 2, Acquisitions, for more information

on this transaction.

We hold daily transportation and storage capacity entitlements with interstate pipeline companies as well as other service providers under varied-length long-term contracts.

Natural gas pipeline capacity and storage and natural gas supplies under contract can be resold in secondary markets. Peak or near-peak demand generally occurs only a few times each year. The secondary markets facilitate utilization of capacity and supply during times when the contracted capacity and supply are in excess of utility demand. The proceeds from these transactions are passed through to customers, subject to our approved GCRMs. For information on the GCRMs, see

Note 1(d), Operating Revenues

.

To ensure a reliable supply of natural gas during peak winter conditions, we have LNG and propane facilities located within our distribution system. These facilities are typically utilized during extreme demand conditions to ensure reliable supply to our customers. In addition to their existing facilities, WE and WG each plan to construct an additional LNG facility. Subject to PSCW approval, each facility would provide approximately one billion cubic feet of natural gas supply to meet anticipated peak demand without requiring the construction of additional interstate pipeline capacity. Commercial operation of the LNG facilities is targeted for the end of 2023.

Combined with our storage capability, management believes that the volume of natural gas under contract is sufficient to meet our forecasted firm peak-day and seasonal demand. Our Wisconsin segment natural gas utilities' forecasted design peak-day throughput is 34.1 million therms for the


through


heating season. Our Wisconsin segment natural gas utilities' peak daily send-out during


was 26.4 million therms on January 30,


.

Natural Gas Supply

We have contracts with suppliers for natural gas acquired in the Chicago, Illinois market hub and in the producing areas discussed above. The pricing of the term contracts is based upon first of the month indices.

We expect to continue to make natural gas purchases in the spot market as price and other circumstances dictate. We have supply relationships with a number of sellers from whom we purchase natural gas in the spot market.

Hedging Natural Gas Supply Prices

WE, WPS, and WG have PSCW approval to hedge up to 60% of planned winter demand and up to 15% of planned summer demand using a mix of NYMEX-based natural gas options and futures contracts. These approvals allow these companies to pass 100% of the hedging costs (premiums, brokerage fees, and losses) and proceeds (gains) to customers through their respective GCRMs.

To the extent that opportunities develop and physical supply operating plans are supportive, WE, WPS, and WG also have PSCW approval to utilize NYMEX-based natural gas derivatives to capture favorable forward-market price differentials. These approvals provide for 100% of the related proceeds to accrue to these companies' respective GCRMs.

Natural Gas Supply, Pipeline Capacity, and Storage

We manage portfolios of natural gas supply contracts, storage services, and pipeline transportation services designed to meet varying customer use patterns with safe, reliable natural gas supplies at the best value. For more information on our natural gas utility supply and transportation contracts, see

Note 23, Commitments and Contingencies

.

Pipeline Capacity and Storage

We contract with local distribution companies and interstate pipelines to purchase firm transportation services. We believe that having multiple pipelines that serve our natural gas service territory benefits our customers by improving reliability, providing access to a diverse supply of natural gas, and fostering competition among these service providers. These benefits can lead to favorable conditions for our Illinois utilities when negotiating new agreements for transportation and storage services.

We own a 38.8 Bcf storage field (Manlove Field in central Illinois) and contract with various other underground storage service providers for additional storage services. Storage allows us to manage significant changes in daily natural gas demand and to purchase steady levels of natural gas on a year-round basis, which provides a hedge against supply cost volatility. We also own a natural gas pipeline system that connects Manlove Field to Chicago and nine major interstate pipelines. These assets are directed primarily to serving rate-regulated retail customers and are included in our regulatory rate base. We also use a portion of these company-owned storage and pipeline assets as a natural gas hub, which consists of providing transportation and storage services in interstate commerce to our wholesale customers. Customers deliver natural gas to us for storage through an injection into the storage reservoir, and we return the natural gas to the customers under an agreed schedule through a withdrawal from the storage

WEC Energy Group, Inc.


reservoir. Title to the natural gas does not transfer to us. We recognize service fees associated with the natural gas hub services provided to wholesale customers. These service fees reduce the cost of natural gas and services charged to retail customers in rates.

Natural gas pipeline capacity and storage and natural gas supplies under contract can be resold in secondary markets. Peak or near-peak demand generally occurs only a few times each year. The secondary markets facilitate utilization of capacity and supply during times when the contracted capacity and supply are in excess of utility demand. The proceeds from these transactions are passed through to customers, subject to our approved GCRMs. For information on the GCRMs, see

Note 1(d), Operating Revenues

.

Combined with our storage capability, management believes that the volume of natural gas under contract is sufficient to meet our forecasted firm peak-day and seasonal demand. Our Illinois utilities' forecasted design peak-day throughput is 26.2 million therms for the


through


heating season. Our Illinois utilities' peak daily send-out during


was 22.6 million therms on January 30,


.

Natural Gas Supply

Our natural gas supply requirements are met through a combination of fixed-price purchases, index-priced purchases, contracted and owned storage, peak-shaving facilities, and natural gas supply call options. We contract for fixed-term firm natural gas supply each year to meet the demand of firm system sales customers. To supplement natural gas supply and manage risk, we purchase additional natural gas supply on the monthly and daily spot markets.

Hedging Natural Gas Supply Prices

Our Illinois utilities further reduce their supply cost volatility through the use of financial instruments, such as commodity futures, swaps, and options as part of their hedging programs. Their hedging programs are reviewed by the ICC as part of the annual purchased gas adjustment reconciliation. They hedge between 25% and 50% of natural gas purchases, with a target of 37.5%.

Natural Gas System Modernization Program

PGL is continuing work on the SMP, a project to replace approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago's aging natural gas pipeline infrastructure that began in 2011. PGL currently recovers these costs through a surcharge on customer bills pursuant to an ICC approved QIP rider, which is in effect through 2023. For information on regulatory proceedings related to the SMP, see

Note 25, Regulatory Environment

.

Other States Segment

Our other states segment includes the natural gas utility operations of MERC and MGU. MERC serves customers in various cities and communities throughout Minnesota, and MGU serves customers in southern and western Michigan. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations – Other States Segment Contribution to Operating Income for information on natural gas sales volumes by customer class for this segment.

MERC has MPUC approval to hedge up to 30% of planned winter demand using NYMEX financial instruments. MGU has MPSC approval to hedge up to 20% of its planned annual purchases using NYMEX financial instruments.

General

Seasonality

Electric Utility Operations – Wisconsin Segment

Our electric utility sales are impacted by seasonal factors and varying weather conditions. We sell more electricity during the summer months because of the residential cooling load. We continue to upgrade our electric distribution system, including substations, transformers, and lines, to meet the demand of our customers. Our generating plants performed as expected during the

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


warmest periods of the summer, and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, our electric utilities did not require public appeals for conservation. However, during the polar vortex in the first quarter of 2019 we curtailed electric service to certain non-firm customers at MISO's request, in response to wide-spread regional power supply issues in MISO. These non-firm customers receive a rate credit in return for agreeing to occasional service interruptions. WPS also had service curtailments for economic interruptions during this period. Economic interruptions are declared during times in which the price of electricity in the regional market exceeds the cost of operating the company's peaking generation. During this time, interruptible customers can choose to continue using electricity at a price based on wholesale market prices.

Natural Gas Utility Operations – Wisconsin, Illinois, and Other States Segments

Since the majority of our customers use natural gas for heating, customer use is sensitive to weather and is generally higher during the winter months. Accordingly, we are subject to some variations in earnings and working capital throughout the year as a result of changes in weather. The effect on earnings from these changes in weather are reduced by decoupling mechanisms included in the rates of PGL, NSG, and MERC. These mechanisms differ by state and allow the utilities to recover or refund the differences between actual and authorized margins for certain customer classes.

Our natural gas utilities' working capital needs are met by cash generated from operations and debt (both long-term and short-term). The seasonality of natural gas revenues causes the timing of cash collections to be concentrated from January through June. A portion of the winter natural gas supply needs is typically purchased and stored from April through November. Also, planned capital spending on our natural gas distribution facilities is concentrated in April through November. Because of these timing differences, the cash flow from customers is typically supplemented with temporary increases in short-term borrowings (from external sources) during the late summer and fall. Short-term debt is typically reduced over the January through June period.

Competition

Electric Utility Operations – Wisconsin Segment

Our electric utilities face competition from various entities and other forms of energy sources available to customers, including self-generation by customers and alternative energy sources. Our electric utilities compete with other utilities for sales to municipalities and cooperatives as well as with other utilities and marketers for wholesale electric business.

Natural Gas Utility Operations – Wisconsin, Illinois, and Other States Segments

Our natural gas utilities also face varying degrees of competition from other entities and other forms of energy available to consumers. Many large commercial and industrial customers have the ability to switch between natural gas and alternative fuels. In addition, the majority of our natural gas customers have the opportunity to choose a natural gas supplier other than us. Our natural gas utilities offer transportation services for customers that elect to purchase natural gas directly from a third-party supplier. We continue to earn distribution revenues from these transportation customers for their use of our distribution systems to transport natural gas to their facilities. As such, the loss of revenue associated with the cost of natural gas that our transportation customers purchase from third-party suppliers has little impact on our net income, as it is offset by an equal reduction to natural gas costs.

For more information on competition in each of our service territories, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity, and Capital Resources – Competitive Markets.

C. ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION SEGMENT

ATC is a regional transmission company that owns, maintains, monitors, and operates electric transmission systems in Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, and Minnesota. ATC is expected to provide comparable service to all customers, including WE, WPS, and UMERC, and to support effective competition in energy markets without favoring any market participant. ATC is regulated by the FERC for all rate terms and conditions of service and is a transmission-owning member of MISO. MISO maintains operational control of ATC's transmission system, and WE, WPS, and UMERC are non-transmission owning members and customers of MISO. As of

December 31, 2019

, our ownership interest in ATC was approximately 60%. In addition, we owned approximately 75% of ATC Holdco, a separate entity formed in December 2016 to invest in transmission-related projects outside of ATC's traditional footprint.

See Note 20, Investment in Transmission Affiliates, for more information

.

In November 2019, the FERC issued an order related to the methodology used to calculate the base ROE for all MISO transmission owners, including ATC. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity, and Capital Resources – Other Matters – American Transmission Company Allowed Return on Equity Complaints, for more information.

D. NON-UTILITY OPERATIONS

Non-Utility Energy Infrastructure Segment

The non-utility energy infrastructure segment includes We Power, which owns and leases generating facilities to WE; Bluewater, which owns underground natural gas storage facilities in Michigan; and WECI, which holds our ownership interests in the Bishop Hill III, Upstream, and Coyote Ridge wind generating facilities. See Item 2. Properties, for more information on our non-utility energy infrastructure facilities.

W.E. Power, LLC

We Power, through wholly owned subsidiaries, designed and built approximately 2,500 MW of generation in Wisconsin. This generation is made up of capacity from the ERGS units, ER 1 and ER 2, which were placed in service in February 2010 and January 2011, respectively, and the PWGS units, PWGS 1 and PWGS 2, which were placed in service in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively. Two unaffiliated entities collectively own approximately 17%, or approximately 211 MW, of ER 1 and ER 2. We Power's share of the ERGS units and both PWGS units are being leased to WE under long-term leases (the ERGS units have 30-year leases and the PWGS units have 25-year leases), and are positioned to provide a significant portion of our future generation needs.

Because of the significant investment necessary to construct these generating units, we constructed the plants under Wisconsin's Leased Generation Law, which allows a non-utility affiliate to construct an electric generating facility and lease it to the public utility. The law allows a public utility that has entered into a lease approved by the PSCW to recover fully in its retail electric rates that portion of any payments under the lease that the PSCW has allocated to the public utility's Wisconsin retail electric service, and all other costs that are prudently incurred in the public utility's operation and maintenance of the electric generating facility allocated to the utility's Wisconsin retail electric service. In addition, the PSCW may not modify or terminate a lease it has approved under the Leased Generation Law except as specifically provided in the lease or the PSCW's order approving the lease. This law effectively created regulatory certainty in light of the significant investment being made to construct the units. All four units were constructed under leases approved by the PSCW.

We are recovering our costs of these units, including subsequent capital additions, through lease payments that are billed from We Power to WE and then recovered in WE's rates as authorized by the PSCW and the FERC. Under the lease terms, our return is calculated using a 12.7% ROE and the equity ratio is assumed to be 55% for the ERGS units and 53% for the PWGS units.

Bluewater Natural Gas Holding, LLC

Bluewater, located in Michigan, provides natural gas storage and hub services for our Wisconsin natural gas utilities. WE, WPS, and WG have entered into long-term service agreements for natural gas storage with a wholly owned subsidiary of Bluewater.

WEC Infrastructure LLC

At December 31, 2019, our non-utility energy infrastructure segment included WECI's ownership interests in the three wind generating facilities reflected in the table below.

(1)

In February 2020, WECI signed an agreement to acquire an additional 10% ownership interest in Upstream.

(2)

Coyote Ridge achieved commercial operation on December 20, 2019.

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


Bishop Hill III and Coyote Ridge have long-term offtake agreements with unaffiliated third parties for the sale of all the energy they produce. In addition, Upstream's revenue is substantially fixed over a 10-year period through an agreement with an unaffiliated third party. Under the Tax Legislation, all of these investments qualify for production tax credits and 100% bonus depreciation. WECI is entitled to the tax benefits of each facility in proportion to its ownership interest, with the exception of Coyote Ridge. WECI is entitled to 99% of the tax benefits of Coyote Ridge for the first 11 years of commercial operation, after which WECI will be entitled to tax benefits equal to its ownership interest. WECI recognizes production tax credits as power is generated over 10 years.

In August 2019, WECI signed an agreement to acquire an 80% ownership interest in Thunderhead, a 300 MW wind generating facility under construction in Nebraska. In addition, in January 2020, WECI signed an agreement to acquire an 80% ownership interest in Blooming Grove, a 250 MW wind generating facility under construction in Illinois. In February 2020, WECI amended these agreements to acquire an additional 10% ownership interest in both Thunderhead and Blooming Grove. Under the Tax Legislation, WECI's investments in Thunderhead and Blooming Grove are expected to qualify for production tax credits and 100% bonus depreciation.

See

Note 2, Acquisitions

, for more information on these wind generating facilities.

Corporate and Other Segment

The corporate and other segment includes the operations of the WEC Energy Group holding company, the Integrys holding company, and the PELLC holding company, as well as the operations of Wispark, Bostco (prior to the sale of substantially all of its remaining assets in the first quarter of 2017 and its dissolution in October 2018), WBS, and PDL.

See Note 3, Dispositions, for more information

on the sale of Bostco's assets and certain assets of PDL. This segment also includes Wisvest and WECC, which no longer have significant operations.

Wispark develops and invests in real estate, primarily in southeastern Wisconsin. Wispark had $32.9 million in real estate holdings at

December 31, 2019

.

WBS is a wholly owned centralized service company that provides administrative and general support services to our regulated entities. WBS also provides certain administrative and support services to our nonregulated entities.

PDL owns distributed renewable solar projects. As part of our asset management strategy, in 2019, PDL sold its remaining four distributed commercial and industrial solar projects.

See Note 3, Dispositions, for more information

on these sales. These facilities were not considered core to our operations. PDL still owns a portfolio of residential solar systems.

E. REGULATION

We are a holding company and are subject to the requirements of the PUHCA 2005. We also have various subsidiaries that meet the definition of a holding company under the PUHCA 2005 and are also subject to its requirements.

Pursuant to the non-utility asset cap provisions of Wisconsin's public utility holding company law, the sum of certain assets of all non-utility affiliates in a holding company system generally may not exceed 25% of the assets of all public utility affiliates. However, among other items, the law exempts energy-related assets, including the generating plants constructed by We Power and the other assets in our non-utility energy infrastructure segment, from being counted against the asset cap provided that they are employed in qualifying businesses. We report to the PSCW annually on our compliance with this law and provide supporting documentation to show that our non-utility assets are below the non-utility asset cap.

Regulated Utility Operations

In addition to the specific regulations noted above and below, our utilities are subject to various other regulations, which primarily consist of regulations, where applicable, of the EPA; the WDNR; the IDNR; the IEPA; the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (previously Michigan Department of Environmental Quality); the Michigan Department of Natural Resources; the United States Army Corps of Engineers; the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources; and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.

Rates

Our utilities' rates were regulated by the various commissions shown in the table below during


. These commissions have general supervisory and regulatory powers over public utilities in their respective jurisdictions.

*

Tilden, an iron-ore mine in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, was a customer of WE through March 31, 2019. Tilden became a customer of UMERC when UMERC's new natural gas-fired generation in the Upper Peninsula began commercial operation. As a result, WE no longer has any retail customers in Michigan and its retail electric rates were not regulated by the MPSC after March 31, 2019. See

Note 25, Regulatory Environment

, for more information on the formation of UMERC.

Embedded within our electric utilities' rates is an amount to recover fuel and purchased power costs. The Wisconsin retail fuel rules require a utility to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, any under-collection or over-collection of fuel and purchased power costs that are outside of the utility's symmetrical fuel cost tolerance, which the PSCW typically sets at plus or minus 2% of the utility's approved fuel and purchased power cost plan. The deferred fuel and purchased power costs are subject to an excess revenues test. If the utility's ROE in a given year exceeds the ROE authorized by the PSCW, the recovery of under-collected fuel and purchased power costs would be reduced by the amount by which the utility's return exceeds the authorized amount. Prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs are recovered dollar-for-dollar from our Michigan retail electric customers and our wholesale electric customers.

Our natural gas utilities operate under GCRMs as approved by their respective state regulator. Generally, the GCRMs allow for a dollar-for-dollar recovery of prudently incurred natural gas costs.

See

Note 1(d), Operating Revenues

, for additional information on the significant mechanisms our utilities had in place in


that allowed them to recover or refund changes in prudently incurred costs from rate case-approved amounts.

WE, WPS, and WG are each subject to an earnings sharing mechanism. WE and WG have been subject to an earnings sharing mechanism since January 2016, and WPS adopted one in January 2018 pursuant to its settlement agreement with the PSCW. See

Note 25, Regulatory Environment

, for more information.

The material and information contained on these websites are not intended to be a part of, nor are they incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The following table compares our utility operating revenues by regulatory jurisdiction for each of the three years ended December 31:

Electric Transmission, Capacity, and Energy Markets

In connection with its status as a FERC-approved RTO, MISO operates bid-based energy markets. MISO has been able to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control.

In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by load-serving entities located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. The FERC has previously confirmed the use of the current transmission cost allocation methodology. Certain additional costs for new transmission projects are allocated throughout the MISO footprint.

As part of MISO, a market-based platform is used for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that is used in certain northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to hedge transmission congestion costs through ARRs and FTRs. ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO, and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction were completed for the period of June 1,


, through May 31,


. The resulting ARR allocation and the secured FTRs are expected to mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period.

MISO has an annual zonal resource adequacy requirement to ensure there is sufficient generation capacity to serve the MISO market. To meet this requirement, capacity resources can be acquired through MISO's annual capacity auction, bilateral contracts for capacity, or provided from generating or demand response resources. All of our capacity requirements during the planning year from June 1,


, through May 31,


were met.

Other Electric Regulations

Our electric utilities are subject to the Federal Power Act and the corresponding regulations developed by certain federal agencies. The Energy Policy Act amended the Federal Power Act in 2005 to, among other things, make electric utility industry consolidation

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


more feasible, authorize the FERC to review proposed mergers and the acquisition of generation facilities, change the FERC regulatory scheme applicable to qualifying cogeneration facilities, and modify certain other aspects of energy regulations and federal tax policies applicable to us. Additionally, the Energy Policy Act created an Electric Reliability Organization to be overseen by the FERC, which established mandatory electric reliability standards and has the authority to levy monetary sanctions for failure to comply with these standards.

WE and WPS are subject to Act 141 in Wisconsin, and UMERC is subject to Public Acts 295 and 342 in Michigan, which contain certain minimum requirements for renewable energy generation.

All of our hydroelectric facilities follow FERC guidelines and/or regulations.

Other Natural Gas Regulations

Almost all of the natural gas we distribute is transported to our distribution systems by interstate pipelines. The pipelines' transportation and storage services, including PGL's natural gas hub, are regulated by the FERC under the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. In addition, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and the state commissions are responsible for monitoring and enforcing requirements governing our natural gas utilities' safety compliance programs for our pipelines under the United States Department of Transportation regulations. These regulations include 49 CFR Part 191 (Transportation of Natural and Other Gas by Pipeline; Annual Reports, Incident Reports, and Safety-Related Condition Reports), 49 CFR Part 192 (Transportation of Natural and Other Gas by Pipeline: Minimum Federal Safety Standards), and 49 CFR Part 195 (Transportation of Hazardous Liquids by Pipeline).

We are required to provide natural gas service and grant credit (with applicable deposit requirements) to customers within our service territories. We are generally not allowed to discontinue natural gas service during winter moratorium months to residential heating customers who do not pay their bills. Federal and certain state governments have programs that provide for a limited amount of funding for assistance to low-income customers of our utilities.

Non-Utility Energy Infrastructure Operations

The generation facilities constructed by wholly owned subsidiaries of We Power are being leased on a long-term basis to WE. Environmental permits necessary for operating the facilities are the responsibility of the operating entity, WE. We Power received determinations from the FERC that upon the transfer of the facilities by lease to WE, We Power's subsidiaries would not be deemed public utilities under the Federal Power Act and thus would not be subject to the FERC's jurisdiction.

Bluewater is regulated by the FERC under the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. In addition, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration is responsible for monitoring and enforcing requirements governing Bluewater's safety compliance programs for its pipelines under the United States Department of Transportation regulations. These regulations include 49 CFR Parts 191, 192, and 195. Given that Bluewater is required to route some of its natural gas through Canada, applicable reporting and licensing with the United States Department of Energy and the Canadian National Energy Board are also required, along with routine reporting related to imports and exports.

Bishop Hill III, Coyote Ridge, and Upstream are all subject to the FERC’s regulation of wholesale energy under the Federal Power Act.

F. ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

Our operations, especially as they relate to our coal-fired generating facilities, are subject to extensive environmental regulation by state and federal environmental agencies governing air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste management, environmental remediation, and management of natural resources. Costs associated with complying with these requirements are significant. Additional future environmental regulations or revisions to existing laws, including for example, additional regulation related to GHG emissions, coal combustion products, air emissions, water use, or wastewater discharges and other climate change issues, could significantly increase these environmental compliance costs.

Anticipated expenditures for environmental compliance and certain remediation issues for the next three years are included in the estimated capital expenditures described in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Capital Requirements. For a discussion of certain environmental matters affecting us,

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

We are subject to a variety of risks, many of which are beyond our control, that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information included in this report and other documents filed by us with the SEC from time to time, when making an investment decision.

Risks Related to Legislation and Regulation

Our business is significantly impacted by governmental regulation and oversight.

We are subject to significant state, local, and federal governmental regulation, including regulation by the various utility commissions in the states where we serve customers. These regulations significantly influence our operating environment, may affect our ability to recover costs from utility customers, and cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs. Changes in regulations, interpretations of regulations, or the imposition of new regulations could also significantly impact us, including requiring us to change our business operations. Many aspects of our operations are regulated and impacted by government regulation, including, but not limited to: the rates we charge our retail electric, natural gas, and steam customers; the authorized rates of return of our utilities; construction and operation of electric generating facilities and electric and natural gas distribution systems, including the ability to recover such costs; decommissioning generating facilities, the ability to recover the related costs, and continuing to recover the return on the net book value of these facilities; wholesale power service practices; electric reliability requirements and accounting; participation in the interstate natural gas pipeline capacity market; standards of service; issuance of securities; short-term debt obligations; transactions with affiliates; and billing practices. Failure to comply with any applicable rules or regulations may lead to customer refunds, penalties, and other payments, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

The rates, including adjustments determined under riders, we are allowed to charge our customers for retail and wholesale services have the most significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. Rate regulation provides us an opportunity to recover prudently incurred costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. However, our ability to obtain rate adjustments in the future is dependent upon regulatory action, and there is no assurance that our regulators will consider all of our costs to have been prudently incurred. In addition, our rate proceedings may not always result in rates that fully recover our costs or provide for a reasonable ROE. We defer certain costs and revenues as regulatory assets and liabilities for future recovery from or refund to customers, as authorized by our regulators. Future recovery of regulatory assets is not assured and is subject to review and approval by our regulators. If recovery of regulatory assets is not approved or is no longer deemed probable, these costs would be recognized in current period expense and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.

We believe we have obtained the necessary permits, approvals, authorizations, certificates, and licenses for our existing operations, have complied in all material respects with all of their associated terms, and that our businesses are conducted in accordance with applicable laws. These permits, approvals, authorizations, certificates, and licenses may be revoked or modified by the agencies that granted them if facts develop that differ significantly from the facts assumed when they were issued. In addition, discharge permits and other approvals and licenses are often granted for a term that is less than the expected life of the associated facility. Licenses and permits may require periodic renewal, which may result in additional requirements being imposed by the granting agency. In addition, existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted by federal, state, and local agencies, or these agencies may adopt new laws and regulations that apply to us. We cannot predict the impact on our business and operating results of any such actions by these agencies.

If we are unable to recover costs of complying with regulations or other associated costs in customer rates in a timely manner, or if we are unable to obtain, renew, or comply with these governmental permits, approvals, authorizations, certificates, or licenses, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.

We face significant costs to comply with existing and future environmental laws and regulations.

Our operations are subject to numerous federal and state environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, air emissions (including, but not limited to: CO

2,

methane, mercury, SO


, and NOx), protection of natural resources, water quality, wastewater discharges, and management of hazardous, toxic, and solid wastes and substances. We incur significant costs to comply with these environmental requirements, including costs associated with the installation of pollution control equipment, environmental monitoring, emissions fees, and permits at our facilities. In addition, if we fail to comply with

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond our control, that failure may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and fines.

The EPA adopted and implemented (or is in the process of implementing) regulations governing the emission of NOx, SO


, fine particulate matter, mercury, and other air pollutants under the CAA through the NAAQS, the MATS rule, the ACE rule, the Cross-State Air Pollution rule, and other air quality regulations. In addition, the EPA finalized regulations under the Clean Water Act that govern cooling water intake structures at our power plants and revised the effluent guidelines for steam electric generating plants. We continue to assess the potential cost of complying, and to explore different alternatives in order to comply, with these and other environmental regulations. In addition, as a result of the upcoming 2020 federal Presidential election and the lack of final resolution of several environmental standards, there is uncertainty as to what capital expenditures or additional costs may ultimately be required to comply with existing and future environmental laws and regulations.

Existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised or new laws or regulations may be adopted at the federal or state level that could result in significant additional expenditures for our generation units or distribution systems, including, without limitation, costs to further limit GHG emissions from our operations; operating restrictions on our facilities; and increased compliance costs. In addition, the operation of emission control equipment and compliance with rules regulating our intake and discharge of water could increase our operating costs and reduce the generating capacity of our power plants. Any such regulation may also create substantial additional costs in the form of taxes or emission allowances and could affect the availability and/or cost of fossil fuels.

As a result of these environmental laws and regulations and other factors, certain of our coal-fired electric generating facilities have become uneconomical to maintain and operate, which has resulted in these units being retired or converted to an alternative type of fuel. We retired approximately 1,800 MW of coal-fired generation since the beginning of 2018, including the 2018 retirements of the Pleasant Prairie power plant, Pulliam power plant, and the jointly-owned Edgewater Unit 4 generating unit and the 2019 retirement of the PIPP. Certain of our remaining coal-fired electric generating facilities may also be retired or converted in the future. If other generation facility owners in the Midwest retire a significant number of older coal-fired generation facilities, a potential reduction in the region's capacity reserve margin below acceptable risk levels may result. This could impair the reliability of the grid in the Midwest, particularly during peak demand periods. A reduction in available future capacity could also adversely affect our ability to serve our customers' needs.

Our electric and natural gas utilities are also subject to significant liabilities related to the investigation and remediation of environmental impacts at certain of our current and former facilities and at third-party owned sites. We accrue liabilities and defer costs (recorded as regulatory assets) incurred in connection with our former manufactured gas plant sites. These costs include all costs incurred to date that we expect to recover, management's best estimates of future costs for investigation and remediation, related legal expenses, and are net of amounts recovered (or that may be recovered) from insurance or other third parties. Due to the potential for the imposition of stricter standards and greater regulation in the future, the possibility that other potentially responsible parties may not be financially able to contribute to cleanup costs, a change in conditions or the discovery of additional contamination, our remediation costs could increase, and the timing of our capital and/or operating expenditures in the future may accelerate or could vary from the amounts currently accrued.

In the event we are not able to recover all of our environmental expenditures and related costs from our customers in the future, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Further, increased costs recovered through rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity and natural gas, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.

Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental laws and regulations, has become more frequent throughout the United States. In addition to claims relating to our current facilities, we may also be subject to potential liability in connection with the environmental condition of facilities that we previously owned and operated, regardless of whether the liabilities arose before, during, or after the time we owned or operated these facilities. If we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations or cause (or caused) harm to the environment or persons, that failure or harm may result in the assessment of civil penalties and damages against us. The incurrence of a material environmental liability or a material judgment in any action for personal injury or property damage related to environmental matters could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

We may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions.

Management believes it is reasonably likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the existence and extent of climate change, and the role of human activity in it, will continue, with the potential for further regulation that affects our

operations.

The ACE rule became effective in September 2019 and is currently being litigated by multiple states (including Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin), local governments, and non-government organizations. This rule provides existing coal-fired generating units with standards for achieving GHG emission reductions. Every state's plan to implement ACE is required to focus on reducing GHG emissions by improving the efficiency of fossil-fueled power plants. We are continuing to analyze the GHG emission profile of our electric generation resources and to work with other stakeholders to determine the potential impacts to our operations of the ACE rule and federal and state GHG regulations in general.

There is no guarantee that we will be allowed to fully recover costs incurred to comply with these and other federal and state regulations or that cost recovery will not be delayed or otherwise conditioned. GHG regulations that may be adopted in the future, at either the federal or state level, may cause our environmental compliance spending to differ materially from the amounts currently estimated. These regulations, as well as changes in the fuel markets and advances in technology, could make additional electric generating units uneconomic to maintain or operate, may impact how we operate our existing fossil-fueled power plants and biomass facility, and could affect unit retirement and replacement decisions in the future. These regulations could also adversely affect our future results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.

In addition, our natural gas delivery systems and natural gas storage fields may generate fugitive gas as a result of normal operations and as a result of excavation, construction, and repair. Fugitive gas typically vents to the atmosphere and consists primarily of methane. CO


is also a byproduct of natural gas consumption. As a result, future regulation of GHG emissions could increase the price of natural gas, restrict the use of natural gas, cause us to accelerate the replacement and/or updating of our natural gas delivery systems, and adversely affect our ability to operate our natural gas facilities. A significant increase in the price of natural gas may increase rates for our natural gas customers, which could reduce natural gas demand.

We also continue to monitor the feasibility of taking more aggressive action to further reduce GHG emissions in order to limit future global temperature increases. These efforts could impact how we operate our electric generating units and natural gas facilities and lead to increased competition and regulation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.

Changes in federal income tax policy may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, as well as our or our subsidiaries’ credit ratings.

We and our subsidiaries have invested or will be investing in renewable energy generating facilities, several of which generate production tax credits and investment tax credits that we use to reduce our federal tax obligations. The amount of tax credits we earn depends on the level of electricity generated, the applicable tax credit rate, and the amount of the investment in qualifying property. If our tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an IRS audit or changes in tax law, we could owe tax liabilities for previously recognized tax credits that could significantly impact our earnings and cash flows.

In addition, if corporate tax rates or policies are changed with future federal or state legislation, we may be required to take material charges against earnings. For example, the Tax Legislation significantly changed the United States Internal Revenue Code, including taxation of United States corporations, by, among other things, reducing the federal corporate income tax rate, limiting interest deductions, and altering the expensing of capital expenditures. Parts of the Tax Legislation still remain unclear and will require additional interpretations and implementing regulations by the Treasury Department and the IRS, as well as state income tax authorities, and the Tax Legislation could continue to be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the Tax Legislation. State and local taxing authorities continue to evaluate the impact of the Tax Legislation, and any changes on the state or local level could lessen or increase the impacts of the Tax Legislation.

There is still uncertainty as to when or how credit rating agencies, capital markets, the FERC, or state public utility commissions will treat any additional impacts of the Tax Legislation. These impacts could subject us or any of our subsidiaries to further credit rating downgrades. It is unclear whether additional opportunities may evolve for us to manage the adverse impacts of the Tax Legislation. In addition, certain financial metrics used by credit rating agencies, such as our funds from operations-to-debt percentage, could be negatively impacted by future rulings related to the Tax Legislation.

Based on our current evaluation of the Tax Legislation, we do not expect the limitations on interest deductions to materially adversely affect our earnings per share. Any amendments to the Tax Legislation or interpretations or implementing regulations by the Treasury Department and/or the IRS contrary to our interpretation of the Tax Legislation could limit our ability to deduct the interest on some of our outstanding debt.

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


There may be other material adverse effects resulting from the Tax Legislation that we have not yet identified. If we are unable to successfully take actions to manage any adverse impacts of the Tax Legislation, or if additional interpretations, regulations, amendments, or technical corrections exacerbate the adverse impacts of the Tax Legislation, the Tax Legislation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and on the value of investments in our debt securities and common stock, and could result in credit rating agencies placing our or our subsidiaries’ credit ratings on negative outlook or further downgrading our or our subsidiaries' credit ratings.

We may fail to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

We are subject to reporting, disclosure control, and other obligations under SOX. SOX contains provisions requiring our management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and requires our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls. We have undertaken, and will continue to undertake, a variety of initiatives to integrate, standardize, centralize, and streamline our operations with technology, including, but not limited to, the implementation of several different ERP systems. There is a risk that we will not be able to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective because of the discovery of material weaknesses, with either our current controls and processes or with the implementation of new controls and processes around these new technologies. Any failure to maintain effective internal controls or a determination by our independent registered public accounting firm that we have a material weakness in our internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in the accuracy or completeness of our financial reports, cause a decline in the market price of our common stock, restrict our access to the capital markets, or subject us to investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities.

Our electric utilities could be subject to higher costs and penalties as a result of mandatory reliability standards.

Our electric utilities are subject to mandatory reliability and critical infrastructure protection standards established by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and enforced by the FERC. The critical infrastructure protection standards focus on controlling access to critical physical and cyber security assets. Compliance with the mandatory reliability standards could subject our electric utilities to higher operating costs. If our electric utilities were ever found to be in noncompliance with the mandatory reliability standards, they could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties.

Provisions of the Wisconsin Utility Holding Company Act limit our ability to invest in non-utility businesses and could deter takeover attempts by a potential purchaser of our common stock that would be willing to pay a premium for our common stock.

Under the Holding Company Act, we remain subject to certain restrictions that have the potential of limiting our diversification into non-utility businesses. Under the Holding Company Act, the sum of certain assets of all non-utility affiliates in a holding company system generally may not exceed 25% of the assets of all public utility affiliates in the system, subject to certain exceptions.

In addition, the Holding Company Act precludes the acquisition of 10% or more of the voting shares of a holding company of a Wisconsin public utility unless the PSCW has first determined that the acquisition is in the best interests of utility customers, investors, and the public. This provision and other requirements of the Holding Company Act may delay or reduce the likelihood of a sale or change of control of WEC Energy Group. As a result, shareholders may be deprived of opportunities to sell some or all of their shares of our common stock at prices that represent a premium over market prices.

Risks Related to the Operation of Our Business

Our operations are subject to risks arising from the reliability of our electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, natural gas infrastructure facilities, and other facilities, as well as the reliability of third-party transmission providers.

Our financial performance depends on the successful operation of our electric generation and natural gas and electric distribution facilities. The operation of these facilities involves many risks, including operator error and the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes. Potential breakdown or failure may occur due to severe weather; catastrophic events (i.e., fires, earthquakes, explosions, tornadoes, floods, droughts, pandemic health events, etc.); significant changes in water levels in waterways; fuel supply or transportation disruptions; accidents; employee labor disputes; construction delays or cost overruns; shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, material, and/or labor; performance below expected levels; operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements; terrorist attacks; or cyber security intrusions. Any of these events could lead to substantial financial losses.

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


Because our electric generation facilities are interconnected with third-party transmission facilities, the operation of our facilities could also be adversely affected by events impacting their systems. Unplanned outages at our power plants may reduce our revenues, cause us to incur significant costs if we are required to operate our higher cost electric generators or purchase replacement power to satisfy our obligations, and could result in additional maintenance expenses.

Insurance, warranties, performance guarantees, or recovery through the regulatory process may not cover any or all of these lost revenues or increased expenses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.

Our operations are subject to various conditions that can result in fluctuations in energy sales to customers, including customer growth and general economic conditions in our service areas, varying weather conditions, and energy conservation efforts.

Our results of operations and cash flows are affected by the demand for electricity and natural gas, which can vary greatly based upon:

•

Fluctuations in customer growth and general economic conditions in our service areas.

Customer growth and energy use can be negatively impacted by population declines as well as economic factors in our service territories, including workforce reductions, stagnant wage growth, changing levels of support from state and local government for economic development, business closings, and reductions in the level of business investment. Our electric and natural gas utilities are impacted by economic cycles and the competitiveness of the commercial and industrial customers we serve. Any economic downturn, disruption of financial markets, or reduced incentives by state government for economic development could adversely affect the financial condition of our customers and demand for their products or services. These risks could directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas as well as the need for additional power generation and generating facilities. We could also be exposed to greater risks of accounts receivable write-offs if customers are unable to pay their bills.

•

Weather conditions

. Demand for electricity is greater in the summer and winter months when cooling and heating is necessary. In addition, demand for natural gas peaks in the winter heating season. As a result, our overall results may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. In addition, milder temperatures during the summer cooling season and during the winter heating season may result in lower revenues and net income.

•

Our customers' continued focus on energy conservation

. Our customers' use of electricity and natural gas has decreased as a result of continued individual conservation efforts, including the use of more energy efficient technologies. Customers could also voluntarily reduce their consumption of energy in response to decreases in their disposable income and increases in energy prices. Conservation of energy can be influenced by certain federal and state programs that are intended to influence how consumers use energy. For example, several states, including Wisconsin and Michigan, have adopted energy efficiency targets to reduce energy consumption by certain dates.

As part of our planning process, we estimate the impacts of changes in customer growth and general economic conditions, weather, and customer energy conservation efforts, but risks still remain. Any of these matters, as well as any regulatory delay in adjusting rates as a result of reduced sales from effective conservation measures or the adoption of new technologies, could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.

We are actively involved with several significant capital projects, which are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect project costs and completion of construction projects.

Our business requires substantial capital expenditures for investments in, among other things, capital improvements to our electric generating facilities, electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure, natural gas storage, and other projects, including projects for environmental compliance. We also expect to continue investing in renewable energy generating facilities as part of our generation reshaping plan and as part of our non-utility energy infrastructure segment. In addition, WBS continues to invest in technology and the development of software applications to support our utilities.

Achieving the intended benefits of any large construction project is subject to many uncertainties, some of which we will have limited or no control over, that could adversely affect project costs and completion time. These risks include, but are not limited to, the ability to adhere to established budgets and time frames; the availability of labor or materials at estimated costs; the ability of contractors to perform under their contracts; strikes; adverse weather conditions; potential legal challenges; changes in applicable laws or regulations; the impact on global supply chains of pandemic health events; other governmental actions; continued public and policymaker support for such projects; and events in the global economy. In addition, certain of these projects require the approval of our regulators. If construction of commission-approved projects should materially and adversely deviate from the schedules, estimates, and projections on which the approval was based, our regulators may deem the additional capital costs as imprudent and

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


disallow recovery of them through rates, and otherwise available production tax credits and investment tax credits for renewable energy projects could be lost or lose value.

To the extent that delays occur, costs become unrecoverable, tax credits are lost or lose value, or we (or third parties with whom we invest and/or partner) otherwise become unable to effectively manage and complete our (or their) capital projects, our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition may be adversely affected.

Our operations are subject to risks beyond our control, including but not limited to, cyber security intrusions, terrorist attacks, acts of war, or unauthorized access to personally identifiable information.

We have been subject to attempted cyber attacks from time to time, but these attacks have not had a material impact on our system or business operations. Despite the implementation of security measures, all assets and systems are potentially vulnerable to disability, failures, or unauthorized access due to physical or cyber security intrusions caused by human error, vendor bugs, terrorist attacks, or other malicious acts. These threats against our generation facilities, electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure, our information and technology systems, and network infrastructure, including that of third parties on which we rely, could result in a full or partial disruption of our ability to generate, transmit, purchase, or distribute electricity or natural gas or cause environmental repercussions. If our assets or systems were to fail, be physically damaged, or be breached, and were not recovered in a timely manner, we may be unable to perform critical business functions, and data, including sensitive information, could be compromised.

We operate in an industry that requires the use of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure, which control an interconnected system of generation, distribution, and transmission systems shared with third parties. A successful physical or cyber security intrusion may occur despite our security measures or those that we require our vendors to take, which include compliance with reliability standards and critical infrastructure protection standards. Successful cyber security intrusions, including those targeting the electronic control systems used at our generating facilities and electric and natural gas transmission, distribution, and storage systems, could disrupt our operations and result in loss of service to customers. These intrusions may cause unplanned outages at our power plants, which may reduce our revenues or cause us to incur significant costs if we are required to operate our higher cost electric generators or purchase replacement power to satisfy our obligations, and could result in additional maintenance expenses. The risk of such intrusions may also increase our capital and operating costs as a result of having to implement increased security measures for protection of our information technology and infrastructure.

Our continued efforts to integrate, consolidate, and streamline our operations have also resulted in increased reliance on current and recently completed projects for technology systems, including but not limited to, a customer information and billing system, automated meter reading systems, and other similar technological tools and initiatives. We implement procedures to protect our systems, but we cannot guarantee that the procedures we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data and systems are adequate to safeguard against all security breaches. The failure of any of these or other similarly important technologies, or our inability to support, update, expand, and/or integrate these technologies across our subsidiaries could materially and adversely impact our operations, diminish customer confidence and our reputation, materially increase the costs we incur to protect against these risks, and subject us to possible financial liability or increased regulation or litigation.

Our business requires the collection and retention of personally identifiable information of our customers, shareholders, and employees, who expect that we will adequately protect such information. Security breaches may expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of confidential and proprietary information. A significant theft, loss, or fraudulent use of personally identifiable information may lead to potentially large costs to notify and protect the impacted persons, and/or could cause us to become subject to significant litigation, costs, liability, fines, or penalties, any of which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations as well as our reputation with customers, shareholders, and regulators, among others. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs associated with governmental actions in response to such intrusions or to strengthen our information and electronic control systems. We may also need to obtain additional insurance coverage related to the threat of such intrusions.

Any operational disruption or environmental repercussions caused by these on-going threats to our assets and technology systems could result in a significant decrease in our revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The costs of repairing damage to our facilities, operational disruptions, protecting personally identifiable information, and notifying impacted persons, as well as related legal claims, may also not be recoverable in rates, may exceed the insurance limits on our insurance policies, or, in some cases, may not be covered by insurance.

Advances in technology could make our electric generating facilities less competitive.

Advances in new technologies that produce power or reduce power consumption are ongoing and include renewable energy technologies, customer-oriented generation, energy storage devices, and energy efficiency technologies. We generate power at central station power plants to achieve economies of scale and produce power at a competitive cost. There are distributed generation technologies that produce power, including fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines, and solar cells, which have become more cost competitive than they were in the past. It is possible that legislation or regulations could be adopted supporting the use of these technologies. There is also a risk that advances in technology will continue to reduce the costs of these alternative methods of producing power to a level that is competitive with that of central station power production. If these technologies become cost competitive and achieve economies of scale, our market share could be eroded, and the value of our generating facilities could be reduced. Advances in technology could also change the channels through which our electric customers purchase or use power, which could reduce our sales and revenues or increase our expenses.

We transport, distribute, and store natural gas, which involves numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.

Inherent in natural gas distribution activities are a variety of hazards and operational risks, such as leaks, accidental explosions, and mechanical problems, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. In addition, these risks could result in serious injury to employees and non-employees, loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of operations, and substantial losses to us. The location of natural gas pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. These activities may subject us to litigation and/or administrative proceedings from time to time, which could result in substantial monetary judgments, fines, or penalties against us, or be resolved on unfavorable terms.

We are a holding company and rely on the earnings of our subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations.

As a holding company with no operations of our own, our ability to meet our financial obligations including, but not limited to, debt service, taxes, and other expenses, as well as pay dividends on our common stock, is dependent upon the ability of our subsidiaries to pay amounts to us, whether through dividends or other payments.

Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that are not required to pay any of our obligations or to make any funds available for that purpose or for the payment of dividends on our common stock.

The ability of our subsidiaries to pay amounts to us depends on their earnings, cash flows, capital requirements, and general financial condition, as well as regulatory limitations. Prior to distributing cash to us, our subsidiaries have financial obligations that must be satisfied, including, among others, debt service and preferred stock dividends.

In addition, each subsidiary's ability to pay amounts to us depends on any statutory, regulatory, and/or contractual restrictions and limitations applicable to such subsidiary, which may include requirements to maintain specified levels of debt or equity ratios, working capital, or other assets. Our utility subsidiaries are regulated by various state utility commissions, which generally possess broad powers to ensure that the needs of the utility customers are being met.

We may fail to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce.

We operate in an industry that requires many of our employees to possess unique technical skill sets. Events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, the mismatch of skill sets to future needs, or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges or increased costs. These operating challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and a lengthy time period associated with skill development. In addition, current and prospective employees may determine that they do not wish to work for us. Failure to hire and obtain replacement employees, including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, may adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business. If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, our results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our counterparties may fail to meet their obligations, including obligations under power purchase, natural gas supply, and transportation agreements.

We are exposed to the risk that counterparties to various arrangements who owe us money, electricity, natural gas, or other commodities or services will not be able to perform their obligations. Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, we may be required to replace the underlying commitment at current market prices or we may be unable to meet all of our

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


customers' electric and natural gas requirements unless or until alternative supply arrangements are put in place. In such event, we may incur losses, and our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity could be adversely affected.

We have entered into several power purchase, natural gas supply, and transportation agreements with non-affiliated companies, and continue to look for additional opportunities to enter into these agreements. Revenues are dependent on the continued performance by the counterparties of their obligations under the power purchase, natural gas supply, and transportation agreements. Although we have a comprehensive credit evaluation process and contractual protections, it is possible that one or more counterparties could fail to perform their obligations under these agreements. If this were to occur, we generally would expect that any operating and other costs that were initially allocated to a defaulting customer's power purchase, natural gas supply, or transportation agreement would be reallocated among our retail customers. To the extent these costs are not allowed to be reallocated by our regulators or there is any regulatory delay in adjusting rates, a counterparty default under these agreements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows.

We may not be able to fully use tax credits, net operating losses, and/or charitable contribution carryforwards.

We have significantly reduced our consolidated federal and state income tax liability in the past through tax credits, net operating losses, and charitable contribution deductions available under the applicable tax codes. We have not fully used the allowed tax credits, net operating losses, and charitable contribution deductions in our previous tax filings. We may not be able to fully use the tax credits, net operating losses, and charitable contribution deductions available as carryforwards if our future federal and state taxable income and related income tax liability is insufficient to permit their use. In addition, any future disallowance of some or all of those tax credits, net operating losses, or charitable contribution carryforwards as a result of legislation or an adverse determination by one of the applicable taxing jurisdictions could materially affect our tax obligations and financial results.

We have recorded goodwill that could become impaired.

We assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances occur that indicate a potential for impairment. If goodwill is deemed to be impaired, we may be required to incur non-cash charges that could materially adversely affect our results of operations. At

Risks Related to Economic and Market Volatility

Our business is dependent on our ability to successfully access capital markets.

We rely on access to credit and capital markets to support our capital requirements, including expenditures for our utility infrastructure and to comply with future regulatory requirements, to the extent not satisfied by the cash flow generated by our operations. We have historically secured funds from a variety of sources, including the issuance of short-term and long-term debt securities. Successful implementation of our long-term business strategies, including capital investment, is dependent upon our ability to access the capital markets, including the banking and commercial paper markets, on competitive terms and rates. In addition, we rely on committed bank credit agreements as back-up liquidity, which allows us to access the low cost commercial paper markets.

Our or our subsidiaries' access to the credit and capital markets could be limited, or our or our subsidiaries' cost of capital significantly increased, due to any of the following risks and uncertainties:

•

A rating downgrade;

•

An economic downturn or uncertainty;

•

Prevailing market conditions and rules;

•

Concerns over foreign economic conditions;

•

Changes in tax policy;

•

Changes in investment criteria of institutional investors;

•

War or the threat of war;

•

The overall health and view of the utility and financial institution industries; and

•

Changes in the method of determining LIBOR or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate.

A portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable interest rates, primarily based on LIBOR. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform, which may cause LIBOR to cease to exist after 2021 or to perform differently than in the past. While we expect that reasonable alternatives to LIBOR will be implemented prior to the

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


2021 target date, we cannot predict the consequences and timing of the development of alternative reference rates. The transition to alternative reference rates could include an increase in our interest expense and/or reduction in our interest income.

If any of these risks or uncertainties limit our access to the credit and capital markets or significantly increase our cost of capital, it could limit our ability to implement, or increase the costs of implementing, our business plan, which, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition, and could limit our ability to sustain our current common stock dividend level.

A downgrade in our or any of our subsidiaries' credit ratings could negatively affect our or our subsidiaries' ability to access capital at reasonable costs and/or require the posting of collateral.

There are a number of factors that impact our and our subsidiaries' credit ratings, including, but not limited to, capital structure, regulatory environment, the ability to cover liquidity requirements, and other requirements for capital. We or any of our subsidiaries could experience a downgrade in ratings if the rating agencies determine that the level of business or financial risk of us, our utilities, or the utility industry has deteriorated. Changes in rating methodologies by the rating agencies could also have a negative impact on credit ratings.

Any downgrade by the rating agencies could:

•

Increase borrowing costs under certain existing credit facilities;

•

Require the payment of higher interest rates in future financings and possibly reduce the pool of creditors;

•

Decrease funding sources by limiting our or our subsidiaries' access to the commercial paper market;

•

Limit the availability of adequate credit support for our subsidiaries' operations; and

•

Trigger collateral requirements in various contracts.

See the risk factor titled "Changes in federal income tax policy may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, as well as our or our subsidiaries' credit ratings" above for information about how the Tax Legislation could impact our or our subsidiaries' credits ratings.

Fluctuating commodity prices could negatively impact our electric and natural gas utility operations.

Our operating and liquidity requirements are impacted by changes in the forward and current market prices of natural gas, coal, electricity, renewable energy credits, and ancillary services.

Our electric utilities burn natural gas in several of their electric generation plants and as a supplemental fuel at several coal-fired plants. In many instances the cost of purchased power is tied to the cost of natural gas. The cost of natural gas may increase because of disruptions in the supply of natural gas due to a curtailment in production or distribution, international market conditions, the demand for natural gas, and the availability of shale gas and potential regulations affecting its accessibility.

For Wisconsin retail electric customers, our utilities bear the risk for the recovery of fuel and purchased power costs within a symmetrical 2% fuel tolerance band compared to the forecast of fuel and purchased power costs established in their respective rate structures. Prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs are recovered dollar-for-dollar from our Michigan retail electric customers and our wholesale electric customers. Our natural gas utilities receive dollar-for-dollar recovery of prudently incurred natural gas costs from their natural gas customers.

Changes in commodity prices could result in:

•

Higher working capital requirements, particularly related to natural gas inventory, accounts receivable, and cash collateral postings;

•

Reduced profitability to the extent that lower revenues, increased bad debt, and interest expense are not recovered through rates;

•

Higher rates charged to our customers, which could impact our competitive position;

•

Reduced demand for energy, which could impact revenues and operating expenses; and

•

Shutting down of generation facilities if the cost of generation exceeds the market price for electricity.

We may not be able to obtain an adequate supply of coal, which could limit our ability to operate our coal-fired facilities.

We own and operate several coal-fired electric generating units. Although we generally carry sufficient coal inventory at our generating facilities to protect against an interruption or decline in supply, there can be no assurance that the inventory levels will be adequate. While we have coal supply and transportation contracts in place, we cannot assure that the counterparties to these agreements will be able to fulfill their obligations to supply coal to us or that we will be able to take delivery of all the coal volume contracted for. If we are unable to obtain our coal requirements under our coal supply and transportation contracts, we may be required to purchase coal at higher prices or we may be forced to reduce generation at our coal-fired units, which could lead to increased fuel costs. The increase in fuel costs could result in either reduced margins on net sales into the MISO Energy Markets, a reduction in the volume of net sales into the MISO Energy Markets, and/or an increase in net power purchases in the MISO Energy Markets. There is no guarantee that we would be able to fully recover any increased costs in rates or that recovery would not otherwise be delayed, either of which could adversely affect our cash flows.

Our use of derivative contracts could result in financial losses.

We use derivative instruments such as swaps, options, futures, and forwards to manage commodity price exposure. We could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market value of these contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform. These risks are managed through risk management policies, which might not work as planned and cannot entirely eliminate the risks associated with these activities. In addition, although the hedging programs of our utilities must be approved by the various state commissions, derivative contracts entered into for hedging purposes might not offset the underlying exposure being hedged as expected, resulting in financial losses. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the value of these financial instruments can involve management's judgment or use of estimates. Changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.

Restructuring in the regulated energy industry and competition in the retail and wholesale markets could have a negative impact on our business and revenues.

The regulated energy industry continues to experience significant structural changes. Deregulation or other changes in law in the states where we serve our customers could allow third-party suppliers to contract directly with customers for their natural gas and electric supply requirements. This increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets could have a significant adverse financial impact on us.

Certain jurisdictions in which we operate, including Michigan and Illinois, have adopted retail choice. Under Michigan law, our retail customers may choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. The law limits customer choice to 10% of our Michigan retail load. The iron ore mine located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan is excluded from this cap. When a customer switches to an alternative electric supplier, we continue to provide distribution and customer service functions for the customer. Although Illinois has adopted retail choice, there is currently little or no impact on the net income of our Illinois utilities as they still earn a distribution charge for transporting the natural gas for these customers. It is uncertain whether retail choice might be implemented in Wisconsin or Minnesota.

The FERC continues to support the existing RTOs that affect the structure of the wholesale market within these RTOs. In connection with its status as a FERC-approved RTO, MISO implemented bid-based energy markets that are part of the MISO Energy Markets. All market participants, including us, must submit day-ahead and/or real-time bids and offers for energy at locations across the MISO region. MISO then calculates the most efficient solution for all of the bids and offers made into the market that day and establishes an LMP that reflects the market price for energy. We are required to follow MISO's instructions when dispatching generating units to support MISO's responsibility for maintaining the stability of the transmission system. MISO also implemented an ancillary services market for operating reserves that schedules energy and ancillary services at the same time as part of the energy market, allowing for more efficient use of generation assets in the MISO Energy Markets. These market designs continue to have the potential to increase the costs of transmission, the costs associated with inefficient generation dispatching, the costs of participation in the MISO Energy Markets, and the costs associated with estimated payment settlements.

The FERC rules related to transmission are designed to facilitate competition in the wholesale electricity markets among regulated utilities, non-utility generators, wholesale power marketers, and brokers by providing greater flexibility and more choices to wholesale customers, including initiatives designed to encourage the integration of renewable sources of supply. In addition, along with transactions contemplating physical delivery of energy, financial laws and regulations impact hedging and trading based on futures contracts and derivatives that are traded on various commodities exchanges, as well as over-the-counter. Technology changes in the power and fuel industries also have significant impacts on wholesale transactions and related costs. We currently cannot

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


predict the impact of these and other developments or the effect of changes in levels of wholesale supply and demand, which are driven by factors beyond our control.

We may experience poor investment performance of benefit plan holdings due to changes in assumptions and market conditions.

We have significant obligations related to pension and OPEB plans. If we are unable to successfully manage our benefit plan assets and medical costs, our cash flows, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely impacted. Our cost of providing these plans is dependent upon a number of factors, including actual plan experience, changes made to the plans, and assumptions concerning the future. Types of assumptions include earnings on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation, estimated withdrawals by retirees, and our required or voluntary contributions to the plans. Plan assets are subject to market fluctuations and may yield returns that fall below projected return rates. In addition, medical costs for both active and retired employees may increase at a rate that is significantly higher than we currently anticipate. Our funding requirements could be impacted by a decline in the market value of plan assets, changes in interest rates, changes in demographics (including the number of retirements), or changes in life expectancy assumptions.

In addition, we maintain rabbi trusts to fund our deferred compensation plans, which from time to time, hold equity and debt investments that are subject to market fluctuations. Decreases in investment performance of these assets could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.

We may be unable to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or at all, and the insurance coverage we do obtain may not provide protection against all significant losses.

Our ability to obtain insurance, as well as the cost and coverage of such insurance, could be affected by developments affecting our business; international, national, state, or local events; and the financial condition of insurers and our contractors that are required to acquire and maintain insurance for our benefit. Insurance coverage may not continue to be available at all or at rates or terms similar to those presently available to us. In addition, our insurance may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject. Any losses for which we are not fully insured or that are not covered by insurance at all could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial position.

A. REGULATED

Electric Facilities

The following table summarizes information on our electric generation facilities, including owned and jointly owned facilities, as of

December 31, 2019

:

(1)

Capacity for our electric generation facilities is based on rated capacity, which is the net power output under average operating conditions with equipment in an average state of repair as of a given month in a given year. Values are primarily based on the net dependable expected capacity ratings for summer


established by tests and may change slightly from year to year. The summer period is the most relevant for capacity planning purposes. This is a result of continually reaching demand peaks in the summer months, primarily due to air conditioning demand.

(2)

These facilities are jointly owned by WPS and various other utilities. The capacity indicated for each of these units is equal to WPS's portion of total plant capacity based on its percent of ownership.

•

Wisconsin Power and Light Company, an unaffiliated utility, operates the Columbia units. WPS holds a 27.6% ownership interest in Columbia.

See Note 7, Jointly Owned Utility Facilities, for more information

on the anticipated decrease in WPS's ownership interest in the Columbia unit.

Environmental Matters

Manlove Field Matter

In September 2017, the IDNR, Office of Oil and Gas Resource Management, issued a VN to PGL related to a leak of natural gas from a well located at the PGL Manlove Gas Storage Field in December 2016. PGL quickly shut down and permanently plugged the well to

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


contain the leak after it was discovered. The leak resulted in the migration of natural gas from the well to the Mahomet Aquifer located in central Illinois and impacted residential freshwater wells. PGL has been working with residents potentially impacted by the natural gas leak, and the Illinois state agencies to investigate and remediate the impacts of the natural gas leak to the Mahomet Aquifer. In October 2017, the Illinois AG filed a complaint against PGL alleging certain violations of the Illinois Environmental Protection Act and the Oil and Gas Act. PGL entered into an Agreed Interim Order with the State of Illinois in October 2017 and a First Amended Agreed Interim Order in September 2019 whereby PGL agreed, among other things, to continue actions it was already undertaking proactively, including the submittal of a GMZ application, which PGL submitted to the IEPA in August 2019. The GMZ application is being reviewed by the IEPA staff.

In addition, in December 2017, the IEPA issued a VN to PGL alleging the same violations as the AG. Lastly, in January 2018, the IEPA issued a VN alleging certain violations of Illinois air emission rules arising from the construction and operation of flaring equipment at the leak site. Both of the IEPA VN matters have been referred to the AG for enforcement.

In the complaint, as is customary in these types of actions, the AG cited to the statutory penalties allowed by law. Ultimately, the pursuit of any civil penalties is at the AG’s discretion. In the event the AG wishes to consider such penalties, we believe that PGL's high level of cooperation and quick action to remedy the situation and to work with the potentially impacted homeowners would be taken into account. At this time, we believe that civil penalties, if any, will not have a material impact on our financial statements.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

CORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS

Introduction

We are a diversified holding company with natural gas and electric utility operations (serving customers in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota), an approximately 60% equity ownership interest in American Transmission Company LLC (ATC) (a for-profit electric transmission company regulated by the FERC and certain state regulatory commissions), and non-utility energy infrastructure operations through We Power (which owns generation assets in Wisconsin), Bluewater (which owns underground natural gas storage facilities in Michigan), and WEC Infrastructure LLC (WECI), which holds ownership interests in several wind generating facilities.

In August 2019, WECI signed an agreement to acquire an 80% ownership interest in Thunderhead Wind Energy LLC, a 300 MW wind generating facility under construction in Antelope and Wheeler counties in Nebraska. In January 2020, WECI signed an agreement to acquire an 80% ownership interest in Blooming Grove Wind Energy Center LLC, a 250 MW wind generating facility under construction in McLean County, Illinois. See

Note 2, Acquisitions

, for more information.

Corporate Strategy

Our goal is to continue to build and sustain long-term value for our shareholders and customers by focusing on the fundamentals of our business: reliability; operating efficiency; financial discipline; customer care; and safety.

Reshaping Our Generation Fleet

The planned reshaping of our generation fleet balances reliability and customer cost with environmental stewardship. Taken as a whole, this plan should reduce costs to customers, preserve fuel diversity, and lower carbon emissions. Generation reshaping includes retiring older fossil fuel generation units, building state-of-the-art natural gas generation, and investing in cost-effective zero-carbon generation. In 2019, we met and exceeded our 2030 goal of reducing CO


emissions by 40% below 2005 levels, and are re-evaluating our longer-term CO


reduction goals. We have already retired more than 1,800 MW of coal-fired generation since the beginning of 2018, and expect to continue adding natural gas-fired generating units and renewable generation, including utility-scale solar projects. The plan included the March 2019 retirement of the Presque Isle power plant as well as the 2018 retirements of the Pleasant Prairie power plant, the Pulliam power plant, and the jointly-owned Edgewater Unit 4 generating units. See

Note 6, Property, Plant, and Equipment

, for more information related to these power plant retirements.

As part of our commitment to invest in zero-carbon generation, we have either filed for or received approval to invest in 300 MW of utility-scale solar within our Wisconsin segment. Wisconsin Public Service Corporation (WPS) has partnered with an unaffiliated utility to construct two solar projects in Wisconsin. Badger Hollow Solar Farm I is located in Iowa County, Wisconsin, and the Two Creeks Solar Project is located in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin. Once constructed, WPS will own 100 MW of the output of each project for a total of 200 MW. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) approved the acquisition of these two projects in April 2019. Construction began at the Two Creeks Solar Project and the Badger Hollow Solar Farm I in August 2019 and October 2019, respectively. Commercial operation of both projects is targeted for the end of 2020. Wisconsin Electric Power Company (WE) has partnered with an unaffiliated utility to acquire an ownership interest in a proposed solar project, Badger Hollow Solar Farm II, that will be located in Iowa County, Wisconsin. At its meeting on February 20, 2020, the PSCW approved the acquisition of this project. The approval is still subject to WE's receipt and review of a final written order from the PSCW. Once constructed, WE will own 100 MW of the output of this project. Commercial operation of Badger Hollow Solar Farm II is targeted for the end of 2021.

In December 2018, WE received approval from the PSCW for two renewable energy pilot programs. The Solar Now pilot is expected to add 35 MW of solar generation to WE's portfolio, allowing non-profit and government entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers to site utility owned solar arrays on their property. Under this program, in 2019, WE constructed 5 MW of solar generation and expects to construct more than double that amount in 2020. The second program, the Dedicated Renewable Energy Resource pilot, would allow large commercial and industrial customers to access renewable resources that WE would operate, adding up to 150 MW of renewables to WE's portfolio, and allowing these larger customers to meet their sustainability and renewable energy goals.

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


As the cost of renewable energy generation continues to decline, these utility-scale solar projects and the WE pilot programs have become cost effective opportunities for WEC Energy Group and our customers to participate in renewable energy.

We also have a goal to decrease the rate of methane emissions from the natural gas distribution lines in our network by 30% per mile by the year 2030 from a 2011 baseline. We were over half way toward meeting that goal at the end of 2019.

Reliability

We have made significant reliability-related investments in recent years, and plan to continue strengthening and modernizing our generation fleet and distribution networks to further improve reliability. Our investments, coupled with our commitment to operating efficiency and customer care, resulted in We Energies and WPS being recognized by PA Consulting Group, an independent consulting firm, for superior reliability of their electric delivery networks. This is the ninth consecutive year that We Energies has been named the most reliable utility in the Midwest and the first time WPS has been recognized.

Below are a few examples of reliability projects that are proposed or currently underway.

•

WE and Wisconsin Gas LLC (WG) each plan to construct their own LNG facility. Subject to PSCW approval, each facility would provide approximately one billion cubic feet of natural gas supply to meet anticipated peak demand without requiring the construction of additional interstate pipeline capacity. These facilities are expected to reduce the likelihood of constraints on WE's and WG's natural gas systems during the highest demand days of winter. Commercial operation of the LNG facilities is targeted for the end of 2023.

•

The Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company continues to work on its Natural Gas System Modernization Program, which primarily involves replacing old cast and ductile iron pipes and facilities in Chicago’s natural gas delivery system with modern polyethylene pipes to reinforce the long-term safety and reliability of the system.

•

WPS continues work on its System Modernization and Reliability Project, which involves modernizing parts of its electric distribution system, including burying or upgrading lines. The project focuses on constructing facilities to improve the reliability of electric service WPS provides to its customers. WE, WPS, and WG also continue to upgrade their electric and natural gas distribution systems to enhance reliability.

Operating Efficiency

We continually look for ways to optimize the operating efficiency of our company. For example, we are making progress on our Advanced Metering Infrastructure program, replacing aging meter-reading equipment on both our network and customer property. An integrated system of smart meters, communication networks, and data management programs enables two-way communication between our utilities and our customers. This program reduces the manual effort for disconnects and reconnects and enhances outage management capabilities.

We continue to focus on integrating resources of all our businesses and finding the best and most efficient processes while meeting all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

See

Note 3, Dispositions

, for information on recent dispositions. In the first quarter of 2017, we sold substantially all of the remaining assets of Bostco LLC, and, in October 2018, Bostco was dissolved. In 2019, we sold certain WPS Power Development, LLC solar power generation facilities.

Our investment focus remains in our regulated utility and non-utility energy infrastructure businesses, as well as our investment in ATC. We expect total capital expenditures for our regulated utility and non-utility energy infrastructure businesses to be approximately $13.7 billion from 2020 to 2024. Specific projects are discussed in more detail below under Liquidity and Capital Resources.

From 2020 to 2024, we expect capital contributions to ATC to be approximately $150 million. Capital investments at ATC will be funded utilizing these capital contributions, in addition to cash generated by ATC from operations and debt. We currently forecast that our share of ATC's projected capital expenditures over the next five years will be $1.3 billion.

year ended December 31, 2019

with the

year ended December 31, 2018

, including favorable or better, "B", and unfavorable or worse, "W", variances:

We adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), effective January 1, 2019, which revised the previous guidance regarding the accounting for leases. As a result of this adoption, during


,

$347.6 million

of minimum lease payments that were billed from We Power to WE were no longer classified within operation and maintenance, but were instead recorded as interest expense in accordance with Topic 842. The We Power leases do not impact our financial statements as all amounts associated with the leases are eliminated at the consolidated level.

Earnings

increased

$74.7 million

during


, compared with


. The table above shows the income statement impacts associated with the flow through of tax repairs beginning January 1, 2018 and the adoption of Topic 842, effective January 1, 2019. As shown in the table above, the changes related to these items had no impact on net income attributed to common shareholders.

The significant factors impacting the

$74.7 million

increase in earnings were:

•

A

$41.7 million

remaining decrease in income tax expense, primarily due to an increase in wind production tax credits related to acquisitions of ownership interests in wind generation facilities in our non-utility energy infrastructure segment and the impact of the 2018 PSCW order regarding the benefits associated with the Tax Legislation. The impacts from the 2018 PSCW order related to the Tax Legislation were offset in operating income at the Wisconsin segment. See

Note 2, Acquisitions

, for more information on the acquisitions in our non-utility energy infrastructure segment.

•

A

$41.6 million

remaining increase in operating income at the Wisconsin segment. The increase was driven by lower operation and maintenance expense related to our power plants, which primarily resulted from lower maintenance and labor costs associated with our 2019 and 2018 plant retirements, and increases to certain plant-related regulatory assets resulting from decisions included in the December 2019 Wisconsin rate orders. The positive impact from lower operation and maintenance expense was partially offset by a decrease in electric margins related to lower retail sales volumes, primarily driven by cooler summer weather during 2019 compared with 2018; higher depreciation and amortization expense, driven by assets being placed into service as we continue to execute on our capital plan; and the impact from the PSCW's 2018 order addressing the Tax Legislation, which was offset in income tax expense.

•

A

$36.1 million

increase in operating income at the Illinois segment. The increase was driven by higher natural gas margins at PGL due to continued capital investment in the SMP project under its QIP rider.

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


•

A

$31.9 million

increase in other income, net, driven by net gains from investments held in the Integrys rabbi trust during 2019, compared with net losses during 2018. These investment gains partially offset benefits costs related to deferred compensation, which are included in other operation and maintenance expense.

See Note 16, Fair Value Measurements, for more information

on our investments held in the Integrys rabbi trust. Also contributing to the increase was higher net credits from the non-service components of our net periodic pension and OPEB costs.

See Note 19, Employee Benefits, for more information

on our benefit costs.

These increases in earnings were partially offset by:

•

A

$53.1 million

remaining increase in interest expense, driven by higher long-term debt balances, primarily used to fund capital investments.

•

A

$12.2 million

increase in operating loss at the corporate and other segment, primarily driven by the transfer of assets from WBS, our centralized services company, to our regulated utilities in 2018. As a result of these transfers, the return on these assets is now recognized within our regulated utility operations. Also contributing to the increase in operating loss was a gain recorded in the third quarter of 2018 that related to the sale of a legacy business.

•

A

$9.1 million

decrease in earnings from our ownership interests in transmission affiliates, driven by the impact of a FERC order issued in November 2019 that addressed complaints related to ATC's allowed ROE. Increased earnings from continued capital investment partially offset the negative impact from the FERC order.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The discussions below address the operating income contribution of each of our segments and include financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as electric margins and natural gas margins, which are not measures of financial performance under GAAP. Electric margin (electric revenues less fuel and purchased power costs) and natural gas margin (natural gas revenues less cost of natural gas sold) are non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude other operation and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization, and property and revenue taxes.

We believe that electric and natural gas margins provide a useful basis for evaluating utility operations since the majority of prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs, as well as prudently incurred natural gas costs, are passed through to customers in current rates. As a result, management uses electric and natural gas margins internally when assessing the operating performance of our segments as these measures exclude the majority of revenue fluctuations caused by changes in these expenses. Similarly, the presentation of electric and natural gas margins herein is intended to provide supplemental information for investors regarding our operating performance.

Our electric margins and natural gas margins may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.  Furthermore, these measures are not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of our segment operating performance. Operating income for each of the last two fiscal years for each of our segments is presented in the “Consolidated Earnings” table above.

Each applicable segment operating income discussion below includes a table that provides the calculation of electric margins and natural gas margins, as applicable, along with a reconciliation to segment operating income.

Wisconsin Segment Contribution to Operating Income

The following table shows a breakdown of other operation and maintenance:

(1)

Represents costs associated with the We Power generation units, including operating and maintenance costs incurred by WE. During


, the amount also included the lease payments that were billed from We Power to WE and then recovered in WE's rates. We adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), effective January 1, 2019, which revised the previous guidance regarding the accounting for leases. As a result of this adoption, during


, $363.3 million of lease expense related to the We Power leases with WE was no longer classified within other operation and maintenance, but was instead recorded as $15.8 million and $347.5 million of depreciation and amortization and interest expense, respectively, in accordance with Topic 842. The We Power leases do not impact our financial statements as all amounts associated with the leases are eliminated at the consolidated level.

During

$134.8 million

of operating and maintenance costs were billed to or incurred by WE related to the We Power generation units, with the difference in costs billed or incurred and expenses recognized, either deferred or deducted from the regulatory asset. During


, $485.3 million of both lease and operating and maintenance costs were billed to or incurred by WE related to the We Power generation units, with the difference in costs billed or incurred and expenses recognized, either deferred or deducted from the regulatory asset.

(2)

Represents transmission expense that we are authorized to collect in rates, in accordance with the PSCW's approval of escrow accounting for ATC and MISO network transmission expenses for our Wisconsin electric utilities. As a result, WE and WPS defer as a regulatory asset or liability the differences between actual transmission costs and those included in rates until recovery or refund is authorized in a future rate proceeding. During


and


,

$486.7 million

and $438.2 million, respectively, of costs were billed to our electric utilities by transmission providers.

(3)

Represents additional transmission expense associated with WE's flow through of tax benefits of its repair-related deferred tax liabilities starting in 2018, in accordance with a settlement agreement with the PSCW, to maintain certain regulatory asset balances at their December 31, 2017 levels.

See Note 25, Regulatory Environment, for more information

. The decrease in transmission expense associated with the flow through of tax benefits is offset in income taxes.

(4)

Represents additional transmission expense associated with the May 2018 PSCW order requiring WE to use 80% of its current 2018 tax benefit, including the amortization associated with the revaluation of deferred taxes, to reduce its transmission regulatory asset balance.

See Note 25, Regulatory Environment, for more information

Compared with


Electric Utility Margins

Electric utility margins at the Wisconsin segment decreased

$45.1 million

during


, compared with


. The significant factors impacting the lower electric utility margins were:

•

A $54.1 million decrease related to lower sales volumes, primarily driven by cooler summer weather during


compared with


. As measured by cooling degree days,


was

21.7%

and

25.7%

cooler than


in the Milwaukee and Green Bay areas, respectively.

•

A $13.7 million decrease in margins associated with WE's flow through of tax benefits of its repair-related deferred tax liabilities starting in 2018 in accordance with a settlement agreement with the PSCW to maintain certain regulatory assets at their December 31, 2017 levels. This decrease in margins was offset in income taxes. See

Note 25, Regulatory Environment

, for more information.

•

A $6.8 million decrease in margins related to savings from the Tax Legislation that we are required to return to customers through bill credits or reductions in other regulatory assets. This decrease in margins did not impact net income as it was offset by the net impact of a $22.0 million decrease in income taxes and a $15.2 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense. We received the PSCW order in May 2018, which required WPS to use 40% of its 2018 and 2019 tax benefits associated with the Tax Legislation to reduce certain regulatory assets. See

Note 15, Income Taxes

, and

Note 25, Regulatory Environment

, for more information.

These decreases in margins were partially offset by:

•

A $16.3 million increase in margins related to the iron ore mine located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Prior to the transfer of the mine as a full requirements customer of WE to UMERC as of April 1, 2019, the margin from the mine was being deferred for the benefit of Wisconsin retail electric customers, as ordered by the PSCW. On March 31, 2019 when the new generation solution in the Upper Peninsula began commercial operation, a new 20 year agreement with Tilden became effective under which Tilden began purchasing electric power from UMERC. Half of the cost of the generation solution is being recovered from Tilden under this new agreement.

•

A $5.3 million increase in margins related to a net decrease in fuel and purchased power costs driven by the commercial operation of UMERC's new generation solution in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan on March 31, 2019. UMERC previously met its market obligations through power purchase agreements.

Natural Gas Utility Margins

Natural gas utility margins at the Wisconsin segment increased

$17.8 million

during


, compared with


. The most significant factor impacting the higher natural gas utility margins was higher sales volumes, due in part to colder winter weather, customer growth, and higher use per residential customer during


, compared with


. As measured by heating degree days,


was

2.2%

colder than


in the Milwaukee and Green Bay areas.

Operating Income

Operating income at the Wisconsin segment increased

$389.4 million

during


, compared with


. This increase was driven by

$416.7 million

of lower operating expenses (which include other operation and maintenance, depreciation and amortization, and property and revenue taxes), partially offset by the

$27.3 million

net decrease in margins discussed above.

The utility segment experienced lower overall operating expenses related to efficiencies and effective cost control. The other significant factors impacting the decrease in operating expenses during


, compared with


, were:

•

A $363.3 million decrease in other operation and maintenance expense resulting from the adoption of the new lease guidance. As discussed in the other operation and maintenance table above, the adoption of Topic 842, effective January 1, 2019, required WE to change the income statement classification of its lease payments related to the We Power leases. During 2019, the minimum lease payments that were billed from We Power to WE were no longer classified within other operation and

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


maintenance, but were instead recorded as a component of depreciation and amortization and interest expense in accordance with Topic 842.

•

A $107.6 million decrease in other operation and maintenance expense related to our power plants, driven by lower maintenance and labor costs associated with our 2019 and 2018 plant retirements, and increases to certain plant-related regulatory assets resulting from decisions included in the December 2019 Wisconsin rate orders. Plant retirements included the March 2019 retirement of the PIPP as well as the 2018 retirements of the Pleasant Prairie power plant, Edgewater Unit 4, and Pulliam Units 7 and 8.

See Note 6, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information

on the plant retirements.

See Note 25, Regulatory Environment, for more information

on the Wisconsin rate orders.

•

A $10.6 million decrease in transmission expense in 2019 related to the flow through of tax repairs, as discussed in the other operation and maintenance table above. This decrease in transmission expense was offset in income taxes.

•

A $6.0 million decrease in expense related to the earnings sharing mechanisms in place at our Wisconsin utilities.

See Note 25, Regulatory Environment, for more information

.

These decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by:

•

A

$70.4 million

increase in depreciation and amortization, driven by assets being placed into service as we continue to execute on our capital plan, an increase related to the reduction of certain regulatory assets as a result of the PSCW's May 2018 order addressing the Tax legislation and offset in electric margins above, and additional expense recognized related to the adoption of Topic 842, as discussed in the notes under the other operation and maintenance table above.

•

A $16.4 million increase in storm restoration expense during 2019.

•

A $16.3 million net increase in benefit costs, primarily related to higher deferred compensation costs during 2019.

Illinois Segment Contribution to Operating Income

Since the majority of PGL and NSG customers use natural gas for heating, operating income is sensitive to weather and is generally higher during the winter months.

The following table shows a breakdown of other operation and maintenance:

*

These riders and regulatory amortizations are substantially offset in margins and therefore do not have a significant impact on operating income.

The following tables provide information on delivered volumes by customer class and weather statistics:

*

Normal heating degree days are based on a 12-year moving average of monthly temperatures from Chicago's O'Hare Airport.


Compared with


Natural Gas Utility Margins

Natural gas utility margins at the Illinois segment, net of the $2.2 million impact of the riders referenced in the table above, increased $34.0 million during 2019, compared with 2018. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in revenue at PGL due to continued capital investment in the SMP project under its QIP rider. PGL currently recovers the costs related to the SMP through a surcharge on customer bills pursuant to an ICC approved QIP rider, which is in effect through 2023. See

Note 25, Regulatory Environment

, for more information.

Operating Income

Operating income at the Illinois segment increased $36.1 million during 2019, compared with 2018. This increase was driven by the $34.0 million net increase in margins discussed above, as well as $2.1 million of lower operating expenses (which include other operation and maintenance, depreciation and amortization, and property and revenue taxes), net of the impact of the riders referenced in the table above.

The significant factor impacting the decrease in operating expenses during 2019, compared with 2018, was a $23.2 million decrease in natural gas maintenance costs related to our Illinois utilities’ distribution systems.

This decrease in operating expenses was partially offset by:

•

An $11.0 million increase in depreciation and amortization, primarily driven by PGL's continued capital investment in the SMP project.

•

An $8.4 million increase in benefit costs, primarily related to higher deferred compensation costs in 2019.

Other States Segment Contribution to Operating Income

Since the majority of MERC and MGU customers use natural gas for heating, operating income is sensitive to weather and is generally higher during the winter months.

The following table shows a breakdown of other operation and maintenance:

*

Regulatory amortizations and other pass through expenses are substantially offset in margins and therefore do not have a significant impact on operating income.

The following tables provide information on delivered volumes by customer class and weather statistics:

*

Normal heating degree days for MERC and MGU are based on a 20-year moving average and 15-year moving average, respectively, of monthly temperatures from various weather stations throughout their respective territories.


Compared with


Natural Gas Utility Margins

Natural gas utility margins increased $3.1 million during


, compared with


. The increase was primarily driven by higher sales volumes as a result of colder weather and customer growth, as well as capital investment in natural gas utility infrastructure. MERC began recognizing revenue under its new GUIC rider in the second quarter of 2019. The GUIC rider allows MERC to recover previously

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


approved GUIC that were incurred to replace or modify natural gas facilities to the extent the work was required by state, federal, or other government agencies and exceed the costs included in base rates. These increases were partially offset by volumetric bill credits MGU is required to provide customers under a MPUC order addressing the effects of the Tax Legislation to return tax savings from the ruling. See

Note 15, Income Taxes

, and

Note 25, Regulatory Environment

, for more information.

Operating Income

Operating income at the other states segment decreased $3.5 million during


, compared with


. The decrease was driven by a $6.6 million increase in operating expenses (which include other operation and maintenance, depreciation and amortization, and property and revenue taxes) partially offset by the increase in margins discussed above. The increase in operating expenses was partially driven by lower property and revenue taxes in 2018 resulting from a favorable judgment that MERC received related to a property tax matter. Because property taxes were under-recovered from rate payers in prior years, MERC received $4.8 million of the judgment, with the remaining amount being passed back to customers through the property tax tracker. The increase was also driven by a $2.1 million positive impact on 2018 depreciation and amortization expense from a depreciation study approved by the MPUC in the second quarter of 2018. These rates were effective retroactively to January 2017.

Non-Utility Energy Infrastructure Segment Contribution to Operating Income


Compared with


Operating income at the non-utility energy infrastructure segment increased

$0.8 million

during


, compared with


. Operating income at We Power increased $4.8 million, driven by higher revenues in connection with capital additions to the plants We Power owns and leases to WE. Higher operating income at We Power was partially offset by operating losses at the Upstream and Bishop Hill III wind generation facilities. The majority of earnings from our ownership interests in wind generation facilities come in the form of wind production tax credits, and are recognized as an offset to income tax expense. For more information on Upstream and Bishop Hill III, see

Note 2, Acquisitions

.

Corporate and Other Segment Contribution to Operating Income


Compared with


The operating loss at the corporate and other segment increased

$12.2 million

during


, compared with


, primarily driven by the transfer of assets from WBS, our centralized services company, to our regulated utilities in 2018. As a result of these transfers, the return on these assets is now recognized within our regulated utility operations. Also contributing to the increase in operating loss was a gain recorded in the third quarter of 2018 that related to a previous sale of a legacy business.

Electric Transmission Segment Operations


Compared with


Earnings from our electric transmission segment operations, primarily related to our investment in ATC, decreased

$9.1 million

during


, compared with


. A $19.3 million decrease in ATC's earnings was the result of a FERC order issued in November 2019 that addressed complaints related to ATC's allowed ROE. Increased earnings from continued capital investment partially offset the negative impact from the FERC order.

Consolidated Other Income, Net


Compared with


Other income, net increased

$31.9 million

during


, compared with


. An increase of

$23.0 million

was due to net gains from investments held in the Integrys rabbi trust during 2019, compared with net losses during 2018. These investment gains partially offset benefits costs related to deferred compensation, which are included in other operation and maintenance expense.

See Note 16, Fair Value Measurements, for more information

on our investments held in the Integrys rabbi trust. Also contributing to the increase was

$10.2 million

of higher net credits from the non-service components of our net periodic pension and OPEB costs.

See Note 19, Employee Benefits, for more information

on our benefit costs.

Consolidated Interest Expense


Compared with


Interest expense increased

$56.4 million

during


, compared with


. The increase was primarily due to higher long-term debt balances. This increase in debt balances was primarily related to continued capital investments.

Consolidated Income Tax Expense


Compared with


Our effective tax rate was 9.9% in 2019, compared to 13.8% in 2018. The 3.9% decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in wind production tax credits related to acquisitions of ownership interests in wind generation facilities in our non-utility energy infrastructure segment, the impact of the 2018 PSCW order regarding the benefits associated with the Tax Legislation, and the increased benefit from the flow through of tax repairs in connection with the 2017 Wisconsin rate settlement. The impacts from the 2018 PSCW order related to the Tax Legislation and the flow through of tax repairs were offset in operating income at the Wisconsin segment. See

Note 2, Acquisitions

,

Note 15, Income Taxes

, and

Note 25, Regulatory Environment

, for more information.

We expect our 2020 annual effective tax rate to be between 16% and 17%, which includes an estimated 4% effective tax rate benefit due to the amortization of unprotected excess deferred taxes in connection with the 2019 Wisconsin rate orders. Excluding this estimated effective tax rate benefit, the expected 2020 range would be between 20% and 21%.

Capital Resources and Requirements

Capital Resources

Liquidity

We anticipate meeting our capital requirements for our existing operations through internally generated funds and short-term borrowings, supplemented by the issuance of intermediate or long-term debt securities, depending on market conditions and other factors.

We currently have access to the capital markets and have been able to generate funds both internally and externally to meet our capital requirements. Our ability to attract the necessary financial capital at reasonable terms is critical to our overall strategic plan. We currently believe that we have adequate capacity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future through our existing borrowing arrangements, access to capital markets, and internally generated cash.

WEC Energy Group, WE, WPS, WG, and PGL maintain bank back-up credit facilities, which provide liquidity support for each company's obligations with respect to commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. We review our bank back-up credit facility needs on an ongoing basis and expect to be able to maintain adequate credit facilities to support our operations. See

Note 12, Short-Term Debt and Lines of Credit

, for more information about these credit facilities.

The following table shows our capitalization structure as of

December 31, 2019

and


, as well as an adjusted capitalization structure that we believe is consistent with how a majority of the rating agencies currently view our 2007 Junior Notes:

Included in long-term debt on our balance sheets as of

December 31, 2019

and


, is $500.0 million principal amount of 2007 Junior Notes. The adjusted presentation attributes $250.0 million of the 2007 Junior Notes to common equity and $250.0 million to long-term debt.

The adjusted presentation of our consolidated capitalization structure is included as a complement to our capitalization structure presented in accordance with GAAP. Management evaluates and manages our capitalization structure, including our total debt to total capitalization ratio, using the GAAP calculation as adjusted to reflect the treatment of the 2007 Junior Notes by the majority of rating agencies. Therefore, we believe the non-GAAP adjusted presentation reflecting this treatment is useful and relevant to investors in understanding how management and the rating agencies evaluate our capitalization structure.

For a summary of the interest rates, maturity, and amounts of long-term debt outstanding on a consolidated basis, see

Note 13, Long-Term Debt

.

As described in

Note 10, Common Equity

, certain restrictions exist on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us. We do not expect these restrictions to have any material effect on our operations or ability to meet our cash obligations.

At

December 31, 2019

, we were in compliance with all covenants related to outstanding short-term and long-term debt. We expect to be in compliance with all such debt covenants for the foreseeable future. See

Note 12, Short-Term Debt and Lines of Credit

, and

Note 13, Long-Term Debt

, for more information.

Working Capital

As of

December 31, 2019

, our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by

$1,089.1 million

. We do not expect this to have any impact on our liquidity since we believe we have adequate back-up lines of credit in place for our ongoing operations. We also believe that we can access the capital markets to finance our construction programs and to refinance current maturities of long-term debt, if necessary.

Credit Rating Risk

We do not have any credit agreements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. However, we have certain agreements in the form of commodity contracts and employee benefit plans that could require collateral or a termination payment in the event of a credit rating change to below BBB- at S&P Global Ratings and/or Baa3 at Moody's Investors Service. We also have other commodity contracts that, in the event of a credit rating downgrade, could result in a reduction of our unsecured credit granted by counterparties.

In addition, access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality. Any credit ratings downgrade could impact our ability to access capital markets.

In November 2019, Moody's downgraded the ratings of WG senior unsecured debt to A3 from A2 and WG commercial paper to P-2 from P-1. The change in ratings has not had, and we do not believe that it will have, a material impact on our ability to access capital. Moody's changed the rating outlook for WG to stable from negative.

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


Subject to other factors affecting the credit markets as a whole, we believe our current ratings should provide a significant degree of flexibility in obtaining funds on competitive terms. However, these security ratings reflect the views of the rating agency only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from the rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency.

If we are unable to successfully take actions to manage any additional adverse impacts of the Tax Legislation, or if additional interpretations, regulations, amendments or technical corrections exacerbate the adverse impacts of the Tax Legislation, the legislation could result in credit rating agencies placing our or our subsidiaries’ credit ratings on negative outlook or additional downgrading of our or our subsidiaries' credit ratings. Any such actions by credit rating agencies may make it more difficult and costly for us and our subsidiaries to issue future debt securities and certain other types of financing and could increase borrowing costs under our and our subsidiaries’ credit facilities.

Obligations for utility operations have historically been included as part of the rate-making process and therefore are generally recoverable from customers.

Significant Capital Projects

We have several capital projects that will require significant capital expenditures over the next three years and beyond. All projected capital requirements are subject to periodic review and may vary significantly from estimates, depending on a number of factors. These factors include environmental requirements, regulatory restraints and requirements, impacts from the Tax Legislation, additional changes in tax laws and regulations, acquisition and development opportunities, market volatility, and economic trends. Our estimated capital expenditures and acquisitions for the next three years are as follows:

WE, WPS, and WG continue to upgrade their electric and natural gas distribution systems to enhance reliability. These upgrades include the AMI program. AMI is an integrated system of smart meters, communication networks, and data management systems that enable two-way communication between utilities and customers.

WPS is also continuing work on the System Modernization and Reliability Project. This project includes modernizing parts of its electric distribution system, including burying or upgrading lines. The project focuses on constructing facilities to improve the reliability of electric service WPS provides to its customers. WPS expects to invest approximately $100 million between 2020 and 2022 on this project.

As part of our commitment to invest in zero-carbon generation, we have either filed for or received approval to invest in 300 MW of utility-scale solar within our Wisconsin segment. WPS has partnered with an unaffiliated utility to construct two solar projects in Wisconsin. Badger Hollow I is located in Iowa County, Wisconsin, and Two Creeks is located in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin. Once constructed, WPS will own 100 MW of the output of each project for a total of 200 MW. WPS's share of the cost of both projects is estimated to be $256 million. Construction began at Two Creeks and Badger Hollow I in August 2019 and October 2019, respectively. Commercial operation of both projects is targeted for the end of 2020. WE has partnered with an unaffiliated utility to acquire an ownership interest in a proposed solar project, Badger Hollow II, that will be located in Iowa County, Wisconsin. At its meeting on February 20, 2020, the PSCW approved the acquisition of this project. The approval is still subject to WE's receipt and review of a final written order from the PSCW. Once constructed, WE will own 100 MW of the output of this project. WE's share of the cost of this project is estimated to be $130 million. Commercial operation of Badger Hollow II is targeted for the end of 2021. Solar generation technology has greatly improved, has become more cost-effective, and it complements our summer demand curve.

WE and WG each plan to construct their own LNG facility. Subject to PSCW approval, each facility would provide approximately one billion cubic feet of natural gas supply to meet anticipated peak demand without requiring the construction of additional interstate pipeline capacity. These facilities are expected to reduce the likelihood of constraints on WE's and WG's natural gas systems during the highest demand days of winter. The total cost of both projects is estimated to be approximately $370 million, with approximately half being invested by each utility. Commercial operation of the LNG facilities is targeted for the end of 2023.

PGL is continuing work on the SMP, a project under which PGL is replacing approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago's aging natural gas pipeline infrastructure. PGL currently recovers these costs through a surcharge on customer bills pursuant to an ICC approved QIP rider, which is in effect through 2023. PGL's projected average annual investment through 2022 is between $280 million and $300 million.

See Note 25, Regulatory Environment, for more information

on the SMP.

The non-utility energy infrastructure segment line item in the table above includes WECI's planned investment in Thunderhead and Blooming Grove.

See Note 2, Acquisitions, for more information

on these wind projects.

We expect to provide total capital contributions to ATC (not included in the above table) of approximately $90 million from 2020 through 2022. We do not expect to make any contributions to ATC Holdco during that period.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We are a party to various financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk as a part of our normal course of business, including financial guarantees and letters of credit that support construction projects, commodity contracts, and other payment obligations. We believe that these agreements do not have, and are not reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.

FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Market Risks and Other Significant Risks

We are exposed to market and other significant risks as a result of the nature of our businesses and the environments in which those businesses operate. These risks, described in further detail below, include but are not limited to:

Regulatory Recovery

Our utilities account for their regulated operations in accordance with accounting guidance under the Regulated Operations Topic of the FASB ASC. Our rates are determined by various regulatory commissions. See Item 1. Business – E. Regulation for more information on these commissions.

Regulated entities are allowed to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense if the regulated entity believes the recovery of those costs is probable. We record regulatory assets pursuant to specific orders or by a generic order issued by our regulators. Recovery of the deferred costs in future rates is subject to the review and approval by those regulators. We assume the risks and benefits of ultimate recovery of these items in future rates. If the recovery of the deferred costs, including those referenced below, is not approved by our regulators, the costs would be charged to income in the current period. In general, our regulatory assets are recovered over a period of between one to twenty years. Regulators can impose liabilities on a prospective basis for amounts previously collected from customers and for amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers. We record these items as regulatory liabilities. As of

December 31, 2019

, our regulatory assets were

$3,527.6 million

, and our regulatory liabilities were

$4,080.4 million

.

Due to the Tax Legislation, our regulated utilities remeasured their deferred taxes and recorded a tax benefit of $2,529 million. Our utilities have been returning this tax benefit to ratepayers through refunds, bill credits, riders, and reductions to other regulatory assets, which we expect to continue. See

Note 15, Income Taxes

, and

Note 25, Regulatory Environment

, for more information.

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


We expect to request or have requested recovery of the costs related to the following projects discussed in recent or pending rate proceedings, orders, and investigations involving our utilities:

•

Prior to its acquisition by us, Integrys initiated an information technology project with the goal of improving the customer experience at its subsidiaries. Specifically, the project is expected to provide functional and technological benefits to the billing, call center, and credit collection functions. As of

December 31, 2019

, we had not received any significant disallowances of the costs incurred for this project. WPS received approval to recover these costs in the rate order it received from the PSCW in December 2019. See

Note 25, Regulatory Environment

, for more information.

•

In January 2014, the ICC approved PGL's use of the QIP rider as a recovery mechanism for costs incurred related to investments in QIP. This rider is subject to an annual reconciliation whereby costs are reviewed for accuracy and prudency. In March 2019, PGL filed its 2018 reconciliation with the ICC, which, along with the 2017 and 2016 reconciliations, are still pending. In July 2019, the ICC approved a settlement of the 2015 reconciliation, which includes a rate base reduction of $7.0 million and a $7.3 million refund to ratepayers. As of December 31, 2019, all amounts had been refunded to customers. As of December 31, 2019, there can be no assurance that all costs incurred under the QIP rider during the open reconciliation years will be deemed recoverable by the ICC.

See

Note 25, Regulatory Environment

, for more information regarding recent and pending rate proceedings, orders, and investigations involving our utilities.

Commodity Costs

In the normal course of providing energy, we are subject to market fluctuations in the costs of coal, natural gas, purchased power, and fuel oil used in the delivery of coal. We manage our fuel and natural gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long-term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, natural gas, and fuel oil. In addition, we manage the risk of price volatility through natural gas and electric hedging programs.

Embedded within our utilities' rates are amounts to recover fuel, natural gas, and purchased power costs. Our utilities have recovery mechanisms in place that allow them to recover or refund all or a portion of the changes in prudently incurred fuel, natural gas, and purchased power costs from rate case-approved amounts. See Item 1. Business – E. Regulation for more information on these mechanisms.

Higher commodity costs can increase our working capital requirements, result in higher gross receipts taxes, and lead to increased energy efficiency investments by our customers to reduce utility usage and/or fuel substitution. Higher commodity costs combined with slower economic conditions also expose us to greater risks of accounts receivable write-offs as more customers are unable to pay their bills.

See Note 1(d), Operating Revenues, for more information

on riders and other mechanisms that allow for cost recovery or refund of uncollectible expense.

Weather

Our utilities' rates are based upon estimated normal temperatures. Our electric utility margins are unfavorably sensitive to below normal temperatures during the summer cooling season and, to some extent, to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. Our natural gas utility margins are unfavorably sensitive to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. PGL, NSG, and MERC have decoupling mechanisms in place that help reduce the impacts of weather. Decoupling mechanisms differ by state and allow utilities to recover or refund certain differences between actual and authorized margins. A summary of actual weather information in our utilities' service territories during


and


, as measured by degree days, may be found in Results of Operations.

Interest Rates

We are exposed to interest rate risk resulting from our short-term and long-term borrowings and projected near-term debt financing needs. We manage exposure to interest rate risk by limiting the amount of our variable rate obligations and continually monitoring the effects of market changes on interest rates. When it is advantageous to do so, we enter into long-term fixed rate debt. We may also enter into derivative financial instruments, such as swaps, to mitigate interest rate exposure.

Based on the variable rate debt outstanding at

December 31, 2019

, and

December 31, 2018

and


, respectively. This sensitivity analysis was performed assuming a constant level of variable rate debt during the period and an immediate increase in interest rates, with no other changes for the remainder of the period.

Marketable Securities Return

We use various trusts to fund our pension and OPEB obligations. These trusts invest in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market prices of these assets can affect future pension and OPEB expenses. Additionally, future contributions can also be affected by the investment returns on trust fund assets. We believe that the financial risks associated with investment returns would be partially mitigated through future rate actions by our various utility regulators.

The fair value of our trust fund assets and expected long-term returns were approximately:

Fiduciary oversight of the pension and OPEB trust fund investments is the responsibility of an Investment Trust Policy Committee. The Committee works with external actuaries and investment consultants on an ongoing basis to establish and monitor investment strategies and target asset allocations. Forecasted cash flows for plan liabilities are regularly updated based on annual valuation results. Target asset allocations are determined utilizing projected benefit payment cash flows and risk analyses of appropriate investments. The targeted asset allocations are intended to reduce risk, provide long-term financial stability for the plans, and maintain funded levels which meet long-term plan obligations while preserving sufficient liquidity for near-term benefit payments. Investment strategies utilize a wide diversification of asset types and qualified external investment managers.

We consult with our investment advisors on an annual basis to help us forecast expected long-term returns on plan assets by reviewing actual historical returns and calculating expected total trust returns using the weighted-average of long-term market returns for each of the major target asset categories utilized in the funds.

Economic Conditions

We have electric and natural gas utility operations that serve customers in Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota, and Michigan. As such, we are exposed to market risks in the regional Midwest economy. In addition, any economic downturn or disruption of national or international markets could adversely affect the financial condition of our customers and demand for their products, which could affect their demand for our products.

Inflation

We continue to monitor the impact of inflation, especially with respect to the costs of medical plans, fuel, transmission access, construction costs, and regulatory and environmental compliance in order to minimize its effects in future years through pricing strategies, productivity improvements, and cost reductions. We do not believe the impact of general inflation will have a material impact on our future results of operations.

For additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information at the beginning of this report and Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Competitive Markets

Electric Utility Industry

The FERC supports large RTOs, which directly impacts the structure of the wholesale electric market. Due to the FERC's support of RTOs, MISO uses the MISO Energy Markets to carry out its operations, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. It is uncertain when, if at all, retail choice might be implemented in Wisconsin. However, Michigan has adopted a limited retail choice program.

Wisconsin

Electric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date.

Michigan

Under Michigan law, our retail customers may choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. As a result, some of our small retail customers have switched to an alternative electric supplier. At

December 31, 2019

, Michigan law limited customer choice to 10% of an electric utility's Michigan retail load, but this cap could potentially be reduced in future years due to the December 2016 passage of Michigan Act 341. Based on current law, our iron ore mine customer, Tilden, is exempt from the 10% cap. In addition, certain load increases by facilities already using an alternative electric supplier can still be serviced by their alternative electric supplier, when various conditions exist, even if the cap has already been met. When a customer switches to an alternative electric supplier, we continue to provide distribution and customer service functions for the customer.

Natural Gas Utility Industry

We offer natural gas transportation services to our customers that elect to purchase natural gas directly from a third-party supplier. Since these transportation customers continue to use our distribution systems to transport natural gas to their facilities, we earn distribution revenues from them. As such, the loss of revenue associated with the cost of natural gas that our transportation customers purchase from third-party suppliers has little impact on our net income, as it is offset by an equal reduction to natural gas costs.

Wisconsin

Our Wisconsin utilities offer both natural gas transportation service and interruptible natural gas sales to enable customers to better manage their energy costs. Customers continue to switch between firm system supply, interruptible system supply, and transportation service each year as the economics and service options change. Due to the PSCW's previous proceedings on natural gas industry regulation in a competitive environment, the PSCW currently provides all Wisconsin customer classes with competitive markets the option to choose a third-party natural gas supplier. All of our Wisconsin customer classes have competitive market choices and, therefore, can purchase natural gas directly from either a third-party supplier or their local natural gas utility. Since third-party suppliers can be used in Wisconsin, the PSCW has also adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its natural gas marketing affiliates. We are currently unable to predict the impact, if any, of potential future industry restructuring on our results of operations or financial position.

Illinois

Absent extraordinary circumstances, potential competitors are not allowed to construct competing natural gas distribution systems in the service territories for PGL and NSG. A charter from the state of Illinois gives PGL the right to provide natural gas distribution service in the city of Chicago as a public utility. Further, the "first in the field" and public interest standards limit the ability of potential competitors to operate in an existing utility service territory. In addition, we believe it would be impractical to construct competing duplicate distribution facilities due to the high cost of installation.

Since 2002, PGL and NSG have, under ICC-approved tariffs, provided their customers with the option to choose a third-party natural gas supplier. There are no state laws requiring PGL and NSG to make this choice option available to customers, but since this option is currently provided to our Illinois customers under tariff, we would need ICC approval to eliminate it.

An interstate pipeline may seek to provide transportation service directly to our Illinois end users, which would bypass our natural gas transportation service. However, PGL and NSG have bypass rates approved by the ICC, which allow them to negotiate rates with customers that are potential bypass candidates to help ensure that such customers continue to use their transportation service.

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


Minnesota

Natural gas utilities in the state of Minnesota do not have exclusive franchise service territories and, as a matter of law and policy, natural gas utilities may compete for new customers. However, natural gas utilities have customarily avoided competing for existing customers of other utilities, as there would be duplicative utility facilities and/or increased costs to customers. If this approach were to change, it could lead to a greater level of competition amongst utilities to obtain customers.

MERC offers both natural gas transportation service and interruptible natural gas sales to enable customers to better manage their energy costs. Customers continue to switch between firm system supply, interruptible system supply, and transportation service each year as the economics and service options change. MERC has provided its commercial and industrial customers with the option to choose a third-party natural gas supplier since 2006. We are not required by the MPUC or state law to make this choice option available to customers, but since this option is currently provided to our Minnesota commercial and industrial customers, we would need MPUC approval to eliminate it.

Michigan

The option to choose a third-party natural gas supplier has been provided to UMERC’s customers (formerly WPS’s Michigan customers) since the late 1990s and MGU's customers since 2005. We are not required by the MPSC or state law to make this choice option available to customers, but since this option is currently provided to our Michigan customers, we would need MPSC approval to eliminate it.

Environmental Matters

See

Note 23, Commitments and Contingencies

, for a discussion of certain environmental matters affecting us, including rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, land quality, and climate change.

Other Matters

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017

In December 2017, the Tax Legislation was signed into law. In 2018 and 2019, the PSCW and the MPSC issued written orders regarding how to refund certain tax savings from the Tax Legislation to our ratepayers in Wisconsin and Michigan, respectively. The various remaining impacts of the Tax Legislation on our Wisconsin operations were addressed in our recent rate orders issued by the PSCW in December 2019. In addition, the ICC approved the VITA in Illinois during April 2018, and, in Minnesota, the MPUC included the various impacts of the Tax Legislation in MERC's final 2018 rate order.

In July 2019, the FERC approved WPS's revised formula rate tariff, which incorporated the impacts of the Tax Legislation. We are also working with the FERC to modify WE's formula rate tariff for the impacts of the Tax Legislation, and we expect to receive FERC approval for WE's modified tariff in 2020.

American Transmission Company Allowed Return on Equity Complaints

On November 21, 2019, the FERC issued an order (November 2019 Order) related to the methodology used to calculate the base ROE for all MISO transmission owners, including ATC. Based on this order, the FERC has expanded its base ROE methodology to include the capital-asset pricing model in addition to the discounted cash flow model to better reflect how investors make their investment decisions. The FERC's modified methodology will reduce the base ROE that ATC is allowed to collect on a going-forward basis, as discussed below. Various parties have requested a rehearing by the FERC of the November 2019 Order in its entirety.

First Return on Equity Complaint

In November 2013, a group of MISO industrial customer organizations filed a complaint with the FERC requesting to reduce the base ROE used by MISO transmission owners, including ATC, from 12.2% to 9.15%. In September 2016, the FERC issued an order requiring MISO transmission owners to collect a reduced base ROE of 10.32%, as well as the 0.5% incentive adder approved by the FERC in January 2015 for MISO transmission owners. The FERC then issued the November 2019 Order after directing MISO transmission owners and other stakeholders to provide briefs and comments on a proposed change to the methodology for calculating base ROE. The November 2019 Order further reduced the base ROE for all MISO transmission owners, including ATC, to 9.88%, effective as of

2019 Form 10-K

September 28, 2016 and prospectively. The November 2019 Order also continued to allow the collection of the 0.5% ROE incentive adder, which only applies to revenues collected after January 6, 2015. In addition, ATC is required to provide refunds, with interest, for the 15-month refund period from November 12, 2013 through February 11, 2015 and for the period from September 28, 2016 through November 21, 2019. As a result, ATC will provide WE and WPS with refunds related to the transmission costs they paid during the two refund periods, and these refunds will be applied to WE's and WPS's PSCW-approved escrow accounting for transmission expense.

Second Return on Equity Complaint

In February 2015, a second complaint was filed with the FERC requesting a reduction in the base ROE used by MISO transmission owners, including ATC, to 8.67%, with a refund effective date retroactive to February 12, 2015. The FERC also addressed this second complaint in the November 2019 Order. Similar to the first complaint, the November 2019 Order stated that the base ROE of 9.88% and the 0.5% incentive adder were reasonable for the period covered by the second complaint, February 12, 2015 through May 10, 2016. However, in its order, the FERC relied on certain provisions of the Federal Power Act to dismiss the second complaint and to determine that refunds were not allowed for this period. Refunds could still be required, however, for the second complaint period depending on the outcome of numerous rehearing requests filed with the FERC. Therefore, our financials continue to reflect a liability of $41.9 million resulting in reduced equity earnings from ATC. This liability reflects a 10.38% ROE for the second complaint period. If it is ultimately determined that a refund is required for the second complaint period, we would not expect any such refund to have a material impact on our financial statements or results of operations in the future. In addition, WE and WPS would be entitled to receive a portion of the refund from ATC for the benefit of their customers.

Bonus Depreciation Provisions

Bonus depreciation is an additional amount of first-year tax deductible depreciation that is awarded above what would normally be available. The bonus depreciation deduction available for public utility property subject to rate-making by a government entity or public utility commission was modified by the Tax Legislation. Based on the provisions of the Tax Legislation, bonus depreciation can no longer be deducted for public utility property acquired and placed in service after December 31, 2017. The provisions of the Tax Legislation regarding the repeal of bonus depreciation do not apply to some of our non-utility investments.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges, and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.

The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments.

Regulatory Accounting

Our utility operations follow the guidance under the Regulated Operations Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 980). Our financial statements reflect the effects of the rate-making principles followed by the various jurisdictions regulating us. Certain items that would otherwise be immediately recognized as revenues and expenses are deferred as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers, as authorized by our regulators.

Future recovery of regulatory assets, including the timeliness of recovery and our ability to earn a reasonable return, is not assured and is generally subject to review by regulators in rate proceedings for matters such as prudence and reasonableness. Once approved, the regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into earnings over the rate recovery or refund period. If recovery or refund of costs is not approved or is no longer considered probable, these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in current period earnings. Management regularly assesses whether these regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as changes in the regulatory environment, earnings from our electric and natural gas utility operations, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation.

WEC Energy Group, Inc.


The application of the Regulated Operations Topic of the FASB ASC would be discontinued if all or a separable portion of our utility operations no longer met the criteria for application. Our regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off to income as an unusual or infrequently occurring item in the period in which discontinuation occurred.

As of

December 31, 2019

, we had

$3,527.6 million

in regulatory assets and

$4,080.4 million

in regulatory liabilities.

Goodwill

We completed our annual goodwill impairment tests for all of our reporting units that carried a goodwill balance as of July 1, 2019. No impairments were recorded as a result of these tests. For all of our reporting units, the fair values calculated in step one of the test were greater than their carrying values. The fair values for the reporting units were calculated using a combination of the income approach and the market approach.

For the income approach, we used internal forecasts to project cash flows. Any forecast contains a degree of uncertainty, and changes in these cash flows could significantly increase or decrease the calculated fair value of a reporting unit. Since all of our reporting units are regulated, a fair recovery of and return on costs prudently incurred to serve customers is assumed. An unfavorable outcome in a rate case could cause the fair values of our reporting units to decrease.

Key assumptions used in the income approach include ROEs, the long-term growth rates used to determine terminal values at the end of the discrete forecast period, and the discount rates. The discount rate is applied to estimated future cash flows and is one of the most significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the income approach. As interest rates rise, the calculated fair values will decrease. The discount rate is based on the weighted-average cost of capital for each reporting unit, taking into account both the after-tax cost of debt and cost of equity. The terminal year ROE for each utility is driven by its current allowed ROE. The terminal growth rate is based primarily on a combination of historical and forecasted statistics for real gross domestic product and personal income for each utility service area.

For the market approach, we used an equal weighting of the guideline public company method and the guideline merged and acquired company method. The guideline public company method uses financial metrics from similar publicly traded companies to determine fair value. The guideline merged and acquired company method calculates fair value by analyzing the actual prices paid for recent mergers and acquisitions in the industry. We applied multiples derived from these two methods to the appropriate operating metrics for our reporting units to determine fair value.

The underlying assumptions and estimates used in the impairment tests were made as of a point in time. Subsequent changes in these assumptions and estimates could change the results of the tests.

For each of our reporting units, the fair value exceeded its carrying value by over 50%. Based on these results, our reporting units are not at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test.

Our reporting units had the following goodwill balances at July 1, 2019:

See Note 9, Goodwill, for more information

.

Long-Lived Assets

In accordance with ASC 980-360, Regulated Operations – Property, Plant, and Equipment, we periodically assess the recoverability of certain long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those long-lived assets may not be recoverable. Examples of events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the market price, a significant change in use, adverse legal factors or a change in business climate, operating or cash flow losses, or an

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


expectation that the asset might be sold. These assessments require significant assumptions and judgments by management. Long-lived assets that would be subject to an impairment assessment would generally include any assets within regulated operations that may not be fully recovered from our customers as a result of regulatory decisions that will be made in the future, and assets within nonregulated operations that are proposed to be sold or are currently generating operating losses.

In accordance with ASC 980-360, when it becomes probable that a generating unit will be retired before the end of its useful life, we assess whether the generating unit meets the criteria for abandonment accounting. Generating units that are considered probable of abandonment are expected to cease operations in the near term, significantly before the end of their original estimated useful lives. As a result, the remaining net book value of these assets can be significant. If a generating unit meets applicable criteria to be considered probable of abandonment, and the unit has been abandoned, we assess the likelihood of recovery of the remaining net book value of that generating unit at the end of each reporting period. If it becomes probable that regulators will disallow full recovery or a return on the remaining net book value of a generating unit that is either abandoned or probable of being abandoned, an impairment loss may be required. An impairment loss would be recorded if the remaining net book value of the generating unit is greater than the present value of the amount expected to be recovered from ratepayers.

Pleasant Prairie power plant, Pulliam Units 7 and 8, and the jointly-owned Edgewater 4 generating unit were retired during 2018. PIPP was retired during 2019. Effective with the rate orders issued by the PSCW in December 2019, WE and WPS received approval to collect a return of and on the entire net book value of the retired generating units, excluding Pleasant Prairie power plant. WE will collect a full return of and on all but $100 million of the net book value of the Pleasant Prairie power plant. In accordance with its PSCW rate order received in December 2019, WE will seek a financing order from the PSCW to securitize the remaining $100 million. See

Note 6, Property, Plant, and Equipment

, and

Note 25, Regulatory Environment

, for more information on our retired generating units, including various approvals we received from the FERC and the PSCW.

Pension and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits

The costs of providing non-contributory defined pension benefits and OPEB, described in

Note 19, Employee Benefits

, are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience.

Pension and OPEB costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels, and employment periods), the level of contributions made to the plans, and earnings on plan assets. Pension and OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets, mortality and discount rates, and expected health care cost trends. Changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future pension and OPEB costs.

Pension and OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity and fixed income market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased benefit costs in future periods. We believe that such changes in costs would be recovered or refunded at our utilities through the rate-making process.

The following table shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the projected benefit obligation and the reported net periodic pension cost. Each factor below reflects an evaluation of the change based on a change in that assumption only.

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


The following table shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the accumulated OPEB obligation and the reported net periodic OPEB cost. Each factor below reflects an evaluation of the change based on a change in that assumption only.

The discount rates are selected based on hypothetical bond portfolios consisting of noncallable, high-quality corporate bonds across the full maturity spectrum. From the hypothetical bond portfolios, a single rate is determined that equates the market value of the bonds purchased to the discounted value of the plans' expected future benefit payments.

We establish our expected return on assets based on consideration of historical and projected asset class returns, as well as the target allocations of the benefit trust portfolios. The assumed long-term rate of return on pension plan assets was

7.12%

in


and


, and 7.11% in


. The actual rate of return on pension plan assets, net of fees, was 18.89%, (4.30)%, and 13.74%, in

, and

In selecting assumed health care cost trend rates, past performance and forecasts of health care costs are considered. For more information on health care cost trend rates and a table showing future payments that we expect to make for our pension and OPEB, see

Note 19, Employee Benefits

.

Unbilled Revenues

We record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses, and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during


of approximately

$7.4 billion

included accrued utility revenues of $478.8 million as of

December 31, 2019

.

Income Tax Expense

We are required to estimate income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements. This process involves estimating current income tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, for income tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our balance sheets. We also assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. To the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance, which is offset by an adjustment to income tax expense in our income statements.

Uncertainty associated with the application of tax statutes and regulations and the outcomes of tax audits and appeals requires that judgments and estimates be made in the accrual process and in the calculation of effective tax rates. Only income tax benefits that meet the "more likely than not" recognition threshold may be recognized or continue to be recognized. Unrecognized tax benefits are re-evaluated quarterly and changes are recorded based on new information, including the issuance of relevant guidance by the courts or tax authorities and developments occurring in the examinations of our tax returns.

Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred income tax assets and liabilities, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets. The assumptions involved are supported by historical data, reasonable projections, and interpretations of applicable tax laws and

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions. Significant changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. See

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

A. REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of WEC Energy Group, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of WEC Energy Group, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities – Impact of rate regulation on financial statements – Refer to Notes 5 and 25 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Company’s regulated utilities are subject to regulation by various state and federal regulatory bodies (collectively the “Commissions”) which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric and gas distribution companies in each respective state. Management has determined the Company meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the Regulated Operations Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standard Codification.

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the Company’s costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, the Company’s investment in the utility business. Regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investment, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. The Commissions’ regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. Certain items that would otherwise be immediately recognized as revenues and expenses are deferred as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers, as authorized by the Company’s regulators. Future decisions of the Commissions will impact the accounting for regulated operations, including decisions about the amount of allowable costs and return on invested capital included in rates, and any refunds that may be required.

While the Company has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment or (3) timely recovery of costs incurred. The Company had $3,528 million and $4,080 million of regulatory assets and liabilities, respectively, as of December 31, 2019.

We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Given that management’s accounting judgments can be based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following procedures, among others:

•

We tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over regulatory assets and liabilities, including management’s controls over the identification of costs recorded as regulatory assets and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates.

•

We inquired of Company management and read: (1) relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for the Company and other public utilities in each respective state, (2) company filings, (3) filings made by intervenors and (4) other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedence of the Commissions’ treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances.

•

For regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company’s filings with the Commissions and the filings with the Commissions by intervenors that may impact the Company’s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management’s assertions.

•

We obtained management’s analysis regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management’s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in rates.

•

We evaluated the Company’s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.

A. REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of WEC Energy Group, Inc.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of WEC Energy Group, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(a) Nature of Operations

—

WEC Energy Group serves approximately

1.6

million

electric customers and

2.9

million

natural gas customers, and owns approximately


%

of ATC.

As used in these notes, the term "financial statements" refers to the consolidated financial statements. This includes the income statements, statements of comprehensive income, balance sheets, statements of cash flows, and statements of equity, unless otherwise noted. On our financial statements, we consolidate our majority-owned subsidiaries and reflect noncontrolling interests for the portion of entities that we do not own as a component of consolidated equity separate from the equity attributable to our shareholders. The noncontrolling interests that we reported as equity on our balance sheet as of

December 31, 2019

related to the minority interests at Bishop Hill III, Coyote Ridge, and Upstream held by third parties.

Our financial statements include the accounts of WEC Energy Group, a diversified energy holding company, and the accounts of our subsidiaries in the following reportable segments:

•

Wisconsin segment – Consists of WE, WPS, and WG, which are engaged primarily in the generation of electricity and the distribution of electricity and natural gas in Wisconsin; and UMERC, which generates electricity and distributes electricity and natural gas to customers located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

•

Illinois segment – Consists of PGL and NSG, which are engaged primarily in the distribution of natural gas in Illinois.

•

Other states segment – Consists of MERC and MGU, which are engaged primarily in the distribution of natural gas in Minnesota and Michigan, respectively.

•

Electric transmission segment – Consists of our approximate


%

ownership interest in ATC, a for-profit, electric transmission company regulated by the FERC and certain state regulatory commissions, and our approximate


%

ownership interest in ATC Holdco, which invests in transmission-related projects outside of ATC's traditional footprint.

•

Non-utility energy infrastructure segment – Consists of We Power, which is principally engaged in the ownership of electric power generating facilities for long-term lease to WE, and Bluewater, which owns underground natural gas storage facilities in Michigan. WECI, which holds our ownership interests in several wind generating facilities, is also included in this segment.

See Note 2, Acquisitions, for more information

on Bluewater and the WECI wind generating facilities.

•

Corporate and other segment – Consists of the WEC Energy Group holding company, the Integrys holding company, the PELLC holding company, Wispark, Bostco, Wisvest, WECC, WBS, and PDL. In the first quarter of 2017, we sold substantially all of the remaining assets of Bostco, and, in October 2018, Bostco was dissolved. In 2019, we sold certain PDL solar power generating facilities.

See Note 3, Dispositions, for more information

on these sales.

Investments in companies not controlled by us, but over which we have significant influence regarding the operating and financial policies of the investee, are accounted for using the equity method. We use the cumulative earnings approach for classifying distributions received in the statements of cash flows. Under the cumulative earnings approach, we compare the distributions received to cumulative equity method earnings since inception. Any distributions received up to the amount of cumulative equity earnings are considered a return on investment and classified in operating activities. Any excess distributions are considered a return of investment and classified in investing activities.

Our financial statements also reflect our proportionate interests in certain jointly owned utility facilities.

See Note 7, Jointly Owned Utility Facilities, for more information

(b) Basis of Presentation

—

We prepare our financial statements in conformity with GAAP. We make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Revenues from Contracts with Customers

Electric Utility Operating Revenues

Electricity sales to residential and commercial and industrial customers are generally accomplished through requirements contracts, which provide for the delivery of as much electricity as the customer needs. These contracts represent discrete deliveries of electricity and consist of

one

distinct performance obligation satisfied over time, as the electricity is delivered and consumed by the customer simultaneously. For our Wisconsin residential and commercial and industrial customers and the majority of our Michigan residential and commercial and industrial customers, our performance obligation is bundled to consist of both the sale and the delivery of the electric commodity. In our Michigan service territory, a limited number of residential and commercial and industrial customers can purchase the commodity from a third party. In this case, the delivery of the electricity represents our sole performance obligation.

The transaction price of the performance obligations for residential and commercial and industrial customers is valued using the rates, charges, terms, and conditions of service included in the tariffs of our regulated electric utilities, which have been approved by state regulators. These rates often have a fixed component customer charge and a usage-based variable component charge. We recognize revenue for the fixed component customer charge monthly using a time-based output method. We recognize revenue for the usage-based variable component charge using an output method based on the quantity of electricity delivered each month. Our retail electric rates in Wisconsin include base amounts for fuel and purchased power costs, which also impact our revenues. The electric fuel rules set by the PSCW allow us to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, under- or over-collections of actual fuel and purchased power costs that exceed a


%

price variance from the costs included in the rates charged to customers. Our electric utilities monitor the deferral of under-collected costs to ensure that it does not cause them to earn a greater ROE than authorized by the PSCW. In contrast, the rates of our Michigan retail electric customers include recovery of fuel and purchased power costs on a one-for-one basis. In addition, the Wisconsin residential tariffs of WE and WPS include a mechanism for cost recovery or refund of uncollectible expense based on the difference between actual uncollectible write-offs and the amounts recovered in rates.

Wholesale customers who resell power can choose to either bundle capacity and electricity services together under

one

contract with a supplier or purchase capacity and electricity separately from multiple suppliers. Furthermore, wholesale customers can choose to have our utilities provide generation to match the customer's load, similar to requirements contracts, or they can purchase specified quantities of electricity and capacity. Contracts with wholesale customers that include capacity bundled with the delivery of electricity contain

two

performance obligations, as capacity and electricity are often transacted separately in the marketplace at the wholesale level. When recognizing revenue associated with these contracts, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Revenue is recognized as control of each individual component is transferred to the customer. Electricity is the primary product sold by our electric utilities and represents a single performance obligation satisfied over time through discrete deliveries to a customer. Revenue from electricity sales is generally recognized as units are produced and delivered to the customer within the production month. Capacity represents the reservation of an electric generating facility and conveys the ability to call on a plant to produce electricity when needed by the customer. The nature of our performance obligation as it relates to capacity is to stand ready to deliver power. This represents a single performance obligation transferred over time, which generally represents a monthly obligation. Accordingly, capacity revenue is recognized on a monthly basis.

The transaction price of the performance obligations for wholesale customers is valued using the rates, charges, terms, and conditions of service, which have been approved by the FERC. These wholesale rates include recovery of fuel and purchased power costs from customers on a one-for-one basis. For the majority of our wholesale customers, the price billed for energy and capacity is a formula-based rate. Formula-based rates initially set a customer's current year rates based on the previous year’s expenses. This is a predetermined formula derived from the utility's costs and a reasonable rate of return. Because these rates are eventually trued up to reflect actual, current-year costs, they represent a form of variable consideration in certain circumstances. The variable consideration is estimated and recognized over time as wholesale customers receive and consume the capacity and electricity services.

WEC Energy Group, Inc.


We are an active participant in the MISO Energy Markets, where we bid our generation into the Day Ahead and Real Time markets and procure electricity for our retail and wholesale customers at prices determined by the MISO Energy Markets. Purchase and sale transactions are recorded using settlement information provided by MISO. These purchase and sale transactions are accounted for on a net hourly position. Net purchases in a single hour are recorded as purchased power in cost of sales and net sales in a single hour are recorded as resale revenues on our income statements. For resale revenues, our performance obligation is created only when electricity is sold into the MISO Energy Markets.

For all of our customers, consistent with the timing of when we recognize revenue, customer billings generally occur on a monthly basis, with payments typically due in full within


days

.

Natural Gas Utility Operating Revenues

We recognize natural gas utility operating revenues under requirements contracts with residential, commercial and industrial, and transportation customers served under the tariffs of our regulated utilities. Tariffs provide our customers with the standard terms and conditions, including rates, related to the services offered. Requirements contracts provide for the delivery of as much natural gas as the customer needs. These requirements contracts represent discrete deliveries of natural gas and constitute a single performance obligation satisfied over time. Our performance obligation is both created and satisfied with the transfer of control of natural gas upon delivery to the customer. For most of our customers, natural gas is delivered and consumed by the customer simultaneously. A performance obligation can be bundled to consist of both the sale and the delivery of the natural gas commodity. In certain of our service territories, customers can purchase the commodity from a third party. In this case, the performance obligation only includes the delivery of the natural gas to the customer.

The transaction price of the performance obligations for our natural gas customers is valued using the rates, charges, terms, and conditions of service included in the tariffs of our regulated utilities, which have been approved by state regulators. These rates often have a fixed component customer charge and a usage-based variable component charge. We recognize revenue for the fixed component customer charge monthly using a time-based output method. We recognize revenue for the usage-based variable component charge using an output method based on natural gas delivered each month.

The tariffs of our natural gas utilities include various rate mechanisms that allow them to recover or refund changes in prudently incurred costs from rate case-approved amounts. The rates for all of our natural gas utilities include one-for-one recovery mechanisms for natural gas commodity costs. We defer any difference between actual natural gas costs incurred and costs recovered through rates as a current asset or liability. The deferred balance is returned to or recovered from customers at intervals throughout the year. In addition, the rates of PGL and NSG, and the residential tariffs of WE, WPS, and WG, include riders or other mechanisms for cost recovery or refund of uncollectible expense based on the difference between actual uncollectible write-offs and the amounts recovered in rates. The rates of PGL and NSG include riders for cost recovery of both environmental cleanup costs, energy conservation and management program costs, and income tax expense changes resulting from the Tax Legislation. Finally, PGL's rates include a cost recovery mechanism for SMP costs, and similarly, MERC's rates include a rider to recover costs incurred to replace or modify natural gas facilities.

Consistent with the timing of when we recognize revenue, customer billings generally occur on a monthly basis, with payments typically due in full within


days

.

Other Natural Gas Operating Revenues

We have other natural gas operating revenues from Bluewater, which is in our non-utility energy infrastructure segment. Bluewater has entered into long-term service agreements for natural gas storage services with WE, WPS, and WG, and provides service to several unaffiliated customers. All amounts associated with services from affiliates have been eliminated at the consolidated level.

Other Non-Utility Operating Revenues

As part of the construction of the We Power electric generating units, we capitalized interest during construction, which is included in property, plant, and equipment. As allowed by the PSCW, we collected these carrying costs from WE's utility customers during construction. The equity portion of these carrying costs was recorded as deferred revenue, and we continually amortize the deferred carrying costs to revenues over the life of the related lease term that We Power has with WE. During 2019 and 2018, we recorded

$

25.4

million

and

$

25.3

million

, respectively, of revenue related to these deferred carrying costs, which were included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of the period. This contract liability is presented as deferred revenue, net on our balance sheets.

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


Non-utility operating revenues are also derived from servicing appliances for customers at MERC. These contracts customarily have a duration of

one year

or less and consist of a single performance obligation satisfied over time. We use a time-based output method to recognize revenues monthly for the service fee.

Revenues from distributed renewable solar projects consist primarily of sales of renewable energy and SRECs generated by PDL. The sale of SRECs is a distinct performance obligation as they are often sold separately from the renewable energy generated. Although the performance obligation for the sale of renewable energy is recognized over time and the performance obligation for SRECs is recognized at a point-in-time, the timing of revenue recognition is the same, as the generation of renewable energy and sales of SREC's occur concurrently.

See Note 3, Dispositions, for more information

on the sale of certain of these solar facilities.

Wind generation revenues from WECI's ownership interests in wind generation facilities continued to grow with the acquisition of Upstream in January 2019.

See Note 2, Acquisitions, for more information

on Upstream, the December 2018 acquisition of Coyote Ridge, and other planned future acquisitions. Most of these wind generation facilities have offtake agreements with unaffiliated third parties for all of the energy to be produced by the facility. The contracts consist of

one

distinct performance obligation satisfied over time, as the electricity is delivered and consumed by the customer simultaneously. We recognize revenue as energy is produced and delivered to the customer within the production month. Upstream's revenue is substantially fixed over


years

through an agreement with an unaffiliated third party.

Other Operating Revenues

Alternative Revenues

Alternative revenues are created from programs authorized by regulators that allow our utilities to record additional revenues by adjusting rates in the future, usually as a surcharge applied to future billings, in response to past activities or completed events. Alternative revenue programs allow compensation for the effects of weather abnormalities, other external factors, or demand side management initiatives. Alternative revenue programs can also provide incentive awards if the utility achieves certain objectives and in other limited circumstances. We record alternative revenues when the regulator-specified conditions for recognition have been met. We reverse these alternative revenues as the customer is billed, at which time this revenue is presented as revenues from contracts with customers.

Below is a summary of the alternative revenue programs at our utilities:

•

The rates of PGL, NSG, and MERC include decoupling mechanisms. These mechanisms differ by state and allow the utilities to recover or refund the differences between actual and authorized margins for certain customer classes.

See Note 25, Regulatory Environment, for more information

.

•

MERC’s rates include a conservation improvement program rider, which includes a financial incentive for meeting energy savings goals.

•

WE and WPS provide wholesale electric service to customers under market-based rates and FERC formula rates. The customer is charged a base rate each year based upon a formula using prior year actual costs and customer demand. A true-up is calculated based on the difference between the amount billed to customers for the demand component of their rates and what the actual cost of service was for the year. The true-up can result in an amount that we will recover from or refund to the customer. We consider the true-up portion of the wholesale electric revenues to be alternative revenues.

(e) Materials, Supplies, and Inventories

—

Our inventory as of December 31 consisted of:

PGL and NSG price natural gas storage injections at the calendar year average of the costs of natural gas supply purchased. Withdrawals from storage are priced on the LIFO cost method. Inventories stated on a LIFO basis represented approximately


%

and


%

of total inventories at

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively. The estimated replacement cost of natural gas in inventory at

December 31, 2019

and


, exceeded the LIFO cost by

$

9.8

million

and

$

72.4

million

, respectively. In calculating these replacement amounts, PGL and NSG used a Chicago city-gate natural gas price per Dth of

$

Substantially all other materials and supplies, natural gas in storage, and fossil fuel inventories are recorded using the weighted-average cost method of accounting.

(f) Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

—

The economic effects of regulation can result in regulated companies recording costs and revenues that are allowed in the rate-making process in a period different from the period they would have been recognized by a nonregulated company. When this occurs, regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are recorded on the balance sheet. Regulatory assets represent deferred costs probable of recovery from customers that would have otherwise been charged to expense. Regulatory liabilities represent amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers in future rates or future costs already collected from customers in rates.

The recovery or refund of regulatory assets and liabilities is based on specific periods determined by our regulators or occurs over the normal operating period of the related assets and liabilities. If a previously recorded regulatory asset is no longer probable of recovery, the regulatory asset is reduced to the amount considered probable of recovery, and the reduction is charged to expense in the current period.

See Note 5, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, for more information

.

(g) Property, Plant, and Equipment

—

We record property, plant, and equipment at cost. Cost includes material, labor, overhead, and both debt and equity components of AFUDC. Additions to and significant replacements of property are charged to property, plant, and equipment at cost; minor items are charged to other operation and maintenance expense. The cost of depreciable utility property less salvage value is charged to accumulated depreciation when property is retired.

We record straight-line depreciation expense over the estimated useful life of utility property using depreciation rates approved by the applicable regulators.

Annual utility composite depreciation rates are shown below:

*

The 2018 rate reflects the impact of a new depreciation study approved by the MPUC in May 2018. The rates approved were effective retroactive to January 2017. An approximate

$

1.4

million

reduction in depreciation expense was recorded in 2018 related to this depreciation study.

We depreciate our We Power assets over the estimated useful life of the various property components. The components have useful lives of between


to


years for PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 and


to


years for ER 1 and ER 2.

We capitalize certain costs related to software developed or obtained for internal use and record these costs to amortization expense over the estimated useful life of the related software, which ranges from


to


years. If software is retired prior to being fully amortized, the difference is recorded as a loss on the income statement.

Third parties reimburse the utilities for all or a portion of expenditures for certain capital projects. Such contributions in aid of construction costs are recorded as a reduction to property, plant, and equipment.

See Note 6, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information

.

(h) Allowance for Funds Used During Construction

—

AFUDC is included in utility plant accounts and represents the cost of borrowed funds (AFUDC – Debt) used during plant construction, and a return on shareholders' capital (AFUDC – Equity) used for construction purposes. AFUDC – Debt is recorded as a reduction of interest expense, and AFUDC – Equity is recorded in other income, net.

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


The majority of AFUDC is recorded at WE, WPS, WBS, WG, and UMERC. Approximately


%

of WE's, WPS's, WG's, UMERC's, and WBS's retail jurisdictional CWIP expenditures are subject to the AFUDC calculation. The AFUDC calculation for WBS uses the WPS AFUDC retail rate, while our other utilities' AFUDC rates are determined by their respective state commissions, each with specific requirements. Based on these requirements, the other utilities did not record significant AFUDC for


,


, or


.

Average AFUDC rates are shown below:

Our regulated utilities and WBS recorded the following AFUDC for the years ended December 31:

(i) Cloud Computing Hosting Arrangements that are Service Contracts

—

We have entered into several cloud computing arrangements that are hosted service contracts as part of projects related to the continuous transformation of technology. These projects include, among other things, developing a centralized repository for data to improve analytics and reporting, targeted ERP systems, a project management tool, and a power generation employee scheduling system. We present prepaid hosting fees that are service contracts in either prepayments or other long-term assets on our balance sheets and amortize them as the hosting services are received. Amortization expense, as well as the fees associated with the hosting arrangements, is recorded in other operation and maintenance expense on our income statements.

As of January 1, 2020, we started capitalizing implementation costs related to cloud computing arrangements that are hosted service contracts. We will amortize the implementation costs on a straight-line basis over the cloud computing service arrangement term once the component of the hosted service is ready for its intended use. The presentation of these costs, along with the related amortization, will follow the prepaid hosting fees.

(j) Asset Impairment

—

Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to an annual impairment test. Interim impairment tests are performed when impairment indicators are present. Our reporting units containing goodwill perform annual goodwill impairment tests during the third quarter of each year. The carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill is considered not recoverable if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. An impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the carrying amount of the goodwill over its implied fair value.

See Note 9, Goodwill, for more information

. Intangible assets with definite lives are reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis.

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


We periodically assess the recoverability of certain long-lived assets when factors indicate the carrying value of such assets may be impaired or such assets are planned to be sold. These assessments require significant assumptions and judgments by management. The long-lived assets assessed for impairment generally include certain assets within regulated operations that may not be fully recovered from our customers as a result of regulatory decisions that will be made in the future, as well as assets within nonregulated operations that are proposed to be sold or are currently generating operating losses. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the asset. The carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. An impairment loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset in comparison to the fair value of the asset.

When it becomes probable that a generating unit will be retired before the end of its useful life, we assess whether the generating unit meets the criteria for abandonment accounting. Generating units that are considered probable of abandonment are expected to cease operations in the near term, significantly before the end of their original estimated useful lives. If a generating unit meets the applicable criteria to be considered probable of abandonment, and the unit has been abandoned, we assess the likelihood of recovery of the remaining net book value of that generating unit at the end of each reporting period. If it becomes probable that regulators will disallow full recovery as well as a return on the remaining net book value of a generating unit that is either abandoned or probable of being abandoned, an impairment loss may be required. An impairment loss would be recorded if the remaining net book value of the generating unit is greater than the present value of the amount expected to be recovered from ratepayers.

See Note 6, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information

.

The carrying amounts of equity method investments are assessed for impairment by comparing the fair values of these investments to their carrying amounts if a fair value assessment was completed or by reviewing for the presence of impairment indicators. If an impairment exists, and it is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the investment's fair value.

(k) Asset Retirement Obligations

—

We recognize, at fair value, legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development, and normal operation of the assets. An ARO liability is recorded, when incurred, for these obligations as long as the fair value can be reasonably estimated, even if the timing or method of settling the obligation is unknown. The associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and are depreciated over the useful life of the asset. The ARO liabilities are accreted each period using the credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates associated with the expected settlement dates of the AROs. These rates are determined when the obligations are incurred. Subsequent changes resulting from revisions to the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows are recognized as an increase or a decrease to the carrying amount of the liability and the associated capitalized retirement costs. For our regulated entities, we recognize regulatory assets or liabilities for the timing differences between when we recover an ARO in rates and when we recognize the associated retirement costs.

See Note 8, Asset Retirement Obligations, for more information

.

(l) Stock-Based Compensation

—

In accordance with the shareholder approved Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan, we provide long-term incentives through our equity interests to our non-employee directors, officers, and other key employees. The plan provides for the granting of stock options, restricted stock, performance shares, and other stock-based awards. Awards may be paid in common stock, cash, or a combination thereof. The number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the plan is

34.3

million

.

We recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Awards classified as equity awards are measured based on their grant-date fair value. Awards classified as liability awards are recorded at fair value each reporting period.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which modified certain aspects of the accounting for stock-based compensation awards. This ASU became effective for us on January 1, 2017. Under the new guidance, all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies are recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement on a prospective basis. Prior to January 1, 2017, these amounts were recorded in additional paid in capital on the balance sheet, and excess tax benefits could only be recognized to the extent they reduced taxes payable. In the first quarter of 2017, we recorded a

$

15.7

million

cumulative-effect adjustment to increase retained earnings for excess tax benefits that had not been recognized in prior years as they did not reduce taxes payable.

As allowed under this ASU, we have elected to account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than estimating potential future forfeitures and recording them over the vesting period.

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


Stock Options

We grant non-qualified stock options that generally vest on a cliff-basis after

three years

. The exercise price of a stock option under the plan cannot be less than


%

of our common stock's fair market value on the grant date. Historically, all stock options have been granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the grant. Options vest immediately upon retirement, death, or disability; however, they may not be exercised within

six months

of the grant date except in the event of a change in control. Options expire no later than


years

from the date of the grant.

Our stock options are classified as equity awards. The fair value of our stock options was calculated using a binomial option-pricing model.

The following table shows the estimated weighted-average fair value per stock option granted along with the weighted-average assumptions used in the valuation models:

The risk-free interest rate was based on the United States Treasury interest rate with a term consistent with the expected life of the stock options. The dividend yield was based on our dividend rate at the time of the grant and historical stock prices. Expected volatility and expected life assumptions were based on our historical experience.

Restricted Shares

Restricted shares granted to employees generally have a vesting period of

three years

with one-third of the award vesting on each anniversary of the grant date. This same vesting schedule is followed for restricted shares that were granted to non-employee directors prior to 2017. Restricted shares granted to certain officers and all non-employee directors after January 1, 2017, fully vest after

one year

.

Our restricted shares are classified as equity awards.

Performance Units

Officers and other key employees are granted performance units under the WEC Energy Group Performance Unit Plan. Under the plan, the ultimate number of units that will be awarded is dependent on our total shareholder return (stock price appreciation plus dividends) as compared to the total shareholder return of a peer group of companies over

three years

, as well as other performance metrics as may be determined by the Compensation Committee. Under the terms of the award, participants may earn between


%

and


%

of the performance unit award based on our total shareholder return. Pursuant to the terms of the plan, these percentages can be adjusted upwards or downwards based on our performance against additional performance measures, if any, adopted by the Compensation Committee. Performance units also accrue forfeitable dividend equivalents in the form of additional performance units.

All grants of performance units are settled in cash and are accounted for as liability awards accordingly. The fair value of the performance units reflects our estimate of the final expected value of the awards, which is based on our stock price and performance achievement under the terms of the award. Stock-based compensation costs are generally recorded over the performance period, which is

three years

.

See Note 10, Common Equity, for more information

on our stock-based compensation plans.

(m) Earnings Per Share

—

We compute basic earnings per share by dividing our net income attributed to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed in a similar

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


manner, but includes the exercise and/or conversion of all potentially dilutive securities. Such dilutive securities include in-the-money stock options. There were

no

securities that had an anti-dilutive effect for the years ended

December 31, 2019

,


, and


.

(n) Leases

—

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which revised the previous guidance (Topic 840) regarding accounting for leases. Revisions include requiring a lessee to recognize a lease asset and a lease liability on its balance sheet for each lease, including operating leases with an initial term greater than 12 months. In addition, required quantitative and qualitative disclosures related to lease agreements were expanded.

As required, we adopted Topic 842 effective January 1, 2019. We utilized the following practical expedients, which were available under ASU 2016-02, in our adoption of the new lease guidance.

•

We did not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts were leases or contained leases.

•

We did not reassess the lease classification for any expired or existing leases (that is, all leases that were classified as operating leases in accordance with Topic 840 continue to be classified as operating leases, and all leases that were classified as capital leases in accordance with Topic 840 are classified as finance leases).

•

We did not reassess the accounting for initial direct costs for any existing leases.

We did not elect the practical expedient allowing entities to account for the nonlease components in lease contracts as part of the single lease component to which they were related. Instead, in accordance with ASC 842-10-15-31, our policy is to account for each lease component separately from the nonlease components of the contract.

We did not elect the practical expedient to use hindsight in determining the lease term and in assessing impairment of our right of use assets.

No

impairment losses were included in the measurement of our right of use assets upon our adoption of Topic 842.

In January 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-01, Leases (Topic 842): Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842, which is an amendment to ASU 2016-02. Land easements (also commonly referred to as rights of way) represent the right to use, access or cross another entity's land for a specified purpose. This new guidance permits an entity to elect a transitional practical expedient, to be applied consistently, to not evaluate under Topic 842 land easements that were already in existence or had expired at the time of the entity's adoption of Topic 842. Once Topic 842 is adopted, an entity is required to apply Topic 842 prospectively to all new (or modified) land easements to determine whether the arrangement should be accounted for as a lease. We elected this practical expedient, resulting in

none

of our land easements being treated as leases upon our adoption of Topic 842.

In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements, which amends ASU 2016-02 and allows entities the option to initially apply Topic 842 at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption, if required. We used the optional transition method to apply the new guidance as of January 1, 2019, rather than as of the earliest period presented. We did not require a cumulative-effect adjustment upon adoption of Topic 842.

Right of use assets and related lease liabilities related to our operating leases that were recorded upon adoption of Topic 842 were

$

49.0

million

and

$

48.8

million

, respectively. Regarding our power purchase agreement that meets the criteria of a finance lease, while the adoption of Topic 842 changed the classification of expense related to this lease on a prospective basis, it had

no

impact on the total amount of lease expense recorded, and did not impact the lease asset and related liability amounts recorded on our balance sheets.

Significant Judgments and Other Information

We are currently party to several easement agreements that allow us access to land we do not own for the purpose of constructing and maintaining certain electric power and natural gas equipment. The majority of payments we make related to easements relate to our wind generating facilities. We have not classified our easements as leases because we view the entire parcel of land specified in our easement agreements to be the identified asset, not just that portion of the parcel that contains our easement. As such, we have concluded that we do not control the use of an identified asset related to our easement agreements, nor do we obtain substantially all of the economic benefits associated with these shared-use assets.

As of

February 27, 2020

, we have not entered into any material leases that have not yet commenced.

(o) Income Taxes

—

We follow the liability method in accounting for income taxes. Accounting guidance for income taxes requires the recording of deferred assets and liabilities to recognize the expected future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in our financial statements or tax returns and the adjustment of deferred tax balances to reflect tax rate changes. We are required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets would expire before being realized. If we conclude that certain deferred tax assets are likely to expire before being realized, a valuation allowance would be established against those assets. GAAP requires that, if we conclude in a future period that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets would be realized before expiration, we reverse the related valuation allowance in that period. Any change to the allowance, as a result of a change in judgment about the realization of deferred tax assets, is reported in income tax expense.

Investment tax credits associated with regulated operations are deferred and amortized over the life of the assets. Production tax credits are recognized in the period in which such credits are generated. The amount of the credit is based upon power production from our qualifying generation facilities. We file a consolidated federal income tax return. Accordingly, we allocate federal current tax expense, benefits, and credits to our subsidiaries based on their separate tax computations and our ability to monetize all credits on our consolidated federal return. See

Note 15, Income Taxes

, for more information.

We recognize interest and penalties accrued, related to unrecognized tax benefits, in income tax expense in our income statements.

In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income. The amendments in this update allowed entities to reclassify the income tax effects that are stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of the Tax Legislation to retained earnings. These amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We early adopted the amendments in the fourth quarter of 2018 and reclassified the stranded tax effects associated with the Tax Legislation from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. As of December 31, 2018, our accumulated other comprehensive income decreased

$

0.6

million

as a result of adopting ASU 2018-02. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our results of operations or cash flows.

(p) Fair Value Measurements

—

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).

Fair value accounting rules provide a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:

Level 1 – Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

Level 2 – Pricing inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, but are not quoted prices included within Level 1. Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using external inputs within models or other valuation methods.

Level 3 – Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources. These inputs may be used with internally developed methods that result in management's best estimate of fair value. Level 3 instruments include those that may be more structured or otherwise tailored to customers' needs.

Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. We use a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point price between bid and ask prices) as a practical measure for valuing certain derivative assets and liabilities. We primarily use a market approach for recurring fair value measurements and attempt to use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.

When possible, we base the valuations of our derivative assets and liabilities on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets. These valuations are classified in Level 1. The valuations of certain contracts not classified as Level 1 may be based on quoted market prices received from counterparties and/or observable inputs for similar instruments. Transactions valued using these inputs are classified in Level 2. Certain derivatives are categorized in Level 3 due to the significance of unobservable or internally-developed inputs.

See Note 16, Fair Value Measurements, for more information

(q) Derivative Instruments

—

We use derivatives as part of our risk management program to manage the risks associated with the price volatility of interest rates, purchased power, generation, and natural gas costs for the benefit of our customers and shareholders. Our approach is non-speculative and designed to mitigate risk. Regulated hedging programs are approved by our state regulators.

We record derivative instruments on our balance sheets as assets or liabilities measured at fair value unless they qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception, and are so designated. We continually assess our contracts designated as normal and will discontinue the treatment of these contracts as normal if the required criteria are no longer met. Changes in the derivative's fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met or we receive regulatory treatment for the derivative. For most energy-related physical and financial contracts in our regulated operations that qualify as derivatives, our regulators allow the effects of fair value accounting to be offset to regulatory assets and liabilities.

We classify derivative assets and liabilities as current or long-term on our balance sheets based on the maturities of the underlying contracts. Cash flows from derivative activities are presented in the same category as the item being hedged within operating activities on our statements of cash flows.

Derivative accounting rules provide the option to present certain asset and liability derivative positions net on the balance sheets and to net the related cash collateral against these net derivative positions. We elected not to net these items. On our balance sheets, cash collateral provided to others is reflected in other current assets, and cash collateral received is reflected in other current liabilities.

See Note 17, Derivative Instruments, for more information

.

(r) Guarantees

—

We follow the guidance of the Guarantees Topic of the FASB ASC, which requires, under certain circumstances, that the guarantor recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee at its inception.

See Note 18, Guarantees, for more information

.

(s) Employee Benefits

—

The costs of pension and OPEB are expensed over the periods during which employees render service. These costs are distributed among our subsidiaries based on current employment status and actuarial calculations, as applicable. Our regulators allow recovery in rates for the utilities' net periodic benefit cost calculated under GAAP.

See Note 19, Employee Benefits, for more information

.

(t) Customer Deposits and Credit Balances

—

When utility customers apply for new service, they may be required to provide a deposit for the service. Customer deposits are recorded within other current liabilities on our balance sheets.

Utility customers can elect to be on a budget plan. Under this type of plan, a monthly installment amount is calculated based on estimated annual usage. During the year, the monthly installment amount is reviewed by comparing it to actual usage. If necessary, an adjustment is made to the monthly amount. Annually, the budget plan is reconciled to actual annual usage. Payments in excess of actual customer usage are recorded within other current liabilities on our balance sheets.

(u) Environmental Remediation Costs

—

We are subject to federal and state environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to pay for environmental remediation at sites where we have been, or may be, identified as a potentially responsible party. Loss contingencies may exist for the remediation of hazardous substances at various potential sites, including coal combustion product landfill sites and manufactured gas plant sites.

See Note 8, Asset Retirement Obligations, for more information

regarding coal combustion product landfill sites and

Note 23, Commitments and Contingencies

, for more information regarding manufactured gas plant sites.

We record environmental remediation liabilities when site assessments indicate remediation is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss or a range of losses. The estimate includes both our share of the liability and any additional amounts that will not be paid by other potentially responsible parties or the government. When possible, we estimate costs using site-specific information but also consider historical experience for costs incurred at similar sites. Remediation efforts for a particular site generally extend over a period of several years. During this period, the laws governing the remediation process may change, as well as site conditions, potentially affecting the cost of remediation.

Our utilities have received approval to defer certain environmental remediation costs, as well as estimated future costs, through a regulatory asset. The recovery of deferred costs is subject to the applicable state Commission's approval.

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


We review our estimated costs of remediation annually for our manufactured gas plant sites and coal combustion product landfill sites. We adjust the liabilities and related regulatory assets, as appropriate, to reflect the new cost estimates. Any material changes in cost estimates are adjusted throughout the year.

(v) Customer Concentrations of Credit Risk

—

We provide regulated electric service to customers in Wisconsin and Michigan and regulated natural gas service to customers in Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota, and Michigan. The geographic concentration of our customers did not contribute significantly to our overall exposure to credit risk. We periodically review customers' credit ratings, financial statements, and historical payment performance and require them to provide collateral or other security as needed. Credit risk exposure at WE, WPS, WG, PGL, and NSG is mitigated by their recovery mechanisms for uncollectible expense discussed in

Note 1(d), Operating Revenues

. As a result, we did not have any significant concentrations of credit risk at

December 31, 2019

. In addition, there were

no

customers that accounted for more than


%

of our revenues for the year ended

December 31, 2019

.

ACQUISITIONS

On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business (ASU 2017-01). The amendments in this update clarify the definition of a business and provide guidance on evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. ASU 2017-01 also clarifies that transaction costs are capitalized in an asset acquisition but expensed in a business combination.

REGULATORY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

The following regulatory assets were reflected on our balance sheets as of December 31:

(1)

Based on prior and current rate treatment, we believe it is probable that our utilities will continue to recover from customers the regulatory assets in this table. In accordance with GAAP, our regulatory assets do not include the allowance for ROE that is capitalized for regulatory purposes. This allowance was

$

24.3

million

and

$

18.2

million

at

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.

(2)

As of

December 31, 2019

, we had

$

175.1

million

of regulatory assets not earning a return,

$

29.1

million

of regulatory assets earning a return based on short-term interest rates, and

$

151.5

million

of regulatory assets earning a return based on long-term interest rates. The regulatory

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


assets not earning a return primarily relate to certain environmental remediation costs, the recovery of which depends on the timing of the actual expenditures, as well as uncollectible expense, our electric real-time market pricing program, and unamortized loss on reacquired debt. The other regulatory assets in the table either earn a return at the applicable utility's weighted average cost of capital or the cash has not yet been expended, in which case the regulatory assets are offset by liabilities.

(3)

Primarily represents the unrecognized future pension and OPEB costs related to our defined benefit pension and OPEB plans. We are authorized recovery of these regulatory assets over the average remaining service life of each plan.

(4)

In accordance with the rate orders issued by the PSCW in December 2019, amounts previously collected from customers for the future removal of our recently retired plants were used to reduce our unrecovered plant balances during December 2019. Any additional removal costs that we incur  will increase our plant retirement regulatory assets.

(5)

As of

December 31, 2019

, we had made cash expenditures of

$

96.3

million

related to these environmental remediation costs. The remaining

$

589.2

million

represents our estimated future cash expenditures.

(6)

For information on the flow through of tax repairs and the regulatory treatment of the impacts of the Tax Legislation in our various jurisdictions, see

Note 25, Regulatory Environment

.

(7)

As a result of the rate order WE received from the PSCW in December 2019, the regulatory liability related to its mines deferral was offset against its SSR regulatory asset during December 2019. The rate order also authorized recovery of WE's SSR regulatory asset over a 15-year period that began on January 1, 2020.

(8)

Represents amounts recoverable from customers related to our uncollectible expense tracking mechanisms and riders. These mechanisms allow us to recover or refund the difference between actual uncollectible write-offs and the amounts recovered in rates.

(9)

Represents amounts recoverable from customers related to WE's costs of the generating units leased from We Power, including subsequent capital additions.

The following regulatory liabilities were reflected on our balance sheets as of December 31:

(1)

For information on the regulatory treatment of the impacts of the Tax Legislation in our various jurisdictions, see

Note 25, Regulatory Environment

(2)

Represents amounts collected from customers to cover the future cost of property, plant, and equipment removals that are not legally required. Legal obligations related to the removal of property, plant, and equipment are recorded as AROs.

See Note 8, Asset Retirement Obligations, for more information

on our legal obligations.

(3)

Primarily represents the unrecognized future pension and OPEB benefits related to our defined benefit pension and OPEB plans. We will amortize these regulatory liabilities into net periodic benefit cost over the average remaining service life of each plan.

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


(4)

Represents an over-collection of energy costs that will be refunded to customers in the future. When the rates we charge to customers include energy costs that are higher than our actual energy costs, any over-collection outside of the allowable energy cost price variance is refunded to customers.

(5)

Based on orders received from the PSCW, WE was required to apply the refunds due to customers from its earnings sharing mechanism to its electric transmission escrow through 2019. As a result,

$

38.6

million

of WE's earnings sharing refunds were reflected in its electric transmission regulatory liability at December 31, 2019, and

$

37.2

million

of WE's earnings sharing refunds were netted against its electric transmission regulatory asset at December 31, 2018.

(6)

Represents amounts refundable to customers related to our uncollectible expense tracking mechanisms and riders. These mechanisms allow us to recover or refund the difference between actual uncollectible write-offs and the amounts recovered in rates.

(7)

Represents amounts refundable to customers related to programs at the utilities designed to meet energy efficiency standards.

(8)

Represents the deferral of revenues less the associated cost of sales related to Tilden, which were not included in the PSCW's 2015 rate order. As a result of the rate order WE received from the PSCW in December 2019, this regulatory liability was offset against WE's SSR regulatory asset during December 2019.

Severance Liability for Plant Retirements

In December 2017, a severance liability of

$

29.4

million

was recorded in other current liabilities on our balance sheets related to these plant retirements.

Activity related to this severance liability for the years ended December 31 was as follows:

NOTE 7—

JOINTLY OWNED UTILITY FACILITIES

We Power and WPS hold joint ownership interests in certain electric generating facilities. They are entitled to their share of generating capability and output of each facility equal to their respective ownership interest. They pay their ownership share of additional construction costs and have supplied their own financing for all jointly owned projects. We record We Power's and WPS's proportionate share of significant jointly owned electric generating facilities as property, plant, and equipment on the balance sheets.

We Power leases its ownership interest in ER 1 and ER 2 to WE, and WE operates these units. WE and WPS record their respective share of fuel inventory purchases and operating expenses, unless specific agreements have been executed to limit their maximum exposure to additional costs. WE's and WPS's proportionate share of direct expenses for the joint operation of these plants is recorded in operating expenses in the income statements.

Information related to jointly owned utility facilities at

December 31, 2019

was as follows:

(1)

Capacity for our electric generation facilities is based on rated capacity, which is the net power output under average operating conditions with equipment in an average state of repair as of a given month in a given year. Values are primarily based on the net dependable expected capacity ratings for summer


established by tests and may change slightly from year to year. The summer period is the most relevant for capacity planning purposes. This is a result of continually reaching demand peaks in the summer months, primarily due to air conditioning demand.

(2)

Columbia Energy Center is jointly owned by Wisconsin Power and Light, Madison Gas and Electric, and WPS. In October 2016, Wisconsin Power and Light received an order from the PSCW approving amendments to the Columbia Energy Center joint operating agreement between the parties allowing WPS and Madison Gas and Electric to forgo certain capital expenditures at the Columbia Energy Center. As a result, Wisconsin Power and Light will incur these capital expenditures in exchange for a proportional increase in its ownership share of the Columbia Energy Center. Based upon the additional capital expenditures Wisconsin Power and Light expects to incur through June 1, 2020, WPS's ownership interest would decrease to

27.5

%

.

WPS has partnered with an unaffiliated utility to construct

two

solar projects in Wisconsin. Badger Hollow I is located in Iowa County, Wisconsin, and Two Creeks is located in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin. Once constructed, WPS will own


MW of the output of each project for a total of


MW. The PSCW approved the acquisition of these

two

projects in April 2019. Construction began at Two Creeks and Badger Hollow I in August 2019 and October 2019, respectively. Commercial operation of both projects is targeted for the end of 2020. The CWIP balances for Badger Hollow I and Two Creeks as of

December 31, 2019

were

$

32.5

million

and

$

87.3

million

, respectively.

In August 2019, WE, along with an unaffiliated utility, filed an application with the PSCW for approval to acquire an ownership interest in a proposed solar project, Badger Hollow II, that will be located in Iowa County, Wisconsin. At its meeting on February 20, 2020, the PSCW approved the acquisition of this project. The approval is still subject to WE's receipt and review of a final written

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

Our utilities have recorded AROs primarily for the removal of natural gas distribution mains and service pipes (including asbestos and PCBs); asbestos abatement at certain generation and substation facilities, office buildings, and service centers; the removal and dismantlement of biomass and hydro generation facilities; the dismantling of wind generation projects; the disposal of PCB-contaminated transformers; the closure of fly-ash landfills at certain generation facilities; and the removal of above ground storage tanks. Regulatory assets and liabilities are established by our utilities to record the differences between ongoing expense recognition under the ARO accounting rules and the rate-making practices for retirement costs authorized by the applicable regulators.

AROs have also been recorded at Bishop Hill III, Coyote Ridge, and Upstream for the dismantling of wind generation projects.

On our balance sheets, AROs are recorded within other long-term liabilities.

The following table shows changes to our AROs during the years ended December 31:

(1)

AROs increased

Restrictions

Our ability as a holding company to pay common stock dividends primarily depends on the availability of funds received from our utility subsidiaries, We Power, ATC Holding, and WECI. Various financing arrangements and regulatory requirements impose certain restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us in the form of cash dividends, loans, or advances. All of our utility subsidiaries, with the exception of UMERC and MGU, are prohibited from loaning funds to us, either directly or indirectly.

In accordance with their most recent rate orders, WE, WPS, and WG may not pay common dividends above the test year forecasted amounts reflected in their respective rate cases, if it would cause their average common equity ratio, on a financial basis, to fall below their authorized level of

52.5

%

. A return of capital in excess of the test year amount can be paid by each company at the end of the year provided that their respective average common equity ratios do not fall below the authorized level.

WE may not pay common dividends to us under WE's Restated Articles of Incorporation if any dividends on its outstanding preferred stock have not been paid. In addition, pursuant to the terms of WE's

3.60

%

Serial Preferred Stock, WE's ability to declare common dividends would be limited to


%

or


%

of net income during a twelve month period if its common stock equity to total capitalization, as defined in the preferred stock designation, is less than


%

and


%

, respectively.

NSG's long-term debt obligations contain provisions and covenants restricting the payment of cash dividends and the purchase or redemption of its capital stock.

The long-term debt obligations of UMERC, Bluewater Gas Storage, and ATC Holding contain a provision requiring them to maintain a total funded debt to capitalization ratio of


%

or less.

WEC Energy Group and Integrys have the option to defer interest payments on their junior subordinated notes, from time to time, for

one

or more periods of up to


consecutive years per period. During any period in which they defer interest payments, they may not declare or pay any dividends or distributions on, or redeem, repurchase or acquire, their respective common stock.

LEASES

Obligations Under Operating Leases

We have recorded right of use assets and lease liabilities associated with the following operating leases.

•

Leases of office space, primarily related to several floors we are leasing in the Aon Center office building in Chicago, Illinois, though April 2029.

•

Land we are leasing related to our Rothschild biomass plant through June 2051.

•

Rail cars we are leasing to transport coal to various generating facilities through February 2021.

The operating leases generally require us to pay property taxes, insurance premiums, and operating and maintenance costs associated with the leased property. Many of our leases contain options to renew past the initial term, as set forth in the lease agreement.

Obligations Under Finance Lease

Power Purchase Commitment

In 1997, we entered into a


-year power purchase contract with an unaffiliated independent power producer. The contract, for


MWs of firm capacity from a natural gas-fired cogeneration facility, includes

zero

minimum energy requirements. When the contract expires in 2022, we may, at our option and with proper notice, renew for another

ten years

, purchase the generating facility at fair market value, or allow the contract to expire. At lease inception we recorded this leased facility and corresponding obligation on our balance sheets at the estimated fair value of the plant's electric generating facilities. Minimum lease payments are a function of the


MWs of firm capacity we receive from the plant and the fixed monthly capacity rate published in the lease.

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


Prior to our adoption of Topic 842 on January 1, 2019, we accounted for this finance lease under Topic 980-840, Regulated Operations – Leases, as follows:

•

We recorded our minimum lease payments as purchased power expense in cost of sales on our income statement.

•

We recorded the difference between the minimum lease payments and the sum of imputed interest and amortization costs calculated under finance lease accounting rules as a deferred regulatory asset on our balance sheets.

In conjunction with our adoption of Topic 842, while the timing of expense recognition related to this finance lease did not change, classification of the lease expense changed as follows:

•

Effective January 1, 2019, the minimum lease payments under the power purchase contract were no longer classified within cost of sales in our income statements, but were instead recorded as a component of depreciation and amortization and interest expense in accordance with Topic 980-842, Regulated Operations – Leases.

•

In accordance with Topic 980-842, the timing of lease expense did not change for this finance lease upon adoption of Topic 842, and still resembled the expense recognition pattern of an operating lease, as the amortization of the right of use assets was modified from what would typically be recorded for a finance lease under Topic 842.

•

We continue to record the difference between the minimum lease payments and the sum of imputed interest and unadjusted amortization costs calculated under the finance lease accounting rules as a deferred regulatory asset on our balance sheets.

Due to the timing and the amounts of the minimum lease payments, the regulatory asset increased to

$

78.5

million

in 2009, at which time the regulatory asset began to be reduced to

zero

over the remaining life of the contract. The total obligation under the finance lease was

$

18.4

million

at

December 31, 2019

, and will decrease to

zero

over the remaining life of the contract.

Two Creeks Solar Project

Related to its investment in Two Creeks, WPS, along with an unaffiliated utility, entered into several land leases in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin that commenced in the third quarter of 2019. The leases with unaffiliated parties are for a total of approximately


acres of land. Each lease has an initial term of


years

with

two

optional


-year extensions. We expect the

two

optional extensions to be exercised, and, as a result, the land leases are being amortized over the


-year extended term of the leases. The lease payments are being recovered through rates.

We treat these land lease contracts as operating leases for rate-making purposes. Our total obligation under the finance leases for Two Creeks was

$

7.7

million

as of

December 31, 2019

, and will decrease to

zero

over the remaining lives of the leases.

Badger Hollow Solar Farm I

Related to its investment in Badger Hollow I, WPS, along with an unaffiliated utility, entered into several land leases in Iowa County, Wisconsin that commenced in the third quarter of 2019. The leases are for a total of approximately

1,400

acres of land. Each lease has an initial construction term that ends upon achieving commercial operation, then automatically extends for


years

with an option for an additional


-year extension. We expect the optional extension to be exercised, and, as a result, the land leases are being amortized over the extended term of the leases. The lease payments will be recovered through rates.

We treat these land lease contracts as operating leases for rate-making purposes. Our total obligation under the finance leases for Badger Hollow I was

million

(included in interest expense). For the years ended

, and


.

(3)

Prior to our adoption of Topic 842 on January 1, 2019, all cash flows related to the finance lease were recorded as a component of operating cash flows.

(4)

Because our operating leases do not provide an implicit rate of return, we used the fully collateralized incremental borrowing rates based upon information available for similarly rated companies in determining the present value of lease payments for our operating leases. For our power purchase agreement that meets the definition of a finance lease, the rate implicit in the lease was readily determinable. For our solar land leases that are finance leases, we used the fully collateralized incremental borrowing rates based upon information available for similarly rated companies in determining the present value of lease payments.

INCOME TAXES

Income Tax Expense

The following table is a summary of income tax expense for the years ended December 31:

Statutory Rate Reconciliation

The provision for income taxes for each of the years ended December 31 differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the applicable United States statutory federal income tax rate to income before income taxes as a result of the following:

(1)

In accordance with a settlement agreement with the PSCW, WE flowed through the tax benefit of its repair related deferred tax liabilities in 2018 and 2019, to maintain certain regulatory asset balances at their December 31, 2017 levels. The flow through treatment of the repair related deferred tax liabilities offsets the negative income statement impact of holding the regulatory assets level, resulting in

no

change to net income.

See Note 25, Regulatory Environment, for more information

about the impact of the Tax Legislation and the Wisconsin rate order.

(2)

In 2017, the net impact of tax reform in the amount of

$

206.7

million

is represented in both the Federal tax reform and State income taxes net of federal tax benefit lines above.

Deferred Income Tax Assets and Liabilities

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Legislation was signed into law. For businesses, the Tax Legislation reduced the corporate federal tax rate from a maximum of


%

to a


%

rate effective January 1, 2018. In December 2017, we recorded a tax benefit related to the re-measurement of our deferred taxes in the amount of

$

2,657

million

. Accordingly, the tax benefit related to our regulated utilities was recorded as both an increase to regulatory liabilities as well as a decrease to certain existing regulatory assets as of December 31, 2017. The effects of the Tax Legislation primarily at our non-utility energy infrastructure and corporate and other segments resulted in the recording of an income tax benefit of approximately

$

206.7

million

for the year ended December 31, 2017. This tax benefit was primarily due to a re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities.

On December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued guidance in SAB 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which provided for a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date to complete accounting under GAAP for the tax effects of the legislation. Due to the complex and comprehensive nature of the enacted tax law changes, and their application under GAAP, certain amounts related to bonus depreciation and future tax benefit utilization recorded in the financial statements as a result of the Tax Legislation were considered "provisional" and subject to revision at December 31, 2017, and through 2018, as discussed in SAB 118.

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


In 2018, we considered all available guidance from industry and income tax authorities related to these tax items, and revised our Alternative Minimum Tax Credit valuation allowance, and revised our estimates for re-measurement of deferred income taxes related to guidance on bonus depreciation.

See Note 25, Regulatory Environment, for more information

on the re-measurement of deferred income taxes. At December 31, 2018, we no longer considered any amounts related to bonus depreciation and future tax benefit utilization "provisional," subject to any additional amendments or technical corrections to the Tax Legislation.

In 2019, we considered all available guidance from industry and income tax authorities related to these tax items, and reversed the valuation allowance we had related to Alternative Minimum Tax Credits due to an IRS Announcement issued January 14, 2019. Any further amendments or technical corrections to the Tax Legislation could subject these tax items to revision.

The components of deferred income taxes as of December 31 were as follows:

Consistent with rate-making treatment, deferred taxes related to our regulated utilities in the table above are offset for temporary differences that have related regulatory assets and liabilities.

Cash Flow Hedges

Effective January 1, 2019, we adopted ASU 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. The amendments in this update expand the strategies that qualify for hedge accounting, amend the presentation and disclosure requirements related to hedging activities, and provide overall targeted improvements to simplify hedge accounting in certain situations. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on our financial statements.

As of

December 31, 2019

, we had

two

interest rate swaps with a combined notional value of

$

250.0

million

to hedge the variable interest rate risk associated with our 2007 Junior Notes. The swaps provide a fixed interest rate of

4.9765

%

on

$

250.0

million

of the

$

500.0

million

of outstanding 2007 Junior Notes through November 15, 2021. As these swaps qualified for cash flow hedge accounting treatment, the related gains and losses are being deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss and are being amortized to interest expense as interest is accrued on the 2007 Junior Notes.

We previously entered into forward interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the interest rate exposure associated with the issuance of long-term debt related to the acquisition of Integrys. These swap agreements were settled in 2015, and we continue to amortize amounts out of accumulated other comprehensive loss into interest expense over the periods in which the interest costs are recognized in earnings.

The table below shows the amounts related to these cash flow hedges recorded in other comprehensive loss and in earnings, along with our total interest expense on the income statements, for the years ended

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

Pension and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits

We and our subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all of our employees, as well as several unfunded non-qualified retirement plans. In addition, we and our subsidiaries offer multiple OPEB plans to employees. The benefits for a portion of these plans are funded through irrevocable trusts, as allowed for income tax purposes. We also offer medical, dental, and life insurance benefits to active employees and their dependents. We expense the costs of these benefits as incurred.

Generally, former Wisconsin Energy Corporation employees who started with the company after 1995 receive a benefit based on a percentage of their annual salary plus an interest credit, while employees who started before 1996 receive a benefit based upon years of service and final average salary. New Wisconsin Energy Corporation management employees hired after December 31, 2014, and certain new represented employees hired after May 1, 2017, receive an annual company contribution to their 401(k) savings plan instead of being enrolled in the defined benefit plans.

For former Integrys employees, the defined benefit pension plans are closed to all new hires. In addition, the service accruals for the defined benefit pension plans were frozen for non-union employees as of January 1, 2013. These employees receive an annual company contribution to their 401(k) savings plan, which is calculated based on age, wages, and full years of vesting service as of December 31 each year.

We use a year-end measurement date to measure the funded status of all of our pension and OPEB plans. Due to the regulated nature of our business, we have concluded that substantially all of the unrecognized costs resulting from the recognition of the funded status of our pension and OPEB plans qualify as a regulatory asset.

Plan Assets

Current pension trust assets and amounts which are expected to be contributed to the trusts in the future are expected to be adequate to meet pension payment obligations to current and future retirees.

The Investment Trust Policy Committee oversees investment matters related to all of our funded benefit plans. The Committee works with external actuaries and investment consultants on an on-going basis to establish and monitor investment strategies and target asset allocations. Forecasted cash flows for plan liabilities are regularly updated based on annual valuation results. Target allocations are determined utilizing projected benefit payment cash flows and risk analyses of appropriate investments. They are intended to reduce risk, provide long-term financial stability for the plans and maintain funded levels which meet long-term plan obligations while preserving sufficient liquidity for near-term benefit payments.

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity must consolidate the entity's assets and liabilities. In addition, certain disclosures are required for significant interest holders in variable interest entities.

We assess our relationships with potential variable interest entities, such as our coal suppliers, natural gas suppliers, coal transporters, natural gas transporters, and other counterparties related to power purchase agreements, investments, and joint ventures. In making this assessment, we consider, along with other factors, the potential that our contracts or other arrangements provide subordinated financial support, the obligation to absorb the entity's losses, the right to receive residual returns of the entity, and the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance.

Investment in Transmission Affiliates

We own approximately


%

of ATC, a for-profit, electric transmission company regulated by the FERC and certain state regulatory commissions. We have determined that ATC is a variable interest entity, but consolidation is not required since we are not ATC's primary beneficiary. As a result of our limited voting rights, we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact ATC's economic performance. Therefore, we account for ATC as an equity method investment. At

December 31, 2019

and


, our equity investment in ATC was

$

1,684.7

million

and

$

1,625.3

million

, respectively, which approximates our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with ATC.

We also own approximately


%

of ATC Holdco, a separate entity formed in December 2016 to invest in transmission-related projects outside of ATC's traditional footprint. We have determined that ATC Holdco is a variable interest entity, but consolidation is not required since we are not ATC Holdco's primary beneficiary. As a result of our limited voting rights, we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact ATC Holdco's economic performance. Therefore, we account for ATC Holdco as an equity method investment. At

December 31, 2019

See Note 20, Investment in Transmission Affiliates, for more information

, including any significant assets and liabilities related to ATC and ATC Holdco recorded on our balance sheets.

Power Purchase Agreement

We have a power purchase agreement that represents a variable interest. This agreement is for


MWs of firm capacity from a natural gas-fired cogeneration facility, and we account for it as a finance lease. The agreement includes

no

minimum energy requirements over the remaining term of approximately

two years

. We have examined the risks of the entity, including operations,

maintenance, dispatch, financing, fuel costs, and other factors, and have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of the entity. We do not hold an equity or debt interest in the entity, and there is

no

residual guarantee associated with the power purchase agreement.

We have

$

of required capacity payments over the remaining term of this agreement. We believe that the required capacity payments under this contract will continue to be recoverable in rates, and our maximum exposure to loss is limited to these capacity payments.

NOTE 23—

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

We and our subsidiaries have significant commitments and contingencies arising from our operations, including those related to unconditional purchase obligations, environmental matters, and enforcement and litigation matters.

Unconditional Purchase Obligations

Our electric utilities have obligations to distribute and sell electricity to their customers, and our natural gas utilities have obligations to distribute and sell natural gas to their customers. The utilities expect to recover costs related to these obligations in future customer rates. In order to meet these obligations, we routinely enter into long-term purchase and sale commitments for various quantities and lengths of time.

Our non-utility energy infrastructure generation facilities have obligations to distribute and sell electricity through long-term offtake agreements with their customers for all of the energy produced. These projects also enter into related easements and other agreements associated with the generating facilities.

The following table shows our minimum future commitments related to these purchase obligations as of

December 31, 2019

, including those of our subsidiaries.

Environmental Matters

Consistent with other companies in the energy industry, we face significant ongoing environmental compliance and remediation obligations related to current and past operations. Specific environmental issues affecting us include, but are not limited to, current and future regulation of air emissions such as SO


, NOx, fine particulates, mercury, and GHGs; water intake and discharges; management of coal combustion products such as fly ash; and remediation of impacted properties, including former manufactured gas plant sites.

We have continued to pursue a proactive strategy to manage our environmental compliance obligations, including:

•

the development of additional sources of renewable electric energy supply;

•

the addition of improvements for water quality matters such as treatment technologies to meet regulatory discharge limits and improvements to our cooling water intake systems;

•

the addition of emission control equipment to existing facilities to comply with ambient air quality standards and federal clean air rules;

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


•

the protection of wetlands and waterways, threatened and endangered species, and cultural resources associated with utility construction projects;

•

the retirement of older coal-fired power plants and conversion to modern, efficient, natural gas generation, super-critical pulverized coal generation, and/or replacement with renewable generation;

•

the beneficial use of ash and other products from coal-fired and biomass generating units; and

•

the remediation of former manufactured gas plant sites.

Air Quality

National Ambient Air Quality Standards

After completing its review of the 2008 ozone standard, the EPA released a final rule in October 2015, which lowered the limit for ground-level ozone, creating a more stringent standard than the 2008 NAAQS. The EPA issued final nonattainment area designations in April 2018. The following counties within our service territories were designated as partial nonattainment: Door, Kenosha, Manitowoc, Northern Milwaukee/Ozaukee, and Sheboygan shorelines. This re-designation was challenged in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in

Clean Wisconsin et al. v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Petitioners in that case have argued that additional portions of Milwaukee, Waukesha, Ozaukee, and Washington Counties (among others) should be designated as nonattainment for ozone. In November 2019, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments for that case. A decision is expected in spring 2020, and we expect that any subsequent EPA re-designation, if necessary, would take place in mid-2021.

We believe we are well positioned to meet the requirements associated with the ozone standard and do not expect to incur significant costs to comply. The State of Wisconsin is currently working with stakeholders, including us, in developing regulations for inclusion in the state implementation plan required by the rule.

Mercury and Air Toxics Standards

In December 2018, the EPA proposed to revise the Supplemental Cost Finding for the MATS rule as well as the CAA required RTR. The EPA was required by the United States Supreme Court to review both costs and benefits of complying with the MATS rule. After its review of costs, the EPA determined that it is not appropriate and necessary to regulate hazardous air pollutant emissions from power plants under Section 112 of the CAA. As a result, under the proposed rule, the emission standards and other requirements of the MATS rule first enacted in 2012 would remain in place. The EPA is not proposing to remove coal- and oil-fired power plants from the list of sources that are regulated under Section 112. The EPA also proposes that

no

revisions to MATS are warranted based on the results of the RTR. As a result, we do not expect the proposed rule to have a material impact on our financial condition or operations.

Climate Change

The ACE rule became effective in September 2019. This rule provides existing coal-fired generating units with standards for achieving GHG emission reductions. The rule was finalized in conjunction with two other separate and distinct rulemakings, (1) the repeal of the Clean Power Plan, and (2) revised implementing regulations for ACE, ongoing emissions guidelines, and all future emission guidelines for existing sources issued under CAA section 111(d). Every state's plan to implement ACE is required to focus on reducing GHG emissions by improving the efficiency of fossil-fueled power plants. The rule is being litigated in challenges brought in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals by


states (including Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin), local governments, and certain nongovernmental organizations. This litigation is proceeding, but has not yet been scheduled for oral argument. The WDNR is working with state utilities and has begun the process of developing the implementation plan with respect to the ACE rule.

In December 2018, the EPA proposed to revise the New Source Performance Standards for GHG emissions from new, modified, and reconstructed fossil-fueled power plants. The EPA determined that the BSER for new, modified, and reconstructed coal units is highly efficient generation that would be equivalent to supercritical steam conditions for larger units and subcritical steam conditions for smaller units. This proposed BSER would replace the determination from the previous rule, which identified BSER as partial carbon capture and storage.

In April 2019, we issued a climate report, which analyzes our GHG reduction goals with respect to international efforts to limit future global temperature increases to less than

two

degrees Celsius. We will evaluate potential GHG reduction pathways as climate change policies and relevant technologies evolve over time.

We continue to evaluate opportunities and actions that preserve fuel diversity, lower costs for our customers, and contribute toward long-term GHG emissions reductions. Our current plan is to work with our industry peers, environmental groups, public policy

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


makers, and customers, with goals of reducing CO


emissions. In 2019, we met and exceeded our 2030 goal of reducing CO


emissions by


%

below 2005 levels, and are re-evaluating our longer-term CO


reduction goals.

As a result of our generation reshaping plan, we retired approximately

1,800

MW of coal generation since the beginning of 2018, including the 2018 retirements of the Pleasant Prairie power plant, the Pulliam power plant, and the jointly-owned Edgewater Unit 4 generating units as well as the March 2019 retirement of the PIPP.

See Note 6, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information

.

We also have a goal to decrease the rate of methane emissions from the natural gas distribution lines in our network by


%

per mile by the year 2030 from a 2011 baseline. We were over half way toward meeting that goal at the end of 2019.

We are required to report our CO


equivalent emissions from our electric generating facilities under the EPA Greenhouse Gases Reporting Program. Based upon our analysis of the data, we reported CO


equivalent emissions of

21.8

million

metric tonnes and

26.4

million

metric tonnes to the EPA for


and


, respectively. The level of CO


and other GHG emissions varies from year to year and is dependent on the level of electric generation and mix of fuel sources, which is determined primarily by demand, the availability of the generating units, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and how our units are dispatched by MISO.

We are also required to report CO


equivalent emissions related to the natural gas that our natural gas utilities distribute and sell. Based upon our analysis of the data, we reported CO

Water Quality

Clean Water Act Cooling Water Intake Structure Rule

In August 2014, the EPA issued a final regulation under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act that requires the location, design, construction, and capacity of cooling water intake structures at existing power plants to reflect the BTA for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. The rule became effective in October 2014 and applies to all of our existing generating facilities with cooling water intake structures, except for the ERGS units, which were permitted under the rules governing new facilities.

We have received BTA determinations for OC 5 through OC 8, Weston Units 2, 3, and 4, and VAPP. Although we currently believe that existing technology at the PWGS satisfies the BTA requirements, final determinations will not be made until the discharge permit is renewed for this facility, which is expected to be in 2021. Until that time, we cannot determine what, if any, intake structure or operational modifications will be required to meet the new BTA requirements for this facility.

As a result of past capital investments completed to address Section 316(b) compliance at WE and WPS, we believe our fleet overall is well positioned to meet the regulation and do not expect to incur significant costs to comply with this regulation.

Steam Electric Effluent Limitation Guidelines

The EPA's final 2015 ELG rule took effect in January 2016. This rule created new requirements for several types of power plant wastewaters. The two new requirements that affect WE and WPS relate to discharge limits for BATW and wet FGD wastewater. As a result of past capital investments at WE and WPS, we believe our fleet is well positioned to meet the existing ELG regulations. Our power plant facilities already have advanced wastewater treatment technologies installed that meet many of the discharge limits established by this rule. There will, however, need to be modifications to the BATW systems at Weston Unit 3 and OC 7 and OC 8. Also, one wastewater treatment system modification may be required for the wet FGD discharges from the

six

units that make up the OCPP and ERGS. Based on preliminary engineering, we estimate that compliance with the current rule will require

$


million

in capital costs.

The ELG requirements for BATW and wet FGD systems are currently being re-evaluated by the EPA. In September 2017, the EPA issued a final rule (Postponement Rule) to postpone the earliest compliance date to November 1, 2020 for the BATW and wet FGD wastewater requirements while it reconsiders the ELG rule. The Postponement Rule left unchanged the latest ELG rule compliance date of December 31, 2023. In November 2019, the EPA Administrator signed the proposed ELG Reconsideration Rule to revise the treatment technology requirements related to BATW and wet FGD wastewaters at existing facilities. The EPA also proposed a provision that exempts facility owners from the new BATW and wet FGD requirements if a generating unit is retired by December 31, 2028. We expect the rule to be finalized in late 2020. In the meantime, we are currently evaluating what impact, if any, the proposed rule would have on our estimated compliance cost.

Manufactured Gas Plant Remediation

We have identified sites at which our utilities or a predecessor company owned or operated a manufactured gas plant or stored manufactured gas. We have also identified other sites that may have been impacted by historical manufactured gas plant activities. Our natural gas utilities are responsible for the environmental remediation of these sites, some of which are in the EPA Superfund Alternative Approach Program. We are also working with various state jurisdictions in our investigation and remediation planning. These sites are at various stages of investigation, monitoring, remediation, and closure.

In addition, we are coordinating the investigation and cleanup of some of these sites subject to the jurisdiction of the EPA under what is called a "multisite" program. This program involves prioritizing the work to be done at the sites, preparation and approval of documents common to all of the sites, and use of a consistent approach in selecting remedies. At this time, we cannot estimate future remediation costs associated with these sites beyond those described below.

The future costs for detailed site investigation, future remediation, and monitoring are dependent upon several variables including, among other things, the extent of remediation, changes in technology, and changes in regulation. Historically, our regulators have allowed us to recover incurred costs, net of insurance recoveries and recoveries from potentially responsible parties, associated with the remediation of manufactured gas plant sites. Accordingly, we have established regulatory assets for costs associated with these sites.

We have established the following regulatory assets and reserves for manufactured gas plant sites as of December 31:

Renewables, Efficiency, and Conservation

Wisconsin Legislation

In 2005, Wisconsin enacted Act 141, which established a goal that


%

of all electricity consumed in Wisconsin be generated by renewable resources annually. WE and WPS have achieved their required renewable energy percentages of

8.27

%

and

9.74

%

, respectively, and met their compliance requirements by constructing various wind parks, a biomass facility, and by also relying on renewable energy purchases. WE and WPS continue to review their renewable energy portfolios and acquire cost-effective renewables as needed to meet their requirements on an ongoing basis. The PSCW administers the renewable program related to Act 141, and each utility funds the program based on

1.2

%

of its annual retail operating revenues.

Michigan Legislation

In December 2016, Michigan enacted Act 342, which requires

12.5

%

of the state's electric energy to come from renewables for years 2019 through 2020, and energy optimization (efficiency) targets up to


%

annually. The renewable requirement is increased to

15.0

%

for 2021. UMERC was in compliance with these requirements as of

December 31, 2019

. The legislation continues to allow recovery of costs incurred to meet the standards and provides for ongoing review and revision to assure the measures taken are cost-effective.

Enforcement and Litigation Matters

We and our subsidiaries are involved in legal and administrative proceedings before various courts and agencies with respect to matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Although we are unable to predict the outcome of these matters, management believes that appropriate reserves have been established and that final settlement of these actions will not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

Consent Decrees

Wisconsin Public Service Corporation – Weston and Pulliam Power Plants

In November 2009, the EPA issued an NOV to WPS, which alleged violations of the CAA's New Source Review requirements relating to certain projects completed at the Weston and Pulliam power plants from 1994 to 2009. WPS entered into a Consent Decree with the EPA resolving this NOV. This Consent Decree was entered by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin in March 2013.

With the retirement of Pulliam Units 7 and 8 in October 2018, WPS completed the mitigation projects required by the Consent Decree and received a completeness letter from the EPA in October 2018.

See Note 6, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information

about the retirement of the Pulliam units. We plan to request termination of the WPS Consent Decree during 2020.

Joint Ownership Power Plants – Columbia and Edgewater

In December 2009, the EPA issued an NOV to Wisconsin Power and Light, the operator of the Columbia and Edgewater plants, and the other joint owners of these plants, including Madison Gas and Electric, WE (former co-owner of an Edgewater unit), and WPS. The NOV alleged violations of the CAA's New Source Review requirements related to certain projects completed at those plants. WPS, along with Wisconsin Power and Light, Madison Gas and Electric, and WE, entered into a Consent Decree with the EPA resolving this NOV. This Consent Decree was entered by the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin in June 2013. As a result of the continued implementation of the Consent Decree related to the jointly owned Columbia and Edgewater plants, the Edgewater 4 generating unit was retired in September 2018.

See Note 6, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information

about the retirement. WE paid an immaterial portion of the assessed penalty but has no further obligations under the Consent Decree.

NOTE 25—

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017

Due to the Tax Legislation, our regulated utilities deferred for return to ratepayers, through future refunds, bill credits, riders, or reductions in other regulatory assets, the estimated tax benefit of

$

2,529

million that resulted from the revaluation of deferred taxes. The Tax Legislation also reduced the corporate federal tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a 21% rate, effective January 1, 2018. We have received written orders from the PSCW and the MPSC addressing the refunding of certain of these tax benefits to ratepayers in Wisconsin and Michigan, respectively. The ICC has approved the VITA in Illinois, and the MPUC addressed the impacts to MERC in its 2018 rate order. See the Variable Income Tax Adjustment Rider discussion and the 2018 Minnesota Rate Order discussion below for more information. A summary of the Wisconsin and Michigan orders is outlined below.

Wisconsin

In May 2018, the PSCW issued an order regarding the benefits associated with the Tax Legislation. The PSCW order required WE's and WPS’s electric utility operations to use


%

and


%

, respectively, of the current 2018 and 2019 tax benefits to reduce certain regulatory assets. The remaining


%

and


%

at WE and WPS, respectively, was to be returned to electric customers in the form of bill credits. For our Wisconsin natural gas utility operations, the PSCW indicated that


%

of the current 2018 and 2019 tax benefits should be returned to natural gas customers in the form of bill credits. Regarding the net tax benefit associated with the revaluation of deferred taxes, amortization required in accordance with normalization accounting was used to reduce certain regulatory assets for our electric utilities and was deferred at our natural gas utilities. The timing and method of returning the remaining net tax benefit associated with the revaluation of deferred taxes was addressed in the rate orders issued by the PSCW in December 2019. See the 2020 and 2021 Rates discussion below for more information.

Michigan

In February 2018, the MPSC issued an order requiring Michigan utilities to make

three

filings related to the Tax Legislation. The first of those filings, which was filed in March 2018, prospectively addressed the impact on base rates for the change in tax expense resulting from the federal tax rate reduction from 35% to 21%. MGU and UMERC proposed providing a volumetric bill credit, subject to reconciliation and true up. In May 2018, the MPSC issued orders approving settlements that resulted in volumetric bill credits for all of MGU's and UMERC's customers effective July 1, 2018. The bill credits will remain in effect until each company's next rate proceeding.

The second filing, which was filed in July 2018, addressed the impact on base rates for the change in tax expense resulting from the federal tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% from January 1, 2018 until July 1, 2018. MGU and UMERC proposed to return the tax savings from these months to customers via volumetric bill credits over multiple months. The MPSC issued orders approving settlements in September 2018. In accordance with the settlement orders, the savings were returned to MGU's and UMERC's customers via volumetric bill credits that were in effect from October 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018.

The third filing was filed in October 2018 and addressed the remaining impacts of the Tax Legislation on base rates – most notably the re-measurement of deferred tax balances. MGU and UMERC proposed providing a volumetric bill credit, subject to reconciliation and true up, to return these remaining impacts of the Tax Legislation to customers. The MPSC issued orders approving settlements in May 2019. The settlement orders provide for volumetric bill credits to MGU's and UMERC's customers effective June 1, 2019. The bill credits will remain in effect until each company's next rate proceeding.

WE, which served

one

retail electric customer in Michigan, reached a settlement with that customer. That settlement was approved by the MPSC in May 2018 and addressed all base rate impacts of the Tax Legislation, which were returned to the customer through bill credits.

Wisconsin Electric Power Company, Wisconsin Public Service Corporation, and Wisconsin Gas LLC

2020 and 2021 Rates

In March 2019, WE, WPS, and WG filed applications with the PSCW to increase their retail electric, natural gas, and steam rates, as applicable, effective January 1, 2020. In August 2019, all three utilities filed applications with the PSCW for approval of settlement agreements entered into with certain intervenors to resolve several outstanding issues in each utility's respective rate case. On

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


December 19, 2019, the PSCW issued written orders that approved the settlement agreements without material modification and addressed the remaining outstanding issues that were not included in the settlement agreements.

The new rates became effective January 1, 2020. The final orders reflect the following:

(1)

Amounts are net of certain deferred tax benefits from the Tax Legislation that were utilized to reduce near-term rate impact. The WE and WPS rate orders reflect the majority of the unprotected deferred tax benefits from the Tax Legislation being amortized over

two years

. For WE, approximately

$


million

of tax benefits will be amortized in each of 2020 and 2021. For WPS, approximately

$


million

of tax benefits are being amortized in 2020 and approximately

$


million

will be amortized in 2021. The unprotected deferred tax benefits related to the unrecovered balances of WE's recently retired plants and its SSR regulatory asset are being used to reduce the related regulatory asset. Unprotected deferred tax benefits by their nature are eligible to be returned to customers in a manner and timeline determined to be appropriate by our regulators.

(2)

The WPS rate order is net of

$


million

of refunds related to its 2018 earnings sharing mechanism. These refunds will be made to customers evenly over

two years

, with half being returned in 2020 and the remainder in 2021.

(3)

The WE amount includes certain deferred tax expense from the Tax Legislation, and the WPS and WG amounts are net of certain deferred tax benefits from the Tax Legislation that were utilized to reduce near-term rate impact. The rate orders for all

three

gas utilities reflect all of the unprotected deferred tax expense and benefits from the Tax Legislation being amortized evenly over

four years

. For WE, approximately

$


million

of previously deferred tax expense will be amortized each year. For WPS and WG, approximately

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively, of previously deferred tax benefits will be amortized each year. Unprotected deferred tax expense and benefits by their nature are eligible to be recovered from or returned to customers in a manner and timeline determined to be appropriate by our regulators.

In accordance with its rate order, WE will seek a financing order from the PSCW to securitize

$


million

of Pleasant Prairie power plant's book value, plus the carrying costs accrued on the

$


million

during the securitization process and related fees. The securitization will reduce the carrying costs for the

$


million

, benefiting customers.

The WPS rate order allows WPS to collect the previously deferred revenue requirement for ReACT™ costs above the authorized

$

275.0

million

level. The total cost of the ReACT™ project was

$


million

. This regulatory asset will be collected from customers over

eight years

.

All

three

Wisconsin utilities will continue having an earnings sharing mechanism through 2021. The earnings sharing mechanism was modified from its previous structure to one that is consistent with other Wisconsin investor-owned utilities. Under the new earnings sharing mechanism, if the utility earns above its authorized ROE: (i) the utility retains

100.0

%

of earnings for the first


basis points above the authorized ROE; (ii)

50.0

%

of the next


basis points is refunded to customers; and (iii)

100.0

%

of any remaining excess earnings is refunded to customers. In addition, the rate orders also require WE, WPS, and WG to maintain residential and small commercial electric and natural gas customer fixed charges at previously authorized rates and to maintain the status quo for WE's and WPS's electric market-based rate programs for large industrial customers through 2021.

2018 and 2019 Rates

During April 2017, WE, WPS, and WG filed an application with the PSCW for approval of a settlement agreement they made with several of their commercial and industrial customers regarding 2018 and 2019 base rates. In September 2017, the PSCW issued an order that approved the settlement agreement, which froze base rates through 2019 for electric, natural gas, and steam customers of WE, WPS, and WG. Based on the PSCW order, the authorized ROE for WE, WPS, and WG remained at

10.2

%

,

10.0

%

, and

10.3

%

, respectively, and the capital cost structure for all of our Wisconsin utilities remained unchanged through 2019.

In addition to freezing base rates, the settlement agreement extended and expanded the electric real-time market pricing program options for large commercial and industrial customers and mitigated the continued growth of certain escrowed costs at WE during

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


the base rate freeze period by accelerating the recognition of certain tax benefits. WE was flowing through the tax benefit of its repair-related deferred tax liabilities in 2018 and 2019, to maintain certain regulatory asset balances at their December 31, 2017 levels. While WE would typically follow the normalization accounting method and utilize the tax benefits of the deferred tax liabilities in rate-making as an offset to rate base, benefiting customers over time, the federal tax code does allow for passing these tax repair-related benefits to ratepayers much sooner using the flow through accounting method. The flow through treatment of the repair-related deferred tax liabilities offset the negative income statement impact of holding the regulatory assets level, resulting in

no

change to net income.

The agreement also allowed WPS to extend through 2019, the deferral for the revenue requirement of ReACT™ costs above the authorized

$

275.0

million

level, and other deferrals related to WPS's electric real-time market pricing program and network transmission expenses.

Pursuant to the settlement agreement, WPS also agreed to adopt, beginning in 2018, the earnings sharing mechanism that had been in place for WE and WG since January 2016, and all

three

utilities agreed to keep the mechanism in place through 2019. Under this earnings sharing mechanism, if WE, WPS, or WG earned above its authorized ROE,


%

of the first


basis points of additional utility earnings were required to be refunded to customers. All utility earnings above the first


basis points were also required to be refunded to customers.

Liquefied Natural Gas Facilities

On November 1, 2019, WE and WG filed a joint application with the PSCW requesting approval for each company to construct its own LNG facility. If approved, each facility would provide

one

billion cubic feet of natural gas supply to meet peak demand without requiring the construction of additional interstate pipeline capacity. These facilities are expected to reduce the likelihood of constraints on WE's and WG's natural gas systems during the highest demand days of winter. The total cost of both projects is estimated to be approximately

$


million

, with approximately half being invested by each utility. Commercial operation of the LNG facilities is targeted for the end of 2023.

Solar Generation Projects

On August 1, 2019, WE, along with an unaffiliated utility, filed an application with the PSCW for approval to acquire an ownership interest in a proposed solar project, Badger Hollow II, that will be located in Iowa County, Wisconsin. Once constructed, WE will own


MW of the output of this project. WE's share of the cost of this project is estimated to be

$


million

. At its meeting on February 20, 2020, the PSCW approved the acquisition of this project. The approval is still subject to WE's receipt and review of a final written order from the PSCW. Commercial operation of Badger Hollow II is targeted for the end of 2021.

In May 2018, WPS, along with an unaffiliated utility, filed an application with the PSCW for approval to acquire ownership interests in

two

solar projects in Wisconsin. Badger Hollow I is located in Iowa County, Wisconsin, and Two Creeks is located in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin. Once constructed, WPS will own


MW of the output of each project for a total of


MW. WPS's share of the cost of both projects is estimated to be

$


million

. The PSCW approved the acquisition of these

two

projects in April 2019. Commercial operation of both projects is targeted for the end of 2020.

Acquisition of a Wind Energy Generation Facility in Wisconsin

In October 2017, WPS, along with

two

other unaffiliated utilities, entered into an agreement to purchase Forward Wind Energy Center, which consists of


wind turbines located in Wisconsin with a total capacity of


MW. The FERC approved the transaction in January 2018, and the PSCW approved the transaction in March 2018. The transaction closed in April 2018. See

Note 2, Acquisitions

, for more information.

Natural Gas Storage Facilities in Michigan

In January 2017, we signed an agreement for the acquisition of Bluewater. Bluewater owns natural gas storage facilities in Michigan that provide approximately

one-third

of the current storage needs for the natural gas operations of WE, WPS, and WG. As a result of this agreement, WE, WPS, and WG filed a request with the PSCW in February 2017 for a declaratory ruling on various items associated with the storage facilities. In the filing, WE, WPS, and WG requested that the PSCW review and confirm the reasonableness and prudency of their potential long-term storage service agreements and interstate natural gas transportation contracts related to the storage facilities. WE, WPS, and WG also requested approval to amend our Affiliated Interest Agreement to

2019 Form 10-K


WEC Energy Group, Inc.


ensure WBS and our other subsidiaries could provide services to the storage facilities. During June 2017, the PSCW granted, subject to various conditions, these declarations and approvals, and we acquired Bluewater on June 30, 2017. In September 2017, WE, WPS, and WG entered into the long-term service agreements for the natural gas storage, which were approved by the PSCW in November 2017. See

Note 2, Acquisitions

Illinois Proceedings

In December 2015, the ICC ordered a series of stakeholder workshops to evaluate PGL's SMP, which were completed in March 2016. In July 2016, the ICC initiated a proceeding to review, among other things, the planning, reporting, and monitoring of the program, including the target end date for the program, and issued a final order in January 2018. The order did not have a significant impact on PGL's existing SMP design and execution. An appeal related to the final order was filed by the Illinois AG in April 2018. In June 2019, the Illinois Appellate Court issued its ruling affirming the ICC’s final order. The appeal period has since expired for this ruling.

Qualifying Infrastructure Plant Rider

In July 2013, Illinois Public Act 98-0057, The Natural Gas Consumer, Safety & Reliability Act, became law. This law provides PGL with a cost recovery mechanism that allows collection, through a surcharge on customer bills, of prudently incurred costs to upgrade Illinois natural gas infrastructure. In September 2013, PGL filed with the ICC requesting the proposed rider, which was approved in January 2014.

PGL's QIP rider is subject to an annual reconciliation whereby costs are reviewed for accuracy and prudency. In March 2019, PGL filed its 2018 reconciliation with the ICC, which, along with the 2017 and 2016 reconciliations, are still pending. In July 2019, the ICC approved a settlement of the 2015 reconciliation, which included a rate base reduction of

$

7.0

million

and a

$

7.3

million

refund to ratepayers. As of

December 31, 2019

, all amounts had been refunded.

As of

December 31, 2019

, there can be

no

assurance that all costs incurred under PGL's QIP rider during the open reconciliation years will be deemed recoverable by the ICC.

Variable Income Tax Adjustment Rider

In April 2018, the ICC approved the VITA proposed by PGL and NSG. The VITA recovers or refunds changes in income tax expense resulting from differences in income tax rates and amortization of deferred tax excesses and deficiencies (in accordance with the Tax Legislation) from the amounts used in the last PGL and NSG rate case, effective January 25, 2018.

Minnesota Energy Resources Corporation

2018 Minnesota Rate Order

In October 2017, MERC initiated a rate proceeding with the MPUC. In December 2018, the MPUC issued a final written order for MERC. The order authorized a retail natural gas rate increase of

$

3.1

million

(

1.26

%

). The rates reflect a

9.7

%

ROE and a common equity component average of

50.9

%

. The final rates were implemented on July 1, 2019. The final approved rate increase was lower than the interim rates collected from customers during 2018 and through June 30, 2019. Therefore, MERC refunded

$

8.2

million

to its customers during the second half of 2019.

The final order addressed the various impacts of the Tax Legislation, including the remeasurement of deferred tax balances. All of the impacts from the Tax Legislation have been included in base rates. The order also approved MERC's continued use of its decoupling mechanism for residential customers. Effective January 1, 2019, MERC's small commercial and industrial customers are no longer included in the decoupling mechanism.

2021 Rate Application

On February 3, 2020, MGU provided notification to the MPSC of its intent to file an application requesting an increase to its natural gas rates. The application is expected to be filed in March 2020 and to request new rates be effective January 1, 2021. MGU is currently in the process of evaluating its rate request.

Upper Michigan Energy Resources Corporation

Formation of Upper Michigan Energy Resources Corporation

In December 2016, both the MPSC and the PSCW approved the operation of UMERC as a stand-alone utility in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and UMERC became operational effective January 1, 2017. This utility holds the electric and natural gas distribution assets, previously held by WE and WPS, located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

In August 2016, we entered into an agreement with Tilden under which Tilden agreed to purchase electric power from UMERC for its iron ore mine for


years

, contingent upon UMERC's construction of approximately


MW of natural gas-fired generation in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. In October 2017, the MPSC approved both the agreement with Tilden and UMERC's application for a certificate of necessity to begin construction of the proposed generation.

On March 31, 2019, UMERC's new generation solution in the Upper Peninsula began commercial operation, and the agreement with Tilden became effective. The cost of the new units was approximately

$


million

(

$


million

with AFUDC),


%

of which is expected to be recovered from Tilden, with the remaining


%

expected to be recovered from UMERC's other utility customers. Tilden remained a customer of WE until the new generation began commercial operation.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Financial Instruments Credit Losses

Effective January 1, 2020, we adopted FASB ASU 2016-13, "Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments," using the modified retrospective transition method. This ASU amends the impairment model to utilize an expected loss methodology in place of the incurred loss methodology for financial instruments. The amendment requires entities to consider a broader range of information to estimate expected credit losses, which may result in earlier recognition of loss. Our exposure to credit losses is related to our accounts receivable and unbilled revenue balances, which are primarily generated from the sale of electricity and natural gas by our regulated utility operations.

Because our exposure to credit losses for many of our regulated utility customers is mitigated by regulatory mechanisms we have in place, the noncash cumulative effect adjustment we recorded to retained earnings on January 1, 2020, as a result of our adoption of this standard, was not significant. The most significant impact of implementing this ASU will be in the form of additional disclosures that will be required in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020. These disclosures are intended to provide information that will help users of our financial statements analyze our exposure to credit risk and understand how we estimate our allowance for credit losses.

Cloud Computing

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract. The standard allows entities who are customers in hosting arrangements that are service contracts to apply the existing internal-use software guidance to determine which implementation costs to capitalize as an asset related to the service contract and which costs to expense. The guidance specifies classification for capitalizing implementation costs and related amortization expense within the financial statements and requires additional disclosures. The adoption of ASU 2018-15, effective January 1, 2020, did not have a significant impact on our financial statements.

Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, Disclosure Framework: Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans. The pronouncement modifies the disclosure requirements for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The guidance removes disclosures that are no longer considered cost beneficial, clarifies the specific requirements of disclosures and adds disclosure requirements identified as relevant. The modifications affect annual period disclosures and must be applied on a retrospective basis to all periods presented. The guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the effects of this pronouncement on the notes to our financial statements.

Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective (i) in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act and (ii) to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our and our subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control

–

Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its evaluation, our management concluded that our and our subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2019

.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the fourth quarter of


that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
