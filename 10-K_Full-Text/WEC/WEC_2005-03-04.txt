PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

INTRODUCTION

Wisconsin Energy Corporation was incorporated in the state of Wisconsin in 1981 and became a diversified holding company in 1986. We maintain our principal executive offices in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Unless qualified by their context when
used in this document, the terms Wisconsin Energy, the Company, our, us or we refer to the holding company and all of its subsidiaries.

Historically we conducted our operations primarily in three operating segments: a utility energy segment, a non-utility energy segment and a manufacturing segment. The
sale of our manufacturing segment was completed effective July 31, 2004 and this segment is reported as discontinued operations. Our primary subsidiaries are Wisconsin Electric Power Company (Wisconsin Electric), Wisconsin Gas LLC, formerly
Wisconsin Gas Company (Wisconsin Gas) and W.E. Power, LLC (We Power).

Utility Energy Segment:

Our utility energy segment consists of: Wisconsin Electric, which serves approximately 1,081,400 electric customers in Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, approximately
437,800 gas customers in Wisconsin and approximately 460 steam customers in metro Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Wisconsin Gas, which serves approximately 577,000 gas customers in Wisconsin and about 2,660 water customers in suburban Milwaukee, Wisconsin;
and Edison Sault Electric Company (Edison Sault), which serves approximately 22,700 electric customers in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. In April 2002, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas began doing business under the trade name of “We
Energies”.

Non-Utility Energy
Segment:

Our non-utility energy segment consists of We Power and Wisvest Corporation (Wisvest). We Power was formed in 2001 to design, construct, own, finance and lease the new generating capacity included in our

Power the Future

strategy. See Item 7 for more information on

Power the Future

. Wisvest owns an investment in an electric generating facility and has investments in other energy-related entities and assets. We have substantially
reduced the operations of Wisvest since 2000.

Manufacturing
Segment:

Our manufacturing segment consisted of WICOR Industries, LLC (WICOR Industries), an intermediary holding company, and its three primary subsidiaries: Sta-Rite Industries, LLC, SHURflo, LLC and Hypro, LLC,
which are manufacturers of pumps, water treatment products and fluid handling equipment with manufacturing, sales and distribution facilities in the United States and several other countries. Effective July 31, 2004, we sold this segment to Pentair,
Inc. (Pentair).

Power the Future
Strategy:

In late February 2001, we filed a petition with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) starting the regulatory review process for a 10-year strategy, originally proposed in September 2000, to
improve the supply and reliability of electricity in Wisconsin. As part of our

Power the Future

strategy, we are: (1) investing in new natural gas-fired and coal-fired electric generating facilities, (2) upgrading Wisconsin Electric’s
existing electric generating facilities and (3) investing in upgrades of our existing energy distribution system. Also, as part of this strategy, we announced and began implementing plans to divest non-core assets and operations in our non-utility
energy segment and to reduce our real estate operations. Implementation of the

Power the Future

strategy is subject to a number of state and federal regulatory approvals and judicial review. Additional information concerning

Power the
Future

may be found below under “Non-Utility Energy Segment” and “Environmental Compliance” as well as in Item 7.

For further financial information about our business segments, see “Results of Operations” in Item 7 and “Note Q - Segment Reporting” in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

We have our annual and periodical
filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) available, free of charge, through our Internet website

UTILITY ENERGY SEGMENT

ELECTRIC
UTILITY OPERATIONS

Our electric utility operations consist of the electric
operations of Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault. Wisconsin Electric, which is the largest electric utility in the state of Wisconsin, generates and distributes electric energy in a territory in southeastern (including the metropolitan Milwaukee
area), east central and northern Wisconsin and in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Edison Sault generates and distributes electric energy in a territory in the eastern Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

Electric
Sales

See “Consolidated Selected Utility Operating Data” in Item
6 for certain electric utility operating information by customer class during the period 2000 through 2004.

Wisconsin Electric:

Wisconsin Electric is authorized to provide retail electric service in designated territories in the state of Wisconsin, as established by indeterminate
permits, certificates of public convenience and necessity or boundary agreements with other utilities, and in certain territories in the state of Michigan pursuant to franchises granted by municipalities. Wisconsin Electric also sells wholesale
electric power.

Electric energy sales by Wisconsin Electric to all classes of
customers totaled approximately 31.6 million megawatt hours (mwh) during 2004, a 1.5% increase from 2003. Approximately 0.4 million of megawatt-hour sales during 2004 were to Edison Sault. Wisconsin Electric had approximately 1,081,400 electric
customers at December 31, 2004, an increase of 1.3% since December 31, 2003.

Edison Sault:

Edison Sault is authorized to provide retail electric service in certain territories in the state of Michigan pursuant to franchises granted by municipalities. Edison Sault also provides
wholesale electric service under contract with one rural cooperative.

Electric
energy sales by Edison Sault to all classes of customers totaled approximately 0.9 million megawatt hours during both 2004 and 2003. No significant megawatt-hour sales during 2004 were to Wisconsin Electric. Edison Sault had approximately 22,700
electric customers at December 31, 2004 and 22,000 electric customers at December 31, 2003.

Electric Sales Growth:

Assuming moderate growth in the economy of our electric utility service territories and normal weather, we presently anticipate total retail and municipal
electric kilowatt-hour sales of our utility energy segment to grow at an annual rate of 1.5% to 2.0% over the next five years. We also anticipate that our annual electric demand will grow at a rate of 2.0% to 3.0% over the next five years.

Sales To Large Electric Retail
Customers:

Wisconsin Electric provides electric utility service to a diversified base of customers in such industries as mining, paper, foundry, food products and machinery production, as well as to large retail
chains. Edison Sault provides electric service to industrial accounts in the paper, crude oil pipeline and limestone quarry industries as well as to several state and federal government facilities.

Our largest retail electric customers are two iron ore mines located in the Upper Peninsula
of Michigan. Wisconsin Electric currently has special negotiated power-sales contracts with these mines that expire in December 2007. The


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2004 Form 10-K

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS – (Cont’d)

combined electric energy sales to the two mines accounted for 7.4% and 7.1% of our total electric utility energy sales during 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Sales to Wholesale Customers:

During 2004, Wisconsin
Electric sold wholesale electric energy to three municipally owned systems, two rural cooperatives and one municipal joint action agency located in the states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Illinois. Wholesale electric energy sales by Wisconsin Electric
were also made to 34 other public utilities and power marketers throughout the region under rates approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Edison Sault sold wholesale electric energy to one rural cooperative during 2004.
Wholesale sales accounted for approximately 9.1% of our total electric energy sales and 4.7% of total electric operating revenues during 2004 compared with 8.9% of total electric energy sales and 4.6% of total electric operating revenues during
2003.

Electric System Reliability
Matters:

Electric energy sales are impacted by seasonal factors and varying weather conditions from year-to-year. As a summer peaking utility, we reached our 2004 electric peak demand obligation of 5,789 megawatts on
July 20, 2004 and our all-time electric peak demand obligation of 6,376 megawatts on August 31, 2003. The summer period is the most relevant period for capacity planning purposes for us as a result of cooling load. Wisconsin Electric is a member of
the MAIN reliability council. MAIN guidelines direct members to have a minimum 14.12% planning reserve margin in place prior to the upcoming peak season. PSCW guidelines to electric utilities in Wisconsin advise a minimum 18% planning reserve
margin. The Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) has not provided guidelines in this area.

We had adequate capacity to meet all of our firm electric load obligations during 2004 and expect to have adequate capacity to meet all of our firm obligations during 2005. For additional information, see
“Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7. For additional information regarding our generation facilities, see “Utility Energy Segment” in Item 2.

Competition

Prior to 2003, the nation’s electric utility industry had been following a trend towards restructuring and increased competition.
However, given electric reliability problems experienced in the summer of 2003 and in the state of California in 2001 and 2002, which had previously restructured its electric industry framework, and given the current status of restructuring
initiatives in regulatory jurisdictions where we primarily do business, we do not expect to be affected by a significant change in electric regulation in the next five years. The PSCW has been and remains focused on electric reliability
infrastructure issues for the state of Wisconsin. The state of Michigan implemented electric retail access in 2002, and the FERC continues to strongly support large Regional Transmission Organizations (RTO) such as the Midwest Independent
Transmission System Operator, Inc. (Midwest ISO). For additional information, see “Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7.

Electric Supply

The table below indicates our sources of electric energy supply as a percentage of sales, for the three years ended December 31, 2004, as well as an estimate for 2005:

(a)

Estimated; includes the operation of the first natural gas-fired unit at Port Washington Generating Station scheduled to go into service early in the third quarter of 2005.


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2004 Form 10-K

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS – (Cont’d)

We have not built a base load generating plant since the mid 1980’s. Over the past few years, we have seen an increase in natural gas as a fuel source to meet
increased customer demand for electricity. Our

Power the Future

plan, which is discussed further in Item 7, “Power the Future”, includes the addition of 2,320 megawatts of generating capacity over the next seven years. We are
currently building two 545-megawatt natural gas units at an existing site in Port Washington, Wisconsin. The first natural gas unit is expected to be operational early in the third quarter of 2005. The second natural gas unit is expected to be
operational by the end of the second quarter of 2008. We also have received approval from the PSCW to build two 615-megawatt coal units at an existing site in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. The approval to build these coal units has been challenged, and this
matter is to be heard by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin in March 2005. (See Item 7, “Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity, and Capital Resources - Power the Future” for further discussions on the legal and regulatory challenges associated
with the proposed coal plants).

We believe that our

Power the Future

plan will allow us to manage the mix of fuels used to generate electricity for our customers. We believe that it is in the best interests of our customers to provide a diverse fuel mix that is expected to maintain a stable, reliable and
affordable energy supply in our service territory.

Our net generation totaled
29.2 million megawatt hours during 2004 compared with 28.0 million megawatt hours during 2003 and 27.8 million megawatt hours during 2002. When compared with the past three years, net generation as a percent of our total electric energy supply is
expected to decrease during 2005 in large part due to the Port Washington unit retirements associated with construction of two natural gas-fired generation facilities at the same site, one of which is expected to become operational in 2005, and two
nuclear generating facility outages scheduled for 2005. Purchased power is expected to be the primary source of additional electric energy supply required to meet load growth in the next year.

Our average fuel and purchased power costs per megawatt hour by fuel type for the years ended
December 31 are shown below.

We use natural gas to fuel our peaking
units that are designed to run for short durations. The Port Washington natural gas-fired units under construction as part of

Power the Future

are combined cycle facilities that are designed to run for longer durations and at a lower
operating cost as compared to a peaking unit.

Coal costs in 2004 were
adversely affected by the failure of one of our transportation suppliers to deliver coal under a long-term contract, forcing us to obtain replacement coal at substantially higher prices. We are currently evaluating various remedies available for
this delivery failure under the transportation contract.

The fuel costs for
coal and nuclear generation are relatively stable as the fuel costs are under long-term contracts. However, many existing coal and rail contracts expire at the end of 2005. Based on current market conditions, we expect coal and transportation costs
to increase more significantly than our most recent historical trend beginning in 2006.

The costs for natural gas and purchased power, which is primarily natural gas-fired, are more volatile and have experienced significant increases since 2002. Beginning in late 2003 and concurrent with the approval of the PSCW, we
established hedging programs to mitigate significant price fluctuations due to gas prices. This hedging program is generally implemented on a 18 month forward-looking basis. Proceeds related to the natural gas hedging program are reflected in the
2004 average costs of Natural Gas and Purchased Power shown above.

(a)

Dependable capability is the net power output under average operating conditions with equipment in an average state of repair as of a given month in a given year. The values were
established by test and may change slightly from year to year.

(b)

The dual fuel facilities burn oil only if natural gas is not available due to constraints on the natural gas pipeline and/or at the local gas distribution company that delivers gas
to the plants.

Coal-Fired Generation

Coal Supply:

Wisconsin Electric diversifies the coal
supply for its power plants by purchasing coal from mines in northern and central Appalachia as well as from various western mines. During 2005, 97.6% of Wisconsin Electric’s projected coal requirements of 10.5 million tons will be under
contracts which are not tied to 2005 market pricing fluctuations. Wisconsin Electric does not anticipate any problem in procuring its remaining 2005 coal requirements through short-term or spot purchases and inventory adjustments. Our coal-fired
generation consists of six operating plants with a dependable capability of approximately 3,334 megawatts.

Following is a summary of the annual tonnage amounts for Wisconsin Electric’s principal long-term coal contracts by the month and year in which the contracts expire.

As of the beginning of 2005, Wisconsin
Electric had approximately a 77-day supply of coal in inventory at its coal-fired facilities.

Coal Deliveries:

Approximately 75% of Wisconsin Electric’s 2005 coal requirements are expected to be delivered by Wisconsin Electric-owned or leased unit trains. The unit
trains will transport coal for the Oak Creek and Pleasant Prairie Power Plants from Wyoming mines. Coal from Pennsylvania and Colorado mines is also transported via rail to Lake Erie or Lake Michigan transfer docks and delivered to the Valley and
Milwaukee County Power Plants. Montana and Wyoming coal for Presque Isle Power Plant is transported via rail to Superior, Wisconsin, placed in dock storage and reloaded into lake vessels for plant delivery. Central Appalachia and Colorado coal bound
for Presque Isle Power Plant is shipped via rail to Lake Erie and Lake Michigan (Chicago) coal transfer docks, respectively, for lake vessel delivery to the plant.

Environmental Matters:

For information regarding emission restrictions, especially as they relate to
coal-fired generating facilities, see “Environmental Compliance”.

Nuclear Generation

Point Beach Nuclear Plant:

Wisconsin Electric owns two 518-megawatt electric generating units at Point Beach Nuclear Plant (Point Beach) in Two Rivers, Wisconsin. The United States
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) operating licenses for Point Beach expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2. The Nuclear


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2004 Form 10-K

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS – (Cont’d)

Management Company, LLC (NMC) and Wisconsin Electric filed an application with the NRC in February 2004 to renew the operating licenses for both of Wisconsin
Electric’s nuclear reactors for an additional 20 years. Based upon the NRC’s published schedule, we expect the NRC to make a decision on the license extension application by January 2006. For additional information concerning Point Beach,
see “Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7 and “Note H – Nuclear Operations” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Nuclear Management Company:

NMC, owned by our affiliate
WEC Nuclear Corporation and the affiliates of four other unaffiliated investor-owned utilities in the region, operates Point Beach. NMC operates eight nuclear generating units at six sites in the states of Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, and Iowa
with a total combined generating capacity of approximately 4,600 megawatts as of December 31, 2004. Wisconsin Electric continues to own Point Beach and retains exclusive rights to the energy generated by the plant as well as financial responsibility
for the safe operation, maintenance and decommissioning of Point Beach. For further information, see “Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7.

Nuclear Fuel Supply:

Wisconsin Electric purchases uranium concentrates (Yellowcake) and contracts for
its conversion, enrichment and fabrication. There have been numerous events in the nuclear fuel supply market that have affected the price of uranium concentrates, conversion service and enrichment services. The price of the fuel commodities has
risen steadily since the fourth quarter of 2003 and we anticipate that the price will continue to rise due to current demand exceeding current supply. NMC is continually monitoring the nuclear fuel commodities market to assess current and future
commodity pricing and adjusting purchasing strategies to address changes in the market conditions. Wisconsin Electric maintains title to the nuclear fuel until fabricated fuel assemblies are delivered to Point Beach; it is then sold to and leased
back from the Wisconsin Electric Fuel Trust. For further information concerning this nuclear fuel lease, see “Note J - Long-Term Debt” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Uranium Requirements:

Wisconsin Electric requires
approximately 400,000 pounds of Yellowcake to refuel a generating unit at Point Beach. Point Beach has staggered fuel cycles that are expected to average approximately 18 months in duration. The supply of Yellowcake for these refuelings is currently
provided through one long-term contract, which supplies 100% of the annual requirements through 2007, with an option to extend the current contract through 2009.

Conversion:

Wisconsin Electric, through NMC, has a long-term contract with a provider of uranium
conversion services to supply 100% of the conversion requirements for the Point Beach reactors through 2005. Wisconsin Electric has the option to utilize an NMC fleet contract for conversion services to meet approximately 56% of its conversion
requirements through 2006. We are currently pursuing additional contracts for conversion services for Point Beach to meet the remaining 2006 requirements and additional contracts for supply beyond 2006.

Enrichment:

Wisconsin Electric effectively has one
long-term contract and another contract through NMC that provide for 100% of the required enrichment services for the Point Beach reactors through the year 2006 and approximately 38% of the enrichment services requirements through 2009.

Fabrication:

Fabrication of fuel assemblies from
enriched uranium for Point Beach is covered under a contract with Westinghouse Electric Company, LLC for the balance of the plant’s current operating licenses.

Used Nuclear Fuel Storage & Disposal:

For information concerning used fuel storage and disposal
issues, see “Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7.

Nuclear Decommissioning:

Wisconsin Electric provides for costs associated with the eventual decommissioning of Point Beach through the use of an external trust fund. Payments to
this fund, together with investment results, brought the balance in the fund at December 31, 2004 to approximately $737.8 million. For additional information regarding decommissioning, see “Note H - Nuclear Operations” in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Hydroelectric Generation

Wisconsin Electric:

Wisconsin Electric’s hydroelectric generating system consists of thirteen operating plants with a total installed capacity of approximately 89 megawatts
and a dependable capability of approximately 57 megawatts. Of these thirteen plants, twelve are licensed by the FERC. The thirteenth plant, with an installed generating capacity of approximately 2 megawatts, does not require a license. Of the twelve
licensed plants, eleven plants, representing a total of 85 megawatts of installed capacity, have long-term licenses from the FERC. A fourteenth non-operating plant, the Sturgeon project, was not relicensed and is in the process of being removed.
Staged removal of the Sturgeon project has commenced and will be completed by 2006.

Edison Sault:

Edison Sault’s primary source of generation is its 30-megawatt hydroelectric generating plant located on the St. Marys River in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. The water for this facility
is leased under a contract with the United States Army Corps of Engineers with tenure to December 31, 2050. However, the Secretary of the Army has the right to terminate the contract after December 2020. Edison Sault pays for all water taken from
the St. Marys River at predetermined rates with a minimum annual payment of $0.1 million. The total flow of water taken out of Lake Superior, which in effect is the flow of water in the St. Marys River, is under the direction and control of the
International Joint Commission, created by the Boundary Water Treaty of 1909 between the United States and Great Britain, now represented by Canada.

Hydroelectric generation is also purchased by Edison Sault under contract from the United States Army Corps of Engineers’ hydroelectric generating plant located
within the Soo Locks complex on the St. Marys River in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. This 17-megawatt contract has a tenure to November 1, 2040 and cannot be terminated by the United States government prior to November 1, 2030.

Natural
Gas-Fired Generation

Our natural gas-fired generation consists of four
operating plants with a dependable capability of approximately 888 megawatts. In addition, early in the third quarter of 2005, we expect to add an additional 545 megawatts of natural gas-fired generation with the first of two units at the Port
Washington plant under our

Power the Future

plan. The second 545-megawatt unit at Port Washington is estimated to come on line in 2008.

We purchase natural gas for these plants on the spot market from gas marketers and producers and we arrange for transportation of the natural gas to our plants. We have
an interruptible balancing and storage agreement that is intended to facilitate the variable usage pattern of the plants.

The PSCW has approved a program that allows us to hedge up to 75% of our estimated gas purchases for electric generation. This program is intended to minimize the
volatility of natural gas prices to our customers. The costs of this program are included in our fuel and purchased power costs.

Oil-Fired Generation

Fuel oil is used for the combustion turbines at the Point Beach and Germantown Power Plants units 1-4. It is also used for boiler ignition
and flame stabilization at the Presque Isle Power Plant, as backup for ignition at the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant and as a backup fuel for the natural gas-fired turbines discussed above. Our oil-fired generation has a dependable capability of
approximately 275 megawatts. The natural gas facilities burn oil only if natural gas is not available due to constraints on the natural gas pipeline and/or at the local gas distribution company that delivers gas to the plants. Fuel oil requirements
are purchased under partnering agreements with suppliers that assist Wisconsin Electric with inventory tracking and oil market price trends.

Purchase Power Commitments

We enter into short and long-term purchase power commitments to meet a portion of our
anticipated electric energy supply needs. The following table identifies our purchase power commitments over the next five years:


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2004 Form 10-K

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS – (Cont’d)

The majority of these purchase power
commitments are tolling arrangements whereby we are responsible for the procurement, delivery and cost of natural gas fuel related to specific units identified in the contracts. The energy costs for the balance of the commitments are tied to the
costs of natural gas.

Electric Transmission and Energy Markets

American Transmission Company:

Effective January 1, 2001, we transferred all of the electric utility transmission assets of Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault to American Transmission Company LLC (ATC)
in exchange for ownership interests in this new company. Joining ATC is consistent with the FERC’s Order No. 2000, designed to foster competition, efficiency and reliability in the electric industry.

ATC is owned and governed by the utilities that contributed facilities or capital in
accordance with 1999 Wisconsin Act 9. At December 31, 2004, we owned approximately 37.8% of ATC.

ATC’s sole business is to provide reliable, economic electric transmission service to all customers in a fair and equitable manner. Specifically, ATC plans, constructs, operates, maintains and expands
transmission facilities it owns to provide for adequate and reliable transmission of electric power. ATC is expected to provide comparable service to all customers, including Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault, and to support effective competition
in energy markets without favoring any market participant. ATC is regulated by the FERC for all rate terms and conditions of service and is a transmission-owning member of the Midwest ISO. As of February 1, 2002, operational control of ATC’s
transmission system was transferred to the Midwest ISO, and Wisconsin Electric is a non-transmission owning member and customer of the Midwest ISO.

Wisconsin Electric has contracted to provide, at cost, services required by ATC and which ATC is not able to provide itself at this time. Services include transmission
line and substation operation and maintenance, engineering, project, real estate, environmental, supply chain, control center, accounting and miscellaneous services. The annual cost of the services provided by Wisconsin Electric was approximately
$21 million, $33 million, and $52 million during 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively, and is expected to continue to decline in future years as ATC provides more of these services itself.

Midwest ISO:

In connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, the Midwest ISO is in the process of
developing and implementing a bid-based energy market. In March 2004, Midwest ISO filed a proposed Energy Markets Tariff that was approved by the FERC, subject to modification, in August 2004 and which will govern the operation of the market. The
scheduled implementation date for the bid-based energy market is April 1, 2005.

In the Midwest ISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by load serving entities (LSEs) located in the service territories of each Midwest ISO transmission owner in proportion to the load served by the LSE versus the total load
of the service territory. This “license plate” rate design is scheduled to be replaced after a six-year phase-in of rates in Midwest ISO; but it also was the subject of a proceeding in which a new rate design governing service in the
combined Midwest ISO and PJM Interconnection, L.L.C (PJM) service territories was to be developed. In November 2004, FERC issued an order allowing the existing Midwest ISO license plate rate design to continue until at least February 1, 2008.

Lost Revenue Charges:

The FERC permits
transmission owning utilities that have not joined an RTO to propose a charge to recover revenues that would be lost as a result of RTO membership. These lost revenues result from FERC’s requirement that, within an RTO and for transmission
between the systems operated by the Midwest ISO and PJM, entities that currently pay a transmission charge to move energy through or out of a neighboring

BUSINESS – (Cont’d)

transmission system will no longer pay this charge to the neighboring transmission system owner or operator upon the neighboring transmission system owner or operator
joining an RTO.

For further information, see “Factors Affecting Results,
Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7.

Renewable Electric Energy

Our

Power the Future

plan includes a commitment to significantly increase the amount of renewable energy generation we utilize beyond that required by Wisconsin
law. Our target is to provide 5% of our retail electric sales in Wisconsin from renewable energy resources by the year 2011. In addition, Wisconsin Electric has an “

Energy For Tomorrow®

” renewable energy program to provide our
customers the opportunity to purchase energy from renewable resources.

Wisconsin’s public benefits legislation requires that for 2005, retail energy providers supply 1.2% of a 3 year average of their Wisconsin retail electric sales from renewable energy. The required minimum percentage increases to 2.2%
by the year 2011. For more information about public benefits see “Regulation - Utility Energy Segment” below.

GAS UTILITY OPERATIONS

Our gas utility operations consist of Wisconsin Gas and the gas operations of Wisconsin Electric. Both companies are authorized to provide
retail gas distribution service in designated territories in the state of Wisconsin, as established by indeterminate permits, certificates of public convenience and necessity, or boundary agreements with other utilities. The two companies also
transport customer-owned gas. Wisconsin Gas, the largest natural gas distribution utility in Wisconsin, operates throughout the state including the City of Milwaukee.

Wisconsin Electric’s gas utility operates in three distinct service
areas: west and south of the City of Milwaukee, the Appleton area and areas within Iron and Vilas Counties, Wisconsin.

Gas Deliveries

Our gas utility business is highly seasonal due to the heating requirements of residential and commercial customers. Annual gas sales are also impacted by the variability of winter temperatures.

See “Consolidated Selected Utility Operating Data” in Item 6 for selected gas
utility operating information by customer class during the period 2000 through 2004.

Wisconsin Gas:

In 2004, Wisconsin Gas delivered a total of approximately 1,233.0 million therms, including customer-owned transported gas, a 3.9% decrease compared with 2003. As of December 31, 2004,
Wisconsin Gas was transporting gas for approximately 1,105 customers who purchased gas directly from other suppliers. Transported gas accounted for approximately 39% of the total volumes delivered by Wisconsin Gas during 2004, 38% during 2003 and
39% during 2002. Wisconsin Gas had approximately 577,000 customers at December 31, 2004, an increase of approximately 1.3% since December 31, 2003.

The maximum daily send-out of Wisconsin Gas during 2004 was 922,076 dekatherms on January 29, 2004. A dekatherm is equivalent to ten therms or one million British thermal
units.

Wisconsin Electric:

Total gas
therms delivered by Wisconsin Electric, including customer-owned transported gas, were approximately 835.1 million therms during 2004, a 6.0% decrease compared with 2003. At December 31, 2004, Wisconsin Electric was transporting gas for
approximately 368 customers who purchased gas directly from other suppliers. Transported gas accounted for approximately 34% of the total volumes delivered by Wisconsin Electric during 2004, 35% during 2003 and 38% during 2002. Wisconsin Electric
had approximately 437,800 gas customers at December 31, 2004, an increase of approximately 2.1% since December 31, 2003.

Wisconsin Electric’s maximum daily send-out during 2004 was 682,933 dekatherms on January 29, 2004.

Sales to Large Gas Customers:

We provide gas utility service to a diversified base of industrial customers who are largely within our
electric service territory. Major industries served include the paper, food products and fabricated metal products industries. Fuel used for Wisconsin Electric’s electric energy supply represents our largest transportation customer.

Gas Deliveries Growth:

We currently forecast total
therm deliveries of natural gas to grow at an annual rate of approximately 3.2% for the combined gas operations of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas over the five-year period ending December 31, 2009. This forecast reflects a current year
normalized sales level and assumes moderate growth in the economy of our gas utility service territories, normal weather, and incremental

Power the Future

demand.

Competition

Competition in varying degrees exists between natural gas and other forms of energy available
to consumers. Many of our large commercial and industrial customers are dual-fuel customers that are equipped to switch between natural gas and alternate fuels. We offer lower-priced interruptible rates and transportation services for these
customers to enable them to reduce their energy costs and use gas rather than other fuels. Under gas transportation agreements, customers purchase gas directly from gas marketers and arrange with interstate pipelines and us to have the gas
transported to the facilities where it is used. We earn substantially the same margin (difference between revenue and cost of gas) whether we sell and transport gas to customers or only transport their gas.

Our future ability to maintain our present share of the industrial dual-fuel market (the
market that is equipped to use gas or other fuels) depends on our success and the success of third-party gas marketers in obtaining long-term and short-term supplies of natural gas at competitive prices compared to other sources and in arranging or
facilitating competitively-priced transportation service for those customers that desire to buy their own gas supplies.

Federal and state regulators continue to implement policies to bring more competition to the gas industry. For information concerning proceedings by the PSCW to consider
how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the gas industry, see “Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7. While the gas utility
distribution function is expected to remain a highly regulated, monopoly function, the sales of the natural gas commodity and related services are expected to become increasingly subject to competition from third parties. However, it remains
uncertain if and when the current economic disincentives for small customers to choose an alternative gas commodity supplier may be removed such that we begin to face competition for the sale of gas to our smaller firm customers.

Gas Supply, Pipeline Capacity and Storage

Both Wisconsin Gas and the gas operations of Wisconsin Electric have been able to meet their
contractual obligations with both their suppliers and their customers despite periods of severe cold and unseasonably warm weather.

Pipeline Capacity and Storage:

In addition to Guardian pipeline, in which we have a one-third ownership interest and which receives
gas supply in the Joliet, Illinois market hub, the interstate pipelines serving Wisconsin originate in three major gas producing areas of North America: the Oklahoma and Texas basins, the Gulf of Mexico and western Canada. We have contracted for
long-term firm capacity from each of these areas. This strategy reflects management’s belief that overall supply security is enhanced by geographic diversification of the supply portfolios and that Canada represents an important long-term
source of reliable, competitively-priced gas.

Because of the daily and
seasonal variations in gas usage in Wisconsin, we have also contracted for substantial underground storage capacity, primarily in Michigan. Storage capacity enables us to manage significant changes in daily demand and to optimize our overall gas
supply and capacity costs. We generally inject gas into storage during the spring and summer months and withdraw it in the winter months. As a result, we can contract for less long-line pipeline capacity than would otherwise be necessary, and can
purchase gas on a more uniform daily basis from suppliers year-round. Each of these capabilities enables us to reduce our overall costs.

We also maintain high deliverability storage in the Southeast production areas, as well as in our market area. This storage capacity is designed to deliver gas when other
supplies cannot be delivered during extremely cold weather in the producing areas, which can reduce long-line supply.


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2004 Form 10-K

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS – (Cont’d)

We hold firm daily transportation and storage capacity entitlements from pipelines and other service providers under long-term contracts.

Term Gas Supply:

On a combined basis, Wisconsin Gas and
the gas operations of Wisconsin Electric currently have contracts for firm supplies with terms in excess of 30 days with suppliers for gas acquired in the Joliet, Illinois market hub and in the three producing areas discussed above. The pricing of
the term contracts is based upon first of the month indices. Combined with our storage capability, management believes that the volume of gas under contract is sufficient to meet our forecasted firm peak day demand.

Secondary Market Transactions:

Capacity release is a
mechanism by which pipeline long-line and storage capacity and gas supplies under contract can be resold in the secondary market. Local distribution companies, like Wisconsin Gas and the gas operations of Wisconsin Electric, must contract for
capacity and supply sufficient to meet the firm peak day demand of their customers. Peak or near peak demand days generally occur only a few times each year. Capacity release facilitates higher utilization of contracted capacity and supply during
those times when the full contracted capacity and supply are not needed by the utility, helping to mitigate the fixed costs associated with maintaining peak levels of capacity and gas supply. Through pre-arranged agreements and day-to-day electronic
bulletin board postings, interested parties can purchase this excess capacity and supply. The proceeds from these transactions are passed through to ratepayers, subject to the Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas gas cost incentive mechanisms
pursuant to which the companies have an opportunity to share in the cost savings. See “Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 for information on the gas cost recovery
mechanism. During 2004, we continued our active participation in the capacity release market.

Spot Market Gas Supply:

Wisconsin Gas and the gas operations of Wisconsin Electric expect to continue to make gas purchases in the 30-day spot market as price and other
circumstances dictate. We have supply relationships with a number of sellers from whom we purchase spot gas.

Hedging Gas Supply Prices:

Wisconsin Gas and the gas operations of Wisconsin Electric have PSCW approval to hedge (i) up to 50% of planned flowing gas supply using NYMEX based
natural gas options, (ii) up to 10% of planned flowing gas supply using NYMEX based natural gas future contracts and, (iii) up to 33% of planned storage withdrawals using NYMEX based natural gas options. Those approvals allow both companies to pass
100% of the hedging costs (premiums and brokerage fees) and proceeds (gains and losses) through their respective purchase gas adjustment mechanisms. Hedge targets (volumes) are provided annually to the PSCW as part of each company’s five-year
gas supply plan filing.

To the extent that opportunities develop and the
companies’ physical supply operating plans will support them, Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Electric also have PSCW approval to utilize NYMEX based natural gas derivatives to capture favorable forward market price differentials. That approval
provides for 100% of the related proceeds to accrue to the companies’ gas cost recovery (incentive) mechanisms.

Guardian Pipeline:

We have a one-third interest in a joint venture, Guardian Pipeline, L.L.C. (Guardian). Two unaffiliated companies
also have one-third interests. Guardian owns an interstate natural gas pipeline from the Joliet, Illinois market hub to southeastern Wisconsin that is designed to serve the growing demand for natural gas in Wisconsin and Northern Illinois. Guardian
pipeline began commercial operation in early December 2002. Currently, Guardian has firm precedent agreements to transport 87% of its 750,000 dekatherms per day pipeline design capacity.

Neither Wisconsin Electric nor Wisconsin Gas has an ownership interest in Guardian. However, Wisconsin Gas has committed to purchase 650,000
dekatherms (approximately 87% of the pipeline’s total capacity) per day of capacity on the pipeline over a long-term contract that expires in December 2012.

OTHER UTILITY OPERATIONS

Steam Utility Operations:

Wisconsin Electric’s steam utility generates, distributes and sells steam supplied by its Valley and
Milwaukee County Power Plants. Wisconsin Electric operates a district steam system in downtown Milwaukee and the near south side of Milwaukee. Steam is supplied to this system from Wisconsin Electric’s Valley Power Plant, a coal-fired
cogeneration facility. Wisconsin Electric also operates the steam production and distribution facilities of the Milwaukee County Power Plant located on the Milwaukee County Grounds in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin.

Annual sales of steam fluctuate from year to year based upon system growth and variations in weather conditions. During 2004, the steam utility had $22.0 million of
operating revenues from the sale of 2,869 million pounds of steam compared with $22.5 million of operating revenues from the sale of 3,073 million pounds of steam during 2003. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, steam was used by approximately 460
customers for processing, space heating, domestic hot water and humidification.

Water Utility Operations:

To leverage off of operational similarities with its natural gas business, Wisconsin Gas entered the water utility business in November 1998. As of December 31, 2004, the water
utility served about 2,660 water customers in the suburban Milwaukee area compared with approximately 2,600 customers at December 31, 2003. Wisconsin Gas also provides contract services to local municipalities and businesses within its service
territory for water system repair and maintenance. During 2004, the water utility had $1.9 million of operating revenues compared with $1.8 million of operating revenues during 2003.

REGULATION

Wisconsin Energy Corporation

Wisconsin Energy is an exempt holding company by order of the SEC under Section 3(a)(1) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended, and, accordingly,
is exempt from that law’s provisions other than with respect to certain acquisitions of securities of a public utility.

Non-Utility Asset Cap:

In October 1999, the Wisconsin State Legislature passed amendments to the non-utility asset cap provisions of
Wisconsin’s public utility holding company law as part of the 1999-2001 biennial state budget, 1999 Wisconsin Act 9. As a result, we remain subject to certain restrictions that have the potential of limiting diversification into non-utility
activities. Under the amended public utility holding company law, the sum of certain assets of all non-utility affiliates in a holding company system may not exceed 25% of the assets of all public utility affiliates. However, among other items, the
amended law exempts energy-related assets and assets, like Minergy’s, used for providing environmental engineering services and for processing waste materials, from being counted against the asset cap provided that they are employed in
qualifying businesses. As a result of these exemptions, our non-utility assets are significantly below the non-utility asset cap as of December 31, 2004.

Under our

Power the Future

plan, the cost of constructing new generating facilities to be owned by We Power is expected to qualify as energy projects under the
amended non-utility asset cap and therefore would be entirely exempt from the definition of “non-utility” property for this purpose. The remaining cost of our

Power the Future

plan represents investments in new and existing energy
distribution system assets and upgrades to existing generation assets and has no impact on the amount of non-utility assets under the non-utility asset cap test.

Utility Energy Segment

Wisconsin Electric is an exempt holding company under Section 3(a)(1) of the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended, and Rule 2 thereunder and, accordingly, is exempt from that law’s provisions other than with respect to certain acquisitions of securities of a public utility. For information on how rates are set for
our regulated entities see “Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters” in Item 7.

Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas are subject to the regulation of the PSCW as to retail electric, gas, steam and water rates in the state of Wisconsin, standards of service, issuance of securities, construction of certain new

Great Britain, now represented by Canada. The operations of Wisconsin Electric, Wisconsin Gas and Edison Sault are also subject to regulations, where applicable, of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Wisconsin Department of
Natural Resources, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality.

Electric Reliability Legislation:

In 1998, the Wisconsin State Legislature passed and the Governor of Wisconsin signed into law 1997
Wisconsin Act 204, intended to address concerns with electric reliability in the state of Wisconsin. 1997 Wisconsin Act 204 included new requirements concerning market power which utilities and their affiliates must meet in order to construct
generating facilities. The requirements apply to electric utility facilities in excess of 100 megawatts.

Public Benefits:

Public benefits legislation was included in 1999 Wisconsin Act 9. The law created new funding which is adjusted annually to be collected by all electric utilities
and remitted to the Wisconsin Department of Administration (DOA). The law also required utilities to continue to collect the funds at existing levels for low-income, conservation and environmental research and development programs and to transfer
the funds for these programs to the DOA. We implemented this change in October 2000. The utilities’ traditional role of providing these programs has shifted to the DOA, which administers the funds for a statewide public benefits program. As
part of its order authorizing the construction of the two coal units under our

Power the Future

strategy, the PSCW required us to implement an energy efficiency program for the years 2005-2008 in addition to the DOA administered programs.

This law also requires that for 2005, retail energy providers supply 1.2% of a
3 year average of their Wisconsin retail electric sales from renewable energy. The required minimum percentage increases to 2.2% by the year 2011.

Non-Utility Energy Segment

We Power is a holding company subsidiary of Wisconsin Energy and was formed to design,
construct, own, finance and lease the new generating capacity in our

Power the Future

strategy. We Power owns the interests in the companies constructing this new generating capacity (collectively, the We Power project companies). When
complete, these facilities will be leased on a long-term basis to Wisconsin Electric. We Power has received determinations from the FERC that upon the transfer of the facilities by lease to Wisconsin Electric, the We Power project companies will not
be deemed public utilities under the Federal Power Act and thus will not be subject to

FERC’s jurisdiction. For a short period prior to the transfer of each generation unit to Wisconsin Electric, We Power will be engaged in the sale of test power, a
FERC jurisdictional transaction. Currently, the We Power project companies have received approval from the FERC for the sale of test power to Wisconsin Electric from Port Washington Unit 1, which sales are expected to commence in March or April
2005, and for the transfer of any FERC jurisdictional facilities at Port Washington to Wisconsin Electric and/or ATC. Under Wisconsin law, We Power is not a “public utility”. Environmental permits necessary for operating the facilities are
the responsibility of the operating entity, Wisconsin Electric.

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

Environmental Expenditures

Expenditures for environmental compliance and remediation issues are included in anticipated capital expenditures described in “Liquidity and Capital Resources”
in Item 7. For discussion of additional environmental issues, see “Environmental Matters” in Item 3. For further information concerning air quality standards and rulemaking initiated by the EPA, including estimated costs of compliance, see
“Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7.

Utility Energy Segment:

Compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection requirements resulted in capital expenditures by Wisconsin Electric of approximately $78 million in 2004 compared
with $15 million in 2003. Expenditures incurred during 2004 primarily included costs associated with the installation of pollution abatement facilities at Wisconsin Electric’s power plants. These expenditures at Wisconsin Electric are expected
to approximate $147 million during 2005, reflecting nitrogen oxide (NO

x

), sulfer dioxide (SO


) and other pollution control equipment needed to comply with various rules promulgated by the EPA.

Operation, maintenance and depreciation expenses for Wisconsin Electric’s fly ash
removal equipment and other environmental protection systems are estimated to have been approximately $52 million during 2004 and $51 million during 2003.

Solid Waste Landfills

We provide for the disposal of non-ash related solid wastes and hazardous wastes through licensed independent contractors, but federal
statutory provisions impose joint and several liability on the generators of waste for certain cleanup costs. Currently there are no active cases.

Coal-Ash Landfills

Some early designed and constructed coal-ash landfills may allow the release of low levels of constituents resulting in the need for various
levels of remediation. Where Wisconsin Electric has become aware of these conditions, efforts have been expended to define the nature and extent of any release, and work has been performed to address these conditions. For additional information, see
“Note S – Commitments and Contingencies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Sites currently undergoing remediation and/or monitoring include:

Lakeside Property:

During 2001, Wisconsin Electric completed an investigation of property that was used
primarily for coal storage, fuel oil transport and coal ash disposal in support of the former Lakeside Power Plant in St. Francis, Wisconsin. Excavation and utilization of residual coal at the site, slope stabilization and cover construction have
been completed. Currently, discussion is taking place with neighbors and other interested parties to determine the ultimate use of the remediated property and some other adjacent land also owned by Wisconsin Electric. Future costs for remediation of
this site are estimated to be approximately $1.0 million.

Oak Creek North Landfill:

Groundwater impairments at this landfill, located in the City of Oak Creek, Wisconsin, prompted Wisconsin
Electric to investigate, during 1998, the condition of the existing cover and other conditions at the site. Surface water drainage improvements were implemented at this site during 1999 and 2000, which are expected to eliminate ash contact with
water and remove unwanted ponding of water near monitoring systems. Future costs for remediation are estimated to be approximately $1.5 million and involve reconfiguration of the site and construction of a new cap, which will be accomplished as a
part of site upgrades needed to facilitate construction of the new power plants.

Manufactured Gas Plant Sites

We are reviewing and addressing environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant sites. See “Note S - Commitments and Contingencies” in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Air Quality

The 1990 amendments to the Federal Clean Air Act mandate significant nationwide reductions in air emissions. The most significant sections of this law applicable to the country’s electric utilities are the acid
rain and nonattainment provisions. The acid rain provisions limit SO


and NO

x

emissions in phases. The amendments Phase II requirements are having a minimal impact on our utilities because of existing cost effective compliance
strategies and previous actions taken.

The 1-hour ozone nonattainment rules
implemented by the state of Wisconsin and ozone transport rules implemented by the state of Michigan, both under authority of the Federal Clean Air Act, will limit NO

x

emissions in phases ending in 2007.

In 2004, the EPA began implementing the

National Ambient Air Quality Standards for 8-hour ozone and fine particulate matter (PM

2.5

).

See “Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7 for information concerning National Ambient Air Quality Standards established during 1997 by the EPA and ozone non-attainment
rulemaking promulgated by the EPA during 1998.

Our

Power the Future

strategy

provides a plan to meet our growing demand for electricity while using environmentally friendly equipment. We plan to build two coal units (Elm Road) at the site of Wisconsin Electric’s existing Oak Creek Power Plant. The
Elm Road units will use a supercritical pulverized coal design and state-of-the-art emission controls. Two natural gas-fired units are being constructed at Wisconsin Electric’s existing Port Washington Power Plant site, where older, less
efficient coal-fired units installed before 1950 were retired in 2003 and 2004. Implementation of our

Power the Future

plan also provides for upgrades to existing power plants and modernization to increase efficiency and reduce emissions. As
a result of the use of the latest emission reduction technologies on the new units, and the installation of equipment to reduce emissions on certain of our existing coal-fired units, the plan is expected to result in a significant reduction in
SO


, NOx and mercury emissions. In addition to the positive environmental attributes of the generation technologies,
the plan involves an increased commitment to conservation and renewable fuels, as well as a commitment to reduce greenhouse gases. For further information about our

Clean Water Act

Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that the location, design, construction and capacity of cooling water intake structures
reflect the best technology available (BTA) for minimizing adverse environmental impact. This law dates back to 1972; however, prior to September 2004, there have not been federal rules that define precisely how states and EPA regions would
determine that an existing intake meets BTA requirements. This rule establishes, for the first time, national performance standards and compliance alternatives for existing facilities that are designed to minimize the potential adverse environmental
impacts to aquatic organisms associated with water withdrawals from cooling water intakes. Costs associated with implementation of the rule for Wisconsin Electric’s Oak Creek

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In addition to those legal proceedings discussed below, we are currently, and from time to time, subject to claims and suits arising in the ordinary course of business. Although the results of these legal proceedings
cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes, after consultation with legal counsel, that the ultimate resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

We are subject to federal, state and
certain local laws and regulations governing the environmental aspects of our operations. Management believes that, perhaps with immaterial exceptions, our existing facilities are in compliance with applicable environmental requirements.

EPA Information Requests:

Wisconsin Electric
and Wisconsin Gas responded to an EPA request for information pursuant to Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act Section 104(e) for the Solvay Coke and Gas Site located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. All potentially
responsive records and corporate legal files have been reviewed and responsive information was provided in October 2004. A predecessor company of Wisconsin Electric owned a parcel of property that is within the property boundaries of the site. A
predecessor company of Wisconsin Gas had a customer and corporate relationship with the entity that owned and operated the site, Milwaukee Solvay Coke Company. Although neither company has accepted responsibility for costs of any sort related to the
property, remediation cost estimates and reserves continue to be included in the estimated manufactured gas plant values reported in “Note S - Commitments and Contingencies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

See “Environmental Compliance” in Item 1 and “Environmental
Matters,” “Manufactured Gas Plant Sites,” “Ash Landfill Sites” and “EPA Information Requests” in Note S- “Commitments and Contingencies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are
incorporated by reference herein, for a discussion of matters related to certain solid waste and coal-ash landfills, manufactured gas plant sites and air quality.

UTILITY RATE MATTERS

See “Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Utility Rates and
Regulatory Matters” and “Power the Future” in Item 7 for information concerning rate matters in the jurisdictions where Wisconsin Electric, Wisconsin Gas and Edison Sault do business.

OTHER MATTERS

Used Nuclear Fuel Storage and
Removal:

See “Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources – Nuclear Operations” in Item 7 for information concerning the United States Department of Energy’s breach of a contract with
Wisconsin Electric that required the Department of Energy to begin permanently removing used nuclear fuel from Point Beach Nuclear Plant by January 31, 1998.

Stray Voltage:

In recent years, several actions by dairy farmers have been commenced or claims made against Wisconsin Electric for
loss of milk production and other damages to livestock allegedly caused by stray voltage resulting from the operation of its electrical system.

On June 25, 2003, the Wisconsin Supreme Court upheld a Court of Appeals decision that affirmed a jury’s verdict against Wisconsin Electric, awarding $1.2 million to
the plaintiffs in a stray voltage lawsuit. The Wisconsin

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS – (Cont’d)

Supreme Court rejected the argument that if a utility company’s measurement of stray voltage is below the PSCW “level of concern,” such company cannot be
found negligent in stray voltage cases. The Supreme Court decision held that PSCW regulations regarding stray voltage were only minimum standards to be considered by a jury in stray voltage litigation. However, the Supreme Court remanded back to the
trial court its requirement imposed on Wisconsin Electric to replace a cable with an ungrounded distribution line. In February 2005, the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle all remaining issues in the case.

On February 26, 2004, a Wisconsin jury awarded $850,000 to a dairy farmer who alleged that
Wisconsin Electric’s distribution system caused damages to his livestock. Wisconsin Electric has filed an appeal in this decision. The claim made against Wisconsin Electric in this case is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our
financial statements. One other stray voltage case is pending against Wisconsin Electric and is currently scheduled for trial in the summer of 2005. For additional information, see “Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources -
Legal Matters” in Item 7.

Electromagnetic
Fields:

Claims have been made or threatened against electric utilities across the country for bodily injury, disease or other damages allegedly caused or aggravated by exposure to electromagnetic fields associated with
electric transmission and distribution lines. Results of scientific studies conducted to date have not established the existence of a causal connection between electromagnetic fields and any adverse health affects. Wisconsin Electric and Edison
Sault believe that their facilities are constructed and operated in accordance with applicable legal requirements and standards. Currently, there are no cases pending or threatened against Wisconsin Electric or Edison Sault with respect to damage
caused by electromagnetic fields.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

CORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS

INTRODUCTION

Wisconsin Energy Corporation is a diversified holding company with subsidiaries primarily in a utility energy segment and a non-utility
energy segment. Unless qualified by their context, when used in this document the terms Wisconsin Energy, the Company, our, us or we refer to the holding company and all of our subsidiaries.

Our utility energy segment, consisting of Wisconsin Electric Power Company (Wisconsin
Electric) and Wisconsin Gas LLC (Wisconsin Gas), both doing business under the trade name of “We Energies”, and Edison Sault Electric Company (Edison Sault), is engaged primarily in the business of generating electricity and distributing
electricity and natural gas in Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Our non-utility energy segment primarily consists of W.E. Power, LLC (We Power) and Wisvest Corporation (Wisvest). We Power is principally engaged in the engineering,
construction and development of electric power generating facilities for long-term lease to Wisconsin Electric.

CORPORATE
STRATEGY

Business Opportunities

We seek to increase shareholder value by leveraging on our core competencies. Our key
corporate strategy, announced in September 2000, is

Power the Future

. This strategy is designed to address Wisconsin’s growing electric supply needs by increasing the electric generating capacity in the state while maintaining a
fuel-diverse, reasonably priced electric supply. It is also designed to improve the delivery of energy within our distribution systems to meet increasing customer demands and to support our commitment to improved environmental performance. Our

Power the Future

strategy, which is discussed further below, is expected to have a significant impact on our utility and non-utility energy segments. Since 2000, we have been selling our non-core assets to direct more attention to the utility
business and to finance

Power the Future

while reducing our debt.

Utility Energy Segment:

We are realizing operating efficiencies in this segment through the integration of the operations of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas. These operating efficiencies should
increase customer satisfaction and reduce operating costs. In connection with our

Power the Future

strategy, we are improving our existing energy distribution systems and upgrading existing electric generating assets. We plan to increase our
generating capacity through the new facilities that We Power is constructing.

Non-Utility Energy Segment:

We are primarily focusing this segment on improving the supply of electric generation in Wisconsin. We Power was formed to design, construct, own, finance and lease new
generation assets under the

Power the Future

strategy. We have divested of the majority of Wisvest’s assets in order to direct capital and management’s attention to

Power the Future

.


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2004 Form 10-K

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – (Cont’d)

Power the Future Strategy:

In February 2001, we filed a petition with the Public
Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) that would allow us to begin implementing our 10-year

Power the Future

strategy to improve the supply and reliability of electricity in Wisconsin.

Power the Future

is intended to meet a growing
demand for electricity and ensure a diverse fuel mix while keeping electricity prices reasonable. Under

Power the Future,

we plan to add new coal-fired and natural gas-fired generating capacity to the state’s power portfolio which would
allow Wisconsin Electric to maintain approximately the same fuel mix as exists today. As part of our

Power the Future

strategy, we plan to (1) invest a net of approximately $2.5 billion in 2,120 megawatts of new natural gas-fired and
coal-fired generating capacity at existing sites; (2) upgrade Wisconsin Electric’s existing electric generating facilities and (3) invest in upgrades of our existing energy distribution system.

Subsequent to our February 2001 filing, the state legislature amended several laws, making
changes which are critical to the implementation of

Power the Future

. In October 2001, the PSCW issued a declaratory ruling finding, among other things, that it was prudent to proceed with

Power the Future

and for us to incur the
associated pre-certification expenses. However, individual expenses are subject to review by the PSCW in order to be recovered.

In November 2001, we created We Power to design, construct, own, finance and lease the new generating capacity. Wisconsin Electric will lease each new facility from We
Power as well as operate and maintain the new plants under 25 to 30-year lease agreements approved by the PSCW. Based upon the structure of the leases, we expect to recover the initial investments in We Power’s new facilities over the initial
lease term. At the end of the leases, Wisconsin Electric will have the right to acquire the plants outright at market value or to renew the leases. Wisconsin Electric expects that all lease payments and operating costs of the plants will be
recoverable in rates under the provisions of the Wisconsin Leased Generation Law.

Under our

Power the Future

strategy, we expect to meet a significant portion of our future generation needs through We Power’s construction of the Port Washington and Elm Road generating stations.

As of December 31, 2004, we:

Ø

Received a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) from the PSCW to build two 545-megawatt natural gas-fired intermediate load units in Port Washington, Wisconsin,
with the first unit expected to be operational early in the third quarter of 2005 and the second unit by the end of the second quarter of 2008.

Ø

Began construction on the first 545-megawatt generating unit in Port Washington (approximately 87% complete as of January 31, 2005), which is currently on schedule and within
budget.

Ø

Began site preparation on the second 545-megawatt generating unit in Port Washington in May 2004.

Ø

Received a CPCN from the PSCW to build two 615-megawatt coal-fired base load units at our existing Oak Creek Power Plant site in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, with the first unit expected
to be in service in 2009 and the second unit in 2010, subject to resolution of legal challenges and receipt of required permits and project approvals. In November 2004, the order granting the CPCN was vacated and remanded back to the PSCW by the
Dane County Circuit Court. We appealed this decision in December 2004, as has the PSCW and Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR). In January 2005, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin agreed to hear the appeals filed by the PSCW, WDNR and us to
reverse the Dane County Circuit Court ruling. The Supreme Court’s order allows the case to bypass the state appeals court. The Supreme Court scheduled oral arguments in this matter for March 30, 2005. We expect a decision to be reached no later
than June 30, 2005.

Ø

Received approval from the PSCW for various leases between We Power and Wisconsin Electric.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – (Cont’d)

We expect to finance the majority of our

Power the Future

strategy with internally generated cash and debt
financings. Additionally, in the future we expect to have some limited asset sales, but at levels significantly below the prior five year level. We expect to maintain our debt to total capital ratio at no more than 61.5% during the period we are
constructing our new gas- and coal- fired generation plants. We currently do not plan to issue any new equity as part of our

Power the Future

financing plan.

Our primary risks under

Power the Future

are associated with successful, timely resolution of court challenges of our Elm Road
facility, timely receipt of remaining permits for Elm Road, and construction risks associated with the schedule and costs for both our Elm Road and Port Washington generating stations.

For further information concerning

Power the Future

capital requirements, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources.” You can
find additional information regarding risks associated with the

Power the Future

strategy, as well as the regulatory process, specific regulatory approvals and associated legal challenges in “Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and
Capital Resources” below.

Divestiture of Non-Core Assets

Our

Power the Future

strategy led to a decision to divest non-core businesses. These non-core businesses primarily included non-utility generation assets located outside of the Midwest and a substantial amount of Wispark’s real estate
portfolio, as well as the manufacturing business. Since 2000, we have received total proceeds of approximately $1.97 billion from the divestiture of non-core assets as follows:

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS

The following table compares our operating income by business segment and our net income for
2004, 2003 and 2002.

(a)

Effective July 31, 2004, we sold our manufacturing business. We began reporting this business as a discontinued operation in the first quarter of 2004 and have restated prior year
information.

2004 vs.
2003:

Our diluted earnings per share were $2.57 during 2004 compared with $2.06 per share during 2003. During 2004, our diluted earnings per share were positively impacted by $1.28 per share due to the gain on the sale
of our manufacturing business offset in part by non-cash, non-utility asset valuation charges of $0.81 per share, severance costs of $0.16 per share primarily in our utility energy segment, and debt redemption costs of $0.13 per share. During 2003,
our diluted earnings per share were negatively impacted by non-cash, non-utility asset valuation charges of $0.32 per share partially offset by $0.07 of gain on the sale of non-utility investments.

2003 vs. 2002:

Our diluted earnings per share of $2.06
during 2003 was $0.62 per share higher than the $1.44 per share earned during 2002. As noted above, our 2003 earnings were negatively impacted by non-cash, non-utility asset valuation charges of $0.32 per share partially offset by $0.07 of gain on
non-utility investments. During 2002, our diluted earnings per share were negatively impacted by non-cash, non-utility asset valuation charges of $0.79 per share.

An analysis of contributions to operating income by segment follows.

UTILITY ENERGY SEGMENT CONTRIBUTION TO OPERATING INCOME

2004 vs. 2003:

Our utility energy
segment contributed $528.6 million of operating income during 2004 compared with $544.1 million of operating income during 2003. During 2004, we experienced an increase in revenues due to base electric sales growth, and we benefited from lower bad
debt expenses. However, these items were offset by higher pension and medical costs, severance costs recorded during the second half of 2004 and unfavorable weather.

2003 vs. 2002:

Utility energy segment operating income during 2003 decreased by $18.0 million compared
with 2002. The decline in utility operating income was primarily due to cooler summer weather, higher fuel and purchased power costs, increases in pension, medical and other benefit costs, higher nuclear costs and costs associated with our

Power
the Future

growth strategy. This decline was somewhat mitigated by a March 2003 rate increase associated with fuel and purchased power expenses, higher gas margins, growth in our base electric

business and litigation settlements in 2002 compared with the receipt of insurance recoveries in 2003, primarily
related to the Giddings & Lewis/City of West Allis litigation.

Electric Utility Revenues and Sales

2004 vs. 2003:

During 2004, our total electric utility operating revenues increased by $85.4 million or
4.2% when compared with 2003 due to pricing increases and to growth in our base businesses, partially offset by the effects of unfavorable weather during the summer of 2004.

During 2004, we received $54.5 million of higher operating revenues as a result of pricing increases which were not in effect during 2003.
In May 2004, Wisconsin Electric received an order from the PSCW authorizing an annualized increase in electric rates of approximately $59.5 million to cover construction costs associated with our

Power the Future

program and to recover low
income uncollectible expenses transferred to Wisconsin’s public benefits fund. In addition, two rate increases related to a rise in fuel and purchased power costs were implemented in March and October 2003, which increased revenues by
approximately $16.3 million during 2004.

Total electric sales increased by
465.0 thousand megawatt-hours or 1.5% between 2004 and 2003. Residential sales were down 0.6%, and small commercial/industrial sales were up just 1.1% due to the unfavorable weather during 2004. We estimate that the unfavorable weather reduced our
electric revenues by approximately $28.6 million as compared to the prior year and by $20.7 million as compared to normal weather. As measured by cooling degree days, 2004 was 27.1% cooler than in 2003 and 38.1% cooler than normal.

However, we estimate that customer growth and higher weather-normalized use per customer
during 2004 mitigated much of the impact of unfavorable weather. Sales volumes to large commercial/industrial customers improved by 2.5%. Excluding our largest customers, two iron ore mines, sales volumes to our remaining large commercial/industrial
customers improved by 1.5%. Sales to municipal utilities, the other retail/municipal customer class, increased 8.1% between the periods due to higher off-peak demand from low-margin municipal wholesale power customers.

2003 vs. 2002:

During 2003, total electric utility
operating revenues increased by $102.8 million or 5.4% when compared with 2002, primarily due to the impact of rate increases related to fuel and purchased power costs and to a surcharge related to transmission costs. The total rate impact was
approximately $83.3 million in 2003. In March 2003, Wisconsin Electric received an interim increase in rates of $55.1 million annually to recover increases in fuel and purchased power costs. In October 2003, we received the final rate order, which
authorized an additional $6.1 million of annual revenues. In spite of the interim fuel order, we under recovered fuel costs by approximately $7.6 million during 2003, which is approximately $5.3 million worse than our under recovery during 2002.
Much of our under recovery of fuel costs during 2003 can be attributed to the need to purchase replacement power in May and June of 2003 due to a flood at Presque Isle Power Plant and to high natural gas prices. The impact of unfavorable summer
weather in 2003 reduced electric operating revenues by approximately $19.0 million between the comparative periods.

Total electric megawatt-hour sales increased by 1.0% during 2003. Residential sales fell 2.5% due to the impact of unfavorable weather conditions on cooling load during
the second and third quarters of 2003. Sales to Wisconsin Electric’s largest customers, two iron ore mines, increased by 238.4 thousand megawatt-hours or 12.1% between the comparative periods despite temporary curtailments of electric sales in
the second and fourth quarters of 2003 resulting from a flood-related outage at our Presque Isle Power Plant and a transmission outage. During the first and third quarters of 2002, the mines had extended outages. Excluding these two mines, our total
electric energy sales increased by 0.3% between the comparative periods, and sales volumes to the remaining large commercial/industrial customers improved by 0.4%. Sales to municipal utilities, the other retail/municipal customer class, increased
8.5% between the periods due to higher off-peak demand from low-margin municipal wholesale power customers.

Electric Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses

2004 vs. 2003:

Total fuel and purchased power expenses for our electric utilities increased by $22.2 million or 3.9% during 2004 when compared with 2003. This increase is primarily due to our 1.5%
increase in total megawatt-hour sales and to higher coal and purchased capacity costs. Increased availability of several of our coal-fired generating units during 2004 mitigated the rise in fuel and purchased power costs. Very cool summer weather
significantly reduced our need to use higher cost peak generating units and purchased power during 2004, also mitigating the rise in fuel and purchased power costs between the comparative periods.


Wisconsin Energy Corporation

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – (Cont’d)

2003 vs. 2002:

During 2003, total fuel and purchased power expenses increased
$72.8 million or 14.9% due in large part to increases in fuel prices, especially for natural gas, the primary fuel source for our purchased power, resulting in a 14% increase in the cost per megawatt hour of purchased power. Average commodity gas
market prices were $5.39 for 2003 compared to $3.22 for 2002 on a per dekatherm basis. Fuel and purchased power costs also increased due to higher purchased capacity costs and a higher need for purchased energy in 2003 compared with the same period
in 2002. Approximately $8 million of this increase was caused by the flood that temporarily shut down our Presque Isle Power Plant during the second quarter of 2003.

Gas Utility Revenues, Gross Margin and Therm Deliveries

The following table compares our total gas utility operating revenues and
gross margin (total gas utility operating revenues less cost of gas sold) during 2004, 2003 and 2002.

Gross margin is a better performance
indicator than revenues because changes in the cost of gas sold flow through to revenue under gas cost recovery mechanisms. The following table compares our gas utility gross margin and therm deliveries by customer class during 2004, 2003 and 2002.

(a)

As measured at Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Normal degree days are based upon a twenty-year moving average.

2004 vs. 2003:

Our total gas utility gross margin fell
slightly from $362.8 million in 2003 to $361.5 million in 2004 due largely to a decrease in therm deliveries resulting from less favorable weather. Total therm deliveries were 4.7% lower during 2004 primarily due to weather. As measured by heating
degree days, 2004 was 5.7% warmer than 2003 and 1.1% warmer than normal, which reduced heating load. We estimate that weather reduced gross margin by approximately $12.9 million between the comparative periods. Our gas margins were favorably
impacted by a price increase that became effective in February 2004. This annual price increase of $25.9 million favorably impacted gas margins by $19.6 million in 2004. However, in 2004, we recognized $8.8 million less in gas cost incentive
revenues under our gas cost recovery mechanisms when compared with 2003.

2003 vs. 2002:

During 2003, our total gas utility gross margin improved by $19.6 million compared with 2002. This was directly related to a favorable weather-related increase in therm deliveries,
especially to residential customers who are more weather sensitive and contribute higher margins per therm than other customer classes. As measured by heating degree days, 2003 was 7.8% colder than 2002 and 5.1% colder than normal, increasing
heating load. A $7.4 million increase in gas cost incentive revenues during 2003 under our gas cost recovery mechanism

2004 Form 10-K

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – (Cont’d)

also contributed to the increased gross margin and operating revenues between the comparative periods. Total therm
deliveries of natural gas increased by 2.4% during 2003 but varied within customer classes. Volume deliveries for the residential and commercial/industrial customer classes increased by 4.5% and 6.3%, respectively, reflecting the colder weather.

Other Operation and Maintenance Expenses

2004 vs. 2003:

Other operation and maintenance expenses
increased by $72.0 million or 8.1% during 2004 compared with 2003. The largest increase related to $36.3 million of costs that we recognized under a lease agreement in connection with the construction of the power plant in Port Washington, Wisconsin
under our

Power the Future

plan. Under the lease agreement, Wisconsin Electric is billed for costs, and these costs are deferred on our balance sheet. The costs are amortized to expense as we recover revenues from our customers under specific
pricing agreements which allow us to recover the lease costs. As noted in the electric revenue discussion, increased revenues resulting from the order we received from the PSCW in May 2004 basically offset these lease costs on a dollar for dollar
basis. In addition to the lease costs, we also recognized $12.8 million of increased public benefits costs which were also included in the May 2004 price increase.

In addition, our benefit costs increased $15.0 million due to increased pension and medical costs. We also incurred $28.2 million of
severance-related costs during 2004, primarily due to a Voluntary Separation Plan which was offered to certain management and represented employees in the second half of 2004. Partially offsetting these increases was an $11.9 million reduction in
bad debt costs due to improved collections and the timing of a deferral order.

2003 vs. 2002:

During 2003, our other operation and maintenance expenses increased by $60.8 million or 7.3% when compared with 2002. The increase was primarily attributable to approximately $39.4 million
of higher electric transmission expenses. A surcharge for transmission costs that was approved by the PSCW in October 2002 offset the impact of higher transmission expenses. Pension, medical and other benefit costs increased by approximately $30
million during 2003. Overall, nuclear costs were $8.7 million higher during 2003 compared with 2002 due to an extended outage and costs associated with supplemental inspections at Point Beach by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).
Insurance recoveries of approximately $11.1 million in 2003 compared to associated settlement costs of $17.3 million in 2002, both primarily related to the Giddings & Lewis/City of West Allis litigation, offset some of the increase in other
operation and maintenance expenses. We spent approximately $7.2 million more in 2003 than in 2002 on the implementation of our

Power the Future

strategy.

NON-UTILITY ENERGY SEGMENT CONTRIBUTION TO OPERATING INCOME

As part of our ongoing efforts to divest non-core assets, we have significantly reduced
Wisvest’s operations since 2002. The following table compares our non-utility energy segment’s operating loss during 2004, 2003 and 2002.

2004 vs.
2003:

Our non-utility energy operating losses increased from $61.5 million during 2003 to $120.4 million during 2004, primarily because of a non-cash asset valuation charge of $122.0 million in the third quarter of


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2004 Form 10-K

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – (Cont’d)

associated with our Calumet Energy facility. During 2003, we recorded $59.5 million of non-cash asset valuation
charges related to our investment in an entity that owns a co-generation plant in Maine (Androscoggin) and to a natural gas power island which we sold in the fourth quarter of 2003. In 2003, we also realized gains on the sale of non-utility energy
assets of $10.5 million.

2003 vs.
2002:

The significant decline in operating revenues, fuel and purchased power and other operation and maintenance expenses during 2003 is directly related to our sale of Wisvest-Connecticut in December 2002, which had
operating earnings of $16.8 million in 2002.

The operating loss incurred in
2003 included total asset valuation charges of $59.5 million offset in part by gains on the sale of assets of $10.5 million. The asset valuation charges recorded in 2003 relate to our investment in Androscoggin and to costs associated with a
500-megawatt natural gas power island. In 2002 we recorded a non-cash asset valuation charge of which $125.1 million related to the non-utility energy segment.

CORPORATE AND OTHER CONTRIBUTION TO OPERATING INCOME

The following table identifies the components of operating loss attributable to our corporate
operations and to other affiliates during 2004, 2003 and 2002.

2004 vs.
2003:

We had net corporate and other affiliate operating losses of $28.4 million during 2004 compared with net operating losses of $0.4 million in 2003. The change reflects a non-cash valuation charge of $27.0
million in the third quarter of 2004 related to our Minergy-Neenah facility.

2003 vs. 2002:

We realized net operating losses of $0.4 million in 2003 from corporate and other affiliate operations compared to a net operating loss of $29.7 million in 2002. This change primarily
reflects a $2.7 million gain from the sale of investment assets in the third quarter of 2003 and a non-cash asset valuation charge of $16.4 million recorded in 2002 related to the decline in value of a venture capital investment.

CONSOLIDATED
OTHER INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS, NET

2004 vs.
2003:

Net consolidated other income and deductions decreased by $26.1 million in 2004 compared to 2003, primarily due to $22.9 million of debt redemption costs incurred during 2004. In connection with the sale of our
manufacturing business, we used most of the proceeds to retire short and long-term debt. These increased costs were partially offset by an $8.7 million increase in our interest in the earnings of unconsolidated affiliates during 2004.

2003 vs. 2002:

Net consolidated other income and
deductions decreased by $1.5 million in 2003 compared to 2002. This decrease is primarily due to $21.1 million ($12.7 million after tax) in Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) 133 gains recognized in 2002 on fuel oil contracts at
Wisvest-Connecticut’s two power plants which were sold in December 2002, a $3.2 million civil penalty we agreed to pay in 2003 pursuant to the terms of a consent decree with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and higher returns
associated with investments in rabbi trusts.

CONSOLIDATED INTEREST EXPENSE

2004 vs. 2003:

Total interest expense decreased by $20.4 million in 2004 compared with 2003. This
decrease primarily reflects the reduction in debt levels due to the retirement of debt with the proceeds from the sale of our manufacturing business, which was effective July 31, 2004. From December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2004, we reduced our debt
levels by $654.2 million or 15%.

2003 vs.
2002:

Total interest expense decreased by $13.3 million in 2003 compared to 2002. This decline was due to a combination of reduced average debt levels, increased capitalized interest and lower interest rates.

CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAXES

2004 vs.
2003:

In 2004, our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 39.6% compared with a 35.5% rate during 2003. The increase in the effective income tax rate is due primarily to the inability to receive a
state tax benefit from the $150.4 million of asset valuation charges which were recorded in 2004.

2003 vs. 2002:

Our effective tax rate applicable to continuing operations was 35.5% compared with a 39.3% rate during 2002. This decrease was primarily related to the inability to
deduct state income taxes on losses of certain non-utility subsidiaries. In 2002, we had $141.5 million of asset impairment charges which did not receive a state tax benefit as compared with $45.6 million of net impairment charges in 2003.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In 2004, we showed our manufacturing
business as a discontinued operation, and it was sold effective July 31, 2004. All prior years have been restated to show the manufacturing business as a discontinued operation. During 2004, this business earned $31.9 million of net income from
operations for the seven months that we owned this business. This compares with net income of $43.9 million and $35.3 million for twelve months of operations during 2003 and 2002, respectively. In 2004, we recorded a gain of $152.3 million on the
sale of the manufacturing business.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH FLOWS

The following table
summarizes our cash flows during 2004, 2003 and 2002:

Operating Activities

Cash provided by operating activities increased to $598.7 million during 2004 compared with $529.9 million during the same period in 2003. This increase was due in large part to stronger cash earnings (net earnings
plus non-cash valuation charges) as well as improvements in working capital.

Cash provided by operating activities decreased to $529.9 million during 2003 compared with $660.9 million during the same period in 2002. This decrease was primarily due to a $116 million refund received in the first quarter of 2002 from a
favorable court ruling in the Giddings & Lewis/City of West Allis litigation and an increase in the use of working capital in 2003.

Investing Activities

During 2004, we had $243.1 million of net cash inflows from investing activities. In 2003 and 2002, we had net cash outflows from investing activities of $596.2
million and $382.5 million, respectively. The most significant investing activities relate to the sale of assets, particularly the sale of the manufacturing business, and capital expenditures. In connection with our growth strategy which was
announced in 2000, we have been focusing on divesting non-core assets and investing in core regulated assets.

The following table identifies capital expenditure by year:

The increase in capital expenditures
at We Power reflects the increased construction activity related to the first unit at Port Washington which is expected to be in service early in the third quarter of 2005. In addition, during 2004 we incurred expenditures for the second unit at
Port Washington, as well as limited expenditures associated with the Elm Road coal units.

The following table identifies cash proceeds from asset sales:

A significant amount of the net
proceeds from asset sales was used to retire debt.

Financing Activities

The following table summarizes our cash flows from financing activities:

During 2004, the proceeds from asset
sales as well as improved cash flows from operations allowed us to retire $654.2 million of debt, including $200 million of 6.85% Trust Preferred Securities and $300 million of 5.875%

senior notes due April 1, 2006. For further information regarding our long-term debt issuances, redemptions and
refinancings, see “Note J - Long-Term Debt” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In September 2000, the Board of Directors amended the common stock repurchase program to authorize us to purchase up to $400 million of our shares of common stock in the open market. In March 2004, we announced that
under this plan we would resume purchasing approximately $50 million of our common shares in the open market with the proceeds from the sale of the manufacturing business, which was effective July 31, 2004. During 2004, we purchased approximately
1.6 million shares of common stock for $50.4 million under this plan. We ceased repurchasing shares in October 2004. The program expired in December 2004. Over the life of the plan we repurchased and retired 14.9 million shares at a cost of $344.0
million.

During January and February 2004, we issued approximately 0.2 million
new shares of common stock in connection with our dividend reinvestment plan and various employee benefit plans. In 2003 and 2002, we issued approximately 2.7 million new shares of common stock in each of those years in connection with these plans.
In 2004, 2003 and 2002, we received payments aggregating $4.8 million, $62.9 million and $52.6 million, respectively. In February 2004, we announced that we did not expect to issue new shares under these programs; rather we instructed the plan
agents to begin purchasing the shares in the open market in lieu of issuing new shares. During 2004, our plan agents purchased 3.2 million shares at a cost of $102.3 million to fulfill exercised stock options. In 2004, we received proceeds of $66.1
million related to the exercise of stock options. Prior to February 2004, we issued new shares to fulfill these obligations.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND REQUIREMENTS

In 2000, we announced a growth strategy which, among other things, called for us to sell
non-core assets. The proceeds from these asset sales were used to retire debt and help fund capital expenditures in our other businesses. During the five years ended December 31, 2004, we received $1.97 billion in proceeds from asset sales. Since
announcing the growth strategy in September 2000, our debt to total capital ratio has decreased from 68.3% at September 30, 2000 to 59.3% at December 31, 2004. Over the next several years, we expect to have some limited asset sales, but at levels
significantly below the prior five year level.

In 2002, we initiated the
construction of the first of our four planned power plants under our

Power the Future

program. We expect to spend over $2.8 billion if all four plants are approved. We expect that two unaffiliated entities will collectively invest
approximately $330 million in the

Power the Future

coal units and receive an ownership interest of approximately 17% in the units or 200 megawatts. If the two unaffiliated entities choose to participate in the coal units, our net investment
would be approximately $2.5 billion. Over the next several years, we expect to fund these plants with cash from operations and debt offerings.

Capital Resources

We anticipate meeting our capital requirements during 2005 primarily through internally generated funds and short-term borrowings, supplemented by the issuance of intermediate or long-term debt securities depending on
market conditions and other factors. Beyond 2005, we anticipate meeting our capital requirements through internally generated funds supplemented, when required, by the issuance of debt securities and construction financing.

We have access to the capital markets and have been able to generate funds internally and
externally to meet our capital requirements. Our ability to attract the necessary financial capital at reasonable terms is critical to our overall strategic plan. We believe that we have adequate capacity to fund our operations for the foreseeable
future through our borrowing arrangements and internally generated cash.

Environmental Trust Financing:

In March 2004, the Governor of Wisconsin signed into law a measure that gives utilities the ability to securitize the portion of customer bills that recovers the cost of
certain investments intended to improve the environment. The measure would result in a lower cost to customers when compared to traditional financing and ratemaking. In June 2004, Wisconsin Electric filed an application with the PSCW that sought
authority to issue up to $500 million of environmental trust bonds pursuant to this legislation. In October 2004, the PSCW approved an order authorizing Wisconsin Electric to issue environmental trust bonds to finance the recovery of $425 million of
environmental control costs plus up-front financing costs. The proposed terms of the bonds are

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – (Cont’d)

subject to further PSCW approval prior to issuance. In January 2005, we notified the PSCW that we would not issue
environmental trust bonds until the satisfactory resolution of tax rulings associated with the proposed securitization and the resolution of the Elm Road proceedings before the Wisconsin State Supreme Court. The issuance would also be dependent upon
market conditions.

Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas
credit agreements provide liquidity support for each company’s obligations with respect to commercial paper.

As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately $1.2 billion of available unused lines of bank back-up credit facilities on a consolidated basis and approximately $338
million of total consolidated short-term debt outstanding.

We review our bank
back-up credit facility needs on an ongoing basis and expect to be able to maintain adequate credit facilities to support our operations. The following table summarizes such facilities at December 31, 2004:

On June 23, 2004, Wisconsin Energy
entered into an unsecured three year $300 million bank back-up credit facility to replace a $300 million 364 day credit facility that was expiring. This facility will expire in June 2007 and may be extended for an additional 364 days, subject to
lender agreement.

On June 23, 2004, Wisconsin Electric entered into an
unsecured three year $250 million bank back-up credit facility to replace a $250 million 364 day credit facility that was expiring. This facility will expire in June 2007 and may be extended for an additional 364 days, subject to lender agreement.

On June 23, 2004, Wisconsin Gas entered into an unsecured three year $200
million bank back-up credit facility to replace a $200 million 364 day credit facility that was expiring. This facility will expire in June 2007 and may be extended for an additional 364 days, subject to lender agreement.

On November 1, 2004, Wisconsin Electric entered into an unsecured three year $125 million
bank back-up credit facility to replace a $100 million 11-month letter agreement that was expiring. This facility will expire in November 2007 and may be extended for an additional 364 days, subject to lender agreement.

As described in “Note I - Common Equity” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain
restrictions exist on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us. We do not expect these restrictions to have any material effect on our operations or ability to meet our cash obligations.

Access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality.
The following table summarizes the ratings of our debt securities and the debt securities and preferred stock of our subsidiaries by Standard & Poors Corporation (S&P), Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) and Fitch as of December
31, 2004.

The security rating outlooks assigned by S&P, Moody’s and Fitch for Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric, Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Energy Capital Corporation
are all stable.

In March 2003, S&P lowered its corporate credit ratings
for us from A- to BBB+ and for Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas, both from A to A-. S&P lowered its ratings for our senior unsecured debt from A- to BBB+; for Wisconsin Electric’s senior secured debt from A to A- and for Wisconsin
Gas’ senior unsecured debt from A to A-. S&P affirmed Wisconsin Electric’s A- senior unsecured debt rating. S&P lowered the rating for our preferred stock from BBB to BBB- and for Wisconsin Electric’s preferred stock from BBB+
to BBB. S&P affirmed the A-2 short-term rating of us and lowered the short-term ratings of both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas from A-1 to A-2. Wisconsin Electric’s senior secured and senior unsecured debt are both rated A- by
S&P. S&P assigned a stable outlook.

In October 2003, Moody’s
downgraded certain of our security ratings and the security ratings of our subsidiaries. Moody’s lowered the senior unsecured debt ratings of Wisconsin Energy and Wisconsin Energy Capital Corporation from A2 to A3 and our commercial paper
rating from P-1 to P-2. Moody’s lowered Wisconsin Electric’s senior secured debt rating from Aa2 to Aa3, senior unsecured debt rating from Aa3 to A1 and preferred stock rating from A2 to A3. Moody’s lowered Wisconsin Gas’ senior
unsecured debt rating from Aa2 to A1. Moody’s confirmed the P-1 commercial paper ratings of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas. In February 2004, Moody’s changed the rating outlook for Wisconsin Energy and Wisconsin Energy Capital
Corporation to stable from negative. The rating outlook for Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas is stable.

In October 2003, Fitch downgraded certain of our security ratings and the security ratings of our subsidiaries. Fitch lowered the senior unsecured debt ratings of Wisconsin Energy and Wisconsin Energy Capital
Corporation from A to A- and the commercial paper rating of Wisconsin Energy from F1 to F2. Fitch lowered Wisconsin Electric’s senior secured debt rating from AA to AA-, senior unsecured rating from AA- to A+ and preferred stock rating from AA-
to A. Fitch lowered Wisconsin Gas’ senior unsecured debt rating from AA- to A+. Fitch lowered the commercial paper ratings of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas from F1+ to F1. The rating outlook for Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric,
Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Energy Capital Corporation is stable.

We believe these security ratings should provide a significant degree of flexibility in obtaining funds on
competitive terms. However, these security ratings reflect the views of the rating agencies only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from each rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold
securities, but rather an indication of creditworthiness. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides that the circumstances warrant the change. Each rating should be evaluated independently
of any other rating.

Capital Requirements

Total capital
expenditures, excluding the purchase of nuclear fuel, are currently estimated to be $823.7 million during 2005 attributable to the following operating segments:

Due to changing environmental and
other regulations such as air quality standards and electric reliability initiatives that impact our utility energy segments, future long-term capital requirements may vary from recent capital requirements. Our utility energy segment currently
expects capital expenditures, excluding the purchase of nuclear fuel and expenditures for new generating capacity contained in our

Power the Future

strategy described below, to be between $400 million and $500 million per year during the next
five years.

Our estimated capital requirements through 2010 for

Power the
Future

include a net of approximately $2.5 billion to construct 2,120 megawatts of new natural gas-fired and coal-fired generating capacity of which we have expended approximately $414.9 million through the end of 2004. We expect that two
unaffiliated entities will collectively invest approximately $330 million in the

Power the Future

coal units and receive an ownership interest of approximately 17% in the units or 200 megawatts. Total cost of all four units, including the two
unaffiliated entities’ portion, is estimated to be $2.8 billion with total output at 2,320 megawatts.

We expect the capital requirements to support our investment in new generation under

Power the Future

to come from a combination of internal and external sources. The new generating plants will be constructed
by We Power, a non-utility subsidiary, and leased to Wisconsin Electric under 25-30 year lease agreements. We expect that Wisconsin Electric will recover the lease payments in its utility rates. We anticipate that we will need external debt
financing as the plants are constructed. We believe that the construction debt, cash flows from the lease payments and strong internal cash flow will be sufficient to fund our

Power the Future

capital expenditures.

Investments in Outside Trusts

:    We have funded our
pension obligations, certain other post-retirement obligations and future nuclear obligations in outside trusts. Collectively, these trusts had investments that exceeded $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2004. These trusts hold investments that are
subject to the volatility of the stock market and interest rates. For further information see “Note O – Benefits” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements:

We are a party to various financial instruments with off-balance sheet
risk as a part of our normal course of business, including financial guarantees and letters of credit which support construction projects, commodity contracts and other payment obligations. We believe that these agreements do not have, and are not
reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our investors.

We have identified three tolling and purchased power agreements with third parties but have been unable to determine
if we are the primary beneficiary of any of these three variable interest entities as defined by Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) Interpretation 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46). As a result, we do not consolidate
these entities. Instead, we account for one of these contracts as a capital lease and for the other two contracts as operating leases. We have included our contractual obligations under all three of these contracts in our “Contractual
Obligations/Commercial Commitments” disclosure that follows. For additional information, see “Note D - Variable Interest Entities” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Contractual Obligations/Commercial Commitments:

We have
the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2004:

(a)

The amounts included in the table are calculated using current market prices, forward curves and other estimates. Contracts with multiple unknown variables have been omitted from
the analysis.

(b)

Principal and interest payments on our Long-Term Debt and the Long-Term Debt of our affiliates (excluding capital lease obligations).

(c)

Capital Lease Obligations of Wisconsin Electric for nuclear fuel lease and purchase power commitments.

(d)

Operating Lease Obligations for purchased power and rail car leases for Wisconsin Energy and affiliates.

(e)

Purchase Obligations under various contracts for the procurement of fuel, power, gas supply and associated transportation related to utility operations and for information
technology and other services for utility and We Power operations.

Obligations for utility operations by our utility affiliates have historically been included as part of the rate making process and therefore are generally recoverable from customers.

FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

MARKET RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT RISKS

We are exposed to market and other significant risks as a result of the nature of our
businesses and the environment in which those businesses operate. These risks, described in further detail below, include but are not limited to:

Construction Risk:

In December 2002, the PSCW issued a written order granting a CPCN to commence construction of the Port Washington
Generating Station (Port Washington units) consisting of two 545-megawatt natural gas-fired combined cycle generating units on the site of Wisconsin Electric’s existing Port Washington Power Plant. The order approves key financial terms of the
leased generation contracts including fixed construction cost of the two Port Washington units at $309.6 million and $280.3 million (2001 dollars), respectively, subject to escalation at the GDP inflation rate and force majeure and excused events
provisions.


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2004 Form 10-K

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – (Cont’d)

In addition, in November 2003, the PSCW issued a written order granting a CPCN to commence construction of two
615-megawatt super critical pulverized coal generating units (Elm Road units) on the site of Wisconsin Electric’s existing Oak Creek Power Plant. The order approves key financial terms of the leased generation contracts including fixed
construction cost of the two Elm Road units. For additional information, see “Power the Future - Elm Road” below.

Large construction projects of this type are subject to usual construction risks over which we will have limited or no control and which might adversely affect project
costs and completion time. These risks include, but are not limited to, shortages of, the inability to obtain or the cost of labor or materials, the inability of the general contractor or subcontractors to perform under their contracts, strikes,
adverse weather conditions, the inability to obtain necessary permits in a timely manner and changes in applicable laws or regulations, governmental actions and events in the global economy. If final costs for the construction of the Port Washington
units or the Elm Road units exceed the fixed costs allowed in the PSCW order, this excess cannot be recovered from Wisconsin Electric or its customers unless specifically allowed by the PSCW. Project costs above the authorized amount, but below the
5% cap will be subject to a prudence determination by the PSCW.

Regulatory Recovery Risk:

The electric operations of Wisconsin Electric burn natural gas in several of its peaking power plants or as a supplemental fuel at several coal-fired plants, and the cost of
purchased power is tied to the cost of natural gas in many instances. Wisconsin Electric bears regulatory risk for the recovery of these fuel and purchased power costs when they are higher than the base rate established in its rate structure.

As noted below in Commodity Price Risk, the electric operations of

Wisconsin Electric operate under a fuel cost adjustment clause in the Wisconsin retail jurisdiction for fuel and purchased power costs associated with the generation and delivery of electricity. This clause establishes a fuel base for fuel and
purchased power costs, and Wisconsin Electric assumes the risks and benefits of fuel cost variances that are within 3% of the fuel base. Wisconsin Electric is subject to risks associated with the regulatory approval process including regulatory lag
once the costs fall outside the 3% variance of the fuel base. During the second quarter of 2002, the PSCW issued an order authorizing new fuel cost adjustment rules to be implemented in the Wisconsin retail jurisdiction. The new rules will not be
effective for Wisconsin Electric until January 2006, the end of a five year rate freeze associated with the WICOR Merger Order. Until this time, Wisconsin Electric will operate under an approved transaction mechanism similar to the old fuel cost
adjustment procedure. For 2004, 2003 and 2002, actual fuel and purchased power costs at Wisconsin Electric exceeded fuel base rates by $0.8 million, $7.6 million and $2.3 million, respectively. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, the electric rates included a
fuel surcharge.

Commodity Price Risk:

In
the normal course of business, our utility and non-utility power generation subsidiaries utilize contracts of various duration for the forward sale and purchase of electricity. This is done to effectively manage utilization of their available
generating capacity and energy during periods when available power resources are expected to exceed the requirements of their obligations. This practice may also include forward contracts for the purchase of power during periods when the anticipated
market price of electric energy is below expected incremental power production costs. We manage our fuel and gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long-term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, uranium,
natural gas and fuel oil.

Wisconsin’s retail electric fuel cost
adjustment procedure mitigates some of Wisconsin Electric’s risk of electric fuel cost fluctuation. If cumulative fuel and purchased power costs for electric utility operations deviate from a prescribed range when compared to the costs
projected in the most recent retail rate proceeding, retail electric rates may be adjusted, subject to risks associated with the regulatory approval process including regulatory lag. Regulatory lag risk occurs between the time we incur costs in
excess of what we collect in rates, and the time we receive approval for interim rates following a regulatory filing. Regulatory risk can increase or decrease due to many factors which may also change during this approval period including commodity
price fluctuations, unscheduled operating outages or unscheduled maintenance. In 2002, the PSCW authorized the inclusion of price risk management financial instruments for the management of our electrical utility gas costs. During 2003, a gas
hedging program was approved by the PSCW and implemented by Wisconsin Electric.

The PSCW has authorized dollar for dollar recovery for the majority of natural gas costs for the gas utility operations of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas through gas cost recovery mechanisms, which mitigates most of the risk of gas
cost variations. For additional information concerning the electric utility fuel cost adjustment

procedure and the natural gas utilities’ gas cost recovery mechanisms, see “Utility Rates and Regulatory
Matters” below.

Natural Gas
Costs:

Significant increases in the cost of natural gas affect our electric and gas utility operations. Natural gas costs have increased significantly because the supply of natural gas in recent years has not kept pace
with the demand for natural gas, which has grown throughout the United States as a result of increased reliance on natural gas-fired electric generating facilities. We expect that demand for natural gas will remain high into the foreseeable future
and that significant price relief will not occur until additional natural gas is added to the nation’s energy supply mix.

Higher natural gas costs increase our working capital requirements, resulting in higher gross receipts taxes in the state of Wisconsin. Higher natural gas costs combined
with slower economic conditions also expose us to greater risks of accounts receivable write-offs as more customers are unable to pay their bills. Because federal and state energy assistance dollars have not kept pace with rising natural gas costs,
our risks related to bad debt expenses associated with non-paying customers has increased.

As a result of gas cost recovery mechanisms, our gas distribution subsidiaries receive dollar for dollar pass through on most of the cost of natural gas. However, increased natural gas costs increase the risk that
customers will switch to alternative fuel sources, which could reduce future gas margins.

Weather:

The rates of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas are set by the PSCW based upon estimated temperatures which approximate 20-year averages. Wisconsin Electric’s
electric revenues are unfavorably sensitive to below normal temperatures during the summer cooling season, and to some extent, to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. The gas revenues of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas
are unfavorably sensitive to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. A summary of actual weather information in the utility segment’s service territory during 2004, 2003 and 2002, as measured by degree-days, may be found
above in “Results of Operations”.

Temperature can also impact demand
for electricity in regions where we have invested in non-utility energy assets or projects.

Interest Rate Risk:

We have various short-term borrowing arrangements to provide working capital and general corporate funds. We also have variable rate long-term debt outstanding
at December 31, 2004. Borrowing levels under these arrangements vary from period to period depending upon capital investments and other factors. Future short-term interest expense and payments will reflect both future short-term interest rates and
borrowing levels.

We performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis at
December 31, 2004 of our outstanding portfolio of $338.0 million short-term debt with a weighted average interest rate of 2.35% and $187.5 million of variable-rate long-term debt with a weighted average interest rate of 1.88%. A one-percentage point
change in interest rates would cause our annual interest expense to increase or decrease by approximately $3.4 million before taxes from short-term borrowings and $1.9 million before taxes from variable rate long-term debt outstanding.

Marketable Securities Return Risk:

We fund our
pension, other post-retirement benefit and nuclear decommissioning obligations through various trust funds, which in turn invest in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market price of the assets in these trust funds can affect future pension,
other post-retirement benefit and nuclear decommissioning expenses. Future contributions to these trust funds can also be affected by changes in the market price of trust fund assets. We expect that the risk of expense and contribution variations as
a result of changes in the market price of trust fund assets would be mitigated in part through future rate actions by our various utility regulators. However, we are currently operating under a PSCW-ordered, qualified five-year rate restriction
period through 2005. For further information about the rate restriction, see “Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters” below.


Wisconsin Energy Corporation

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – (Cont’d)

At December 31, 2004, we held the following total trust fund assets at fair value, primarily consisting of publicly
traded debt and equity security investments.

Fiduciary oversight of the pension and
other post-retirement plan trust fund investments is the responsibility of a Chairman-appointed Investment Trust Policy Committee. Qualified external investment managers are engaged to manage the investments. Asset/liability studies are periodically
conducted with the assistance of an outside investment advisor. The current study for the pension fund projects long-term, annualized returns of approximately 9%.

Fiduciary oversight for the nuclear decommissioning trust fund investments is also the responsibility of the Chairman-appointed Investment
Trust Policy Committee. Qualified external investment managers are also engaged to manage these investments. Asset/liability studies are periodically conducted with the assistance of an outside investment advisor, subject to additional constraints
established by the PSCW. The current study projects long-term, annualized returns of approximately 9%. Current PSCW constraints allow a maximum allocation of 65% in equities. The allocation to equities is expected to be reduced as the date for
decommissioning Point Beach Nuclear Plant approaches in order to increase the probability of sufficient liquidity at the time the funds will be needed.

Wisconsin Electric insures various property and outage risks through Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL). Annually, NEIL reviews its underwriting and investment
results and determines the feasibility of granting a distribution to policyholders. Adverse loss experience, rising reinsurance costs or impaired investment results at NEIL could result in increased costs or decreased distributions to Wisconsin
Electric.

Credit Rating Risk:

We do not
have any credit agreements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. We do have certain agreements in the form of commodity and energy services contracts and employee benefit
plans that could require, in the event of a credit ratings change to below investment grade, a termination payment if collateral is not provided or an accelerated payment. At December 31, 2004, we estimate that the potential payments under these
agreements that could result from credit rating downgrades totaled approximately $118.7 million.

Economic Risk.

We are exposed to market risks in the regional midwest economy for our utility energy segment.

Inflationary Risk:

We continue to monitor the impact of inflation, especially with respect to the
rising costs of medical plans, in order to minimize its effects in future years through pricing strategies, productivity improvements and cost reductions. Except for continuance of an increasing trend in the inflation of medical costs and the
impacts on our medical and post-retirement benefit plans, we have expectations of low-to-moderate inflation. We do not believe the impact of general inflation will have a material effect on our future results of operations.

For additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see
“Cautionary Factors” below.

POWER THE FUTURE

Under our

Power the Future

strategy, we expect to meet a significant portion of our future generation needs through the construction of the Port Washington and Elm Road generating stations by We Power. The new
plants will be leased by We Power to Wisconsin Electric under long-term leases, and we expect Wisconsin Electric to recover the lease payments in its electric rates.

Power the Future - Port Washington

Background:

In December 2002, the PSCW issued a written order (the Port Order) granting Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and We
Power a CPCN to commence construction of the Port Washington Generating Station


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2004 Form 10-K

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – (Cont’d)

consisting of two 545-megawatt natural gas-fired combined cycle generating units (Port Units 1 and 2) on the site of
Wisconsin Electric’s existing Port Washington Power Plant. The Port Order also authorized Wisconsin Gas to proceed with the construction of a connecting natural gas lateral and American Transmission Company LLC (ATC) to construct required
transmission system upgrades to serve Port Units 1 and 2 as a result of their concurrent applications. In January 2003, Wisconsin Electric commenced demolition of two of its existing coal-fired units on the site to make room for the new units. In
July 2003, We Power began construction of Unit 1, and we expect the unit to be operational early in the third quarter of 2005. In October 2003, we received approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to transfer by long-term lease
certain associated FERC jurisdictional assets from We Power to Wisconsin Electric. In May 2004, we filed an updated demand and energy forecast with the PSCW to document market demand for additional generating capacity. We Power began site
preparation of Unit 2 in May 2004. We expect Unit 2 to be operational in 2008.

Lease Terms:

The PSCW approved the lease agreements and related documents under which Wisconsin Electric will staff, operate and maintain Port Units 1 and 2. Key terms of the leased generation contracts
include:

Ø

Initial lease term of 25 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;

Ø

Cost recovery over a 25 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;

Ø

Imputed capital structure of 53% equity, 47% debt for lease computation purposes;

Ø

Authorized rate of return of 12.7% on equity for lease calculation purposes;

Ø

Fixed construction cost of the two Port units at $309.6 million and $280.3 million (2001 dollars) subject to escalation at the GDP inflation rate;

Ø

Recovery of carrying costs during construction; and

Ø

Ongoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the Port Order, which do not include the key financial terms.

In January 2003, Wisconsin Electric filed a request with the
PSCW to defer costs for recovery in future rates. The PSCW approved the request in an open meeting in April 2003. (See “Limited Rate Adjustment Request” below for further information.) We Power began collecting certain costs from Wisconsin
Electric in the third quarter of 2003 as provided for in lease generation contracts that were signed in May 2003. We defer the lease costs on our balance sheet, and we amortize the costs to expense as we recover the costs in rates.

Legal and Regulatory Matters:

In March 2003, an
individual who participated in the PSCW’s Port Washington CPCN proceedings filed a petition for review with the Dane County Circuit Court requesting the Court to reverse and remand in its entirety the PSCW’s December 2002 Order granting
the CPCN (Port Order). This case was remanded back to the PSCW which, after reviewing certain environmental matters, affirmed the original CPCN. The same individual then filed additional appeals challenging the CPCN; however, in October 2004, the
Court, at the request of the individual, dismissed all outstanding appeals related to the CPCN.

The construction of Port Units 1 and 2 required the receipt of many permits including permits relating to air and water quality. All construction permits have been received. In addition, with the construction of Port
Units 1 and 2, we needed the approval from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) for the construction of a natural gas lateral which will deliver fuel to the Units. After several discussions with the WDNR, we agreed to modify the
planned route and mitigate certain environmental impacts. In July 2003, we received approval for construction for the natural gas lateral and the lateral was completed in December 2004.

Power the Future

- Elm Road:

Background:

In November 2003, the PSCW issued an order (the Elm Road Order) granting Wisconsin Energy,
Wisconsin Electric, and We Power a CPCN to commence construction of two 615-megawatt coal-fired units (the Elm Road units) to be located near the site of Wisconsin Electric’s existing Oak Creek Power Plant. The first unit was scheduled to be
operational in 2009 and the second unit was scheduled to be operational in 2010. The Elm Road Order concluded, among other things, that there was a need for additional electric generation for Southeastern Wisconsin and that a diversity of fuel
sources best serves the interests of the State. The total cost for the two units was set at $2.19 billion, adjusted for inflation, and the order provided for recovery of excess costs of up to 5% of the total project, subject to a prudence review by
the PSCW. The CPCN was granted contingent upon us obtaining the necessary environmental permits. In April 2004, we entered into a contract with Bechtel to secure necessary

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – (Cont’d)

engineering, design and construction services and major equipment components for these units. We expect that we will
have co-owners that will have an interest in the project of approximately 17%.

Lease Terms:

In October 2004, the PSCW approved the lease generation contracts between Wisconsin Electric and We Power for the Elm Road units. Key terms of the leased generation contracts include:

Ø

The return on equity on the lease agreement with Wisconsin Electric will be set at 12.7% based on a capital structure that includes 55% equity;

Ø

Cost recovery over a 30 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;

Ø

Recovery of carrying costs during construction; and

Ø

Ongoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the Elm Road Order, which do not include the key financial terms.

In April 2004, the PSCW approved the deferral of certain costs
related to the Elm Road units for recovery in future rates. In May 2004, we filed a request with the PSCW for an increase in rates due to several factors including the Elm Road lease payment costs. We expect to receive an order from the PSCW on this
request in April 2005.

Legal and Regulatory
Matters:

The construction of the Elm Road units is subject to a number of regulatory approvals and legal challenges by third parties. The most notable remaining legal challenges relate to the Elm Road CPCN.

In November 2004, a Dane County Circuit Court judge reviewing challenges to the
PSCW’s order authorizing us to build two coal-fired generating facilities on the site of our existing Oak Creek Power Plant vacated the CPCN and remanded it back to the PSCW for additional proceedings. The Court determined that the PSCW
committed errors in determining the completeness of our application and in its decisions on several other points.

We, the PSCW and the WDNR filed motions for direct, expedited appeal in mid - December 2004 with the Supreme Court of Wisconsin. We believe that the appeal represents a
clear need for prompt, ultimate judicial resolution of matters involving substantial public importance to Wisconsin. While the Dane County decision specifically addresses the Oak Creek expansion, we believe this order would make it very difficult
for any new generation facilities to be built anywhere in the state. In addition to serious questions of reliability and availability of power, this decision also poses increased costs to customers. In January 2005, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin
agreed to hear the appeal. The Supreme Court scheduled oral arguments in this matter for March 30, 2005. We anticipate a decision to be issued no later than June 30, 2005.

We continue to work with the PSCW, the WDNR and other agencies to obtain all required permits and project approvals. The major permits and
the status regarding these permits are discussed below.

In September 2003,
several parties filed a request with the WDNR for a contested case hearing in connection with our application to the WDNR for a permit for wetlands and waterways alterations and construction on the bed of Lake Michigan for the construction of the
Elm Road units. That request was granted and assigned to an administrative law judge. The hearing took place in August 2004 and post hearing briefing concluded in September 2004. In November 2004, the administrative law judge approved the
WDNR’s issuance of the wetlands and waterways permit (Chapter 30 permit) for the Elm Road units. In December 2004, two opponents filed a petition for review of the decision in Dane County Circuit Court. In January 2005, we filed a motion to
dismiss the opponents’ petition. The WDNR has joined in this motion.

We
have applied to the WDNR to modify the existing Wisconsin Pollution Discharge Elimination System (WPDES) permit at this location that is required for operation of the water intake and discharge system for the planned Elm Road and existing Oak Creek
generating units. In January 2005, the WDNR published its notice of intent to issue a WPDES permit with a public comment period ending in February 2005. Additionally, we have applied to the Army Corps of Engineers for the federal permits necessary
for the construction of the Elm Road units. We anticipate decisions on these permits in the first half of 2005. Decisions favorable to the project may be contested by project opponents.


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2004 Form 10-K

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – (Cont’d)

In January 2004, the WDNR issued the Air Pollution Control and Construction Permit to Wisconsin Electric for the Elm
Road units. In February 2004, certain project opponents filed a petition for judicial review in the Dane County Circuit Court. At the same time, the project opponents submitted a request for a contested case hearing with the WDNR which was granted.
Petitioners subsequently agreed to dismiss their petition for judicial review. The contested case hearing was held in October 2004. In February 2005, an administrative law judge issued a decision affirming the WDNR January 2004 issuance of the Air
Pollution Control and Construction Permit. In February 2005, the project opponents filed a petition for judicial review of the decision with the Dane County Circuit Court.

The terms of our construction contract with Bechtel for the Elm Road units presently provide that full notice to proceed must be given to
Bechtel by July 1, 2005. In order for Bechtel to be able to proceed on July 1, it must begin site mobilization activities in May. We are unable to state whether the project could proceed if delayed beyond July 1, 2005.

In July 2004, we entered into an environmental and economic agreement with the Town of
Caledonia (the community immediately adjacent to the Oak Creek plant site), covering our plans for expansion of the Oak Creek plant site and the associated increase in train and vehicular traffic that would result in the community. The agreement was
approved by the Town Board in July 2004. The initial discussions were held at the suggestion of the PSCW in its decision approving the Elm Road Order. Under the agreement, we will take certain actions to mitigate the impact on the Town of
construction of the Elm Road units, as well as pay the Town to mitigate certain community health and safety impacts. The Town will cooperate with us in the issuance of necessary local permits and dismiss its judicial appeal of the PSCW permits
issued. The Town’s appeal was dismissed at the Town’s request in September 2004. Portions of the agreement concerning the impact payments are subject to review and approval by the PSCW. Our direct obligations under the agreement are not
expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

UTILITY RATES AND REGULATORY MATTERS

The PSCW regulates our retail electric, natural gas, steam and water rates in the state of Wisconsin, while the FERC regulates wholesale power, electric transmission and
interstate gas transportation service rates. The Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) regulates retail electric rates in the state of Michigan. Within our regulated segment, we estimate that approximately 87% of our electric revenues are
regulated by the PSCW, 8% are regulated by the MPSC and the balance of our electric revenues are regulated by the FERC. All of our natural gas revenues are regulated by the PSCW. Orders from the PSCW can be viewed at http://psc.wi.gov/ and orders
from the MPSC can be viewed at

www.michigan.gov/mpsc/

.

Overview:

In the state of Wisconsin, We Energies, (the trade name of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas) rates are governed by an order from the PSCW issued in March 2000 in connection with the
approval of the WICOR acquisition. Under this order, We Energies is restricted from increasing Wisconsin rates for a five year period ending December 31, 2005, with certain exceptions. We may seek biennial rate reviews during the five-year rate
restriction as a result of:

Ø

Governmental mandates;

Ø

Abnormal levels of capital additions required to maintain or improve reliable electric service; and

Ø

Major gas lateral projects associated with approved natural gas pipeline construction projects.

In addition, the PSCW found that electric fuel cost adjustment procedures as well as gas cost recovery mechanisms would not be subject to
the five-year rate restriction period and that it was reasonable to allow us to retain efficiency gains associated with the merger. As identified below, we have received rate increases during the five year restriction period for the exceptions
listed above. Under the March 2000 order, a full rate review will be required by the PSCW for rates beginning in January 1, 2006. We expect to make a filing in 2005 in connection with this PSCW review.

Wisconsin Electric:

The table below summarizes the
anticipated annualized revenue impact of recent rate changes. Wisconsin Electric’s current Wisconsin rates are based on an authorized return on common equity of 12.2%.

(a)

In May 2004, the PSCW issued a final order authorizing an increase in electric rates for costs associated with Port Washington power plant under construction and increased costs
associated with low-income energy assistance.

(b)

In October 2003, the PSCW issued a final order authorizing a fuel surcharge for $6.1 million of additional fuel costs. In March 2003, the PSCW issued an interim order authorizing a
surcharge for $55.1 million of additional fuel costs on an annualized basis subject to true up.

(c)

In October 2002, the PSCW issued its order authorizing a surcharge for recovery of $48.1 million of annual estimated incremental costs associated with the formation and operation of
ATC.

(d)

In September 2002, the MPSC issued an order authorizing an annual electric retail rate increase of $3.2 million for Wisconsin Electric. In addition, the September 2002 order issued
by the MPSC authorized us to include the transmission costs from ATC prospectively in its Power Supply Cost Recovery clause.

Wisconsin Gas:

As discussed above, Wisconsin Gas is also
under the five year rate restriction period which ends December 31, 2005. In March 2004, the PSCW approved an annual rate increase of $25.9 million related to increased costs associated with the construction of the Ixonia lateral and for increased
costs associated with low-income energy assistance.

Limited Rate Adjustment Requests

2005 Revenue Deficiencies:

In May 2004, Wisconsin Electric filed an application with the PSCW for an increase in electric and steam
rates for anticipated 2005 revenue deficiencies associated with (1) costs for the new Port Washington Generating Station and the Elm Road Generating Station being constructed as part of our

Power the Future

strategy, (2) costs associated with
our energy efficiency procurement plan and (3) costs associated with making changes to our steam utility systems as part of the reconstruction of the Marquette Interchange highway project in downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The filing identified
anticipated revenue deficiencies in 2005 attributable to Wisconsin in the amount of $84.8 million (4.5%) for the electric operations of Wisconsin Electric, and $0.5 million (3.6%) for Wisconsin Electric’s steam operations. In January 2005, as a
result of the litigation involving our Elm Road units, we amended this filing to reduce the total revenue request to $52.4 million. We anticipate receiving an order from the PSCW before April 2005.

2005 Fuel Recovery Filing:

In February 2005, Wisconsin
Electric filed an application with the PSCW for an increase in electric rates in the amount of $114.9 million due to the increased costs of fuel and purchased power as a result of customer growth and the increase in the reliance upon natural gas as
a fuel source. We expect to receive approval of the increase in fuel recoveries on an interim basis in March 2005. The revenues associated with this filing will be subject to refund and the costs associated with the filing will be audited by the
PSCW. Under the fuel

rules, Wisconsin Electric would have to refund to customers any over recoveries of fuel costs plus interest at a rate
of 12.2%.

Other Utility Rate Matters

Electric Transmission Cost Recovery

:    Wisconsin Electric
divested of its transmission assets with the formation of the ATC in January 2001. In connection with the formation of the ATC, our transmission costs have escalated due to the socialization of costs within the ATC and increased transmission
requirements in the state. In 2002, in connection with the increased costs experienced by our customers, the PSCW issued an order which allowed the deferral of transmission costs in excess of amounts imbedded in rates. We are allowed to earn a
return on the unrecovered transmission costs at our weighted average cost of capital. As of December 31, 2004, we have deferred $109.6 million of unrecovered transmission costs and we expect to begin to recover these costs beginning in 2006.

Fuel Cost Adjustment Procedure:

Within
the state of Wisconsin, Wisconsin Electric operates under a fuel cost adjustment clause for fuel and purchased power costs associated with the generation and delivery of electricity and purchase power contracts. Imbedded within its base rates is an
amount to recover fuel costs. Under the current fuel rules, no adjustments are made to rates as long as fuel and purchased power costs are expected to be within a 3% band of the costs imbedded in current rates for the twelve month period ending
December 31. If, however, annual fuel costs are expected to fall outside of the 3% band, and actual interim costs fall outside of established ranges, then we may file for a change in fuel recoveries on a prospective basis.

Edison Sault and our Wisconsin Electric operations in Michigan operate under a Power Supply
Cost Recovery (PSCR) mechanism which generally allows for the recovery of fuel and purchase power costs on a dollar for dollar basis.

Gas Cost Recovery Mechanism:

Our natural gas operations operate under a gas cost recovery mechanism (GCRM) as approved by the PSCW.
Generally, the GCRM allows for a dollar for dollar recovery of gas costs. There is an incentive mechanism under the GCRM which allows for increased revenues if we acquire gas lower than benchmarks approved by the PSCW. During 2004, $0.2 million of
additional revenues were earned under the incentive portion of the GCRM and $9.0 million and $1.6 million of additional revenues were earned in 2003 and 2002 under the GCRM.

Bad Debt Costs:

Prior to October 2002, Wisconsin Gas expensed amounts included in rates for bad debt
expense. If actual bad debt costs exceeded amounts allowed in rates, these amounts were deferred as a regulatory asset. Effective October 2002, the PSCW issued an order which eliminated escrow accounting for bad debts. The escrow amount accumulated
at September 30, 2002 of approximately $6.9 million is expected to be collected in future rates, but future bad debt expense at Wisconsin Gas will no longer be subject to this separate true-up mechanism.

In 2003 and 2004, due to a combination of unusually high natural gas prices, a soft economy
within our utility service territories, and limited governmental assistance available to low-income customers, we saw a significant increase in residential uncollectible accounts receivable. Because of this, we requested and received a letter from
the PSCW which allowed Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas to defer the costs of residential bad debts to the extent that the costs exceeded the amounts allowed in rates. As a result of these letters from the PSCW we deferred approximately $21.2
million and $15.6 million in 2004 and 2003 related to bad debt costs.

In
December 2004, we filed with the PSCW a request to implement a pilot program, which, among other things, is designed to better match our collection efforts with the ability of low income customers to pay their bills. Included in this filing is a
request to implement escrow accounting for all residential bad debt costs. In February 2005, the PSCW approved our pilot program and our request for escrow accounting.

Environmental Trust Financing:

In March 2004, the Governor of Wisconsin signed into law a measure that
gives utilities the ability to securitize the portion of customer bills that recovers the cost of certain investments intended to improve the environment. The measure would result in a lower cost to customers when compared to traditional financing
and ratemaking. In June 2004, Wisconsin Electric filed an application with the PSCW that sought authority to issue up to $500 million of environmental trust bonds pursuant to this legislation. In October 2004, the PSCW approved an order authorizing
Wisconsin Electric to issue environmental trust bonds to finance the recovery

2004 Form 10-K

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – (Cont’d)

of $425 million of environmental control costs plus up-front financing costs. The proposed terms of the bonds are
subject to further PSCW approval prior to issuance. In January 2005, we notified the PSCW that we would not issue environmental trust bonds until the satisfactory resolution of tax rulings associated with the proposed securitization and the
resolution of the Elm Road proceedings before the Wisconsin State Supreme Court. The issuance would also be dependent upon market conditions.

Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator, Inc. (Midwest ISO) Day 2:

In January 2005, we requested deferral accounting
treatment from the PSCW for incremental costs or benefits that may occur due to the implementation of the Midwest ISO Day 2 energy markets, except for locational marginal pricing (LMP) energy costs. We anticipate receiving a decision related to this
request prior to the scheduled start of the Midwest ISO energy market on April 1, 2005.

Nuclear Refueling Outages - 2005:

In January 2005, we requested deferral accounting treatment for non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses related to the second nuclear refueling outage expected to
occur in the fall of 2005. We estimate that the additional non-fuel operation and maintenance expense associated with the fall nuclear outage is approximately $15.0 million. We anticipate receiving a decision related to this request in the first
quarter of 2005.

ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITY

In response
to customer demand for higher quality power required by modern digital equipment, we are evaluating and updating our electric distribution system as part of our

Power the Future

strategy. We are taking some immediate steps to reduce the
likelihood of outages by upgrading substations and rebuilding lines to upgrade voltages and reliability. These improvements, along with better technology for analysis of our existing system, better resource management to speed restoration and
improved customer communication, are near-term efforts to enhance our current electric distribution infrastructure. In the long-term, we are initiating a new asset management strategy that is expected to consistently provide the level of reliability
needed for a digital economy, using new technology and advanced communications. In addition, we are participating in a world - wide consortium for electric infrastructure to support a digital society, sponsored by the Electric Power Research
Institute. Implementation of our

Power the Future

strategy is subject to a number of state and federal regulatory approvals. For additional information, see “Power the Future” above.

Wisconsin Electric had adequate capacity to meet all of its firm electric load obligations
during 2004. All of Wisconsin Electric’s generating plants performed well during the hottest periods of the summer and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, public appeals for conservation were
not required, nor was there the need to interrupt or curtail service to non-firm customers who participate in load management programs in exchange for discounted rates.

In May 2003, a flood at a hydroelectric dam owned by another utility forced a complete shutdown of the 618-megawatt Presque Isle Power Plant
in Marquette, Michigan, which resulted in the curtailment of non-firm service to some customers, as well as brief interruptions to firm service. Deliveries were also curtailed on several occasions to certain special contract customers in the Upper
Peninsula of Michigan because of transmission constraints in the area including an incident in December 2003. During the December 2003 incident, flow was interrupted on the three main electric transmission lines owned by ATC connecting Wisconsin to
the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This incident also resulted in short outages to some firm customers.

Wisconsin Electric expects to have adequate capacity to meet all of its firm load obligations during 2005. However, extremely hot weather, unexpected equipment failure or unavailability could require Wisconsin
Electric to call upon load management procedures during 2005 as it has in past years.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Consistent with other companies in the energy industry, we face potentially significant ongoing environmental compliance and remediation challenges related to current and
past operations. Specific environmental issues affecting our utility and non-utility energy segments include but are not limited to (1) air emissions such as carbon


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2004 Form 10-K

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – (Cont’d)

dioxide (CO


), sulfur dioxide (SO


), nitrogen oxide (NOx), small particulates
and mercury, (2) disposal of combustion by-products such as fly ash, (3) remediation of former manufactured gas plant sites, (4) disposal of used nuclear fuel, and (5) the eventual decommissioning of nuclear power plants.

We are currently pursuing a proactive strategy to manage our environmental issues including
(1) substituting new and cleaner generating facilities for older facilities as part of our

Power the Future

strategy, (2) developing additional sources of renewable electric energy supply, (3) participating in regional initiatives to reduce
the emissions of NO

x

from our fossil fuel-based generating facilities, (4) entering into agreements with the WDNR
and EPA to reduce emissions of SO


and NOx by more than 65% and mercury by 50% within 10 years from Wisconsin
Electric’s coal-fired power plants in Wisconsin and Michigan, (5) recycling of ash from coal-fired generating units, and (6) the clean-up of former manufactured gas plant sites. The capital cost of implementing the EPA agreement is estimated to
be approximately $600 million over the 10 years ending 2013. For further information concerning the consent decree, see “Note S - Commitments and Contingencies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. For further
information concerning disposal of used nuclear fuel and nuclear power plant decommissioning, see “Nuclear Operations” below and “Note H - Nuclear Operations” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report,
respectively.

National Ambient Air Quality
Standards:

In 2004, EPA began implementing the

National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for 8-hour ozone and fine particulate matter (PM

2.5

) by designating nonattainment areas in the country. The states are currently developing rules to implement the new standards. Although specific emission
control requirements are not yet defined, Wisconsin Electric believes that the revised standards will likely require significant reductions in SO


and NO

x

emissions from coal-fired generating facilities. Wisconsin
Electric expects that reductions needed to achieve compliance with the 8-hour ozone attainment standard will be implemented in stages from 2007 through 2010, beginning with the 1-hour ozone reductions. Reductions associated with the new fine
particulate matter standards are expected to be implemented in stages after the year 2010 and extending to the year 2017. Wisconsin Electric is currently unable to predict the impact that the revised air quality standards might have on the
operations of our existing coal-fired generating facilities.

Ozone
Non-Attainment Standards:

The 1-hour ozone nonattainment rules currently being implemented by the state of Wisconsin and ozone transport rules implemented by the state of Michigan limit NO

x

emissions in phases over the next five years.

Wisconsin Electric currently expects to incur total annual operation and maintenance costs of $1-2 million during the period 2004 through
2007 to comply with the Michigan and Wisconsin rules. In January 2000, the PSCW approved Wisconsin Electric’s comprehensive plan to meet the Wisconsin regulations, permitting recovery in rates of NO

x

emission reduction costs over an accelerated 10-year recovery period.

In April 2004, the EPA designated 10 counties in Southeastern Wisconsin as nonattainment areas for the 8-hour ozone NAAQS. States will be required to develop and
submit State Implementation Plans to the EPA to demonstrate how they intend to comply with the 8-hour ozone NAAQS by June 2007. Reductions needed to achieve compliance with the 8-hour ozone attainment standard will be implemented in stages from 2007
through 2010. Wisconsin Electric believes that compliance with the NO

x

emission reductions requirements under the
agreements with the WDNR and EPA will substantially mitigate costs to comply with the EPA’s 8-hour ozone NAAQS.

In December 2004, the EPA designated PM

2.5

nonattainment areas in the country. All counties in the state of Wisconsin were designated as attainment with the standard. EPA published proposed regulations called the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) in January 2004 to facilitate
the states in meeting the 8-hour ozone and PM

2.5

standards by addressing the regional transport of SO


and NO

x

. The proposed rules would require NO

x

and SO


emission reductions in two phases from electric generating units located in a 28-state region within the eastern U.S. Wisconsin and Michigan are affected
states under CAIR. The EPA is planning to issue the final CAIR regulations by March 15, 2005. Wisconsin Electric believes that compliance with the NO

x

and SO


emission reductions requirements under the agreements with
the WDNR and EPA will substantially mitigate costs to comply with the CAIR rule.

Mercury Emission Control Rulemaking:

As required by the 1990 amendments to the Federal Clean Air Act, the EPA issued a regulatory determination in December 2000 that utility mercury emissions should be
regulated. The


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2004 Form 10-K

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – (Cont’d)

EPA issued draft rules in December 2003 and is expected to issue final rules by March 15, 2005. The compliance date
for the final federal rules cannot be predicted at this time, but could be as early as 2008.

The WDNR independently developed mercury emission control rules that affect electric utilities in Wisconsin. The mercury control rules became effective in October 2004. The rules require emission reductions of 40% by
2010 and 75% by 2015. The rules explicitly recognize an underlying state statutory restriction that state regulations cannot be more stringent than those included in any federal program. The rules state that the WDNR must adopt state rule changes
within 18 months of publication of any federal rules. State rules are to be changed to be consistent with, and no more restrictive than, any federal rules. Our compliance planning estimates show that no additional emission control investments are
likely to be needed to meet the state mercury rules. This is because the federal rules are very likely to be in place prior to the compliance dates contained in the state rule. We are currently unable to predict the ultimate rules that will be
developed and adopted by the EPA, and we are not able to predict the impact that the EPA’s mercury emission control rulemakings might have on the operations of our existing or anticipated coal-fired generating facilities.

Manufactured Gas Plant Sites:

Wisconsin Electric and
Wisconsin Gas are voluntarily reviewing and addressing environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant sites. For further information, see “Note S - Commitments and Contingencies” in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Ash Landfill
Sites:

Wisconsin Electric aggressively seeks environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for its combustion byproducts. For further information, see “Note S - Commitments and Contingencies” in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

EPA Information
Requests:

Wisconsin Electric received requests for information from the EPA regional offices pursuant to Section 114(a) of the Clean Air Act. For further information, see “Note S - Commitments and
Contingencies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

LEGAL MATTERS

Presque Isle Flood:

During the second quarter of 2003, our Presque Isle Power Plant was temporarily shut down due to the failure of a hydroelectric reservoir dike which flooded
Marquette, Michigan. We estimate that our fuel and purchased power costs increased by approximately $8 million due to the need for replacement power during the plant outage. These increased costs were included as part of the fuel surcharge request
discussed above. In addition, we incurred approximately $13.5 million in damage to equipment and property. We are pursuing recovery from insurance carriers and other parties for the above costs. During 2004, we reached settlements with an insurance
carrier for approximately $9.1 million. We are continuing to pursue recovery against the remaining insurance carriers and other third parties. We are continuing to analyze and refine the costs associated with this matter.

Stray Voltage:

On July 11, 1996, the PSCW issued a
final order regarding the stray voltage policies of Wisconsin’s investor-owned utilities. The order clarified the definition of stray voltage, affirmed the level at which utility action is required, and placed some of the responsibility for
this issue in the hands of the customer. Additionally, the order established a uniform stray voltage tariff which delineates utility responsibility and provides for the recovery of costs associated with unnecessary customer demanded services.

In recent years, dairy farmers have commenced actions or made claims against
Wisconsin Electric for loss of milk production and other damages to livestock allegedly caused by stray voltage, and more recently, ground currents resulting from the operation of its electrical system, even though that electrical system has been
operated within the parameters of the PSCW’s order. In 2003, the Wisconsin Supreme Court upheld a Court of Appeals’ affirmance of a jury verdict against Wisconsin Electric in a stray voltage lawsuit and held that even though a utility
company’s measurement of stray voltage is below the PSCW “level of concern,” that utility could still be found negligent in stray voltage cases. Additionally, the Court held that the PSCW regulations regarding stray voltage were only
minimum standards to be considered by a jury in stray voltage litigation.

As a
result of this case, claims by dairy farmers for livestock damage have been based upon ground currents with levels measuring less than the PSCW level of concern. Even though the claims which have been made against


Wisconsin Energy Corporation

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – (Cont’d)

Wisconsin Electric with respect to stray voltage and ground currents are not expected to have a material adverse
effect on its financial statements, we continue to evaluate various options and strategies to mitigate this risk.

NUCLEAR OPERATIONS

Point Beach Nuclear Plant:

Wisconsin Electric owns two 518-megawatt electric generating units (Unit 1 and Unit 2) at Point Beach Nuclear Plant in Two Rivers, Wisconsin. The Plant
is operated by Nuclear Management Company, LLC (NMC), a joint venture of the Company and affiliates of other unaffiliated utilities. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, Point Beach provided approximately 25% of Wisconsin Electric’s net electric energy
supply.

Each Unit at the Plant has a scheduled refueling outage approximately
every 18 months. In 2004, Unit 1 had a scheduled refueling outage in the second quarter and in 2003, Unit 2 had a scheduled refueling outage over the third and fourth quarters. In 2005, Unit 2 is scheduled to have a refueling outage in the second
quarter and Unit 1 is scheduled to have a refueling outage over the third and fourth quarters. During the 2005 scheduled refueling outages we will replace the reactor vessel heads at each Unit. This work, along with other planned maintenance, is
expected to result in longer than normal outages. During scheduled refueling outages, we incur significant operations and maintenance costs for work performed during the outages and we incur costs associated with replacement power.

The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) operating licenses for Point Beach
expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2. In February 2004, NMC and Wisconsin Electric filed an application with the NRC to renew the operating license for both Units for an additional 20 years. The NRC has indicated that they
expect to act on the license renewal request before January 2006.

In July
2000, our senior management authorized the commencement of initial design work for the power uprate of both Units at Point Beach. Subject to approval by the PSCW, the project could add approximately 90 megawatts of electrical output to Point Beach.
In February 2003, Point Beach completed an equipment upgrade which resulted in a capacity increase of 7 megawatts per generating Unit. We are currently evaluating the timing for implementation of the power uprate project.

During 2002 and 2003 the NRC issued Final Significance Determination letters for two red
(high safety significance) inspection findings regarding problems identified by Point Beach with the performance of the auxiliary feedwater system recirculation lines. During 2003, the NRC conducted a three-phase supplemental inspection of Point
Beach in accordance with NRC Inspection Procedure 95003 to review corrective actions for the findings as well as the effectiveness of the corrective action, emergency preparedness and engineering programs.

The inspection results were presented at a public meeting in December 2003, and documented in
a February 2004 NRC letter to NMC. The NRC determined that the plant is being operated in a manner that ensures public safety but also identified several performance issues in the areas of problem identification and resolution, emergency
preparedness, electrical design basis calculation control and engineering-operations communication.

NMC responded to the supplemental inspection in February 2004 with specific commitments to address the NRC concerns, including revision of the Point Beach Excellence Plan. We were assessed a fine of $60,000 related to
issues identified with our emergency preparedness. NRC reviewed the adequacy of the revised Excellence Plan and its implementation, and NMC received a confirmatory action letter in April 2004. NRC will continue to provide increased oversight at
Point Beach.

As a result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, NRC and
the industry have been strengthening security at nuclear power plants. Security at Point Beach remains at a high level, with limited access to the site continuing. Point Beach has responded to NRC’s February 2002 Order for interim safeguards
and security compensatory measures. Point Beach has also responded to NRC orders regarding security of independent spent fuel storage installations, design basis threat and security officer training and work hours.

Used Nuclear Fuel Storage and Disposal:

Wisconsin
Electric is authorized to load and store sufficient dry fuel storage containers to allow Point Beach Units 1 and 2 to operate to the end of their current operating licenses, but not to exceed the original 48-canister capacity of the dry fuel storage
facility.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – (Cont’d)

Temporary storage alternatives at Point Beach are necessary until the United States Department of Energy takes
ownership of and permanently removes the used fuel as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established the Nuclear Waste Fund which is composed of payments made by the generators and
owners of such waste and fuel. Effective January 31, 1998, the Department of Energy failed to meet its contractual obligation to begin removing used fuel from Point Beach, a responsibility for which Wisconsin Electric has paid a total of $200.3
million into the Nuclear Waste Fund over the life of the plant.

On August 13,
2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a lawsuit brought by Maine Yankee and Northern States Power Company that the Department of Energy’s failure to begin performance by January 31, 1998 constituted a breach
of the Standard Contract, providing clear grounds for filing complaints in the Court of Federal Claims. Consequently, Wisconsin Electric filed a complaint on November 16, 2000 against the Department of Energy in the Court of Federal Claims. The
matter is pending. Wisconsin Electric has incurred substantial damages to date and damages continue to accrue. We are seeking recovery of our damages in this lawsuit.

In July 2002, the President signed a resolution which allowed the United States Department of Energy to begin preparation of the application
to the NRC for a license to design and build a spent fuel repository in Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The Department of Energy has indicated that it does not expect a permanent used fuel repository to be available any earlier than 2010. It is not
possible, at this time, to predict with certainty when the Department of Energy will actually begin accepting used nuclear fuel.

INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND COMPETITION

Electric Utility Industry

Across the United States, electric industry restructuring progress remains slow as it has
been subsequent to the California price and supply problems in early 2001. The FERC continues to strongly support large Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs), which will affect the structure of the wholesale market. To this end, the Midwest ISO
is expected to implement a bid-based market including the use of LMPs to value electric transmission congestion. The Midwest ISO energy markets are currently slated to commence operation on April 1, 2005. The timeline for restructuring and retail
access continues to be stretched out, and it is uncertain when retail access will happen in Wisconsin.; however, Michigan has adopted retail choice which potentially affects our Michigan operations. Deliberations are expected to continue in Congress
on a federal energy bill containing changes that would impact the electric utility industry. In the past few years bills have passed the U. S. House of Representatives, but were not passed by the Senate. Major issues in industry restructuring,
implementation of RTO markets and market power mitigation received substantial attention in 2004. We continue to focus on infrastructure issues through our

Power the Future

growth strategy.

Restructuring in Wisconsin:

Electric utility revenues in
Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. Due to many factors, including relatively competitive electric rates charged by the state’s electric utilities, Wisconsin is proceeding with restructuring of the electric utility industry at a much slower
pace than many other states in the United States. Instead, the PSCW has been focused in recent years on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of Wisconsin such as:

Ø

Addition of new generating capacity in the state;

Ø

Modifications to the regulatory process to facilitate development of merchant generating plants;

Ø

Continued development of a regional independent electric transmission system operator; and

Ø

Improvements to existing and addition of new electric transmission lines in the state.

The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should
ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date.


Wisconsin Energy Corporation

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – (Cont’d)

Restructuring in Michigan:

Electric utility revenues are regulated by the MPSC.
In June 2000, the Governor of Michigan signed the “Customer Choice and Electric Reliability Act” into law empowering the MPSC to implement electric retail access in Michigan. The new law provides that as of January 1, 2002, all Michigan
retail customers of investor-owned utilities have the ability to choose their electric power producer. The Michigan Retail Access law was characterized by the Michigan Governor as “Choice for those who want it and protection for those who need
it.”

As of January 1, 2002, Michigan retail customers of Wisconsin
Electric and Edison Sault were allowed to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We have maintained our generation capacity and distribution assets and
provide regulated service as we have in the past. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customer’s power supplier.

Competition and customer switching to alternative suppliers in the companies’ service territories in Michigan has been limited. With
the exception of two general inquiries, no alternate supplier activity has occurred in our service territories in Michigan, reflecting the small market area, our competitive regulated power supply prices and a lack of interest in general in the
Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a market for alternative electric suppliers.

Restructuring in Illinois:

In 1999, the state of Illinois passed legislation that introduced retail electric choice for large customers and introduced choice for all retail customers in May 2002. This
legislation is not expected to have a material impact on Wisconsin Electric’s business. Wisconsin Electric has one wholesale customer in Illinois, the City of Geneva, whose contract is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2005. However,
Wisvest’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Calumet Energy Team, LLC, does compete in the Illinois electric generation market with power produced from its 308-megawatt gas based peaking plant that entered commercial operation in 2002. Since May 1, 2004,
Calumet has operated under the control of PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM), an RTO that also operates bid based energy and capacity markets. Since operating under PJM, there has been a change in the anticipated economics of the facility and the
determination of an impairment of the facility. An impairment charge was recorded in the third quarter of 2004. For further information see “Note F - Asset Valuation Charges” - in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Electric Transmission and Energy Markets

American
Transmission Company:

Effective January 1, 2001, we transferred all of the electric utility transmission assets of Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault to ATC in exchange for ownership interests in this new company.
Joining ATC is consistent with the FERC’s Order No. 2000, designed to foster competition, efficiency and reliability in the electric industry.

ATC is regulated by the FERC for all rate terms and conditions of service and is a transmission-owning member of the Midwest ISO. As of February 1, 2002, operational
control of ATC’s transmission system was transferred to the Midwest ISO, and Wisconsin Electric became a non-transmission owning member and customer of the Midwest ISO.

Midwest ISO:

In connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, the Midwest ISO is in the process of
implementing a bid-based energy market which is currently scheduled to be implemented on April 1, 2005. As part of this energy market, the Midwest ISO is developing a market-based platform for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP
system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. As proposed to the FERC and preliminarily approved, the LMP system will include the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through the use of Financial
Transmission Rights (FTRs), which will be initially allocated by the Midwest ISO, and, it is anticipated, will be available through an auction-based system run by the Midwest ISO. Currently, there are several different estimates, both positive and
negative, of the impacts of the LMP pricing system on Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan’s utilities (also known as WUMS utilities).

In August 2004, the FERC accepted the Midwest ISO Energy Markets Tariff (August 2004 Plan), subject to further development on certain issues and subsequent compliance
filings by the Midwest ISO. Included in the plan were mitigation features, which were proposed by Wisconsin Electric and other WUMS utilities, to minimize the potential cost impacts of the start of the market on the WUMS utilities. Also included was
an FTR mitigation plan for entities


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2004 Form 10-K

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – (Cont’d)

in highly congested areas such as WUMS. The August 2004 Plan is subject to numerous requests for rehearing which may
result in further modifications to the Tariff.

It is unknown at this time
what, if any, financial impact the LMP congestion pricing system might have on Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault. The Midwest ISO recently completed its first allocation of FTRs for the period starting April 1, 2005 and ending August 31, 2005.
Wisconsin Electric received 94% of the FTRs that it requested in the allocation process. The FTR allocation process will be performed again for the period from September 1, 2005 to May 31, 2006, and it is unknown how many FTRs Wisconsin Electric
will be granted during that allocation process.

The Midwest ISO is currently
deferring the costs to develop and start-up its energy market (new software systems and personnel). Once the market is operational, the development and start-up costs will be charged to the Midwest ISO’s market participants, including Wisconsin
Electric and Edison Sault.

To mitigate the risks of this new bid-based energy
market, we requested deferral accounting treatment from the PSCW in January 2005 for incremental costs or benefits that may occur due to the implementation of the Midwest ISO Day 2 energy markets. Our request excluded LMP energy costs which will be
recoverable under Wisconsin’s Fuel Cost Adjustment Procedure. We anticipate receiving a decision related to this request prior to the scheduled start of the Midwest ISO market on April 1, 2005.

In the Midwest ISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by load serving entities
(LSEs) located in the service territories of each Midwest ISO transmission owner in proportion to the load served by the LSE versus the total load of the service territory. This “license plate” rate design is scheduled to be replaced after
a six-year phase-in of rates in the Midwest ISO; but it also was the subject of a proceeding in which a new rate design governing service in the combined Midwest ISO and PJM Interconnection, L.L.C (PJM) service territories was to be developed.
However, the FERC has ordered the elimination of through and out transmission charges for transactions between the Midwest ISO and the PJM. In November 2004, FERC issued an order allowing the existing Midwest ISO license plate rate design to
continue until at least February 1, 2008. In addition, FERC ordered a seams elimination charge to be paid by Midwest ISO LSE’s from December 1, 2004 until March 31, 2006, to compensate transmission owners for the loss of revenues resulting from
the joining of an RTO and/or FERC’s elimination of through and out transmission charges between the Midwest ISO and PJM. The FERC ordered that certain existing transmission transactions continue to pay for through and out service from December
1, 2004 until March 31, 2006. The details of the seams elimination charge and the quantification of the existing transaction charge are the subject of a hearing process initiated by FERC in a February 2005 order. We are currently unable to determine
the impacts on Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault.

Lost Revenue
Charges:

The FERC permits transmission owning utilities that have not joined an RTO to propose a charge to recover revenues that would be lost as a result of RTO membership. These lost revenues result from FERC’s
requirement that, within an RTO and for transmission between the systems operated by the Midwest ISO and PJM, entities that currently pay a transmission charge to move energy through or out of a neighboring transmission system will no longer pay
this charge to the neighboring transmission system owner or operator upon the neighboring transmission system owner or operator joining an RTO.

Discussions as to appropriate lost revenue charges with regard to several entities’ decisions, including that of Commonwealth Edison Company, a non-affiliated
Illinois utility that provides Wisconsin Electric transmission service, to place their transmission facilities under the control of PJM were terminated in September 2004. In lieu of charging the previously ordered seam elimination cost adjustment,
the FERC permitted the Midwest ISO, PJM and the affected entities, including Commonwealth Edison Company, to continue to charge their existing rates for transmission to adjoining areas until December 1, 2004, after which the affected entities as
directed by the FERC, were required to develop a new rate design that will eliminate the multiple charges between the service territories of the Midwest ISO and PJM. Proposals addressing the rate design issue were filed at the FERC on October 1,
2004. These proposals were rejected by the FERC and the transmission owners. The Midwest ISO and PJM were directed to file Seams Elimination Charge Adjustment (SECA) proposals to be effective December 1, 2004. As previously noted, the reasonableness
and magnitude of the proposed SECA charges has been set for a hearing. For further information see the above discussion related to Midwest ISO.

Congestion Charges on Other Systems:

Effective May 1, 2004, Commonwealth Edison,
transferred control of its transmission facilities to PJM, at which time PJM’s LMP based congestion pricing system began to apply to transmission service on Commonwealth Edison’s facilities. Wisconsin Electric was allocated FTRs for
virtually all of its PJM transmission through May 31, 2005, and a new allocation will take place for the period June 1, 2005 through May 31, 2006. To date, Wisconsin Electric has experienced minimal net congestion costs associated with its FTRs in
PJM. Congestion costs are included under the definition of fuel for the Wisconsin Fuel Cost Adjustment Procedure.

Natural Gas Utility Industry

Restructuring in Wisconsin:

The PSCW has instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities
should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has
adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas are unable to
predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position.

ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

New Pronouncements:

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based
Payment (SFAS 123R), which amended SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. This statement requires that the compensation costs relating to such transactions be recognized in the consolidated income statement. We are currently evaluating
the provisions of SFAS 123R and expect to adopt it on July 1, 2005. We have not yet determined the method of transition. See “Note B - Recent Accounting Pronouncements” and “Note I - Common Equity” in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in this report for additional information.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires the application of appropriate
technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory
challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment also may have a
significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting
policies applied have not changed.

The following is a list of accounting
policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments.

Regulatory Accounting:

Our utility subsidiaries operate
under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. Developing competitive pressures in the utility industry may result in future utility
prices which are based upon factors other than the traditional original cost of investment. In this situation, continued deferral of certain regulatory asset and liability amounts on the utilities’ books, as allowed under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (SFAS 71), may no longer be appropriate and the unamortized regulatory assets net of the regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after-tax
non-cash charge to earnings. As of December 31, 2004, we had $849.4 million in regulatory assets and $922.4 million in regulatory liabilities. We continually review the applicability of SFAS 71 and have determined that it is currently appropriate to
continue following SFAS 71. See “Note C - Regulatory Assets and Liabilities” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefits:

Our reported costs of providing
non-contributory defined pension benefits (described in “Note O - Benefits” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience.
Pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to plans and earnings on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact
current and future pension costs. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit
obligation and pension costs.

In accordance with SFAS 87, Employers’
Accounting for Pensions (SFAS 87), changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average
service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants.

The following chart reflects pension plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated
percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.

(a)

The inverse of the change in the actuarial assumption may be expected to have an approximately similar impact in the opposite direction.

In addition to
pension plans, we maintain other post-retirement benefit plans which provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees (described in “Note O - Benefits” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We account for
these plans in accordance with SFAS No. 106, Employers’ Accounting for Post-retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (SFAS 106). Our reported costs of providing these post-retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from
actual plan experience including employee demographics (age and compensation levels), our contributions to the plans, earnings on plan assets and health care cost trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future
post-retirement benefit costs. Other post-retirement benefit costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the
post-retirement benefit obligation and post-retirement costs. Our other post-retirement benefit plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general
interest rates may result in increased or decreased other post-retirement costs in future periods. Similar to accounting for pension plans, the regulators of our utility segment have adopted SFAS 106 for rate making purposes.

The following chart reflects other post-retirement benefit plan sensitivities associated with
changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.

The inverse of the change in the actuarial assumption may be expected to have an approximately similar impact in the opposite direction.

Unbilled
Revenues:

We record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a
systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated
each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled
period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2004 of $3.4 billion included accrued utility revenues of $245.1 million at December 31,
2004.

Asset Retirement Obligations:

We
account for legal liabilities for asset retirements at fair value in the period in which they are incurred according to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS 143).
SFAS 143 applies primarily to decommissioning costs for our utility energy segment’s Point Beach Nuclear Plant. Using a discounted future cash flow methodology, our estimated nuclear asset retirement obligation was approximately $745 million at
December 31, 2004.

Calculation of this asset retirement obligation is based
upon projected decommissioning costs calculated by an independent decommissioning consulting firm, as well as several significant assumptions including the timing of future cash flows, future inflation rates, the discount rate applied to future cash
flows and an 85% probability of plant relicensing. Assuming the following changes in key assumptions and holding all other assumptions constant, we estimate that our nuclear asset retirement obligation at December 31, 2004 would have changed by the
following amounts:

We were unable to identify a viable market for or third party who would be willing to assume this liability. Accordingly, we have used a market-risk premium of zero when
measuring our nuclear asset retirement obligation. We estimate that for each 1% increment that would be included as a market-risk premium, our nuclear asset retirement obligation would increase by approximately $7.5 million.

For additional information concerning SFAS 143 and our estimated nuclear asset retirement
obligation, see “Note L - Asset Retirement Obligations” and “Note H - Nuclear Operations” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Deferred Tax Assets Valuation Allowance:

At December 31, 2004, we had a valuation allowance of approximately $40.5 million of
which approximately $22.0 million related to state net operating loss carryforwards (state NOLs), and the remainder related primarily to potential state tax benefits of asset impairment charges. Of the $22.0 million, $15.1 million relates to state
NOLs of the parent company that begin to expire in 2010, and


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2004 Form 10-K

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – (Cont’d)

$6.9 million relates to state NOLs of various other non-utility subsidiaries that begin to expire in 2008. The state
NOLs have been generated over a period of many years due to taxable losses in the separate state income tax returns. The losses at the Parent were primarily due to interest expense. We had established the valuation allowance against the state NOLs
each year as the taxable losses occurred because management concluded that it was more likely than not that the state NOLs would not be realized prior to expiration.

The

Power the Future

generating units will be owned by our subsidiaries organized as Limited Liability Corporations (LLCs). Once the
plants become operational, taxable income or loss of the LLCs will flow through to and be reported in the separate state income tax return of the Parent. As a result, the Parent no longer expects to generate large state losses if all plants are in
service. The determination of future state taxable income of the Parent is a significant estimate. Factors affecting the estimate include the ultimate resolution of legal challenges to the construction of the plants, amounts spent and timing for
construction of the

Power the Future

generating units, the amount of debt and interest expense at the Parent and the consideration of available tax planning strategies. We concluded at December 31, 2004 it was more likely than not that all of
the deferred tax assets related to state NOLs would expire before being realized.

If we would conclude in a future period that it was more likely than not that some or all of the state NOLs would be realized before expiration, generally accepted accounting principles would require that we reverse the related valuation
allowance in that period. Any change to the allowance, as a result of a change in judgment about the realization of deferred tax assets, is reported as an increase or decrease in income.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General:

Our consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of Wisconsin Energy Corporation (Wisconsin Energy, the Company, our, we or us), a diversified holding company, as well as our principal subsidiaries in the following operating segments:

Ø

Utility Energy Segment

- Consisting of Wisconsin Electric Power Company (Wisconsin Electric), Wisconsin Gas LLC (Wisconsin Gas) and Edison Sault Electric Company
(Edison Sault); engaged primarily in the generation of electricity and the distribution of electricity and natural gas; and

Ø

Non-Utility Energy Segment

- Consisting primarily of W.E. Power, LLC (We Power); engaged principally in the design, development, construction and ownership of electric
power generating facilities for long term lease to Wisconsin Electric, and Wisvest Corporation (Wisvest).

Our other non-utility subsidiaries include primarily Minergy Corp., which develops and markets renewable energy and recycling technologies, and Wispark LLC (Wispark),
which develops and invests in real estate. We have eliminated all significant intercompany transactions and balances from the consolidated financial statements.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications:

We have reclassified certain prior year financial statement amounts to conform to their current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on net income or earnings per
share.

The most significant reclassifications relate to the reporting of
discontinued operations pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Effective July 31, 2004, we sold our manufacturing business. This segment is now
classified as a discontinued operation. The footnotes contained herein have been restated to reflect continuing operations for all periods presented. For further information see Note E - Asset Sales, Divestitures and Discontinued Operations.

Revenues:

We recognize energy revenues on
the accrual basis and include estimated amounts for service rendered but not billed.

Wisconsin Electric’s rates include base amounts for estimated fuel and purchased power costs. We can request recovery of fuel and purchased power costs prospectively from retail electric customers in the Wisconsin jurisdiction through
our rate review process with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) and in interim fuel cost hearings when such annualized costs are expected to be more than 3% higher than the forecasted costs used to establish rates.

Wisconsin Electric’s and Wisconsin Gas’ retail gas rates include monthly
adjustments which permit the recovery or refund of actual purchased gas costs. We defer any difference between actual gas costs incurred (adjusted for a sharing mechanism) and costs recovered through rates as a current asset or liability. The
deferred balance is returned to or recovered from customers at intervals throughout the year and any residual balance at the annual October 31 reconciliation date is subsequently refunded to or recovered from customers.

Other Income and Deductions, Net:

We had the following
other income and deductions for the years ended December 31:


Wisconsin Energy Corporation

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Cont’d)

Property and
Depreciation:

We record utility property, plant and equipment at cost. Cost includes material, labor, overheads and allowance for funds used during construction. Additions to and significant replacements of property
are charged to property, plant and equipment at cost; minor items are charged to maintenance expense. The cost of depreciable utility property less salvage value is charged to accumulated depreciation when property is retired.

We had the following property in service by segment at December 31:

Our regulated utilities collect in
their rates future removal costs for many assets that do not have an associated legal asset retirement obligation. We record a regulatory liability on our balance sheet for the estimated amounts we have collected in rates for future removal costs
less amounts we have spent in removal activities. This regulatory liability was $599.3 million as of December 31, 2004 and $571.1 million as of December 31, 2003.

Estimated useful lives for non-regulated assets are 3 to 28 years for equipment, 2 to 5 years for software and 30 to 40 years for buildings.

For assets other than our regulated assets, we accrue depreciation expense at
straight-line rates over the estimated useful lives of the assets.

We include
capitalized software costs associated with our utility energy segment under the caption “Property, Plant and Equipment” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the net book value of regulated capitalized
software totaled $28.8 million and $36.0 million, respectively. The net book value of other capitalized software was approximately $2.6 million and $2.2 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Our utility depreciation rates are certified by the state regulatory commissions and include
estimates for salvage value and removal costs. Depreciation as a percent of average depreciable utility plant was 4.2% in 2004, 4.2% in 2003, and 4.5% in 2002. Nuclear plant decommissioning costs are accrued and included in depreciation expense (see
Note H).

We record other property, plant and equipment at cost. Cost includes
material, labor, overheads and capitalized interest. We charge additions to and significant replacements of property to property, plant and equipment at cost and we charge minor items to maintenance expense.

We had the following Construction Work in Progress (CWIP) by segment at December 31:


Wisconsin Energy Corporation

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Cont’d)

Allowance For Funds Used During
Construction - Regulated:

Allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) is included in utility plant accounts and represents the cost of borrowed funds (AFUDC - debt) used during plant construction and a return
on stockholders’ capital (AFUDC - equity) used for construction purposes. AFUDC - debt is recorded as a reduction of interest expense and AFUDC - equity is recorded in Other Income and Deductions, Net.

As approved by the PSCW, Wisconsin Electric capitalized AFUDC - debt and equity at 10.18%
during the periods reported.

In a rate order dated August 30, 2000, the PSCW
authorized Wisconsin Electric to accrue AFUDC on all electric utility nitrogen oxide (NOx) remediation construction work in progress at a rate of 10.18%, and provided a full current return on electric safety and reliability construction work in
progress so that no AFUDC accrual is required on these projects. In addition, the August 2000 PSCW order provided a current return on half of other utility construction work in progress and authorized AFUDC accruals on the remaining 50% of these
projects.

As approved by the PSCW, Wisconsin Gas is allowed to accrue AFUDC on
specific large construction projects at a rate of 10.32%.

Our regulated
segment recorded the following AFUDC for the years ended December 31:

Capitalized Interest and
Carrying Costs - Non-Regulated Energy:

As part of the construction of our power plants under the

Power the Future

program, we capitalize interest during construction in accordance with SFAS No. 34,
Capitalization of Interest Cost. We will amortize capitalized interest over the life of the power plants. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, we capitalized $17.9 million and $6.5 million of interest costs, at an average rate of 6.1% and
5.7%.

Under the lease agreements associated with our

Power
the Future

power plants, we are able to collect from utility customers the carrying costs associated with the construction of our power plants. We defer these carrying costs on our balance sheet and they will be amortized to revenue over the
individual lease term. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, we have deferred $38.2 million and $17.1 million of carrying costs related to the

Power the Future

power plants.

Earnings Per Common Share:

We compute basic earnings per
common share by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is less than basic earnings per share due to the dilutive effects of stock options.

Materials, Supplies and Inventories:

Our inventory at December 31 consists of:

We price substantially all fossil
fuel, materials and supplies and natural gas in storage inventories using the weighted-average method of accounting.

Regulatory Accounting:

Our utility energy segment accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of
Certain Types of Regulation. This statement sets forth the application of generally accepted accounting principles to those companies whose rates are determined by an independent third-party regulator. The economic effects of regulation can result
in regulated companies recording costs that have been or are expected to be allowed in the rate making process in a period different from the period in which the costs would be charged to expense by an unregulated enterprise. When this occurs, costs
are deferred as assets in the balance sheet (regulatory assets) and recorded as expenses in the periods when those same amounts are reflected in rates. We defer all of our regulatory assets pursuant to specific orders or by a generic order issued by
our primary regulator. We expect to recover our outstanding regulatory assets in rates over a period of no longer than 20 years. As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately $62.0 million of regulatory assets that were not earning a return.
Additionally, regulators can impose liabilities upon a regulated company for amounts previously collected from customers and for amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers (regulatory liabilities). For further information, see Note C.

Derivative Financial Instruments:

We have derivative physical
and financial instruments as defined by SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. However, our use of financial instruments is limited. For further information, see Note M.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash and cash equivalents include marketable debt
securities acquired three months or less from maturity.

Asset Retirement
Obligations:

We adopted SFAS 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, effective January 1, 2003. Consistent with SFAS 143, we record a liability at fair value for a legal asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is
incurred. When a new legal obligation is recorded, we capitalize the costs of the liability by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. We accrete the liability to its present value each period and depreciate the capitalized
cost over the useful life of the related asset. At the end of the asset’s useful life, we settle the obligation for its recorded amount or incur a gain or loss. As it relates to our regulated operations, we apply SFAS 71 and recognize
regulatory assets or liabilities for the timing differences between when we recover legal asset retirement obligations in rates and when we would recognize these costs under SFAS 143. For further information see Note L.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets:

We account for goodwill and other intangible
assets following SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, effective January 1, 2002. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had recorded $441.9 million of goodwill related to our Utility Energy Segment. As of December 31, 2003, we had recorded
$394.0 million of goodwill related to our Manufacturing Segment in Assets Held for Sale.

Under SFAS 142, goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives are not subject to amortization. However, goodwill and other intangibles are subject to fair value-based rules for measuring impairment, and
resulting write-downs, if any, are to be reflected in operating expense. We assess the fair value of our SFAS 142 reporting unit by considering future discounted cash flows, a comparison of fair value based on public company trading multiples, and
merger and acquisition transaction multiples for similar companies. This evaluation utilizes the information available under the circumstances, including reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections. We perform

2004 Form 10-K

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Cont’d)

our annual impairment test for the reporting unit as of August 31. There was no impairment to the recorded goodwill
balance as of our annual 2004 impairment test date for our reporting unit.

Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets:

We carry property, equipment and goodwill related to businesses held for sale at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less costs to sell. As of December
31, 2004, we had no assets classified as Held for Sale. The manufacturing segment had been reclassified as Held for Sale at December 31, 2003. Consistent with SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, long-lived
assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from the use and eventual disposition of the asset based on the remaining useful life. For further
information, see Note F.

Investments:

We
account for investments in other affiliated companies in which we do not maintain control using the equity method. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had a total ownership interest of approximately 37.8% and 39.4%, in American Transmission Company
(ATC). We are represented by one out of ten ATC board members, each of whom has one vote. Due to the voting requirements, no individual member has more than 10% of the voting control. We account for our investment in ATC under the equity method.

Income Taxes:

We follow the liability
method in accounting for income taxes as prescribed by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). SFAS 109 requires the recording of deferred assets and liabilities to recognize the expected future tax consequences of events that have
been reflected in our financial statements or tax returns and the adjustment of deferred tax balances to reflect tax rate changes. Tax credits associated with regulated operations are deferred and amortized over the life of the assets. We file a
consolidated Federal income tax return. Accordingly, we allocate Federal current tax expense benefits and credits to our subsidiaries based on their separate tax computations. For further information, see Note G.

Stock Options:

We account for stock options under
Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25) and adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
- - Transition and Disclosure - an amendment of SFAS 123 (See Notes B and I).

Nuclear Fuel Amortization:

We amortize our nuclear fuel inventory to fuel expense as the power is generated, generally over a period of 60 months.

B - RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Share Based Compensation:

In December 2004, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R), which amended SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. This statement supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees. SFAS 123R addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees and other third parties, eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation transactions using APB 25 and requires that the
compensation costs relating to such transactions be recognized in the consolidated income statement. We are currently evaluating the provisions of SFAS 123R and expect to adopt it on July 1, 2005. We have not yet determined the method of transition.
See Note I for information regarding the pro forma impact of this statement.

C - REGULATORY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

Our regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31 consist of:

We record a minimum pension liability
to reflect the funded status of our pension plans (see Note O). We have concluded that substantially all of the unrecognized pension costs resulting from the recognition of our minimum pension liability that relate to our utility energy segment
qualify as a regulatory asset.

Our regulated subsidiaries record deferred
regulatory assets and liabilities representing the future expected impact of deferred taxes on utility revenues (see Note A).

In October 2002, the PSCW issued an order authorizing Wisconsin Electric to implement a surcharge for recovery of annual electric transmission costs projected through
2005. In addition, the PSCW order authorized escrow accounting treatment for transmission costs. The difference between actual incremental transmission costs incurred and the amount being recovered is charged to the escrow account. We have deferred
a total of $109.6 million of electric transmission costs as a regulatory asset through December 31, 2004.

Consistent with a generic order from and past rate-making practices of the PSCW, we defer as a regulatory asset costs associated with the remediation of former manufactured gas plant sites. As of December 31, 2004, we
have recorded $58.0 million of environmental costs associated with manufactured gas plant sites as a regulatory asset, including $31.4 million of deferrals for actual remediation costs incurred and a $26.6 million accrual for estimated future site
remediation (See Note S). In addition, we have deferred $16.7 million of insurance recoveries associated with the environmental costs as regulatory liabilities. We expect to include total actual remediation costs incurred net of the related
insurance recoveries in our next rate case at which time we would begin amortizing these costs over the following five years.

As part of our

Power the Future

initiative, the PSCW approved the retirement and removal of the Port Washington Power Plant coal units to make way for construction
of gas fired facilities. In a September 27, 2003 order, the Commission authorized transferring the undepreciated costs and related removal amounts to a regulatory asset account. This deferred unrecovered plant costs totaled $45.9 million at December
31, 2004.

As of December 31, 2004, we have deferred a regulatory asset of
$41.7 million for bad debt costs. Prior to October 2002, Wisconsin Gas used the escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs whereby it deferred actual bad debt


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2004 Form 10-K

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  –  (Cont’d)

write-off that exceeded amounts that were allowed in its rates. In 2003 and 2004, the PSCW approved our request to
defer bad debt write-offs at Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Electric to the extent that the write-offs exceeded amounts allowed in rates. We have requested that this deferral accounting continue in 2005. We will request approval to recover these costs
in our next Wisconsin rate case.

In connection with the WICOR acquisition, we
recorded the funded status of the Wisconsin Gas pension and post-retirement medical plans at fair value at the acquisition date. Due to the expected regulatory treatment of these items, we recorded a regulatory liability (Deferred pension - income)
that is being amortized over an average remaining service life of 15 years ending 2015.

D - VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46). This standard requires an enterprise that is the primary
beneficiary of a variable interest entity to consolidate that entity. We applied the Interpretation to any existing interests in variable interest entities beginning in the third quarter of 2003. In October 2003, the FASB deferred the adoption of
FIN 46 for all entities commonly referred to as special-purpose entities to the first reporting period ending after December 15, 2003. In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46R, which revised FIN 46 and deferred the effective date for interests held
in variable interest entities other than special purpose entities to financial statements for periods ending after March 15, 2004. We adopted FIN 46R in the first quarter of 2004.

We continue to evaluate our tolling and purchased power agreements with third parties on a quarterly basis. After making an exhaustive
effort, we concluded that for three of these agreements, we are unable to obtain the information necessary to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of these variable interest entities. Pursuant to the terms of two of the three agreements,
we deliver fuel to the entity’s facilities and receive electric power. We pay the entity a “toll” to convert our fuel into the electric energy. The output of the facility is available for us to dispatch during the term of the
respective agreement. In the other agreement, we have rights to the firm capacity of the entity’s facility. We have approximately $736.3 million of required payments over the remaining term of these three agreements, which expire over the next
18 years. We believe the required payments will continue to be recoverable in rates. We account for one of these agreements as a capital lease.

E - ASSET SALES, DIVESTITURES AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

We have been pursuing a corporate strategy since September 2000, which, among other things, identified the divestiture of non-core investments. These assets primarily
related to our manufacturing business, non-utility energy investments and real estate.

Manufacturing:

Effective July 31, 2004, we sold WICOR, Inc. to Pentair, Inc. and received cash proceeds of $857 million, and Pentair, Inc. assumed approximately $25 million of third party debt.

WICOR’s only asset at the time of the sale consisted of its interest in WICOR
Industries. As a condition of the sale, WICOR transferred its ownership of Wisconsin Gas to Wisconsin Energy through a stock redemption. Prior to the transaction, Wisconsin Gas converted from a corporation to a limited liability company
(collectively the “Wisconsin Gas transfer”). We expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $114 million as a result of the stock redemption described above. However, we also expect to receive future tax deductions from a step-up in the tax
basis of the Wisconsin Gas assets as a result of the Wisconsin Gas transfer. We therefore expect that substantially all of the cash taxes paid on the stock redemption will be recovered as deferred income tax assets through future deductions.

Pursuant to the terms of the sales agreement, Wisconsin Energy agreed to
customary indemnification provisions related to certain environmental, asbestos, and product liability matters associated with the manufacturing business. We have established reserves related to these customary indemnification matters. In addition,
the amount of cash taxes and future deferred income tax benefits are subject to a number of factors including appraisals of the fair value of Wisconsin Gas assets and applicable tax laws. Any changes in the estimates of taxes and indemnification
matters

will be recorded as an adjustment to the gain on sale and reported in discontinued operations in the period the
adjustment is determined.

In accordance with SFAS 144, the assets and
liabilities associated with our manufacturing segment have been reclassified as held for sale in the accompanying December 31, 2003 balance sheet. SFAS 144 requires that a long-lived asset classified as held for sale be measured at the lower of its
carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell, and cease being depreciated. We also reclassified our manufacturing segment as discontinued operations in the accompanying income statements. Included in discontinued operations is interest expense
associated with third-party debt that was assumed by the buyer upon completion of the sale. A summary of the components of Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax in our Consolidated Condensed Income Statements follows:

(a)

Includes the results of our manufacturing segment through July 31, 2004.

A summary of the components of cash flows for discontinued operations follows:

(a)

Includes the results of our manufacturing segment through July 31, 2004.

Cash and temporary cash investments of discontinued operations as of December 31, 2003
totaled $25.4 million and are included in Assets held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Non-Utility:

During 2003, we sold our investment in two energy marketing companies, a small investment
in assets of a Minergy Corp. project, a 500 megawatt natural gas power island and miscellaneous small real estate and other sales. These sales resulted in net cash proceeds of approximately $56.0 million and $32.0 million in tax benefits. In
addition, we received $15.0 million in dividends from certain of these companies at closing.


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2004 Form 10-K

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  –  (Cont’d)

During 2002, we completed the sale of Wisvest - Connecticut LLC (Wisvest Connecticut), which resulted in net cash
proceeds of approximately $220.0 million.

F - ASSET VALUATION CHARGES

In the third quarter of 2004, we recorded non-cash asset valuation charges
of $149.0 million ($96.9 million after-tax) related to Minergy Neenah and Calumet. These charges are discussed below. During 2003, we recorded asset valuation charges totaling $59.5 million, of which $19.4 million related to the write-off of our
remaining investment in Androscoggin LLC, an independent power project and $40.1 million related to an investment in a power island. The power island is discussed in more detail below. During the first quarter of 2002, we recorded $141.5 million of
impairment charges of which $125.1 million was related to our non-utility energy segment (primarily Wisvest - Connecticut) and a $16.4 million charge related to a decline in a venture capital investment. Wisvest - Connecticut was sold in the fourth
quarter of 2002.

Minergy Neenah:

Minergy Neenah is a waste to
energy facility that recycles paper sludge from area paper mills into steam, renewable electricity and glass aggregate. One of Minergy Neenah’s key revenue sources is a long-term steam contract with a paper company whereby Minergy Neenah sells
steam to the paper company’s facility in Neenah. The paper company contacted Minergy Neenah to request a renegotiation of the steam contract to help sustain the long-term viability of the paper company’s facility. Given the importance of
the long-term steam contract to Minergy Neenah, we believed it was important to help maintain the viability of the paper company’s facility. In October 2004, we signed an amendment to the steam contract which will reduce estimated steam
revenues through 2017. We concluded the asset was impaired and recorded a non-cash asset valuation charge of $27.0 million ($17.6 million after-tax) in the third quarter of 2004.

Calumet:

Calumet is a 308 megawatt natural gas-based peaking power plant located in Chicago, Illinois. Since May 1, 2004,
Calumet has operated under the control of PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM), a regional transmission organization that also operates bid based energy and capacity markets. In the third quarter of 2004, we determined that (i) Calumet has significant
risk associated with liquidated damages for certain energy sales within the PJM market, (ii) the elimination of the risk is not guaranteed via assumption of the risk by a third party marketer or through the availability of appropriate insurance, and
(iii) nonacceptance of, or failure to arrange for, coverage of the risk greatly diminishes the ability to viably sell merchant capacity, which has resulted in a change in the anticipated economics of the facility and the determination of an
impairment of the facility. We concluded that this asset was impaired and recorded a non-cash asset valuation charge of $122.0 million ($79.3 million after-tax) in the third quarter of 2004.

Power Island:

Wisvest had purchased a 500 megawatt power island consisting of
gas turbine generators and related equipment. This power island was not identified for a specific project. In 2002, we took possession of the power island and put it in storage. In the third quarter of 2003, we recorded a non-cash asset valuation
charge of $40.1 million ($26.0 million after tax) to reflect the impairment of this asset. We determined in the third quarter of 2003 based on information obtained from our efforts to market the power island, that the carrying value of this asset
exceeded market values. We estimated the fair market value of our 500 megawatt power island based upon a definitive agreement we entered into to sell the asset. This asset was sold in the fourth quarter of 2003 with no additional loss.

G - INCOME TAXES

The following table is a summary of income tax expense for each of the years ended December 31:

The provision for income taxes for
each of the years ended December 31 differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the applicable U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to income before income taxes as a result of the following:

The state income tax rate between 2004
and 2003 was adversely affected by the inability to receive state tax benefits from certain asset valuation charges.

The components of SFAS 109 deferred income taxes classified as net current assets and net long-term liabilities at December 31 are as follows:


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2004 Form 10-K

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  –  (Cont’d)

We had not recorded $22.0 million and $18.0 million of tax benefits as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 primarily
related to state loss carryforwards due to the uncertainty of the ability to benefit from these losses in the future. These loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2008 and have been reduced by a valuation allowance.

H - NUCLEAR OPERATIONS

Point Beach Nuclear Plant:

Wisconsin Electric owns two 518-megawatt electric generating units at Point
Beach Nuclear Plant in Two Rivers, Wisconsin. We currently expect the two units at Point Beach to operate to the end of their operating licenses, which expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2. In February 2004, Nuclear
Management Company (NMC) and Wisconsin Electric filed an application with the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to renew the operating licenses for both of Wisconsin Electric’s nuclear reactors for an additional 20 years. We
expect the NRC to make a decision on the license extension application by January 2006, based upon the NRC’s published schedule.

Nuclear Insurance:

The Price-Anderson Act currently limits the total public liability for damages arising from a nuclear incident at
a nuclear power plant to approximately $10.6 billion, of which $300 million is covered by liability insurance purchased from private sources. The remaining $10.3 billion is covered by an industry retrospective loss sharing plan whereby in the event
of a nuclear incident resulting in damages exceeding the private insurance coverage, each owner of a nuclear plant would be assessed a deferred premium of up to $99.2 million per reactor (Wisconsin Electric owns two) with a limit of $10 million per
reactor within one calendar year. As the owner of Point Beach, Wisconsin Electric would be obligated to pay its proportionate share of any such assessment.

Wisconsin Electric, through its membership in Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), carries decontamination, property damage and decommissioning shortfall insurance
covering losses of up to $2.1 billion at Point Beach. Under policies issued by NEIL, the insured member may be liable for a retrospective premium in the event of catastrophic losses exceeding the full financial resources of NEIL. Wisconsin
Electric’s maximum retrospective liability under the above policies is $16.5 million.

Wisconsin Electric also maintains insurance with NEIL through which it can recover up to $3.5 million per week, subject to a total limit of $490 million, during any prolonged outage at Point Beach caused by accidental
property damage. Wisconsin Electric’s maximum retrospective liability under this policy is $9.6 million.

It should not be assumed that, in the event of a major nuclear incident, any insurance or statutory limitation of liability would protect Wisconsin Electric from material adverse impact.

Nuclear Decommissioning:

We record decommissioning
expense in amounts equal to the amounts collected in rates and funded to the external trusts. Nuclear decommissioning costs are accrued over the expected service lives of the nuclear generating units and are included in electric rates.
Decommissioning funding was $17.6 million for each of the years ended 2004, 2003 and 2002. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had the following investments in Nuclear Decommissioning Trusts, stated at fair value.

As of December 31, 2004 approximately
66.7% of the trusts were invested in equity securities and 33.3% were invested in debt securities. In accordance with SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, Wisconsin Electric’s debt and equity security
investments in the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund are classified as available for sale. Gains and losses on the fund are determined on the basis of specific identification; net unrealized gains on the fund are recorded as part of the fund.


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2004 Form 10-K

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  –  (Cont’d)

We record an Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO) under SFAS 143 for future decommissioning costs based upon the net
present value of the expected cash flows associated with our legal obligation to decommission our nuclear plants. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, our ARO associated with nuclear decommissioning totaled $745.3 million and $708.5 million,
respectively. We recover decommissioning costs in our regulated rates. We record a regulatory asset to the extent that our decommissioning ARO exceeds amounts collected in rates and cumulative investment gains (our nuclear trust investments). In the
future, to the extent that our nuclear trust investments exceed the decommissioning ARO, we would expect to record a regulatory liability. For further information on ARO’s see Note L.

The decommissioning ARO is calculated using several significant assumptions including the
timing of future cash flows, future inflation rates, the extent of work that is expected to be performed and the discount rate applied to future cash flows. These assumptions differ significantly from the assumptions used by the PSCW to calculate
the nuclear decommissioning liability for funding purposes.

In 2002, we
engaged a consultant to perform a site specific study for regulatory funding purposes. This study assumed that the plants would not run past their current operating licenses of 2010 and 2013, respectively, and the study made several assumptions as
to the scope of work. The study also estimated the liability for fuel management costs and non-nuclear demolition costs. These costs are excluded from the calculation of the decommissioning ARO. The 2002 site specific study estimated that the cost
to decommission the plant in 2003 year dollars was approximately $1.1 billion. At least every four years these studies are reviewed which could result in future changes to the decommissioning ARO. The differences between the regulatory funding
liability and the decommissioning ARO are primarily related to fuel management costs, non-nuclear demolition costs and the timing of future cash flows.

The ultimate timing and amount of future cash flows associated with nuclear decommissioning is dependent upon many significant variables including the scope of work
involved, the ability to relicense the plants, future inflation rates and discount rates. However, based on the current plant licenses, we do not expect to make any significant nuclear decommissioning expenditures before the year 2011.

Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund:

The Energy Policy Act of 1992
established a Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund (D&D Fund) for the United States Department of Energy’s nuclear fuel enrichment facilities. Deposits to the D&D Fund are derived in part from special assessments
on utilities using enrichment services. As of December 31, 2004, Wisconsin Electric recorded its remaining estimated liability equal to projected special assessments of $7.2 million. The deferred regulatory asset will be amortized to nuclear fuel
expense and included in utility rates over the next three years ending in 2007.

I - COMMON EQUITY

Common Stock Activity:

In
September 2000, the Board of Directors amended the common stock repurchase plan to authorize us to purchase up to $400 million of our shares of common stock in the open market. In 2004, we purchased and retired approximately 1.6 million shares of
common stock for $50.4 million. The plan expired on December 31, 2004. Over the life of the plan we purchased and retired approximately 14.9 million shares of common stock for $344.0 million.

Prior to February 2004, we issued shares of our common stock to fulfill obligations under
various employee benefit plans and the dividend reinvestment plan. We received proceeds of approximately $4.8 million, $62.9 million, and $52.6 million during 2004, 2003, and 2002, related to these share issuances. In February 2004, we announced
that we did not expect to issue new shares under these programs; rather we instructed the plan agents to begin purchasing the shares in the open market in lieu of issuing new shares. During 2004, our plan agents purchased 3.2 million shares at a
cost of $102.3 million to fulfill exercised stock options. In 2004, we received proceeds of $66.1 million related to the exercise of stock options.

Stock Based Compensation Plans:

Our 1993 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (OSIP), as approved by stockholders, enables us to provide a long-term
incentive through equity interests in Wisconsin Energy, to outside directors, selected officers and key employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The OSIP provides for the


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2004 Form 10-K

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  –  (Cont’d)

granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards and performance units. Awards may be paid in
common stock, cash or a combination thereof.

The exercise price of a stock
option under the OSIP is to be no less than 100% of the common stock’s fair market value on the grant date and options may not be exercised within six months of the grant date except in the event of a change in control. The stock options that
were granted prior to 2005 generally vest on a straight line basis over a four year period and expire no later than ten years from the date of grant.

The following is a summary of our stock options issued through December 31, 2004. In addition to the OSIP, the table below reflects our assumption of former WICOR options
in 2000, which were converted into options to purchase shares of Wisconsin Energy common stock on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the WICOR options.

In December, 2004, the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors approved certain changes to unvested options and to future grants. The Compensation Committee approved the acceleration of vesting of all unvested options awarded to executive officers and other key employees in
2002, 2003 and 2004 in anticipation of the changes in accounting required under the new accounting standard for share based payments which is effective July 1, 2005. In addition, the Compensation Committee determined that future option grants would
be non-qualified stock options and they would vest on a cliff-basis after a three year period. The Company recorded a $0.4 million charge, net of tax, in connection with the accelerated vesting of unvested stock options.

In January 2005, the Compensation Committee awarded 1,328,966 non-qualified stock options to
our officers and key employees under its normal schedule of awarding long-term incentive compensation.

The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding at December 31, 2004:


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2004 Form 10-K

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  –  (Cont’d)

We follow APB 25 and related interpretations when accounting for our stock option plans and we have adopted the
disclosure-only provisions of SFAS 123, as amended by SFAS 148. The fair value of options at date of grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:

As described more fully in the
following table, our diluted earnings would have been reduced by $0.24, $0.06 and $0.05 per share, respectively, had we expensed the 2004, 2003 and 2002 grants for stock-based compensation plans under SFAS 123. The 2004 pro forma expense includes
the effect of accelerating the vesting of stock options, as described above, which resulted in a pro forma expense of $0.16 per share.

The Compensation Committee has also
approved restricted stock grants to certain key employees and directors. The following restricted stock activity occurred during 2004, 2003 and 2002:


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2004 Form 10-K

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  –  (Cont’d)

Recipients of the restricted shares, who have the right to vote the shares and to receive dividends, are not required
to provide consideration to us other than rendering service. Forfeiture provisions on the restricted stock generally expire 10 years after award grant subject to an accelerated expiration schedule based on the achievement of certain financial
performance goals.

Under the provisions of APB 25, we record the market value
of the restricted stock awards on the date of grant as a separate unearned compensation component of common stock equity and then we charge their value to expense over the vesting period of the awards. We also adjust expense for acceleration of
vesting due to achievement of performance goals.

In January 2004, the
Compensation Committee granted 159,159 performance shares to officers and other key employees. The ultimate number of shares of Common Stock which will be awarded under this program is dependent upon the achievement of certain financial performance
of the Company’s stock over a three year period ending December 31, 2006. Under the terms of the award, participants may earn between 0% and 175% of the base performance award. We are accruing compensation costs over the three year period based
on our estimate of the final expected value of the award.

In January 2005, the
Compensation Committee granted 101,834 performance units to executive officers and other key employees. These awards are similar to the January 2004 grant, except that these units will be settled in cash instead of shares of our common stock.

Restrictions:

Various financing arrangements and
regulatory requirements impose certain restrictions on the ability of our principal utility subsidiaries to transfer funds to Wisconsin Energy in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances. Under Wisconsin law, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin
Gas are prohibited from loaning funds, either directly or indirectly, to Wisconsin Energy. We do not believe that these restrictions will materially affect our operations.

J - LONG-TERM DEBT

First Mortgage Bonds, Debentures and Notes:

At December
31, 2004, the maturities and sinking fund requirements through 2009 and thereafter for the aggregate amount of our long-term debt outstanding (excluding obligations under capital leases) were:

Long-term debt premium or discount and
expense of issuance are amortized over the lives of the debt issues and included as interest expense.

In August 2004, Wisconsin Electric retired $140 million of 7-1/4% First Mortgage Bonds at their scheduled maturity. Wisconsin Electric financed this retirement through the issuance of short-term commercial paper.

In September 2004, we used cash proceeds from the sale of WICOR Industries for
the redemption of $300 million of Wisconsin Energy 5.875% senior notes due April 1, 2006. In September 2004, we recorded approximately $17.0 million of costs associated with this early redemption, which are included in Other Income and Deductions,
Net in our Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended December 31, 2004.

In November 2004, Wisconsin Electric sold $250 million of unsecured 3.50% debentures due December 1, 2007. The
securities were issued under an existing $665 million shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The proceeds from the sale were used to repay our outstanding commercial paper.

In December 2004, Wisconsin Electric refinanced $147 million of the $165 million aggregate
principal amount of unsecured variable rate putable weekly reset tax-exempt debt with new “auction” non-putable unsecured variable rate weekly reset tax-exempt debt.

In March 2003, Wisconsin Energy sold $200 million of unsecured 6.20% Senior Notes due April 1, 2033. These securities were issued under a
shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. The proceeds of the offering were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper as it matured.

In May 2003, Wisconsin Electric sold $635 million of unsecured Debentures ($300 million of ten-year 4.50% Debentures due 2013 and $335 million of thirty-year 5.625%
Debentures due 2033) under an $800 million shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. Wisconsin Electric used a portion of the proceeds from the Debentures to repay short-term debt, which was originally incurred to retire debt that matured in
December 2002. The balance of the proceeds were used to redeem $425 million of Wisconsin Electric’s debt securities in June 2003 and to fund the early redemption in August 2003 of another $60 million debt issue.

In October 2003, Wisconsin Electric redeemed $9 million of 6.85% First Mortgage Bonds.

In December 2003, Wisconsin Gas sold $125 million of unsecured 5.20%
debentures due 2015. These securities were issued under an existing $200 million shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. The proceeds of the offering were used to repay short-term debt.

Obligations Under Capital Leases:

In 1997, Wisconsin
Electric entered into a 25 year power purchase contract with an unaffiliated independent power producer. The contract, for 236 megawatts of firm capacity from a gas-fired cogeneration facility, includes no minimum energy requirements. When the
contract expires in 2022, Wisconsin Electric may, at its option and with proper notice, renew for another ten years or purchase the generating facility at fair value or allow the contract to expire. We account for this contract as a capital lease
and recorded the leased facility and corresponding obligation under the capital lease at the estimated fair value of the plant’s electric generating facilities. We are amortizing the leased facility on a straight-line basis over the original
25-year term of the contract.

We treat the long-term power purchase contract
as an operating lease for rate-making purposes and we record our minimum lease payments as purchased power expense on the Consolidated Income Statements. We paid a total of $24.3 million, $23.4 million and $22.3 million in minimum lease payments
during 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. We record the difference between the minimum lease payments and the sum of imputed interest and amortization costs calculated under capital lease accounting as a deferred regulatory asset on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets (see deferred regulatory asset - plant related - capital lease in Note C). Due to the timing of the minimum lease payments, we expect the regulatory asset to increase to approximately $78.5 million by the year 2009 and
the total obligation under the capital lease to increase to $160.2 million by the end of 2005 before each is reduced to zero over the remaining life of the contract.

Wisconsin Electric also has a nuclear fuel leasing arrangement with Wisconsin Electric Fuel Trust (Trust) which is treated as a capital
lease. We lease and amortize the nuclear fuel to fuel expense as power is generated, generally over a period of 60 months. Lease payments include charges for the cost of fuel burned, financing costs and management fees. In the event that Wisconsin
Electric or the Trust terminates the lease, the Trust would recover its unamortized cost of nuclear fuel from Wisconsin Electric. Under the lease terms, Wisconsin Electric is in effect the ultimate guarantor of the Trust’s commercial paper and
line of credit borrowings that finance the investment in nuclear fuel. We recorded $1.4 million of interest expense on the nuclear fuel lease in fuel expense during 2004 and 2003 and $1.9 million during 2002.

Following is a summary of Wisconsin Electric’s capitalized leased facilities and nuclear
fuel at December 31.

Future minimum lease payments under our capital leases and the present value of our net minimum lease payments as of December 31, 2004 are as follows:

Trust Preferred Securities:

In March 1999, WEC Capital Trust I, a Delaware business trust of which we own all of the outstanding
common securities, issued $200 million of 6.85% trust preferred securities to the public. The sole asset of WEC Capital Trust I was $206.2 million of 6.85% junior subordinated debentures issued by us and due March 31, 2039. The terms and interest
payments on these debentures corresponded to the terms and distributions on the trust preferred securities. WEC Capital Trust I had been consolidated into our financial statements prior to adoption of Interpretation 46. In March 2004, WEC Capital
Trust I, the issuer of our trust preferred securities, redeemed all of the $200 million of the outstanding trust preferred securities, which required us to redeem our long-term notes due to WEC Capital Trust I. We financed this redemption through
the issuance of short-term commercial paper. In March 2004, we recorded approximately $5.9 million of costs associated with this early redemption, which are included in Other Income and Deductions, Net in our Consolidated Income Statement for the
year ended December 31, 2004.

K - SHORT-TERM DEBT

Short-term notes payable balances and their corresponding weighted-average interest rates as of December 31 consist of:

On December 31, 2004, we had
approximately $1.2 billion of available unused lines of bank back-up credit facilities on a consolidated basis. We had approximately $338.0 million of total consolidated short-term debt outstanding on such date. Our bank back-up credit facilities
mature beginning April 2006 through November 2007.

The following information
relates to Short-Term Debt for the years ending December 31, 2004 and 2003:

Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric
and Wisconsin Gas have entered into various bank back-up credit agreements to maintain short-term credit liquidity which, among other terms, require the companies to maintain a minimum total funded debt to capitalization ratio of less than 70%, 65%
and 65%, respectively.

Wisconsin Energy’s bank back-up credit facilities
require us to maintain a minimum ratio of consolidated EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) to consolidated interest expense. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 we were in compliance.

L - ASSET
RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

SFAS 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations, primarily applies to the future decommissioning costs for our Point Beach Nuclear Plant (Point Beach). Prior to January 2003, we recorded a long-term liability for accrued nuclear decommissioning costs. See Note H for further
information about the nuclear decommissioning of Point Beach including our investments in Nuclear Decommissioning Trusts that are restricted to nuclear decommissioning.

SFAS 143 also applies to a smaller extent to several other utility assets including the dismantlement of certain hydro facilities and the
removal of certain coal handling equipment and water intake facilities located on lakebeds. We have not recorded any asset retirement obligations for the removal of the coal handling equipment or for the water intake facilities located on lakebeds
because the associated liability cannot be reasonably estimated.

The following
table presents the change in our asset retirement obligations during 2004.

M - DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

We follow SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, effective July 1, 2003, which requires that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as an asset or liability measured at its fair value and that changes in the derivative’s
fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. For most energy related physical and financial contracts in our regulated operations that qualify as derivatives under SFAS 133, the PSCW allows the
effects of the fair market value accounting to be offset to regulatory assets and liabilities.

Wisvest - Connecticut LLC, which was sold December 6, 2002, had fuel oil contracts utilized to mitigate the commodity risk associated with generation costs. These contracts were defined as derivatives under SFAS 133
and did not qualify or were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. For the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded non-cash, after - tax income of $12.7 million to reflect the changes in fuel oil prices during the year and the settlement
of transactions.

We have a limited number of financial contracts that are
defined as derivatives under SFAS 133 and qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. These contracts are utilized to manage the cost of gas for utility operations and gas used in testing a new generating unit under construction. Changes in the fair
market values of these instruments are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. At the date the underlying transaction occurs, the amounts in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income for utility operations are reported in earnings and
amounts related to the new generating unit are capitalized.

For the years
ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 the amount of hedge ineffectiveness was immaterial. We did not exclude any components of derivative gains or losses from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The maximum length of time over which we are hedging our
exposure to the variability in future cash flows of forecasted transactions as of December 31, 2004 was six months. We estimate that $0.6 million will be reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income to earnings or capitalized to Plant
during the first six months of 2005.

During March 2003, we settled several
treasury lock agreements entered into earlier in the first quarter of 2003 and during the third quarter of 2002 to mitigate interest rate risk associated with the issuance of $200 million of long-term unsecured senior notes in March 2003. As these
agreements qualified for cash flow hedging accounting treatment under SFAS 133, the payment made upon settlement of these agreements is deferred in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and is being amortized as an increase to Interest Expense over
the same period in which the interest cost is recognized in income.

We
reclassified $0.8 million in treasury lock agreement settlement payments deferred in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, as an increase to Interest Expense for the year ended December 31, 2004. We estimate that during the next twelve months,
$0.6 million will be reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income as a reduction in earnings. We reclassified $0.8 million to Interest Expense for the year ended December 31, 2003.

In addition, during 2004, in conjunction with the redemption of $300 million of Wisconsin
Energy 5.875% senior notes due April 1, 2006, $0.6 million of a treasury lock agreement settlement payment previously deferred in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income was reclassified to Other Income and Deductions, Net.

N - FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The carrying amount and estimated fair value of certain of our recorded financial instruments at December 31 are as follows:

The carrying value of cash and cash
equivalents, net accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term borrowings approximates fair value due to the short term nature of these instruments. The nuclear decommissioning trust fund is carried at fair value as reported by the trustee
(see Note H). The fair value of our preferred stock is estimated based upon the quoted market value for the same or similar issues. The fair value of our long-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt but excluding capitalized
leases, is estimated based upon quoted market value for the same or similar issues or upon the quoted market prices of U.S. Treasury issues having a similar term to maturity, adjusted for the issuing company’s bond rating and the present value
of future cash flows. The fair values of gas commodity instruments are equal to their carrying values as of December 31, 2004.

O - BENEFITS

Pensions and Other Post-retirement Benefits:

We have funded and unfunded noncontributory defined
benefit pension plans that together cover substantially all of our employees. The plans provide defined benefits based upon years of service and final average salary.

We also have other post-retirement benefit plans covering substantially all of our employees. The health care plans are contributory with
participants’ contributions adjusted annually; the life insurance plans are noncontributory. The accounting for the health care plans anticipates future cost-sharing changes to the written plans that are consistent with our expressed intent to
maintain the current cost sharing levels. The post-retirement health care plans include a limit on our share of costs for recent and future retirees. We use a year end measurement date for all of our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Cont’d)

The components of net periodic pension and other post-retirement benefit costs are:

The expected long-term rate of return
on plan assets was 9% in 2004 and 2003. This return expectation on plan assets was determined by reviewing actual pension historical returns as well as calculating expected total trust returns using the weighted average of long-term market returns
for each of the asset categories utilized in the pension fund.

Other
Post-retirement Benefits Plans:

We use various Employees’ Benefit Trusts to fund a major portion of other post-retirement benefits. The majority of the trusts’ assets are mutual funds or commingled indexed
funds.

A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates
would have the following effects:

In December 2003, the Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (Act) was signed into law. The Act introduced a prescription drug benefit program under Medicare as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans. In the
second quarter of 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) SFAS 106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2004 Form 10-K

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Cont’d)

In accordance with FSP 106-2, we chose to recognize the effects of the Act retroactively effective January 1, 2004
with the impacts calculated actuarially. The act resulted in a reduction of $24.1 million in our benefit obligation and reduced our 2004 SFAS 106 expense by $4.7 million. Assumptions used to develop this reduction include those used in the
determination of the annual SFAS 106 expense and also include expectations of how the federal program will ultimately operate. In January 2005, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services released final regulations to implement the new
prescription drug benefit under Part D of Medicare. It was determined that the employer sponsored plans meet these regulations and that the previously determined actuarial measurements are still accurate. The final regulations have not yet addressed
account based plans similar to the Cash Balance Medical Plan covering former Wisconsin Gas employees. These plans are expected to be addressed by the regulations in February 2005. At this point, we do not expect the final regulations will change our
estimates.

Plan Assets:

In our opinion,
current pension trust assets and amounts which are expected to be contributed to the trusts in the future will be adequate to meet pension payment obligations to current and future retirees. Our pension plans asset allocation at December 31, 2004
and 2003, and our target allocation for 2005, by asset category, are as follows:

Our common stock is not included in
equity securities. Investment managers are specifically prohibited from investing in our securities or any affiliate of ours except if part of a commingled fund.

The target asset allocation was established by our Board of Directors appointed Investment Trust Policy Committee, which oversees investment
matters related to all of our funded benefit plans. Asset allocation is monitored by the Investment Trust Policy Committee.

Our other post-retirement benefit plans asset allocation at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and our target allocation for 2005, by asset category, are as follows:

Our common stock is not included in
equity securities. Investment managers are specifically prohibited from investing in our securities or any affiliate of ours except if part of a commingled fund.

The target asset allocation was established by our Board of Directors appointed Investment Trust Policy Committee, which oversees investment

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Cont’d)

Of the $5.7 million expected to be
contributed to fund pension benefits in 2005, none will be for our qualified plans since there is no minimum required by law. We contributed $55.7 million to our qualified pension plans during 2004. There was no contribution made during 2003 to the
qualified pension plans.

The entire contribution to the other post-retirement
benefit plans during 2004 was discretionary as the plans are not subject to any minimum regulatory funding requirements.

The following table identifies our expected benefit payments over the next 10 years:

Savings
Plans:

We sponsor savings plans which allow employees to contribute a portion of their pre-tax and or after-tax income in accordance with plan-specified guidelines. Under these plans we expensed matching contributions
of $10.5 million, $10.1 million and $10.0 million during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Severance Plans

:

For the year ended December 31, 2004 we incurred $30.5 million ($18.3 million after-tax) of severance costs. The majority of the severance costs related to
an enhanced severance package offered to selected management employees of Wisconsin Energy and its subsidiaries who voluntarily resigned in the fourth quarter of 2004. The program was enacted to help reduce the upward pressure on operating expenses.

Approximately 200 employees received severance benefits during 2004. As of
December 31, 2004 we have accrued $6.6 million of severance benefits which are expected to be paid during 2005.

P - GUARANTEES

We enter into various guarantees to provide financial and performance assurance to third parties on behalf of our affiliates. As of December
31, 2004 we had the following guarantees:


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2004 Form 10-K

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Cont’d)

A Non-Utility Energy guarantee in support of Wisvest-Connecticut, which we sold in December 2002 to PSEG, provides
financial assurance for potential obligations relating to environmental remediation under the original purchase agreement for Wisvest-Connecticut with United Illuminating. The potential obligations for environmental remediation, which are unlimited,
are reimbursable by PSEG under the terms of the sale agreement in the event that we are required to perform under the guarantee.

Other guarantees support obligations of our affiliates to third parties under loan agreements, surety bonds and obligations under legal proceedings of the manufacturing
business which was sold in July 2004. In the event our affiliates or the manufacturing business fail to perform, we would be responsible for the obligations.

Wisconsin Electric guarantees the potential retrospective premiums that could be assessed under Wisconsin Electric’s nuclear insurance program (See Note H).

Subsidiary guarantees support loan obligations between our affiliates and
third parties. In the event the loan obligations are not performed, our subsidiary would be responsible for the obligations.

Postemployment benefits:

Postemployment benefits provided to former or inactive employees are recognized when an event occurs. The
estimated liability for such benefits was $15.6 million as of December 31, 2004.

Q - SEGMENT REPORTING

Our reportable operating segments at December 31, 2004 include a utility energy segment and a non-utility energy segment. Additionally, our manufacturing segment was an operating segment prior to the sale of the
segment in July 2004 to Pentair, Inc. We have organized our reportable operating segments based in part upon the regulatory environment in which our utility subsidiaries operate. In addition, the segments are managed separately because each business
requires different technology and marketing strategies. The accounting policies of the reportable operating segments are the same as those described in Note A.

Our utility energy segment primarily includes our electric and natural gas utility operations. Our electric utility operation engages in the generation, distribution
and sale of electric energy in southeastern (including metropolitan Milwaukee), east central and northern Wisconsin and in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Our natural gas utility operation is engaged in the purchase, distribution and sale of
natural gas to retail customers and the transportation of customer-owned natural gas throughout Wisconsin. Our non-utility energy segment derives its revenues primarily from the ownership of electric power generating facilities for long-term lease
to Wisconsin Electric and economic interests in other energy-related entities.

Summarized financial information concerning our reportable operating segments for each of the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, is shown in the following table. The segment information below includes non-cash impairment charges
of $149.0 million ($96.9 million after tax or $0.81 per share) in 2004, $45.6 million ($29.7 million after tax or $0.25 per share), net of gains in 2003 and $141.5 million ($92.0 million after tax or $0.79 per share) in 2002, primarily related to
the Non-Utility Energy segment (See Notes E and F). Substantially all of our long-lived assets and operations are domestic.

R - RELATED PARTIES

American Transmission Company:

We have a 37.8% interest in ATC, a regional transmission company established in 2000 under
Wisconsin legislation. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, we paid ATC $105.8 million, $94.4 million and $87.3 million, respectively, for transmission services. We also provide a variety of operational, maintenance and project management work for ATC, which
are reimbursed to us by ATC.

Guardian
Pipeline:

We have a one third ownership interest in Guardian Pipeline, L.L.C., which owns and operates an interstate natural gas pipeline. Wisconsin Gas has committed to purchase 650,000 dekatherms per day of capacity
(approximately 87% of the pipeline’s total capacity) under the terms of a 10 year transportation agreement expiring December 2012.

S - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Capital Expenditures:

We have made certain commitments
in connection with 2005 capital expenditures.

Operating
Leases:

We enter into long-term purchase power contracts to meet a portion of our anticipated increase in future electric energy supply needs. These contracts expire at various times through 2013. Certain of these
contracts were deemed to qualify as operating leases.

Future minimum payments
for the next five years and thereafter for these contracts are as follows:

Environmental
Matters:

We periodically review our exposure for environmental remediation costs as evidence becomes available indicating that our liability has changed. Given current information, including the following, we believe
that future costs in excess of the amounts accrued and/or disclosed on all presently known and quantifiable environmental contingencies will not be material to our financial position or results of operations.

We have a program of comprehensive environmental remediation planning for former manufactured
gas plant sites and coal-ash disposal sites. We perform ongoing assessments of manufactured gas plant sites and related disposal sites previously used by Wisconsin Electric or Wisconsin Gas, and coal ash disposal/landfill sites used by Wisconsin
Electric, as discussed below. We are working with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources in our investigation and remediation planning. At this time, we cannot estimate future remediation costs associated with these sites beyond those
described below.

Manufactured Gas Plant
Sites:

We have identified fourteen sites at which Wisconsin Electric, Wisconsin Gas, or a predecessor company historically owned or operated a manufactured gas plant. We have completed planned remediation activities at
five of those sites. Remediation at additional sites is currently being performed, and other sites are being investigated or monitored. We have identified additional sites that may have been impacted by historical manufactured gas plant activities.
Based upon ongoing analysis, we estimate that the future costs for detailed site investigation and future remediation costs may range from $25-$50 million over the next ten years. This estimate is dependent upon several variables including, among
other things, the extent of remediation, changes in technology and changes in regulation. As of December 31, 2004, we have established reserves of $26.6 million related to future remediation costs.


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2004 Form 10-K

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Cont’d)

The PSCW has allowed Wisconsin utilities, including Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas, to defer the costs spent on
the remediation of manufactured gas plant sites, and has allowed for these costs to be recovered in rates over five years. Accordingly, we have recorded a regulatory asset for remediation costs.

Ash Landfill Sites:

Wisconsin Electric aggressively
seeks environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for its coal combustion by-products. However, these coal-ash by-products have been, and to a small degree, continue to be disposed in company-owned, licensed landfills. Some early designed and
constructed landfills may allow the release of low levels of constituents resulting in the need for various levels of monitoring or adjusting. Where Wisconsin Electric has become aware of these conditions, efforts have been expended to define the
nature and extent of any release, and work has been performed to address these conditions. The costs of these efforts are included in the fuel costs of Wisconsin Electric. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, Wisconsin Electric incurred $1.8 million, $2.1
million and $2.1 million, respectively, in coal-ash remediation expenses. As of December 31, 2004 we have no reserves established related to ash landfill sites.

EPA Information Requests:

Wisconsin Electric received a request for information in December 2000 from the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regional offices pursuant to Section 114(a) of the Clean Air Act and a supplemental request in December 2002. In April 2003, Wisconsin Electric and EPA announced that a consent decree had been reached which
resolved all issues related to this matter. In July 2003, the court granted the state of Michigan and EPA’s joint motion to amend the consent decree to allow Michigan to become a party. Under the consent decree, Wisconsin Electric will
significantly reduce its air emissions from its coal-fired generating facilities. The reductions will be achieved by 2013 through a combination of installing new pollution control equipment, upgrading existing equipment, and retiring certain older
units. The capital cost of implementing this agreement is estimated to be approximately $600 million over the 10 years ending 2013. Under the agreement with EPA, Wisconsin Electric will conduct a full scale demonstration at its Presque Isle
facility, in cooperation with the United States Department of Energy (DOE), to test new mercury reduction technologies. The DOE will contribute $24.8 million in addition to the $20 to $25 million Wisconsin Electric will spend to implement this
project. These steps and the associated costs are consistent with our cost projections for implementing our Wisconsin Multi-Emission Cooperative Agreement and our

Power the Future

plan. Wisconsin Electric also agreed to pay a civil penalty of
$3.2 million which was charged to earnings in the second quarter of 2003.

The
agreement has gone through the public comment period. In October 2003, three citizen groups filed a motion with the court to intervene in the proceeding to contest the consent decree; the court granted their motion. Also, in October 2003, the
government filed its response to public comments and a motion asking the court to approve the amended consent decree. The intervenor groups subsequently filed a motion requesting that the court stay the government’s motion for approval of the
decree to allow the intervenors to conduct discovery. Briefing was completed and the judge heard oral arguments from the parties in August 2004. In September 2004, the court granted the intervenors’ request for limited discovery with respect to
two facilities within our generation fleet, and ordered that discovery be completed by December 2004. Final briefing is scheduled to be concluded on February 28, 2005. Following the submission of briefs, the court may convene additional hearings.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of
Directors and Stockholders of Wisconsin Energy Corporation:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of capitalization of Wisconsin Energy Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated
statements of income, common equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted
our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31,
2004 and 2003, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s
board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may
not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of capitalization as of December 31, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income, common equity,
and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2004 of the Company and our report dated February 9, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by us in
the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on
the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its evaluation under the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework, our management concluded
that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2004.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance
with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as auditors of our financial statements has issued an attestation report on management’s
assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. Deloitte & Touche’s report is included in this report.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There has not been any change in our internal control over financial
reporting during the fourth quarter of 2004 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Parent Company Only)

SCHEDULE I - CONDENSED PARENT COMPANY

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Cont’d)

1.    The condensed parent company financial statements and notes should
be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of Wisconsin Energy Corporation appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have reclassified certain prior year financial statement amounts due to the sale of our
investment of our manufacturing business and for the unallocated minimum pension liability which is now presented net.

2.    Various financing arrangements and regulatory requirements impose
certain restrictions on the ability of the principal utility subsidiaries to transfer funds to Wisconsin Energy in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances. Under Wisconsin law, Wisconsin Electric Power Company and Wisconsin Gas LLC are
prohibited from loaning funds, either directly or indirectly, to Wisconsin Energy. Wisconsin Energy does not believe that such restrictions will affect its operations.

3.    In September 2004, Wisconsin Energy
used cash proceeds from the sale of WICOR Industries for the redemption of $300 million of Wisconsin Energy 5.875% senior notes due April 1, 2006. In September 2004, we recorded $17.0 million of costs associated with this early redemption, which are
included in Other Income and Deductions for the year ended December 31, 2004. In March 2003, Wisconsin Energy sold $200 million of unsecured 6.20% Senior Notes due April 1, 2033. These securities were issued under a shelf registration statement
filed with the SEC. The proceeds of the offering were used to repay a portion of Wisconsin Energy’s outstanding commercial paper as it matured.

4.    Wisconsin Energy allocates the service cost component of pension
costs to participating companies based on labor dollars. The assets, obligations and the components of SFAS 87 pension costs other than service cost (including the minimum pension liability) are allocated by the Company’s actuary to each of the
participating companies as if each participating company had its own plan. The balance sheets reflect the unallocated amounts for the Wisconsin Energy Plan to its subsidiaries.

As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, Wisconsin Energy recorded a
minimum pension liability of $127.8 million and $107.7 million, respectively, to reflect the funded status of its unallocated portion of the pension plans. Wisconsin Energy has concluded that substantially all of the unrecognized pension costs which
arose from recording the minimum pension liability under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) 87, Employers’ Accounting for Pensions, related to utility operations qualify as a regulatory asset. As such, as of December 31, 2004 and
2003, Wisconsin Energy recorded pre-tax regulatory assets totaling $130.6 million and $116.5 million, respectively.

5.    In March 2004, WEC Capital Trust I, the issuer of Wisconsin
Energy’s Trust Preferred Securities, redeemed all the outstanding Trust Preferred Securities, which required Wisconsin Energy to redeem the long-term notes due to the Trust. Wisconsin Energy financed this redemption through the issuance of
short-term commercial paper. In March 2004, Wisconsin Energy recorded approximately $5.9 million of costs associated with this early redemption.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46). This standard requires an enterprise that is the primary
beneficiary of a variable interest entity to consolidate that entity. Wisconsin Energy applied the Interpretation to any existing interests in variable interest entities beginning in the third quarter of 2003. In October 2003, the FASB deferred the
adoption of FIN 46 for all entities commonly referred to as special-purpose entities to the first reporting period ending after December 15, 2003. In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46R, which revised FIN 46 and deferred the effective date for
interests held in variable interest entities other than special purpose entities to financial statements for periods ending after March 15, 2004. Wisconsin Energy adopted FIN 46R in the first quarter of 2004.

2004 Form 10-K

SCHEDULE I - CONDENSED PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Cont’d)

Wisconsin Energy continues to evaluate several tolling and purchased power agreements with third parties on a
quarterly basis. After making an exhaustive effort, Wisconsin Energy concluded that for three of these agreements, Wisconsin Energy is unable to obtain the information necessary to determine whether Wisconsin Energy is the primary beneficiary of
these variable interest entities. Pursuant to the terms of two of the three agreements, Wisconsin Energy delivers fuel to the entity’sfacilities and receives electric power. Wisconsin Energy pays the entity a “toll” to convert
Wisconsin Energy’s fuel into the electric energy. The output of the facility is available for Wisconsin Energy to dispatch during the term of the respective agreement. In the other agreement, Wisconsin Energy has rights to the firm capacity of
the entity’s facility. Wisconsin Energy has approximately $736.3 million of required payments over the remaining term of these three agreements, which expire over the next 18 years. Wisconsin Energy believes the required payments will continue
to be recoverable in rates. Wisconsin Energy accounts for one of these agreements as a capital lease.

6.    Wisconsin Energy and certain of its subsidiaries enter into various guarantees to provide financial and
performance assurance to third parties on behalf of affiliates. As of December 31, 2004, Wisconsin Energy had the following guarantees:

Utility guarantees support obligations of the utility segment under surety bonds and worker’s compensation.

Wisconsin Energy’s guarantees in support of our Non-Utility Energy segment guaranty
performance and payment obligations of Calumet Energy Team, We Power and Wisvest-Connecticut, which we sold in December 2002 to PSEG. A guarantee in support of Wisvest-Connecticut provides financial assurance for potential obligations relating to
environmental remediation under the original purchase agreement with United Illuminating. The potential obligations for environmental remediation, which are unlimited, are reimbursable by PSEG under the terms of the sale agreement in the event that
Wisconsin Energy is required to perform under the guarantee.

The guarantees
which support We Power and Calumet Energy Team are for obligations under purchase lease and management agreements with the utility segment and third parties.

Wisconsin Energy’s other guarantees support obligations to third parties under loan agreements, surety bonds, obligations under legal proceedings at the
manufacturing segment which was sold in July 2004 and the agreement with PSEG for the sale of Wisvest - Connecticut. In the event the guarantee fail to perform, Wisconsin Energy would be responsible for the obligations.
