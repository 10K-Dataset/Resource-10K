PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

INTRODUCTION

Wisconsin Energy Corporation was incorporated in the State of Wisconsin in 1981 and became a diversified holding company in 1986. We maintain our principal executive
offices in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Unless qualified by their context when used in this document, the terms Wisconsin Energy, the Company, our, us or we refer to the holding company and all of its subsidiaries.

We conduct our operations primarily in two operating segments: a utility energy segment and a non-utility energy segment. Our primary subsidiaries are Wisconsin
Electric, Wisconsin Gas and We Power.

Utility Energy Segment:

Our utility energy segment consists of: Wisconsin Electric, Wisconsin Gas
and Edison Sault. We serve approximately 1,125,200 electric customers in Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. We have approximately 1,041,400 gas customers in Wisconsin, 460 steam customers in metro Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and 3,000 water
customers in suburban Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas operate under the trade name of “We Energies”.

Non-Utility Energy Segment:

Our non-utility energy segment consists primarily of We Power. We Power was formed in 2001 to design, construct, own and lease to Wisconsin Electric the new generating capacity included in our
PTF strategy. See Item 7 for more information on PTF.

Discontinued Operations:

Effective September 27, 2006, we sold
100% of our membership interests in Minergy Neenah. Previously Minergy Neenah operations were included in Corporate and Other. We sold our Calumet facility, which was part of our non-utility energy segment, effective May 31, 2005. Effective
July 31, 2004, we sold our manufacturing segment.

PTF Strategy:

In September 2000, we announced our PTF strategy to improve
the supply and reliability of electricity in Wisconsin. As part of our PTF strategy, we are: (1) investing in new natural gas-fired and coal-fired electric generating facilities, (2) upgrading Wisconsin Electric’s existing electric
generating facilities and (3) investing in upgrades of our existing energy distribution system. Also, as part of this strategy, we announced and began implementing plans to divest non-core assets and operations in our non-utility energy segment
and to reduce our real estate operations. Additional information concerning PTF may be found below under Non-Utility Energy Segment, as well as in Item 7.

For further financial information about our business segments, see Results of Operations in Item 7 and Note Q — Segment Reporting in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Our annual and periodical filings to the SEC are available, free of charge, through our Internet website www.wisconsinenergy.com. These documents are available as soon
as reasonably practicable after such materials are filed (or furnished) with the SEC.

UTILITY ENERGY SEGMENT

ELECTRIC UTILITY OPERATIONS

Our electric utility operations consist
of the electric operations of Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault. Wisconsin Electric, which is the largest electric utility in the State of Wisconsin, generates and distributes electric energy in a territory in southeastern (including the
metropolitan Milwaukee area), east central and northern Wisconsin and in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Edison Sault generates and distributes electric energy in a territory in the eastern Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

Effective April 1, 2005, Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault began to participate in the MISO Midwest Market which changed how our generating units are dispatched
and how we buy and sell power. For further information, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7.

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS - (Cont’d)

Electric Sales

Our electric energy sales to all classes of customers, excluding intercompany sales between Edison Sault and Wisconsin Electric, totaled approximately 31.9 million MWh during 2006 and approximately 32.5 million MWh during 2005.
Edison Sault did not have any significant MWh sales during 2005 and 2006 to Wisconsin Electric. Approximately 0.4 million MWh sales of Wisconsin Electric during 2005 and 2006 were to Edison Sault. We had approximately 1,125,200 electric
customers at December 31, 2006 and 1,115,300 electric customers at December 31, 2005.

Wisconsin Electric:

Wisconsin Electric
is authorized to provide retail electric service in designated territories in the State of Wisconsin, as established by indeterminate permits, CPCNs or boundary agreements with other utilities, and in certain territories in the State of Michigan
pursuant to franchises granted by municipalities. Wisconsin Electric also sells wholesale electric power within the MISO Midwest Market.

Edison
Sault:

Edison Sault is authorized to provide retail electric service in certain territories in the State of Michigan pursuant to franchises granted by municipalities. Edison Sault also provides wholesale electric service under
contract with one rural cooperative.

Electric Sales Growth:

We presently anticipate total retail and municipal electric kWh sales of
our utility energy segment will grow at an annual rate of 1% to 1.5% over the next five years. This estimate excludes the mine contract (see Legal Matters under Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7), and assumes
moderate growth in the economy of our electric utility service territories and normal weather. We also anticipate that our peak electric demand will grow at a rate of 1.5% to 2.0% over the next five years.

Sales to Large Electric Retail Customers:

Wisconsin Electric provides electric utility service to a diversified base of customers in such
industries as mining, paper, foundry, food products and machinery production, as well as to large retail chains. Edison Sault provides electric service to industrial accounts in the paper, crude oil pipeline and limestone quarry industries, as well
as to several state and federal government facilities.

Our largest retail electric customers are two iron ore mines located in the Upper Peninsula of
Michigan. Wisconsin Electric currently has special negotiated power-sales contracts with these mines that expire in December 2007. The combined electric energy sales to the two mines accounted for 6.2% and 7.1% of our total electric utility energy
sales during 2006 and 2005, respectively. In 2005, the mines notified us that they were disputing certain billings and they have placed the disputed amounts in escrow. We have notified the mines that we believe that they have failed to comply with
certain notification provisions related to annual production as specified within the contract. Arbitration hearings related to this matter are scheduled for August 2007. Although it is currently uncertain, we anticipate that we will provide
power to the mines under the terms of one or more regulated tariffs to be approved by the MPSC beginning January 1, 2008. For further information, see Legal Matters under Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources in
Item 7.

Sales to Wholesale Customers:

During 2006, Wisconsin Electric sold wholesale electric energy to two municipally
owned systems, two rural cooperatives and one municipal joint action agency located in the states of Wisconsin and Michigan. Wholesale electric energy sales by Wisconsin Electric were also made to 34 other public utilities and power marketers
throughout the region under rates approved by FERC. Edison Sault sold wholesale electric energy to one rural cooperative during 2006. Wholesale sales accounted for approximately 9.7% of our total electric energy sales and 5.1% of total electric
operating revenues during 2006, compared with 8.8% of total electric energy sales and 4.9% of total electric operating revenues during 2005.

Electric System Reliability Matters:

Electric energy sales are impacted by seasonal factors and varying weather conditions from year-to-year. As a summer peaking utility, we reached our all-time electric peak demand
obligation of 6,505 MW on July 31, 2006. The summer period is the most relevant period for capacity planning purposes for us as a result of cooling load. Prior to 2006, Wisconsin Electric was a member of the MAIN reliability council, whose
guidelines required a minimum 14% planning reserve margin for the short-term (up to one year ahead). Effective January 1, 2006, Wisconsin Electric became a member of ReliabilityFirst Corporation, a successor council encompassing most of the
East Central Area Reliability Council and Mid-Atlantic Area Council and a portion of MAIN. ReliabilityFirst Corporation has not yet established guidelines in this area but members are expected to adhere to the guidelines of their predecessor
councils until new guidelines are established. Wisconsin Electric must also adhere to PSCW guidelines requiring an 18% planning reserve margin and we expect to be in compliance with


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2006 Form 10-K

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS - (Cont’d)

ReliabilityFirst Corporation guidelines when they are established. The MPSC has not established guidelines in this
area.

We had adequate capacity to meet all of our firm electric load obligations during 2006 and expect to have adequate capacity to meet all of our firm
obligations during 2007. For additional information, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7.

Electric Supply

The table below indicates our sources of electric energy supply as a percentage of sales, for the three years ended December 31, 2006, as well as
an estimate for 2007. This information excludes any impact of the proposed sale of Point Beach.

Our PTF strategy, which is discussed further in Item 7, includes the addition of 2,320 MW of generating
capacity through 2010. Our PTF strategy includes two 545 MW natural gas units at an existing site in Port Washington, Wisconsin. The first unit, which has a current dependable capability of 575 MW, was placed into service in July 2005. The
second unit is expected to be placed in service in 2008. We have begun construction of two 615 MW coal units (of which we will own approximately a 515 MW share of each unit) in Oak Creek, Wisconsin adjacent to the site of Wisconsin Electric’s
existing Oak Creek Power Plant. We anticipate that the first coal unit will be placed in service in 2009, followed by the second unit in 2010.

We believe
that our PTF strategy will allow us to better manage the mix of fuels used to generate electricity for our customers. We believe that it is in the best interests of our customers to provide a diverse fuel mix that is expected to maintain a stable,
reliable and affordable energy supply in our service territory.

Our net generation, including PWGS 1, totaled 28.9 million MWh during 2006 compared
with 28.2 million MWh during 2005 and 29.2 million MWh during 2004. Net generation as a percent of our total electric energy supply increased in 2006 due to the availability of the PWGS 1 for the entire year and one fewer scheduled nuclear
outage in 2006 versus 2005.

Our average fuel and purchased power costs per MWh by fuel type for the years ended December 31 are shown below.

We use natural gas to fuel our peaking units that are designed to run for short durations. The PWGS natural
gas-fired units that are part of the PTF strategy are combined cycle facilities that are designed to run for longer durations and at a lower operating cost as compared to a peaking unit.


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2006 Form 10-K

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS - (Cont’d)

Historically, the fuel costs for coal and nuclear generation have been under long-term contracts, which helped with
price stability. In 2006, we entered into new coal contracts to replace certain contracts that expired during 2006. Coal and associated transportation services have seen greater volatility in pricing than typically experienced in these markets due
to increases in the domestic and world-wide demand for coal and the impacts of higher diesel costs in the last three years which has been reflected in the form of fuel surcharges on rail transportation. Coal price increases in 2006 were more
pronounced due to the expiration of certain favorable long-term contracts at the end of 2005. Based on current market conditions, we expect our coal and transportation costs to continue to increase, but at a more modest rate than we experienced in
2006.

The costs for natural gas and purchased power, which is primarily natural gas-fired, are more volatile and have experienced significant increases
since 2002. Natural gas costs have increased significantly because the supply of natural gas in recent years has not kept pace with the demand for natural gas. Beginning in late 2003 and concurrent with the approval of the PSCW, we established a
hedging program to help manage our natural gas price risk. This hedging program is generally implemented on an 18 month forward-looking basis. Proceeds related to the natural gas hedging program are reflected in the 2006, 2005 and 2004 average costs
of natural gas and purchased power shown above.

Our installed capacity by fuel type for the years ended December 31, is shown below.

(a)

Dependable capability is the net power output under average operating conditions with equipment in an average state of repair as of a given month in a given year. The values were
established by test and may change slightly from year to year.

(b)

Approximately 50% of the Natural Gas/Oil units are dual fueled. The dual fuel facilities generally burn oil only if natural gas is not available due to constraints on the natural
gas pipeline and/or at the local gas distribution company that delivers gas to the plants. The increase in 2006 primarily reflects a 30 MW increase in dependable capability at PWGS 1, which was added in 2005, from the 545 MW guaranteed capacity
required under the lease.

Coal-Fired Generation

Coal Supply:

We diversify the coal supply for our power plants by purchasing coal from mines in northern and central Appalachia as well as from various western mines. During 2007, 96.2% of our projected coal requirements
of 12.2 million tons will be under contracts which are not tied to 2007 market pricing fluctuations. We do not anticipate any problem in procuring our remaining 2007 coal requirements. Our coal-fired generation consists of six operating plants
with a dependable capability of approximately 3,334 MW.

Following is a summary of the annual tonnage amounts for our principal long-term coal
contracts by the month and year in which the contracts expire.


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2006 Form 10-K

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS - (Cont’d)

Coal Deliveries:

Approximately 85.7% of our 2007 coal requirements are expected to be delivered by
Wisconsin Electric-owned or leased unit trains. The unit trains will transport coal for the Oak Creek, Pleasant Prairie and Edgewater Power Plants from Wyoming mines. Coal from Central Appalachia and Colorado mines is also transported via rail to
Lake Erie or Lake Michigan transfer docks and delivered to the Valley and Milwaukee County Power Plants. Montana and Wyoming coal for Presque Isle Power Plant is transported via rail to Superior, Wisconsin, placed in dock storage and reloaded into
lake vessels for plant delivery. Central Appalachia and Colorado coal bound for Presque Isle Power Plant is shipped via rail to Lake Erie and Lake Michigan (Chicago) coal transfer docks, respectively, for lake vessel delivery to the plant.

Environmental Matters:

For information regarding emission restrictions, especially as they relate to coal-fired generating facilities,
see Environmental Compliance below.

Nuclear Generation

Point Beach:

Wisconsin Electric owns two 518 MW electric generating units at Point Beach in Two Rivers, Wisconsin. The operating licenses for Point Beach will expire in October 2030 for Unit 1 and in March 2033 for
Unit 2. In December 2006, we announced that Wisconsin Electric had reached a definitive agreement to sell Point Beach to an affiliate of FPL. Under the agreement, FPL will purchase the plant, its nuclear fuel and associated inventories for
approximately $998 million, subject to closing price adjustments, and it will also assume the obligation to decommission the plant. We also entered into a long-term power purchase agreement to purchase all of the existing capacity and energy of the
plant, which will become effective upon closing of the sale. This transaction is subject to regulatory review and approval and we anticipate it will close during the third quarter of 2007. If and when the sale is completed (or earlier if an interim
operating agreement with FPL is activated by us), Point Beach’s operating licenses would transfer from NMC to FPL. Until the transaction is completed, Wisconsin Electric continues to own Point Beach and retains exclusive rights to the energy
generated by the plant, as well as financial responsibility for the safe operation, maintenance and decommissioning of Point Beach. For additional information concerning Point Beach, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources
— Nuclear Operations in Item 7 and Note I — Nuclear Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Nuclear Management Company:

NMC, owned by our affiliate, WEC Nuclear Corporation and the affiliates of two other unaffiliated investor-owned utilities in the region, operates Point Beach. NMC currently operates six nuclear
generating units at four sites in the states of Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan with a total combined generating capacity of approximately 3,500 MW. One of the other two unaffiliated investor-owned utilities has announced the planned sale of
their unit.

Nuclear Fuel Supply:

Wisconsin Electric purchases Yellowcake and contracts for its conversion, enrichment and fabrication. There
have been numerous events in the nuclear fuel supply market that have affected the price of uranium concentrates, conversion service and enrichment services. The price of the fuel commodities has risen steadily since the fourth quarter of 2003 and
we anticipate that the price will continue to rise due to current demand exceeding current supply. NMC is continually monitoring the nuclear fuel commodities market to assess current and future commodity pricing and adjusting purchasing strategies
to address changes in the market conditions. Wisconsin Electric maintains title to the nuclear fuel until fabricated fuel assemblies are delivered to Point Beach; it is then sold to and leased back from the Wisconsin Electric Fuel Trust. For further
information concerning this nuclear fuel lease, see Note K — Long-Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Uranium Requirements:

Wisconsin Electric requires approximately 400,000 to 450,000 pounds of Yellowcake to refuel a generating unit at Point Beach. Point Beach has staggered fuel cycles that are expected to
average approximately 18 months in duration. The supply of Yellowcake for these refuelings is currently provided through one long-term contract, which supplies 100% of the annual requirements through 2009. Contract negotiations
through NMC are currently underway that would supply approximately 60% of the Point Beach requirements from 2010 to 2016.

Conversion:

Wisconsin Electric had conversion services supply from a share of an NMC fleet contract for conversion services and four spot purchase contracts to meet 100% of its conversion requirements for 2006. In


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2006 Form 10-K

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS - (Cont’d)

2006, an additional NMC fleet contract for conversion services was signed to supply approximately 100% of the Point Beach requirements through 2010 and
approximately 10% of the 2011 requirements.

Enrichment:

Wisconsin Electric effectively has three contracts through NMC that provide for
100% of the required enrichment services for Point Beach through the year 2009 and approximately 70% of the enrichment services requirements through 2013.

Fabrication:

Fabrication of fuel assemblies from enriched uranium for Point Beach is covered under a contract with Westinghouse Electric Company, LLC. The current contract for fabrication services is through 2010 for Unit
1 and 2013 for Unit 2.

Used Nuclear Fuel Storage & Disposal:

For information concerning used nuclear fuel storage and disposal
issues, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7.

Nuclear Decommissioning:

Wisconsin Electric
provides for costs associated with the eventual decommissioning of Point Beach through the use of external trust funds. Payments to these funds, together with investment results, brought the balance in the funds at December 31, 2006 to
approximately $881.6 million. For additional information regarding decommissioning, including the impact of the proposed sale of Point Beach, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources — Nuclear Operations in
Item 7 and Note I — Nuclear Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Nuclear Plant
Insurance:

For information regarding nuclear plant insurance, see Note I — Nuclear Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Natural Gas-Fired Generation

Our natural gas-fired generation
consists of five operating plants with a dependable capability of approximately 1,475 MW at December 31, 2006. In July 2005, we added PWGS 1, a natural gas-fired unit with a dependable capability of 575 MW. A second 545 MW unit at
PWGS is expected to come on line in 2008.

We purchase natural gas for these plants on the spot market from gas marketers, utilities and producers and we
arrange for transportation of the natural gas to our plants. We have firm and interruptible transportation, balancing and storage agreements intended to support the plants’ variable usage.

The PSCW has approved a program that allows us to hedge up to 75% of our estimated gas usage for electric generation in order to help manage our natural gas price risk.
The costs of this program are included in our fuel and purchased power costs.

Oil-Fired Generation

Fuel oil is used for the combustion turbines at the Point Beach and Germantown Power Plants units 1-4. It is also used for boiler ignition and flame stabilization at
the Presque Isle Power Plant. Our oil-fired generation has a dependable capability of approximately 280 MW at December 31, 2006. The natural gas facilities generally burn oil only if natural gas is not available due to constraints on the
natural gas pipeline and/or at the local gas distribution company that delivers gas to the plants. Fuel oil requirements are purchased under agreements with suppliers.

Hydroelectric Generation

Wisconsin Electric:

Wisconsin Electric’s hydroelectric generating
system consists of thirteen operating plants with a total installed capacity of approximately 88 MW and a dependable capability of approximately 57 MW at December 31, 2006. Of these thirteen plants, twelve plants (86 MW of installed
capacity) have long-term licenses from FERC. The thirteenth plant, with an installed generating capacity of approximately 2 MW, does not require a license.

Edison Sault:

Edison Sault’s primary source of generation is its hydroelectric generating
plant located on the St. Mary’s River in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. The hydroelectric generating plant has a total dependable capability of approximately 27 MW. The water for this facility is leased under a contract with the United
States Army Corps of Engineers with tenure to December 31, 2050. However, the Secretary of the Army has the right to terminate the contract subsequent to December 2025 by providing at least a five-year termination notice. No such notice can be
given prior to December 31, 2020. Edison Sault pays for all water taken from the St. Mary’s River at predetermined rates with a minimum annual payment of $0.1 million. The total flow of water taken out of Lake Superior, which in
effect is the flow of water in the St. Mary’s River, is under the direction and control of the International Joint Commission, created by the Boundary Water Treaty of 1909 between the United States and Great Britain, now represented by
Canada.

Hydroelectric generation is also purchased by Edison Sault under contract from the United States Army Corps of Engineers’ hydroelectric
generating plant located within the Soo Locks complex on the St. Marys River in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. This 17 MW contract has tenure to November 1, 2040 and cannot be terminated by the United States government prior to
November 1, 2030.

Purchase Power Commitments

We
enter into short and long-term purchase power commitments to meet a portion of our anticipated electric energy supply needs. The following table identifies our purchase power commitments at December 31, 2006 with unaffiliated parties for the
next five years:

The majority of these purchase power commitments are tolling arrangements whereby we are responsible for the
procurement, delivery and cost of natural gas fuel related to specific units identified in the contracts. A small amount of these purchases are tied to the costs of natural gas.

We have entered into a long-term power purchase agreement with FPL that is contingent upon the sale of Point Beach. This agreement allows us to receive all the existing capacity and energy of the Point Beach units. We
will have the unilateral option, subject to PSCW direction, to select a term for the power purchase agreement of either (i) an estimated 23 years for Unit 1 and 26 years for Unit 2, or (ii) 16 years for Unit 1 and 17 years for Unit 2. This
agreement is subject to approval by various regulatory authorities.

Electric Transmission and Energy Markets

American Transmission Company:

ATC owns, maintains, monitors and operates electric utility transmission in Wisconsin, Michigan and Illinois. ATC’s
sole business is to provide reliable, economic electric transmission service to all customers in a fair and equitable manner. ATC is expected to provide comparable service to all customers, including Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault, and to
support effective competition in energy markets without favoring any market participant. ATC is regulated by FERC for all rate terms and conditions of service and is a transmission-owning member of MISO. As of February 1, 2002, operational
control of ATC’s transmission system was transferred to MISO, and Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault are non-transmission owning members and customers of MISO.

We owned approximately 29.4% and 33.5% of ATC as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. Our ownership has decreased from
December 31, 2005 as other owners have invested additional equity in ATC related to specific, large construction projects subject to their contractual rights.

MISO:

In connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed a bid-based energy market, the MISO Midwest Market, which was implemented on April 1, 2005. For further information on MISO and the MISO
Midwest Market, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7.

Renewable Electric Energy

Our PTF strategy includes a commitment to significantly increase the amount of renewable energy generation we
utilize. In addition, Wisconsin Electric has an “

Energy For Tomorrow

®

” renewable energy program to provide our customers the opportunity to purchase energy from renewable resources. In March 2006, Wisconsin enacted new public benefits legislation, Act 141. Act 141
changes the renewable energy requirements for utilities. Act 141 requires Wisconsin utilities to provide 2% more of their total retail energy from renewable resources than their current levels by 2010, and 6% more renewable energy than their current
levels by 2015. Act 141 establishes a statewide goal that 10% of all electricity in Wisconsin be generated by renewable resources by December 31, 2015. For further information on Act 141 and current renewable projects, see Factors

As measured at Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Normal degree days are based upon a 20-year moving average.

GAS UTILITY OPERATIONS

Our gas utility operations consist of
Wisconsin Gas and the gas operations of Wisconsin Electric. Both companies are authorized to provide retail gas distribution service in designated territories in the State of Wisconsin, as established by indeterminate permits, CPCNs, or boundary
agreements with other utilities. The two companies also transport customer-owned gas. Wisconsin Gas, the largest natural gas distribution utility in Wisconsin, operates throughout the state including the City of Milwaukee. Wisconsin Electric’s
gas utility operates in three distinct service areas: west and south of the City of Milwaukee, the Appleton area and areas within Iron and Vilas Counties, Wisconsin.

Gas Deliveries

Our gas utility business is highly seasonal due to the heating requirements of residential and commercial customers. Annual gas sales are also impacted by the variability of winter temperatures.

Total gas therms delivered, including customer-owned transported gas, were approximately 2,028.9 million therms during 2006, a 6.5% decrease compared with 2005. At
December 31, 2006, we were transporting gas for approximately 1,400 customers who purchased gas directly from other suppliers. Transported gas accounted for approximately 42% of the total volumes delivered during 2006, 41% during 2005, and
37% during 2004. We had approximately 1,041,400 gas customers at December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately 1.1% since December 31, 2005.

Our maximum daily send-out during 2006 was 1,406,429 Dth on February 18, 2006. A Dth is equivalent to ten therms or one million Btu.

Sales to Large Gas Customers:

We provide gas utility service to a diversified base of industrial customers who are largely within our electric service territory. Major industries served include the paper, food products
and fabricated metal products industries. Fuel used for Wisconsin Electric’s electric energy supply represents our largest transportation customer.

Gas Deliveries Growth:

We currently forecast total retail therm deliveries (excluding natural gas deliveries for generation) to stay flat over the five-year period ending December 31, 2011 as new customer additions
are expected to be offset by a reduction in the average use per customer. This forecast reflects a current year normalized sales level and assumes moderate growth in the economy of our gas utility service territories and normal weather.

Competition

Competition in varying degrees exists between natural
gas and other forms of energy available to consumers. Many of our large commercial and industrial customers are dual-fuel customers that are equipped to switch between natural gas and alternate fuels. We are allowed to offer lower-priced gas sales
and transportation services to dual fuel customers. Under gas transportation agreements, customers purchase gas directly from gas marketers and arrange with interstate pipelines and us to have the gas transported to their facilities. We earn
substantially the same margin (difference between revenue and cost of gas) whether we sell and transport gas to customers or only transport their gas.

Our
ability to maintain our share of the industrial dual-fuel market (the market that is equipped to use gas or other fuels) depends on our success and the success of third-party gas marketers in obtaining long-term and short-term supplies of natural
gas at competitive prices compared to other sources and in arranging or facilitating competitively-priced transportation service for those customers that desire to buy their own gas supplies.

Federal and state regulators continue to implement policies to bring more competition to the gas industry. For information concerning proceedings by the PSCW to consider
how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the gas industry, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7. While the gas utility distribution
function is expected to remain a highly regulated, monopoly function, the sales of the natural gas commodity and related services are expected to remain subject to competition from third parties. It remains uncertain if and when the current economic
disincentives for small customers to choose an alternative gas commodity supplier may be removed such that we begin to face competition for the sale of gas to our smaller firm customers.

Gas Supply, Pipeline Capacity and Storage

We have been able to meet our contractual obligations with both our
suppliers and our customers despite periods of severe cold and unseasonably warm weather.

Pipeline Capacity and Storage:

The interstate
pipelines serving Wisconsin originate in three major gas producing areas of North America: the Oklahoma and Texas basins, the Gulf of Mexico and western Canada. We have contracted for long-term firm capacity from each of these areas. This strategy
reflects management’s belief that overall supply


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2006 Form 10-K

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS - (Cont’d)

security is enhanced by geographic diversification of the supply portfolios and that Canada represents an important long-term source of reliable,
competitively-priced gas.

Because of the daily and seasonal variations in gas usage in Wisconsin, we have also contracted for substantial underground
storage capacity, primarily in Michigan. Storage capacity enables us to manage significant changes in daily demand and to optimize our overall gas supply and capacity costs. We generally inject gas into storage during the spring and summer months
and withdraw it in the winter months. As a result, we can contract for less long-line pipeline capacity than would otherwise be necessary, and can purchase gas on a more uniform daily basis from suppliers year-round. Each of these capabilities
enables us to reduce our overall costs. In 2006, we entered into gas purchase contracts which allow us to reduce gas inventory while maintaining supply to meet daily and seasonal demands.

We also maintain storage in the Southeast production areas, as well as in our market area. This storage capacity is designed to deliver gas when other supplies cannot be
delivered during extremely cold weather in the producing areas. We hold firm daily transportation and storage capacity entitlements from pipelines and other service providers under long-term contracts.

Term Gas Supply:

We have contracts for firm supplies with terms in excess of 30 days with suppliers for gas acquired in the Joliet, Illinois market
hub and in the three producing areas discussed above. The pricing of the term contracts is based upon first of the month indices. Combined with our storage capability, management believes that the volume of gas under contract is sufficient to meet
our forecasted firm peak day demand.

Secondary Market Transactions:

Capacity release is a mechanism by which pipeline long-line and
storage capacity and gas supplies under contract can be resold in the secondary market. Local distribution companies, like Wisconsin Gas and the gas operations of Wisconsin Electric, must contract for capacity and supply sufficient to meet the firm
peak day demand of their customers. Peak or near peak demand days generally occur only a few times each year. Capacity release facilitates higher utilization of contracted capacity and supply during those times when the full contracted capacity and
supply are not needed by the utility, helping to mitigate the fixed costs associated with maintaining peak levels of capacity and gas supply. Through pre-arranged agreements and day-to-day electronic bulletin board postings, interested parties can
purchase this excess capacity and supply. The proceeds from these transactions are passed through to ratepayers, subject to the Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas GCRMs pursuant to which the companies have an opportunity to share in the cost
savings. See Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources — Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters in Item 7 for information on the GCRMs. During 2006, we continued our active participation in the capacity release market.

Spot Market Gas Supply:

We expect to continue to make gas purchases in the 30-day spot market as price and other circumstances dictate.
We have supply relationships with a number of sellers from whom we purchase spot gas.

Hedging Gas Supply Prices:

We have PSCW
approval to hedge (i) up to 45% of planned flowing gas supply using NYMEX based natural gas options, (ii) up to 15% of planned flowing gas supply using NYMEX based natural gas future contracts and (iii) up to 35% of planned storage
withdrawals using NYMEX based natural gas options. Those approvals allow both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas to pass 100% of the hedging costs (premiums and brokerage fees) and proceeds (gains and losses) through their respective purchase gas
adjustment mechanisms. Hedge targets (volumes) are provided annually to the PSCW as part of each company’s five-year gas supply plan filing.

To the
extent that opportunities develop and our physical supply operating plans will support them, we also have PSCW approval to utilize NYMEX based natural gas derivatives to capture favorable forward market price differentials. That approval provides
for 100% of the related proceeds to accrue to the companies’ GCRMS.

Guardian Pipeline:

Prior to April 2006, we had a one-third
interest in Guardian. Guardian owns an interstate natural gas pipeline that runs from the Joliet, Illinois area to southeastern Wisconsin. In April 2006, we sold our one-third interest in Guardian to an unaffiliated entity. During 2006, Guardian
announced a plan to extend their pipeline by approximately 110 miles from southeastern Wisconsin to Green Bay, Wisconsin. We have committed to purchase approximately 292,000 Dth per day of capacity on this extension through October 2023. In
addition, we have extended our commitment to purchase 650,000 Dth per day of capacity on the original pipeline until December 2022. In October 2006, in connection with the Guardian extension, we filed applications with the PSCW to construct
approximately 27 miles of pipeline laterals to connect our gas distribution system to the proposed Guardian extension. The Guardian extension is projected to be operational in November 2008.

2006 and 2005, steam was used by approximately 460 customers for processing, space heating, domestic hot water and humidification.

Water Utility
Operations:

To leverage off of operational similarities with its natural gas business, Wisconsin Gas entered the water utility business in November 1998. As of December 31, 2006, the water utility served approximately 3,000 water
customers in the suburban Milwaukee area compared with approximately 2,800 customers at December 31, 2005. Wisconsin Gas also provides contract services to local municipalities and businesses within its service territory for water system repair
and maintenance. During 2006, the water utility had $2.5 million of operating revenues compared with $2.3 million of operating revenues during 2005.

NON-UTILITY ENERGY SEGMENT

Our non-utility energy segment is involved primarily in the design and construction of new generating capacity under our PTF strategy.

During
2000, we performed a comprehensive review of our existing portfolio of businesses and began implementing a strategy of divesting many of our non-utility energy segment businesses. Since 2000, we have sold our interest in many of our non-utility
energy assets with proceeds from these sales totaling approximately $616.8 million. As we implement our PTF strategy, we expect to grow the non-utility energy segment within the State of Wisconsin through the construction of new generating
units by our subsidiary We Power.

We Power

We
Power, through wholly owned subsidiaries, plans to design and construct, in the State of Wisconsin, an additional 1,775 MW of new generating capacity proposed as part of our PTF strategy, in addition to the 575 MW of current dependable
capacity at PWGS 1 that was put into service in July 2005. In November 2005, two unaffiliated entities purchased an ownership interest of approximately 17% or 200 MW of capacity in the two coal units that are being constructed in Oak
Creek, Wisconsin. Similar to the generating capacity at PWGS 1, We Power will own the remaining 1,575 MW of generating capacity currently being constructed and lease this capacity to Wisconsin Electric. At December 31, 2006, we had
approximately $888.5 million of CWIP for the PTF units currently under construction. For further information about our PTF strategy, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources —Power the Future in Item 7.

Wisvest Corporation

Wisvest was originally formed to
develop, own and operate electric generating facilities and to invest in other energy-related entities. As a result of the change in corporate strategy to focus on our PTF strategy, Wisvest has discontinued its development activity. For the year

REGULATION

Wisconsin Energy Corporation

Wisconsin Energy was an exempt holding company by order of the SEC under
Section 3(a)(1) of PUHCA 1935, and, accordingly, was exempt from that law’s provisions other than with respect to certain acquisitions of securities of a public utility. In August 2005, President Bush signed into law the Energy
Policy Act. The Energy Policy Act repealed PUHCA 1935 and enacted PUHCA 2005, transferring jurisdiction over holding companies from the SEC to FERC. Wisconsin Energy was required to notify FERC of its status as a holding company and to
seek from FERC the exempt status similar to that held under PUHCA 1935. In March 2006, Wisconsin Energy filed with FERC notification of its status as a holding company as required and a request for exempt status similar to that held under
PUHCA 1935. In June 2006, Wisconsin Energy received notice from FERC confirming its status as a holding company as required under FERC regulations implementing PUCHA 2005 and granting exempt status similar to that held under
PUHCA 1935.

Non-Utility Asset Cap:

In October 1999, the Wisconsin State Legislature passed amendments to the non-utility asset cap
provisions of Wisconsin’s public utility holding company law as part of the 1999-2001 biennial state budget, 1999 Wisconsin Act 9. As a result, we remain subject to certain restrictions that have the potential of limiting our
diversification into non-utility activities. Under the amended public utility holding company law, the sum of certain assets of all non-utility affiliates in a holding company system may not exceed 25% of the assets of all public utility affiliates.
However, among other items, the amended law exempts energy-related assets and assets, like Minergy’s, used for providing environmental engineering services and for processing waste materials, from being counted against the asset cap provided
that they are employed in qualifying businesses. As a result of these exemptions, our non-utility assets are significantly below the non-utility asset cap as of December 31, 2006.

Under our PTF strategy, the cost of constructing new generating facilities to be owned by We Power qualifies as energy projects under the amended non-utility asset cap and therefore would be entirely exempt from the
definition of “non-utility” property for this purpose. The remaining cost of our PTF plan represents investments in new and existing energy distribution system assets and upgrades to existing generation assets and has no impact on the
amount of non-utility assets under the non-utility asset cap test.

Utility Energy Segment

Wisconsin Electric was an exempt holding company under Section 3(a) (1) of PUHCA 1935 and Rule 2 thereunder and, accordingly, was exempt from that
law’s provisions other than with respect to certain acquisitions of securities of a public utility. Due to the Energy Policy Act’s enactment of PUHCA 2005 as noted above, Wisconsin Electric was also required to notify FERC of its
status as a holding company by reason of its ownership interest in ATC and to seek from FERC the exempt status similar to that held under PUHCA 1935. In March 2006, Wisconsin Electric filed with FERC notification of its status as a holding
company as required under FERC regulations implementing PUCHA 2005 and a request for exempt status similar to that held under PUHCA 1935. In June 2006, Wisconsin Electric received notice from FERC confirming its status as a holding company
as required under FERC regulations implementing PUCHA 2005 and granting exempt status similar to that held under PUHCA 1935. For information on how rates are set for our regulated entities see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters in
Item 7.

Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault are subject to the Energy Policy Act and the corresponding regulations developed by certain federal
agencies. The Energy Policy Act, among other things, repeals PUHCA 1935 making electric utility industry consolidation more possible, authorizes FERC to review proposed mergers and the acquisition of generation facilities, changes FERC regulatory
scheme applicable to qualifying co-generation facilities and modifies certain other aspects of energy regulations and Federal tax policies applicable to Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault. Additionally, the Energy Policy Act created an Electric
Reliability Organization to be overseen by FERC, which will establish mandatory electric reliability standards, replacing the current voluntary standards developed by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and will have the authority
to levy monetary sanctions for failure to comply with the new standards.

Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas are subject to the regulation of the PSCW as

Michigan Department of Environmental Quality.

Public Benefits and Renewables

In March 2006, Wisconsin enacted new public benefits legislation, Act 141. Act 141 changes the renewable energy requirements for utilities. Act 141 requires Wisconsin utilities to provide 2% more of their total
retail energy from renewable resources than their current levels by 2010, and 6% more renewable energy than their current levels by 2015. Act 141 also redirects the administration of energy efficiency, conservation and renewable programs from
the DOA back to the utilities and/or contracted third parties. In addition, Act 141 requires that 1.2% of utilities’ annual operating revenues be used to fund these programs. For additional information on Act 141 and current renewable
projects see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources — Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters - Renewables, Efficiency and Conservation and Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters - Wind Generation in Item 7.

In 2005, President Bush signed into law the Energy Policy Act. The Energy Policy Act and corresponding rules
developed by FERC require us to seek FERC authorization to allow Wisconsin Electric to lease from We Power the three PTF units that are currently being constructed by We Power. In November 2006, Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and We Power
filed a joint application for FERC authorization to transfer the generating assets and limited interconnection facilities of PWGS 2 and OC Units 1 and 2 through lease arrangements between We Power and Wisconsin Electric. We received approval
from FERC on this application in December 2006. We were not required to request similar approval for the PWGS 1 lease between We Power and Wisconsin Electric as this unit was in service prior to the enactment of the Energy Policy Act.

In addition, for a short period prior to the transfer of each generation unit to Wisconsin Electric, We Power will be engaged in the sale of test power, a FERC
jurisdictional transaction. We Power received approval from FERC for the sale of test power to Wisconsin Electric from PWGS 1, and for the transfer of any FERC jurisdictional facilities at Port Washington to Wisconsin Electric and/or ATC. In
July 2005, PWGS 1 became operational and the sale of test power ceased. Under Wisconsin law, We Power is not a “public utility.” Environmental permits necessary for operating the facilities are the responsibility of the operating
entity, Wisconsin Electric.

Lakeside Power Plant in St. Francis, Wisconsin. Excavation and utilization of residual coal at the site, slope stabilization and cover construction have been completed. Currently, discussions are taking place with neighbors and other interested
parties to determine the ultimate use of the remediated property and some other adjacent land also owned by Wisconsin Electric.

Oak Creek North Landfill:

Groundwater impairments at this landfill, located in the City of Oak
Creek, Wisconsin, prompted Wisconsin Electric to investigate, during 1998, the condition of the existing cover and other conditions at the site. Surface water drainage improvements were implemented at this site during 1999 and 2000, which are
expected to eliminate ash contact with water and remove unwanted ponding of water. The approved remediation plan was coordinated with activities associated with the construction of the new units. Currently there is a temporary cap installed and
being used as laydown area and parking. When construction activities are completed, a permanent cap will be installed.

RISK FACTORS

Our business is significantly impacted by
governmental regulation.

We are subject to significant state, local and federal governmental regulation. We are subject to the regulation of the
PSCW as to retail electric, gas and steam rates in the State of Wisconsin, standards of service, issuance of securities, short-term debt obligations, construction of certain new facilities, transactions with affiliates, billing practices and various
other matters. In addition, we are subject to the regulation of the MPSC as to the various matters associated


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2006 Form 10-K

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS - (Cont’d)

with retail electric service in the State of Michigan, except as to issuance of securities, construction of certain new facilities, levels of short-term debt
obligations and advance approval of transactions with affiliates. Further, our hydroelectric facilities are regulated by FERC, and FERC also regulates our wholesale power service practices. Our significant level of regulation imposes restrictions on
our operations and causes us to incur substantial compliance costs.

We are obligated in good faith to comply with all applicable governmental rules and
regulations. If it is determined that we failed to comply with any applicable rules or regulations, whether through new interpretations or applications of the regulations or otherwise, we may be liable for customer refunds, penalties or other
amounts, which could materially adversely effect our results of operations and financial condition.

We estimate that within our regulated energy segment,
approximately 88% of our electric revenues are regulated by the PSCW, 7% are regulated by the MPSC and the balance of our electric revenues is regulated by FERC. All of our natural gas revenues are regulated by the PSCW.

Our ability to obtain rate adjustments in the future is dependent upon regulatory action and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain rate adjustments in
the future that will allow us to recover our prudent costs and expenses and to maintain our current authorized rates of return.

Factors beyond our
control could adversely affect project costs and completion of the natural gas-fired and coal-fired generating units we are constructing as part of our PTF strategy.

Under our PTF strategy, we expect to meet a significant portion of our future generation needs through the construction of two 545 MW natural gas-fired generating units at PWGS and two 615 MW coal-fired generating
units to be located adjacent to our existing Oak Creek Power Plant. PWGS 1 was placed in service in July 2005 and has a current dependable capability of 575 MW. A second 545 MW natural gas-fired generating unit is currently being constructed.

Large construction projects of this type are subject to usual construction risks over which we will have limited or no control and which might adversely
affect project costs and completion time. These risks include, but are not limited to, shortages of, the inability to obtain or the cost of labor or materials, the inability of the general contractor or subcontractors to perform under their
contracts, strikes, adverse weather conditions, the inability to obtain necessary permits in a timely manner and changes in applicable law or regulations, adverse interpretation or enforcement of permit conditions, laws and regulations by the
permitting agencies, governmental actions and events in the global economy.

If final costs for the construction of the PWGS units exceed the fixed costs
allowed in the PSCW order, absent a finding by the PSCW of extraordinary circumstances, such as force majeure conditions, this excess will not adjust the amount of the lease payments recovered from Wisconsin Electric. If final costs of the Oak Creek
expansion are within 5% of the targeted cost, and the additional costs are deemed prudent by the PSCW, the final lease payments for the Oak Creek expansion recovered from Wisconsin Electric would be adjusted to reflect the actual construction costs.
Costs above the 5% cap would not be included in lease payments or recovered from customers absent a finding by the PSCW of extraordinary circumstances, such as force majeure conditions.

As required by the Energy Policy Act, FERC developed new rules to implement certain provisions of the Energy Policy Act. Pursuant to these new rules, Wisconsin Electric requested FERC authorization in
November 2006 to lease from We Power the three PTF units that are currently being constructed by We Power. We received authorization from FERC for these leases in December 2006.

We face significant costs of compliance with existing and future environmental regulations.

We are subject to
extensive environmental regulations affecting our past, present and future operations relating to, among other things, air emissions such as carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, small particulates and mercury, water discharges, management
of hazardous and solid waste (including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)) and removal of degraded lead paint. We incur significant expenditures in complying with these environmental requirements, including expenditures for the installation of
pollution control equipment, environmental monitoring, emissions fees and permits at all of our facilities.


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2006 Form 10-K

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS - (Cont’d)

Existing environmental regulations may be revised or new laws or regulations may be adopted which could result in
significant additional expenditures, operating restrictions on our facilities and increased compliance costs. The operation of emission control equipment to meet emission limits and further regulations on our intake and discharge of water could
increase our operating costs and could reduce the generating capacity of our power plants. In the event we are not able to recover all of our environmental expenditures from our customers in the future, our results of operations could be adversely
affected.

Our electric and gas utility businesses are also subject to significant liabilities related to the investigation and remediation of
environmental contamination at our current and former facilities, as well as at third-party owned sites. Due to the potential for imposition of stricter standards and greater regulation in the future and the possibility that other potentially
responsible parties may not be financially able to contribute to cleanup costs, conditions may change or additional contamination may be discovered, our remediation costs could increase, and the timing of our capital and/or operating expenditures in
the future may accelerate.

In addition, we may also be responsible for liabilities associated with the environmental condition of the facilities that we
have previously owned and operated, regardless of whether the liabilities arose before, during or after the time we owned or operated the facilities. If we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations or cause harm to the environment or
persons, even if caused by factors beyond our control, that failure or harm may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against us. The incurrence of a material environmental liability could have a significant adverse
effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Ownership and operation of nuclear generating units involve inherent risks that may
result in substantial costs and liabilities.

We own two 518 MW nuclear electric generating units at Point Beach. The units are operated by NMC, a
joint venture of Wisconsin Energy and affiliates of other unaffiliated utilities. During 2006, our nuclear generating units provided approximately 25.3% of our net electric energy supply. In December 2006, we announced that we had reached a
definitive agreement to sell our nuclear plant to an affiliate of FPL. This transaction is subject to regulatory review and approval and we anticipate it will close during the third quarter of 2007.

Until the transaction is approved,
Wisconsin Electric continues to own Point Beach and retains exclusive rights to the energy generated by the plant, as well as financial responsibility for the safe operation, maintenance and decommissioning of Point Beach.

Our nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, health and financial risks, including: handling of nuclear materials, on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel and the
current lack of a long-term solution for disposal of materials; mechanical or structural problems; lapses in maintenance procedures; human errors in the operation of the reactors or safety systems; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance
coverage commercially available; the continued ability of NMC to effectively manage and operate our nuclear facilities; and uncertainties regarding our ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning the units. While we have no reason to
anticipate a serious nuclear incident at our units, if an incident were to occur, it could result in substantial costs to us that may significantly exceed the amount of our insurance coverage and reserves.

The NRC has broad authority to impose licensing and safety related requirements for the operation of nuclear generating facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the
NRC has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, until compliance is achieved. Further, in the event of a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world, the NRC could limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of
any domestic nuclear unit.

As a result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the NRC and the industry have been strengthening security at
nuclear power plants. Increased security measures and other safety requirements could require us to make substantial capital expenditures at our nuclear generating units.

Acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Our
electric generation and gas transportation facilities, including our nuclear facilities and the facilities of third parties on which we rely, could be targets of terrorist activities. A terrorist attack on our facilities could result in a full or
partial disruption of our ability to generate, transmit, transport or distribute electricity or natural gas or cause environmental repercussions. Any operational disruption or environmental repercussions could result in a significant decrease in our
revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.


Wisconsin Energy Corporation

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS - (Cont’d)

Energy sales are impacted by seasonal factors and varying weather conditions from year-to-year.

Our electric and gas utility businesses are generally seasonal businesses. Demand for electricity is greater in the summer and winter months
associated with cooling and heating. In addition, demand for natural gas peaks in the winter heating season. As a result, our overall results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. In addition, we have historically had lower
revenues and net income when weather conditions are milder. Our rates in Wisconsin are set by the PSCW based on estimated temperatures which approximate 20-year averages. Mild temperatures during the summer cooling season and during the winter
heating season will negatively impact the results of operations and cash flows of our electric utility business. In addition, mild temperatures during the winter heating season negatively impact the results of operations and cash flows of our gas
utility business.

Higher natural gas costs may negatively impact our electric and gas utility operations.

Significant increases in the cost of natural gas affect our electric and gas utility operations. Natural gas costs have increased significantly because the supply of
natural gas in recent years has not kept pace with the demand for natural gas, which has grown throughout the United States as a result of increased reliance on natural gas-fired electric generating facilities. We expect that demand for natural gas
will remain high into the foreseeable future and that significant price relief will not occur until additional natural gas reserves are developed.

Wisconsin Electric’s electric operations burn natural gas in several of its peaking power plants and in the leased PWGS 1 and as a supplemental fuel at several coal-fired plants, and in many instances the cost of purchased power is
tied to the cost of natural gas. In addition, higher natural gas costs also can have the effect of increasing demand for other sources of fuel thereby increasing the costs of these fuels as well.

In addition, higher natural gas costs increase our working capital requirements. As a result of GCRMs, our gas distribution business receives dollar for dollar pass
through of the cost of natural gas. However, increased natural gas costs increase the risk that customers will switch to alternative sources of fuel or reduce their usage, which could reduce future gas margins. In addition, higher natural gas costs
combined with slower economic conditions also exposes us to greater risks of accounts receivable write-offs as more customers are unable to pay their bills.

We may not be able to obtain an adequate supply of coal, which could limit our ability to operate our facilities.

We are dependent
on coal for much of our electric generating capacity. While we have coal supply and transportation contracts in place, there can be no assurance that the counterparties to these agreements will fulfill their obligations to supply coal to us. The
suppliers under these agreements may experience financial or operational problems that inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations to us. In addition, suppliers under these agreements may not be required to supply coal to us under certain
circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster. If we are unable to obtain our coal requirements under our coal supply and transportation contracts, we may be required to purchase coal at higher prices, or we may be forced to obtain
additional MWh purchases through other potentially higher cost generating resources in the MISO Midwest Market. Higher costs to obtain coal increase our working capital requirements.

Our financial performance may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully operate our facilities.

Our financial performance depends on the successful operation of our electric generating and gas distribution facilities. Operation of these facilities involves many risks, including: operator error and breakdown or failure of equipment
processes; fuel supply interruptions; labor disputes; operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements; or catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods or other similar occurrences.
Unplanned generation outages can result in additional maintenance expenses as well as incremental replacement power costs.

We are exposed to risks
related to general economic conditions in our service territories.

Our electric and gas utility businesses are impacted by the economic cycles of
the customers we serve. In the event regional economic conditions decline, we may experience reduced demand for electricity or natural gas that could result in decreased earnings and cash flow. In addition, regional economic conditions also impact
our collections of accounts receivable.


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2006 Form 10-K

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS - (Cont’d)

Our business is dependent on our ability to successfully access capital markets.

We rely on access to short-term and long-term capital markets to support our capital expenditures and other capital requirements, including expenditures for our utility
infrastructure and to comply with future regulatory requirements. We have historically secured funds from a variety of sources, including the issuance of short-term and long-term debt securities, preferred stock and common stock. Successful
implementation of our long-term business strategies is dependent upon our ability to access the capital markets under competitive terms and rates. If our access to the capital markets were limited due to a ratings downgrade, prevailing market
conditions or other factors, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

We are a holding company and
are subject to restrictions on our ability to pay dividends.

Wisconsin Energy is a holding company and has no significant operations of its own.
Accordingly, our ability to meet our financial obligations and pay dividends on our common stock is dependent upon the ability of our subsidiaries to pay amounts to us, whether through dividends or other payments. The ability of our subsidiaries to
pay amounts to us will depend on the earnings, cash flows, capital requirements and general financial condition of our subsidiaries and on regulatory limitations. Our subsidiaries have dividend payment restrictions based on the terms of their
outstanding preferred stock and regulatory limitations applicable to them. In addition, each of Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas bank back-up credit facilities have specified total funded debt to capitalization ratios that must
be maintained.

Provisions of the Wisconsin Utility Holding Company Act limit our ability to invest in non-utility businesses and could deter
takeover attempts by a potential purchaser of our common stock that would be willing to pay a premium for our common stock.

Under the Wisconsin
Utility Holding Company Act, we remain subject to certain restrictions that have the potential of limiting our diversification into non-utility businesses. Under the public utility holding company law, the sum of certain assets of all non-utility
affiliates in a holding company system may not exceed 25% of the assets of all public utility affiliates.

In addition, this act precludes the acquisition
of 10% or more of the voting shares of a holding company of a Wisconsin public utility unless the PSCW has first determined that the acquisition is in the best interests of utility customers, investors and the public. This provision and other
requirements of this act may delay or reduce the likelihood of a sale or change of control of Wisconsin Energy. As a result, you may be deprived of opportunities to sell some or all of your shares of our common stock at prices that represent a
premium over market prices.

Governmental agencies could modify our permits, authorizations or licenses.

Wisconsin Electric, Wisconsin Gas and Edison Sault are required to comply with the terms of various permits, authorizations and licenses. These permits, authorizations
and licenses may be revoked or modified by the agencies that granted them if facts develop that differ significantly from the facts assumed when they were issued. In addition, discharge permits and other approvals and licenses are often granted for
a term that is less than the expected life of the associated facility. Licenses and permits may require periodic renewal, which may result in additional requirements being imposed by the granting agency.

Also, if we are unable to obtain, renew or comply with these governmental permits, authorizations or licenses, or if we are unable to recover any increased costs of
complying with additional license requirements or any other associated costs in our rates in a timely manner, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

Restructuring in the regulated energy industry could have a negative impact on our business.

The regulated energy industry continues to experience significant structural changes. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant
adverse financial impact on us. It is uncertain when retail access might be implemented in Wisconsin; however, Michigan has adopted retail choice which potentially affects our Michigan operations. Under retail access legislation, customers are
permitted to choose their own electric generation supplier. All Michigan electric customers were able to choose their electric generation supplier beginning in January 2002. Although competition and customer switching to


Wisconsin Energy Corporation

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS - (Cont’d)

alternative suppliers in our service territories in Michigan has been limited, the additional competitive pressures resulting from retail access could lead
to a loss of customers and our incurring stranded costs.

FERC continues to support the existing RTOs that affect the structure of the wholesale market
within those RTOs. In connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO implemented the MISO Midwest Market on April 1, 2005. The MISO Midwest Market rules require that all market participants submit day-ahead and/or real-time bids and
offers for energy at locations across the MISO region. MISO then calculates the most efficient solution for all of the bids and offers made into the market that day and establishes a LMP that reflects the market price for energy. As a participant in
the MISO Midwest Market, we are required to follow MISO’s instructions when dispatching generating units to support MISO’s responsibility for maintaining stability of the transmission system.

Additionally, the MISO Midwest Market subjects us to additional costs primarily associated with constraints in the transmission system. MISO implemented the LMP system,
a market-based platform for valuing transmission congestion. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion charges through the use of FTRs. FTRs are allocated to market participants by MISO for a twelve month period. There
can be no assurance that we will be granted an adequate level of FTRs in the future to avoid material unhedged congestion charges. As allowed by the PSCW, unhedged congestion charges are deferred and we expect to recover these costs in future rates,
subject to review and approval of the PSCW.

EPA Information Requests:

Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas responded to an EPA request for information pursuant to CERCLA Section 104(e) for the Solvay Coke and Gas Site located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
All potentially responsive records and corporate legal files have been reviewed and responsive information was provided in October 2004. A predecessor company of Wisconsin Electric owned a parcel of property that is within the property boundaries of
the site. A predecessor company of Wisconsin Gas had a customer and corporate relationship with the entity that owned and operated the site, Milwaukee Solvay Coke Company. In July 2005, Wisconsin Gas received a general notice letter from the
EPA identifying Wisconsin Gas as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA. In April 2006, we received a special notice letter from the EPA identifying both Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Electric as potentially responsible parties and
commencing a negotiation period with the EPA and other parties regarding the conduct of a RI/FS and reimbursement of the EPA’s costs. Wisconsin Electric and

See Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources — Nuclear Operations in Item 7 for information concerning the DOE’s breach
of contract with Wisconsin Electric that required the DOE to begin permanently removing used nuclear fuel from Point Beach by January 31, 1998.

Stray Voltage:

In recent years, several actions by dairy farmers have been commenced or claims made against Wisconsin Electric for loss of milk production and other damages to livestock allegedly caused by stray
voltage resulting from the operation of its electrical system.

On February 26, 2004, a Wisconsin jury awarded $850,000 to a dairy farmer who alleged
that Wisconsin Electric’s distribution system caused damages to his livestock. Wisconsin Electric appealed this decision. In April 2006, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals affirmed the jury’s verdict against Wisconsin Electric. Wisconsin
Electric paid $1.3 million with interest and costs to the plaintiffs in this suit.

In May 2005, a stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin
Electric. We do not believe the lawsuit has merit and we will vigorously defend the case. The trial for this matter is scheduled to begin in April 2007. This claim against Wisconsin Electric is not expected to have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition or results of operations.

Even though any claims which may be made against Wisconsin Electric with respect to stray voltage and
ground currents are not expected to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, we continue to evaluate various options and strategies to mitigate this risk. For additional information, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and
Capital Resources — Legal Matters in Item 7.

Electromagnetic Fields:

Claims have been made or threatened against
electric utilities across the country for bodily injury, disease or other damages allegedly caused or aggravated by exposure to electromagnetic fields associated with electric transmission and distribution lines. Results of scientific studies
conducted to date have not established the existence of a causal connection between electromagnetic fields and any adverse health affects. Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault believe that their facilities are constructed and operated in accordance
with applicable legal requirements and standards. Currently, there are no cases pending or threatened against Wisconsin Electric or Edison Sault with respect to damage caused by electromagnetic fields.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

CORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS

INTRODUCTION

Wisconsin Energy Corporation is a diversified holding company with subsidiaries primarily in a utility energy segment and a non-utility energy segment. Unless qualified
by their context, when used in this document the terms Wisconsin Energy, the Company, our, us or we refer to the holding company and all of our subsidiaries.

Our utility energy segment, consisting of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas, both doing business under the trade name of “We Energies”, and Edison Sault, is engaged primarily in the business of generating electricity and
distributing electricity and natural gas in Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Our non-utility energy segment primarily consists of We Power. We Power is principally engaged in the engineering, construction and development of electric
power generating facilities for long-term lease to Wisconsin Electric.

CORPORATE STRATEGY

Business Opportunities

We seek to increase stockholder value
by leveraging on our core competencies. Our key corporate strategy, announced in September 2000, is PTF. This strategy is designed to address Wisconsin’s growing electric supply needs by increasing the electric generating capacity in the state
while maintaining a fuel-diverse, reasonably priced electric supply. It is also designed to improve the delivery of energy within our distribution systems to meet increasing customer demands and to support our commitment to improved environmental
performance. Our PTF strategy, which is discussed further below, is having and is expected to continue to have a significant impact on our utility and non-utility energy segments. In July 2005, the first of four new electric generating units
under our PTF strategy was placed into service. Construction on the remaining three units is underway. Since 2000, we have been selling our non-core assets to direct more attention to the utility business and to finance PTF while reducing our debt
leverage

.

Proposed Sale of Point Beach

: In February 2006, we announced that we were undertaking a formal review regarding our
options for the ownership and operation of Point Beach. These options included (1) continued operation by NMC, (2) having a third party other than NMC operate the plant, (3) a return to in-house operations by Wisconsin Electric,
(4) sale of the plant and (5) a partial sale of the plant with us retaining a minority interest in the Plant. Under this fifth option, the new majority owner would operate the plant. After a thorough review of the various options, we
concluded that a full sale of the plant was in our best interest and in the best interest of our customers.

In December 2006, we announced that Wisconsin
Electric had signed a definitive agreement with an affiliate of FPL to sell Point Beach for approximately $998 million, subject to closing price adjustments. Under the terms of the sale, the buyer would assume the obligation to decommission the
plant, and we would transfer assets in a qualified trust for decommissioning. We would retain assets in a non-qualified decommissioning trust. Wisconsin Electric also entered into a long-term power purchase agreement to purchase all of the existing
capacity and energy of the plant. This long-term power purchase agreement will become effective upon the closing of the sale. If and when the sale is completed (or earlier if an interim operating agreement with FPL is activated by us), NMC would
transfer Point Beach’s operating licenses to FPL and our relationship with NMC would be terminated. The sale of the plant and the long-term power purchase agreement are subject to review and approval by various regulatory agencies including the
NRC, PSCW, MPSC and FERC. We anticipate closing the sale during the third quarter of 2007.

We, along with FPL, have made a request to the IRS for a
Private Letter Ruling (PLR) related to the transfer of the qualified decommissioning trust assets. We are requesting permission to withdraw excess funds from the qualified trust without receiving unfavorable tax treatment. If we receive a favorable
PLR, we would use the excess funds for the direct benefit of our customers. If we do not receive a favorable PLR, then the purchase price would be adjusted

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Cont’d)

upward by approximately $50 million based on information as of December 31, 2006. We are unable to predict how or even if the IRS may rule on our
request for a PLR.

If the sale is approved, we expect to receive after-tax cash proceeds exceeding $1.0 billion from the sale and the liquidation of the
decommissioning trust assets. The net sales proceeds are expected to exceed our cost in the nuclear plant, and, absent regulatory treatment, we would expect to record a gain on the sale. However, we have made a filing with PSCW to defer any gain
(net of transaction related costs) as a regulatory liability that would be applied to the benefit of our customers in future rate proceedings. As such, we do not expect the sale of the plant, if approved, to have a material impact on our 2007
earnings.

Utility Energy Segment:

Our utility energy segment strives to provide reasonably priced energy delivered at high levels of
customer service and reliability. We expect our prices to be established by our regulatory bodies under traditional rate based, cost of service methodologies. We continue to gain efficiencies and improve the effectiveness of our service deliveries
through the combined support operations of our electric and gas businesses. We work to obtain a reliable, reasonably-priced supply of electricity through plants that we operate and various long-term supply contracts.

Non-Utility Energy Segment:

Our primary focus in this segment is to improve the supply of electric generation in Wisconsin. We Power was formed
to design, construct, own and lease new generation assets under the PTF strategy.

Power the Future Strategy:

In February 2001, we filed
a petition with the PSCW that would allow us to begin implementing our 10-year PTF strategy to improve the supply and reliability of electricity in Wisconsin. PTF is intended to meet a growing demand for electricity and ensure a diverse fuel mix
while keeping electricity prices reasonable. Under PTF

,

we plan to add new coal-fired and natural gas-fired generating capacity to the state’s power portfolio which would allow us to maintain approximately the same fuel mix as exists
today. PWGS 1 and 2 and OC 1 and 2 have a total output of 2,320 MW, of which we expect to own 2,120 MW. As part of our PTF strategy, we plan to (1) invest approximately $2.6 billion in 2,120 MW of new natural
gas-fired and coal-fired generating capacity at existing sites; (2) upgrade our existing electric generating facilities; and (3) invest in upgrades of our existing energy distribution system.

Subsequent to our February 2001 filing, the state legislature amended several laws, making changes which were critical to the implementation of PTF. In
October 2001, the PSCW issued a declaratory ruling finding, among other things, that it was prudent to proceed with PTF and for us to incur the associated pre-certification expenses. However, individual expenses are subject to review by the
PSCW in order to be recovered.

In November 2001, we created We Power to design, construct, own and lease the new generating capacity. Wisconsin
Electric will lease each new generating facility from We Power as well as operate and maintain the new plants under 25- to 30-year lease agreements approved by the PSCW. Based upon the structure of the leases, we expect to recover the
investments in We Power’s new facilities over the initial lease term. At the end of the leases, Wisconsin Electric will have the right to acquire the plants outright at market value or to renew the leases. Wisconsin Electric expects that
payments under the plant leases will be recoverable in rates under the provisions of the Wisconsin Leased Generation Law.

Under our PTF strategy, we
expect to meet a significant portion of our future generation needs through We Power’s construction of the PWGS units and the Oak Creek expansion.

As of December 31, 2006, we:

•

Received approval from the PSCW to build two 545 MW natural gas-fired intermediate load units in Port Washington, Wisconsin (PWGS 1 and PWGS 2).
PWGS 1 was placed into service in July 2005 and is fully operational. PWGS 1 was completed within the PSCW approved cost parameters.

•

Completed site preparation for PWGS 2 in early 2006, and procured all of the major components for PWGS 2. Construction is underway and PWGS 2 is
expected to be operational in 2008.


Wisconsin Energy Corporation

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Cont’d)

•

Received approval from the PSCW to build two 615 MW coal-fired base load units (OC 1 and OC 2) adjacent to the site of our existing Oak Creek Power
Plant in Oak Creek, Wisconsin (the Oak Creek expansion), with OC 1 expected to be in service in 2009 and OC 2 in 2010. The CPCN was granted contingent upon our obtaining the necessary environmental permits. We have received all permits
necessary to commence construction. In June 2005, construction commenced at the site.

•

Completed the planned sale of approximately a 17% ownership interest in the Oak Creek expansion to two co-owners in November 2005.

•

Received approval from the PSCW for various leases between We Power and Wisconsin Electric.

We expect to finance the majority of our PTF strategy with internally generated cash and debt financings. We expect our debt to total capital ratio, as measured by the
debt rating agencies will not exceed 61.5% through our PTF construction period. We currently do not plan to issue any new common equity as part of our PTF program.

Our primary risks under PTF are construction risks associated with the schedule and costs for both our Oak Creek expansion and PWGS 2; continuing legal challenges to permits obtained and changes in applicable laws or regulations;
adverse interpretation or enforcement of permit conditions, laws and regulations by the permitting agencies; the inability to obtain necessary operating permits in a timely manner; obtaining the investment capital from outside sources necessary to
implement the strategy; governmental actions; and events in the global economy.

For further information concerning PTF capital requirements, see Liquidity
and Capital Resources below. You can find additional information regarding risks associated with the PTF strategy, as well as the regulatory process and specific regulatory approvals, in Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources
below.

Divestiture of Assets

Our PTF strategy led to
a decision to divest non-core businesses. These non-core businesses primarily included non-utility generation assets located outside of Wisconsin and a substantial amount of Wispark’s real estate portfolio, as well as our manufacturing
business. In addition, in 2001 we contributed our transmission assets to ATC and received cash proceeds of $119.8 million and an economic interest in ATC. Since 2000, we have received total proceeds of approximately $2.2 billion from the
divestiture of assets as follows:

UTILITY ENERGY SEGMENT CONTRIBUTION TO OPERATING INCOME

2006 vs. 2005:

Our utility energy segment contributed $532.8 million of operating income during 2006 compared with $542.4 million of operating income during 2005. During 2006, we
experienced mild weather, which reduced electric and gas sales. In addition, operation and maintenance expenses increased due to the timing of scheduled outages and maintenance projects at our coal units. However, these items were largely offset by
improved recovery of fuel costs, only one scheduled refueling outage at Point Beach and increased gas margins.

2005 vs. 2004:

Our utility energy segment contributed $542.4 million of operating income
during 2005 compared with $528.6 million of operating income during 2004. This increase primarily reflects favorable weather during the summer of 2005 and increased gas margins. Also, during 2004 we recorded severance costs under a voluntary
severance program. The year to year increase in operating income was partially offset by an increase in our net under-recovered fuel position and higher operation and maintenance expenses during 2005. We had two scheduled refueling outages at
our nuclear plant in 2005 in comparison to one scheduled refueling outage in 2004.

The following table summarizes our utility energy segment’s
operating income during 2006, 2005 and 2004.

(a)

As measured at Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Normal degree days are based upon a twenty-year moving average.

Electric Utility Revenues and Sales

2006 vs.
2005:

Our electric utility operating revenues increased by $179.7 million, or 7.6%, when compared to 2005. We estimate that revenues in 2006 were $213.3 million higher than 2005 due to pricing increases that we received in
January 2006 and during 2005. The most significant pricing increases authorized by the PSCW related to the recovery of higher fuel costs, costs associated with the new plants under our PTF strategy and increased transmission costs.

Our electric utility operating revenues are expected to increase in 2007 primarily due to the impact of a full year of the January 2006 Wisconsin retail pricing
increase and the expected implementation of increased wholesale rates, as well as the impacts of our fuel adjustment clause that are tied to our fuel and purchase power costs. During 2006, we reserved approximately $38 million of revenues associated
with favorable recoveries of fuel and purchase power. For more information on the pricing increases and the fuel cost adjustment clause, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters in Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources.

Our electric sales volumes decreased by 1.8% in 2006 as compared to 2005 due to mild weather and lower commercial and industrial sales, offset by an
increase in sales for resale. Residential sales volumes decreased 2.8% due largely to weather. In 2006, heating degree days decreased approximately 8.8% compared to 2005, and cooling degree days decreased approximately 23.8%. We estimate that the
weather had an unfavorable impact on operating revenues of approximately $46.5 million when compared to the prior year. Total sales volumes to commercial/industrial customers decreased 2.7% between the comparative periods. Sales volumes to
commercial/industrial customers, excluding our largest customers, two iron ore mines, decreased 1.4%. Sales volumes in the Other Retail/Municipal class decreased approximately 18% compared to the prior year due, in part, to the expiration of a
wholesale contract on December 31, 2005. The increase in sales volumes to other utilities is


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2006 Form 10-K

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Cont’d)

attributed to the availability of PWGS 1 for all of 2006, which provided additional generation capacity. PWGS 1 was not operational until the third quarter
of 2005. Under the Wisconsin fuel rules, sales to other utilities reduce fuel costs charged to customers.

2005 vs. 2004:

During 2005,
our total electric utility operating revenues increased by $250.7 million or 11.9% when compared with 2004 primarily due to favorable weather during the summer of 2005 and pricing increases.

During 2005, we estimate that pricing increases contributed an additional $145.8 million of revenues than in 2004. The most significant impact to rates was a
March 2005 interim order received by Wisconsin Electric from the PSCW authorizing an annualized increase in electric rates of approximately $114.9 million due to the increased costs of fuel and purchased power. In November 2005,
Wisconsin Electric received the final rate order, which authorized an additional $7.7 million of annual revenues. Additional orders impacting rates in 2005 were the May 2004 and May 2005 orders received by Wisconsin Electric from the PSCW
authorizing annualized increases in electric rates of approximately $59.0 million and $59.7 million, respectively, primarily to cover construction costs associated with our PTF strategy.

Total electric sales increased by 2.6% between 2005 and 2004. Residential sales volumes increased 6.3% due to the favorable summer weather in 2005. Total sales volumes
to commercial/industrial customers increased 1.7% between comparative periods. Sales volumes to commercial/industrial customers, excluding our largest customers, two iron ore mines, increased 2.3% due to the favorable weather during the summer of
2005. We estimate that weather increased our electric revenues by approximately $68.8 million during 2005 as compared to the prior year. As measured by cooling degree days, 2005 was 114.7% warmer than in 2004.

Sales volumes in the Resale-Utilities class decreased 52.6% primarily due to the reduced availability of base-load capacity for sale at competitive prices as a result of
limited fuel supplies and outages. Sales volumes to municipal utilities, the Other Retail/Municipal customer class, increased 12.8% between the periods due to higher off-peak demand from lower margin municipal wholesale power customers.

Electric Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses

2006 vs.
2005:

Our fuel and purchased power expenses increased by $24.7 million, or approximately 3.2%, when compared to 2005. Our average cost of fuel and purchased power increased from $23.80 per MWh in 2005 to $25.01 per MWh in
2006. The largest factor for the higher cost per MWh was a 24.2% increase in the per MWh cost of coal-fired generation, which includes coal and related transportation costs, between the comparative periods. This increase was partially offset by
increased generation from Point Beach and a decrease in the average costs of purchased power and fuel for our natural gas-fired units.

Our electric fuel
and purchased power expenses in 2007 are expected to be impacted by the duration of the scheduled nuclear refueling outage in the first quarter of 2007; the timing and completion of the proposed sale of Point Beach; the price of purchased power; the
increased cost of coal and related transportation; and changes in electric sales.

2005 vs. 2004:

Gross fuel and purchased power costs
for our electric utilities increased by a total of $260.8 million during 2005 when compared with 2004. During 2005, we deferred $72.8 million of fuel and purchased power costs which resulted in a net increase of fuel and purchased power
expense of $188.0 million or 32.1% during 2005 when compared to 2004. The increase in fuel and purchased power expense was driven by a 2.6% increase in MWh sales and an increase in our average cost of fuel and purchased power from
$18.48 per MWh in 2004 to $23.80 per MWh in 2005, or 28.8% between the comparative periods.

The increase in our average cost of fuel and
purchased power was due primarily to (1) the reduced availability of nuclear generation due to scheduled refueling outages, (2) higher natural gas prices that increased the cost of power supplied by natural gas, (3) the impact of the
implementation of the MISO Midwest Market in April 2005 and (4) limitations on coal supplies due to transportation shortfalls.

During 2005, we had
two scheduled refueling outages at our nuclear plant and in 2004 we had one scheduled refueling outage. As a result, we had approximately 1,145,000 fewer MWh of nuclear generation in 2005. Our average fuel cost for nuclear generation is
approximately $5 per MWh, while the average energy cost for purchased


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2006 Form 10-K

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Cont’d)

power was approximately $55 per MWh. We estimate that the reduction in nuclear generation resulted in approximately $57 million of increased fuel
and purchased power costs in 2005 as compared to 2004. During the 2005 outages we replaced both reactor vessel heads resulting in longer outages. This work, along with other planned maintenance, lasted longer than originally expected due to delays.
For more information regarding the scheduled refueling outages, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources — Nuclear Operations.

In 2005, we experienced significant increases in the cost of natural gas used in our own generating assets and in the price of purchased energy which is highly influenced by the price of natural gas. This increase was most significant in
the last six months of 2005 due to market related factors including the hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. The average combined cost per MWh of purchased energy and natural gas fired units in 2005 was 47.7% higher than in 2004, increasing total cost
by approximately $77.2 million.

In April 2005, we began participating in the MISO Midwest Market which fundamentally changed the way we dispatch our
generating units and obtain purchased energy. As part of this new market, we are subject to new types of charges which, among other things, recognize the cost of transmission congestion, MWh losses and other costs associated with operating the
generating units in an uneconomic fashion to support the MISO Midwest Market service territory. The State of Wisconsin has a constrained transmission system and we believe these constraints result in higher costs for us than in other parts of the
MISO Midwest Market service territory. The incremental costs associated with the MISO Midwest Market charges identified above were approximately $28 million in 2005. For more information regarding MISO and the MISO Midwest Market, see Factors
Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources — Industry Restructuring and Competition — Electric Transmission and Energy Markets.

Our 2005
operations were also adversely impacted by limitations on deliveries of coal supply due to the failure of our primary rail delivery supplier to deliver contracted quantities of coal to our units. The largest limitation was related to critical rail
track maintenance in the Powder River basin. This, in turn, resulted in reduced coal deliveries of the coal which primarily serves our Oak Creek and Pleasant Prairie generating units from June through December 2005. In response to the reduced
deliveries, we reduced generating output of these units during off-peak periods when replacement power prices were lower, purchased more expensive replacement power and took measures to purchase and transport higher cost coal in place of contracted
supplies when it made economic sense to do so. We estimate that this increased our costs by approximately $52 million in 2005. For additional information on the decreased coal deliveries, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital
Resources — Market Risks and Other Significant Risks — Commodity Prices.

Under the State of Wisconsin fuel rules, we are allowed to request
recovery in fuel revenues if our projected fuel and purchased power costs exceed bands established by the PSCW. In March 2005, we received a rate order that allowed us to increase our annual revenues by $114.9 million (final order received in
November 2005 for an annual increase of $122.6 million) due to increased fuel and purchased power costs. As provided under the Wisconsin rules, we are also allowed to request deferral for the costs associated with adverse events which
materially impact fuel and purchased power costs which were not anticipated, or for which costs could not be reasonably estimated at the time of the fuel recovery request for consideration in future rate proceedings. During 2005, we deferred
approximately $72.8 million of fuel and purchased power costs due to the extended outage at Point Beach Unit 2, the coal delivery problems and increased costs associated with the MISO Midwest Market. During 2005, we estimate that we
under-recovered fuel and purchased power costs by $108.4 million before these deferred items. Adjusted for the allowed deferrals, our net under-recovered fuel and purchased power costs were approximately $35.6 million.

Gas Utility Revenues, Gross Margin and Therm Deliveries

The following table compares our total gas utility operating revenues and gross margin (total gas utility operating revenues less cost of gas sold) during 2006, 2005
and 2004.

We believe gross margin is a better performance indicator than revenues because changes in the cost of gas sold
flow through to revenue under GCRMs. The following table compares our gas utility gross margin and therm deliveries by customer class during 2006, 2005 and 2004.

(a)

As measured at Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Normal degree days are based upon a twenty-year moving average.

2006 vs. 2005:

Gas utility gross margin increased by $31.4 million or 8.5% between the comparative periods. The increase in gross margin is due,
in part, to pricing increases that were granted by the PSCW and implemented in January 2006. The gas pricing increases were primarily granted to recover higher operating costs, including bad debt expenses. We estimate that our gross margin
increased between the comparative periods by approximately $53.4 million due to these pricing increases.

The pricing increases were partially offset
by a decline in gas sales volumes that was driven by mild winter weather and by lower customer usage. Temperatures (as measured by heating degree days) were approximately 8.8% warmer in 2006 as compared to 2005. The mild winter weather reduced
customer demand for heating. We estimate that the weather decreased our gross margin by approximately $21.0 million between the comparative periods. We continue to see a reduction in normalized use of gas per customer which we believe is caused
by high natural gas prices and the continued improvements in energy efficient appliances. During 2006, we estimate this reduction in normalized use decreased our gross margin by approximately $4.9 million. The decrease in volume of transport
gas sales was due in part to fuel switching during months where gas commodity prices were high during 2006. Residential therm deliveries decreased 8.0% as compared to 2005, due to warmer weather and a decrease in use per customer that was driven in
part by high commodity prices.

The gas utility gross margins are expected to increase in 2007 primarily due to the impact of a full year of the
January 2006 pricing increases. In addition, 2007 gross margins will be impacted by weather and customer demand. For more information on the pricing increases, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters in Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and
Capital Resources below.

2005 vs. 2004:

Gas utility gross margin increased by $8.7 million or 2.4% between the comparative
periods. This increase reflects $6.5 million of price increases which reflects the full year’s impact of a $25.9 million annual rate increase, which became effective in March 2004. Total therm deliveries were 4.9% higher during
2005 primarily due to increased transport gas deliveries of 124.2 million therms. Transport volumes increased between the comparative periods due to a higher amount of electric generation from natural gas within our service territory. A portion
of these sales are eliminated in consolidation. Our margins on these transport gas volumes are significantly lower than our margins for retail gas sales. The price increases and increased transport volumes were offset, in part, by a decrease in
residential therm deliveries. Residential therm deliveries decreased 2.3% as compared to 2004, due to slightly warmer weather and a decrease in use per customer that was driven in part by higher commodity prices. As measured by heating degree days,
2005 was less than 1% warmer than 2004.

Other Operation and Maintenance Expenses

2006 vs. 2005:

Our other operation and maintenance expenses increased by $200.7 million, or 19.9%, when compared to 2005. As discussed above, we received pricing increases in January 2006 to
cover increased costs. The increases in other operation and maintenance expenses that relate to the pricing increases include higher PTF lease costs of $85.4 million, increased transmission expenses of $62.7 million, increased renewable
energy and energy efficiency program expenses of $10.6 million and increased bad debt expenses of $13.7 million. Other operation and maintenance expenses increased approximately $34.7 million due to PWGS 1 operating costs and the timing of
scheduled outages and maintenance projects at our coal plants. In 2005, we received approximately $10.0 million as a settlement to resolve a vender dispute, reducing other operation and maintenance expense in 2005. These increases were partially
offset by decreased nuclear operating and maintenance expense. In 2006, we had only one scheduled nuclear refueling outage as compared to two scheduled refueling outages in 2005, which resulted in approximately a $10.9 million decrease in
nuclear operation and maintenance expenses between the comparative periods. In addition, the elimination of seams elimination transmission charges, effective March 31, 2006, resulted in reduced costs of approximately $9.5 million for
2006. For further information on seams elimination charges, see Electric Transmission in Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources below.

Our utility operation and maintenance expenses are expected to increase in 2007 as a result of increased amortizations related to the impact of the 2006 pricing increases. In addition, operation and maintenance expenses are influenced by
wage inflation, employee benefit costs and the length of plant outages.

2005 vs. 2004:

Other operation and maintenance expenses
increased by $47.4 million or 4.9% during 2005 compared with 2004. The most significant changes in our operation and maintenance expense related to increased lease costs and increased nuclear outage costs. Partially offsetting these increases
was a charge in 2004 for severance costs related to the voluntary severance program and lower employee costs in 2005 due to fewer employees.

The largest
operations and maintenance increase for the utility energy segment related to $50.0 million of costs that we recognized under lease agreements between We Power and Wisconsin Electric in connection with our PTF strategy.

In addition to the increased lease costs, our nuclear operating and maintenance expense increased approximately $11.0 million due to two scheduled refueling outages
in 2005 where we also replaced the reactor vessel heads. In 2004, we had one scheduled refueling outage. This increase was partially offset by a $10.0 million settlement we received to resolve a vendor dispute.

Additionally, in 2004 we recognized $28.2 million of severance related costs due to the voluntary severance program that was implemented in the second half of 2004.
In 2005, we had approximately 210 fewer employees, which reduced operation and maintenance costs by $12.9 million.

Benefit costs increased $7.0 million between the comparative periods due to increased pension and medical costs.
In October 2005, we announced that we were offering to our retirees a Medicare Advantage program as an option within our existing post-retirement medical and drug plans.

Depreciation, Decommissioning and Amortization Expense

2006 vs. 2005:

Depreciation,
decommissioning and amortization expenses decreased by $10.1 million or 3.1% when compared to 2005. In January 2006, we implemented new depreciation rates approved by the PSCW which reduced annual depreciation expenses. We estimate that
the new rates reduced annual depreciation expense by approximately $17 million, which was offset, in part, by net plant additions in 2006. We expect Depreciation, decommissioning and amortization expenses in 2007 to increase as a result of an
overall increase in utility plant assets in service.

2005 vs. 2004:

Depreciation, decommissioning and amortization expense increased by
$8.6 million in 2005 as compared to 2004. This increase was primarily due to increased depreciable plant balances.

NON-UTILITY ENERGY SEGMENT
CONTRIBUTION TO OPERATING INCOME

The most significant subsidiary included in this segment is We Power, which constructs and owns power plants
associated with our PTF strategy and leases them to Wisconsin Electric. This segment reflects revenues billed under the PWGS 1 lease and the depreciation expense related to PWGS 1.

The following table compares our non-utility energy segment’s operating income during 2006, 2005 and 2004.

Note: The PTF lease revenues and lease costs recorded by the non-utility and utility energy
segments are eliminated in consolidation.

2006 vs. 2005:

Our non-utility energy segment contributed $43.1 million of operating income
in 2006 compared to operating income of $19.5 million in 2005. This increase in operating income primarily reflects a full year of operating income from PWGS 1 in 2006, which was placed in service in July 2005. There were no earnings
associated with this unit in the first six months of 2005.

Our non-utility energy segment is expected to generate operating income in 2007 that is
comparable to 2006 as both years will include 12 months of operations of PWGS 1.

2005 vs. 2004:

Our non-utility energy segment had
operating income of $19.5 million during 2005 compared with $4.6 million during 2004. The increase in operating income between the comparative periods is primarily due to PWGS 1 commencing service in

July 2005. This unit had operating income of $18.9 million during its six months of operation in 2005.

CORPORATE AND OTHER CONTRIBUTION TO OPERATING INCOME

2006 vs. 2005:

Corporate and other affiliates had an operating loss of $7.4 million in 2006 compared with operating income of
$1.0 million in 2005. The operating loss in 2006 is attributable to lower operating earnings at Wispark. In the foreseeable future, we expect to have slight operating losses as we have minimal business operations in this segment.

2005 vs. 2004:

Corporate and other affiliates had operating income of $1.0 million in 2005 compared with an operating loss of
$3.2 million in 2004. The improved results reflect increased earnings from Wispark.

CONSOLIDATED OTHER INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS, NET

The following table identifies the components of consolidated other income and deductions, net during 2006, 2005 and 2004.

2006 vs. 2005:

Other income and deductions, net increased by $24.4 million when compared
to 2005. The largest increases relate to increased AFUDC - Equity of $5.4 million, capitalized carrying costs of $4.6 million and the pre-tax gain on the sale of our investment in Guardian of $2.8 million. For further information on
the sale of Guardian, see Other Matters in Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources. In 2007, we expect a reduction in AFUDC - Equity as we placed in service the new scrubber at our Pleasant Prairie Power Plant in the fourth
quarter of 2006. The scrubber was installed as part of our EPA consent decree spending. For further information on the consent decree with the EPA, see Note S — Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

2005 vs. 2004:

Other income and deductions, net increased by $43.0 million in 2005 compared to 2004. In 2004, we recognized
$22.9 million of debt redemption costs associated with the early redemption of approximately $500 million of long-term debt. Similar debt redemption costs were not incurred in 2005. We recognized higher capitalized carrying costs of $7.7
million. The AFUDC - Equity increased $6.4 million in 2005 due to a higher average balance of AFUDC qualifying utility construction projects in 2005.

CONSOLIDATED INTEREST EXPENSE


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2006 Form 10-K

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Cont’d)

2006 vs. 2005:

Interest expense decreased by $0.7 million in 2006 when compared with 2005.
Our gross interest costs increased by $10.5 million primarily due to increased debt levels; however, our capitalized interest increased by $11.2 million due to higher CWIP balances. In addition, in 2005 we expensed approximately
$6.2 million related to the amortization of costs associated with prior debt redemptions. These costs were fully amortized as of July 2005; therefore, there was no similar expense in 2006.

We expect total interest expense in 2007 to increase due to increased debt levels to fund our planned construction activity; however, these increases are mitigated by
increases in our capitalized interest. To the extent that we incur debt associated with CWIP, we capitalize the interest costs in accordance with our accounting policies.

2005 vs. 2004:

Total interest expense decreased by $20.0 million in 2005 compared with 2004. The decrease in interest expense primarily reflects lower average debt levels in 2005 as compared to
2004. During 2004, we reduced debt levels by $654.2 million primarily with proceeds from the sale of our manufacturing segment. However, due to the increased construction activity our 2005 year end debt balances increased by
$291.9 million.

CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAXES

2006 vs. 2005:

Our effective tax rate applicable to continuing operations was 35.9% in 2006 compared to 33.0% in 2005. In 2006 and 2005, we reversed $5.8 million and $16.3 million, respectively, of valuation
allowance associated with state net operating loss carry forwards as we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would realize these benefits. Excluding these items, our 2006 and 2005 effective tax rate was 37.1% and 36.6%, respectively.
For further information see Note H — Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect our 2007 annual effective tax rate to range between 38% and 39%.

2005 vs. 2004:

Our effective tax rate applicable to continuing operations was 33.0% in 2005 compared to 37.7% in 2004. In 2005, we reversed $16.3 million of valuation allowances associated with
state net operating loss carry forwards as we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would realize these benefits. Excluding this item, our effective tax rate was 36.6%. For further information see Note H — Income Taxes in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

Our discontinued operations include our Minergy Neenah facility which was sold in September 2006, our Calumet facility which was sold in May 2005 and our manufacturing operations which were sold in
July 2004.

The following table identifies the primary components of net income from discontinued operations during 2006, 2005 and 2004.

Our 2006 earnings from discontinued operations reflect a loss on the sale of Minergy Neenah, the 2006 operations
of the plant and income of approximately $2.4 million related to the favorable resolution of tax liabilities.

Our 2005 earnings from discontinued
operations reflect a gain on the sale of the Calumet facility, the favorable resolution of liabilities at Calumet and a downward adjustment to the carrying value of Minergy Neenah.


Wisconsin Energy Corporation

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Cont’d)

Our 2004 earnings from discontinued operations reflect an after-tax gain of $152.3 million on the sale of our
manufacturing business. Our 2004 earnings from discontinued operations also reflect impairment charges of $79.3 million after-tax related to Calumet and $17.6 million after-tax related to Minergy Neenah.

See Note D — Asset Sales, Divestitures and Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the
transactions described above.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH FLOWS

The following table summarizes our cash flows during 2006, 2005 and 2004:

Operating Activities

Cash provided by operating activities for 2006 totaled $729.8 million, which is a $152.9 million improvement over 2005. There were two primary areas that drove this improvement in operating cash flows. During 2006, we estimate
that our collections of fuel costs improved by nearly $95 million as we had favorable collections in 2006 and unfavorable recoveries and fuel cost deferrals in 2005. The other primary area related to the working capital requirements related to gas
in storage. During 2006, we entered into certain contracts that reduced our need to inject gas in storage. In addition, lower gas commodity prices, offset by less withdrawals due to weather, have lowered working capital requirements between the
comparative periods. We estimate that these items reduced our cash needs for gas in storage by approximately $77.0 million. Partially offsetting these items was an increase of cash taxes of approximately $107 million due to higher taxable
earnings.

Cash provided by operating activities decreased to $576.9 million during 2005 compared with $599.0 million during 2004. This decline
reflected increased working capital needs for our utility business and an increase in deferred costs, offset in part by lower cash taxes and increased cash earnings. During 2005, we experienced significant increases in natural gas costs which
increased our working capital requirements for natural gas in storage. The increased natural gas costs also led to an increase in accounts receivable as the cost of gas is recovered dollar for dollar in our natural gas revenues. During 2005, we also
experienced increased deferred costs related to transmission costs and deferred fuel. During 2005, our cash taxes were lower than 2004 due to the ability to realize tax benefits on the sale of non-utility assets and accelerated tax depreciation on
PWGS 1.

Investing Activities

During 2006, net cash
outflows from investing activities were $939.3 million compared with net cash outflows of $697.1 million in 2005. This increase is primarily associated with the increased capital expenditures as construction progresses on our new
generating plants. During 2006, we had significant capital expenditures related to the Oak Creek expansion and PWGS 2.

During 2005, we had
$697.1 million of net cash outflows from investing activities. In 2004, we had net cash inflows from investing activities of $242.8 million. In 2005, capital expenditures increased related to our PTF strategy at We Power and for compliance
with the consent decree entered into with the EPA. See Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources — Environmental Matters. In addition, expenditures associated with nuclear fuel purchases were higher during 2005. In 2004, we
recognized proceeds of $857.0 million from the sale of our manufacturing segment.


Wisconsin Energy Corporation

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Cont’d)

The following table identifies capital expenditures by year:

In connection with our growth strategy, which was announced in 2000, we have been focusing on divesting non-core
assets and investing in core regulated assets. The sale of assets is a significant component of our investing activities. From 2000 through 2006, we have received approximately $2.2 billion of cash proceeds from the divestiture of assets. In 2007,
if we are able to close on the sale of Point Beach, we expect to receive an additional $1 billion of after-tax cash proceeds. However, except for the potential sale of Point Beach, we do not expect to have a significant level of asset sales in the
future.

The following table identifies cash proceeds from asset sales.

Financing Activities

The following table summarizes our cash flows from financing activities:

During 2006, cash provided by financing activities was $173.3 million compared to $157.8 million in
2005. Wisconsin Energy retired at the scheduled maturity date $250.0 million of 5.875% Notes due April 1, 2006. Short-term debt was issued to retire those notes. During 2006, short-term debt increased approximately $455.6 million. In
November 2006, Wisconsin Electric issued $300 million of 5.70% Debentures due December 1, 2036. The net proceeds from the sale were used to retire Wisconsin Electric’s $200 million of 6-5/8% Debentures due November 15,
2006 at their scheduled maturity and to repay outstanding commercial paper incurred for working capital requirements.


Wisconsin Energy Corporation

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Cont’d)

In July 2005, PWGS issued $155.0 million of 4.91% senior notes in a private placement. The senior notes
have a mortgage style repayment feature and have an average life approximating 15 years. The final payment is due July 15, 2030. Proceeds from the sale of the senior notes were used primarily to repay short-term debt incurred during
construction at PWGS. For further information, see Note K — Long-Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Wisconsin Gas
retired at the scheduled maturity date $65 million of 6-3/8% Notes due November 1, 2005. In November 2005, Wisconsin Gas issued $90 million of 5.90% Debentures due December 1, 2035. The proceeds from the sale were used
to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper. The commercial paper was incurred to both retire the $65 million of 6-3/8% Notes and for working capital requirements.

During 2004, the proceeds from asset sales as well as improved cash flows from operations allowed us to retire $654.2 million of debt, including $200 million of 6.85% Trust Preferred Securities and
$300 million of 5.875% senior notes due April 1, 2006.

No new shares of Wisconsin Energy’s common stock were issued in 2006 and 2005.
During January and February 2004, we issued approximately 0.2 million new shares of common stock in connection with our dividend reinvestment plan and various employee benefit plans and we received payments aggregating $4.8 million. In
February 2004, we announced that we did not expect to issue new shares under these programs; rather we instructed the independent plan agents to begin purchasing the shares in the open market in lieu of issuing new shares. During 2006, 2005 and
2004, our plan agents purchased 1.1 million shares at a cost of $48.0 million, 2.0 million shares at a cost of $75.1 million and 3.2 million shares at a cost of $102.3 million, respectively, to fulfill exercised stock
options and restricted stock awards. In 2006, 2005, and 2004 we received proceeds of $26.8 million, $47.0 million and $66.1 million related to the exercise of stock options. Prior to February 2004, we issued new shares to fulfill
these obligations.

In September 2000, the Board of Directors amended the common stock repurchase program to authorize us to purchase up to
$400 million of our shares of common stock in the open market. This program expired in December 2004. In March 2004, we announced that under this plan we would resume purchasing approximately $50 million of our common shares in the open
market with the proceeds from the sale of the manufacturing business, which was effective July 31, 2004. During 2004, we purchased approximately 1.6 million shares of common stock for $50.4 million under this plan. We ceased
repurchasing shares in October 2004. Over the life of the plan we repurchased and retired 14.9 million shares at a cost of $344.0 million.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND REQUIREMENTS

In December 2006, we announced that Wisconsin Electric had reached an agreement to sell Point Beach to
an affiliate of FPL. If the sale is completed, we expect to receive over $1 billion of after-tax proceeds from the sale and liquidation of decommissioning trust assets. In the short-term, these proceeds would be used to reduce outstanding debt or
temporarily invested in short term securities. However, as discussed in Corporate Developments - Corporate Strategy, we have filed an application with the PSCW that outlines our intention to use the gain (net of transaction related costs) on the
proceeds for the benefit of our customers as decided by our regulators in future rate proceedings. As such, if the Point Beach sale is approved, we believe that the cash proceeds, after transaction costs and return of invested capital, that will
result from the sale will replace revenues that we would have received in future rate proceedings.

In 2000, we announced a growth strategy which, among
other things, called for us to sell non-core assets and reduce our debt levels. Our debt to total capital ratio has decreased from 68.3% at September 30, 2000 to 59.5% at December 31, 2006 due primarily to asset sales. Over the next
several years, we expect to have some limited asset sales, but at levels significantly lower than the previous seven year level.

Capital Resources

We anticipate meeting our capital requirements during 2007 and the next several years primarily through internally generated funds and short-term
borrowings, supplemented by the issuance of intermediate or long-term debt or other


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2006 Form 10-K

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Cont’d)

capital market (other than common stock) securities depending on market conditions and other factors. During 2007, Wisconsin Energy may issue up to $600
million of debt or debt-like securities depending on market conditions and other factors.

We have access to capital markets and have been able to generate
funds internally and externally to meet our capital requirements. Our ability to attract the necessary financial capital at reasonable terms is critical to our overall strategic plan. We believe that we have adequate capacity to fund our operations
for the foreseeable future through our borrowing arrangements and internally generated cash.

In March 2004, the Governor of Wisconsin signed into law
a measure that gives utilities the ability to securitize the portion of customer bills that recovers the cost of certain investments intended to improve the environment. We evaluated the possible issuance of environmental trust bonds for some time.
However, after extensive evaluation and analysis, we will not be pursuing an issuance of environmental trust bonds.

Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric
and Wisconsin Gas credit agreements provide liquidity support for each company’s obligations with respect to commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.

As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately $1.7 billion of available unused lines under our bank back-up credit facilities on a consolidated basis and approximately $911.9 million of total
consolidated short-term debt outstanding.

We review our bank back-up credit facility needs on an ongoing basis and expect to be able to maintain adequate
credit facilities to support our operations. The following table summarizes such facilities at December 31, 2006.

On March 30, 2006, Wisconsin Electric entered into an unsecured five year $500 million bank back-up
credit facility to replace a $250 million three year credit facility with an expiration date of June 2007 and a $125 million three year credit facility with an expiration date of November 2007. This new facility will expire in
March 2011.

On March 30, 2006, Wisconsin Gas entered into an unsecured five year $300 million bank back-up credit facility to replace a
$200 million three year credit facility with an expiration date of June 2007. This new facility will expire in March 2011.

On April 6,
2006, Wisconsin Energy entered into an unsecured five year $900 million bank back-up credit facility to replace a $300 million credit facility that would have expired on April 8, 2006 and a $300 million credit facility with an
expiration date of June 2007. This new credit facility will expire in April 2011.

Each of these facilities has a renewal provision for two
one-year extensions, subject to lender approval.

The following table shows our consolidated capitalization structure at December 31:

As described in Note J — Common Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain
restrictions exist on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us. We do not expect these restrictions to have any material effect on our operations or ability to meet our cash obligations.

Access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality. The following table summarizes the ratings of our debt securities and the
debt securities and preferred stock of our subsidiaries by S&P, Moody’s and Fitch as of December 31, 2006.

On June 15, 2006, Fitch affirmed the security ratings of Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric, Wisconsin Gas
and Wisconsin Energy Capital Corporation and changed the security ratings outlook for Wisconsin Energy and Wisconsin Energy Capital Corporation from stable to negative. The security ratings outlooks assigned by Fitch for Wisconsin Electric and
Wisconsin Gas are stable.

On June 8, 2006, S&P affirmed the security ratings and ratings outlook of Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and
Wisconsin Gas. The security ratings outlooks assigned by S&P for Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric, Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Energy Capital Corporation are negative.

The security rating outlooks assigned by Moody’s for Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric, Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Energy Capital Corporation are all stable. In February 2004, Moody’s changed the
rating outlook for Wisconsin Energy and Wisconsin Energy Capital Corporation from negative to stable.

We believe these security ratings should provide a significant degree of flexibility in obtaining funds on
competitive terms. However, these security ratings reflect the views of the rating agencies only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from each rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold
securities, but rather an indication of creditworthiness. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides that the circumstances warrant the change. Each rating should be evaluated independently
of any other rating.

Capital Requirements

Our current
estimated 2007, 2008 and 2009 capital expenditures, excluding the purchase of nuclear fuel, are as follows:

Due to changing environmental and other regulations such as air quality standards and electric reliability
initiatives that impact our utility energy segments future long-term capital requirements may vary from recent capital requirements.

Our capital
requirements include the construction of the PTF units. Through December 31, 2006, we have expended approximately $1.2 billion of the approximately $2.6 billion in capital we estimate will be required to construct the 2,120 MW of new
natural gas-fired and coal-fired generating capacity. We anticipate that the PTF units will be completed by 2010.

We expect the capital requirements to
support our investment in new generation under PTF to come from a combination of internal and external sources. We Power, a non-utility subsidiary, is constructing the new generating plants, which will be leased to Wisconsin Electric under 25-30
year lease agreements. We expect that Wisconsin Electric will recover the lease payments in its utility rates.

In June 2005, we purchased the
development rights to two wind farm projects from Navitas Energy Inc. We plan to develop the wind sites and construct wind turbines with a combined generating capability between 130 and 200 MW. We estimate that the capital cost of the project,
excluding AFUDC, will be up to $360 million. We anticipate the cost to build the wind farm projects would be recovered in Wisconsin Electric’s rates. We expect the turbines to be placed in service in 2008 dependent upon the availability of
wind turbines and the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals. For additional information on Wind Generation see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters - Wind Generation below.

Investments in Outside Trusts

: We have funded our pension obligations, certain other post-retirement obligations and future nuclear obligations in outside trusts. Collectively, these trusts had
investments that exceeded $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2006. These trusts hold investments that are subject to the volatility of the stock market and interest rates. For further information see Note I — Nuclear Operations and Note
O — Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements:

We are a party to various
financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk as a part of our normal course of business, including financial guarantees and letters of credit which support construction projects, commodity contracts and other payment obligations. We believe
that these agreements do not have, and are not reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,

revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our investors. For further information,
see Note P — Guarantees in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

We have identified three tolling and purchased power agreements with
third parties but have been unable to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of any of these three variable interest entities as defined by FIN 46. As a result, we do not consolidate these entities. Instead, we account for one of these
contracts as a capital lease and for the other two contracts as operating leases as reflected in the table below. We have included our contractual obligations under all three of these contracts in our Contractual Obligations/Commercial Commitments
disclosure that follows. For additional information, see Note G — Variable Interest Entities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Contractual Obligations/Commercial Commitments:

We have the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2006:

(a)

The amounts included in the table are calculated using current market prices, forward curves and other estimates. Contracts with multiple unknown variables have been omitted from
the analysis. The table excludes the long-term power purchase commitment which is contingent upon the sale of Point Beach.

(b)

FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

MARKET RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT RISKS

We are exposed to market
and other significant risks as a result of the nature of our businesses and the environment in which those businesses operate. These risks, described in further detail below, include but are not limited to:

Large Construction Projects:

In December 2002, the PSCW issued a written order granting a CPCN to commence construction of the PWGS consisting of
two 545 MW natural gas-fired combined cycle generating units on the site of Wisconsin Electric’s existing Port Washington Power Plant. The order approved key financial terms of the leased generation contracts including fixed construction costs
of PWGS 1 at $309.6 million and PWGS 2 at $280.3 million (2001 dollars), respectively, subject to escalation at the GDP inflation rate, force majeure, excused events and event of loss provisions. For additional information,
see Power the Future — Port Washington.

In addition, in November 2003, the PSCW issued a written order granting a CPCN to commence construction
of two 615 MW super critical pulverized coal generating units adjacent to the site of Wisconsin Electric’s existing plant. The order approves key financial terms of the leased generation contracts including a target construction cost of
the Oak Creek expansion of $2.191 billion, plus, subject to PSCW approval, cost over-runs of up to 5%, costs attributable to force majeure events, excused events and event of loss provisions. For additional information, see Power the Future
— Oak Creek Expansion.

Large construction projects of this type are subject to usual construction risks over which we will have limited or no control
and which might adversely affect project costs and completion time. These risks include, but are not limited to, shortages of, the inability to obtain or the cost of labor or materials, the inability of the general contractor or subcontractors to
perform under their contracts, strikes, adverse weather conditions, continuing legal challenges to permits obtained, changes in applicable laws or regulations, adverse interpretation or enforcement of permit conditions, laws and regulations by the
permitting agencies, the inability to obtain necessary operating permits in a timely manner, governmental actions and events in the global economy.

If
final costs for the construction of PWGS exceed the fixed costs allowed in the PSCW order, absent a finding by the PSCW of extraordinary circumstances such as force majeure conditions, this excess will not adjust the amount of the lease payments
recovered from Wisconsin Electric. If final costs of the Oak Creek expansion are within 5% of the target cost, and the additional costs are deemed to be prudent by the PSCW, the final lease payments for the Oak Creek expansion recovered from
Wisconsin Electric would be adjusted to reflect the actual construction costs. Costs above the 5% cap would not be included in lease payments or recovered from customers absent a finding by the PSCW of extraordinary circumstances such as force
majeure conditions.

Regulatory Recovery:

The electric operations of Wisconsin Electric burn natural gas in its leased power plants, in
several of its peaking power plants and as a supplemental fuel at several coal-fired plants. In addition, the cost of purchased power is generally tied to the cost of natural gas. Wisconsin Electric bears regulatory risk for the recovery of these
fuel and purchased power costs when these costs are higher than the base rate established in its rate structure. For further information on the recovery of fuel and purchase power costs see Commodity Prices.

Our utility energy segment accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with SFAS 71. Our rates are determined by regulatory authorities. Our primary
regulator is the PSCW. SFAS 71 allows regulated entities to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if the regulated entity believes the recovery of these costs is probable. We record regulatory assets pursuant to
specific orders or by a generic order issued by our regulators, and recovery of these deferred costs in future rates is subject to the review and approval of those regulators. We assume the risks and benefits of ultimate recovery of these items in
future rates. If the recovery of these costs is not approved by our regulators, the costs are charged to income in the current period. We expect to recover our outstanding regulatory assets in rates over a period of no longer than 20 years.
Regulators can impose liabilities on a prospective basis for amounts previously collected from customers and for amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers. Under SFAS 71, we record these items as regulatory liabilities.

Commodity Prices:

In the normal course of providing energy, we are subject to market fluctuations of the costs of coal, natural gas and the cost of
purchased power. We manage our fuel and gas supply costs through a portfolio of


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2006 Form 10-K

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Cont’d)

short- and long-term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, uranium, natural gas and fuel oil. In addition, we manage the
risk of price volatility by utilizing gas hedging programs.

Wisconsin’s retail electric fuel cost adjustment procedure mitigates some of Wisconsin
Electric’s risk of electric fuel cost fluctuation. If cumulative fuel and purchased power costs for electric utility operations deviate from a prescribed range when compared to the costs projected in the most recent retail rate proceeding,
retail electric rates may be adjusted prospectively. For 2007, we will operate under a traditional fuel cost adjustment clause in the Wisconsin retail jurisdiction whereby fuel revenues may be adjusted prospectively if fuel and purchased power costs
fall outside a pre-established annual band of plus or minus 2%. For information regarding the 2006 fuel rules, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters.

The PSCW has authorized dollar for dollar recovery for the majority of natural gas costs for our gas utility operations through gas cost recovery mechanisms, which mitigates most of the risk of gas cost variations. For information
concerning the electric utility fuel cost adjustment procedure and the natural gas utilities’ GCRMs, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters.

Natural Gas Costs:

Significant increases in the cost of natural gas affect our electric and gas utility operations. Natural gas costs have increased significantly because the supply of natural gas in recent years has not
kept pace with the demand for natural gas. We expect that demand for natural gas will remain high into the foreseeable future and that significant price relief will not occur until additional natural gas is added to the nation’s energy supply
mix.

Higher natural gas costs increase our working capital requirements and result in higher gross receipts taxes in the State of Wisconsin. Higher
natural gas costs combined with slower economic conditions also expose us to greater risks of accounts receivable write-offs as more customers are unable to pay their bills. Because federal and state energy assistance dollars have not kept pace with
rising natural gas costs over the recent year, our risks related to bad debt expenses have increased.

In February 2005, the PSCW authorized the use
of the escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs allowing for deferral of Wisconsin residential bad debt expense that exceed amounts allowed in rates. In 2004 and 2003, we had approval from the PSCW to defer residential bad debt net write-offs
that exceed amounts allowed in rates.

As a result of GCRMs, our gas distribution subsidiaries receive dollar for dollar recovery on the cost of natural
gas. However, increased natural gas costs increase the risk that customers will switch to alternative fuel sources, which could reduce future gas margins.

Weather:

Our Wisconsin utility rates are set by the PSCW based upon estimated temperatures which approximate 20-year averages. Wisconsin Electric’s electric revenues are unfavorably sensitive to below normal
temperatures during the summer cooling season, and to some extent, to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. Our gas revenues are unfavorably sensitive to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. A summary of
actual weather information in the utility segment’s service territory during 2006, 2005 and 2004, as measured by degree-days, may be found above in Results of Operations.

Interest Rate:

We have various short-term borrowing arrangements to provide working capital and general corporate funds. We also have variable rate long-term debt outstanding at
December 31, 2006. Borrowing levels under these arrangements vary from period to period depending upon capital investments and other factors. Future short-term interest expense and payments will reflect both future short-term interest rates and
borrowing levels.

We performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis at December 31, 2006 of our outstanding portfolio of $911.9 million of
short-term debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5.37% and $179.0 million of variable-rate long-term debt with a weighted average interest rate of 3.97%. A one-percentage point change in interest rates would cause our annual interest
expense to increase or decrease by approximately $9.1 million before taxes from short-term borrowings and $1.8 million before taxes from variable rate long-term debt outstanding.

Marketable Securities Return:

We fund our pension, OPEB and nuclear decommissioning obligations through various trust funds, which in turn
invest in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market prices of these assets can affect future pension, other post-retirement benefit and nuclear decommissioning expenses. Additionally, future contributions can also be affected by changes in
the market price of trust fund assets. We expect that the risk of


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2006 Form 10-K

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Cont’d)

expense and contribution variations as a result of changes in the market price of trust fund assets would be mitigated in part through future rate actions by
our various utility regulators. Through December 31, 2005, we were operating under a PSCW-ordered, qualified five-year rate restriction period. For further information about the rate restriction, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters.

At December 31, 2006, we held the following total trust fund assets at fair value, primarily consisting of publicly traded debt and equity security
investments.

Wisconsin Energy Corporation

Millions of Dollars

Pension trust funds

$1,057.7

Nuclear decommissioning trust funds

$   881.6

Other post-retirement benefits trust funds

$   203.7

Fiduciary oversight of the pension and other post-retirement plan trust fund investments is the responsibility of
an Investment Trust Policy Committee. Qualified external investment managers are engaged to manage the investments. Asset/liability studies are periodically conducted with the assistance of an outside investment advisor. The current study for the
pension fund projects long-term annualized returns of approximately 8.5%.

Fiduciary oversight for the nuclear decommissioning trust fund investments
is also the responsibility of the Investment Trust Policy Committee. Qualified external investment managers are also engaged to manage these investments. Asset/liability studies are periodically conducted with the assistance of an outside investment
advisor, subject to additional constraints established by the PSCW. The current study projects long-term, annualized returns of approximately 9%. Current PSCW constraints allow a maximum allocation of 65% in equities.

Wisconsin Electric insures various property and outage risks through NEIL. Annually, NEIL reviews its underwriting and investment results and determines the feasibility
of granting a distribution to policyholders. Adverse loss experience, rising reinsurance costs or impaired investment results at NEIL could result in increased costs or decreased distributions to Wisconsin Electric.

Credit Ratings:

We do not have any credit agreements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit
rating downgrade. We do have certain agreements in the form of commodity and energy services contracts and employee benefit plans that could require, in the event of a credit rating change to below investment grade, a termination payment if
collateral is not provided or an accelerated payment. At December 31, 2006, we estimate that the potential payments under these agreements that could result from credit rating downgrades totaled approximately $71.2 million.

Economic Conditions:

We are exposed to market risks in the regional midwest economy for our utility energy segment.

Inflation:

We continue to monitor the impact of inflation, especially with respect to the rising costs of medical plans, in order to minimize its
effects in future years through pricing strategies, productivity improvements and cost reductions. Except for continuance of an increasing trend in the inflation of medical costs and the impacts on our medical and post-retirement benefit plans, we
have expectations of low-to-moderate inflation. We do not believe the impact of general inflation will have a material effect on our future results of operations.

For additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information at the beginning of this report and Risk Factors above.

POWER THE FUTURE

Under our PTF strategy, we expect to meet a
significant portion of our future generation needs through the construction of the PWGS and the Oak Creek expansion by We Power. We Power will lease the new plants to


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2006 Form 10-K

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Cont’d)

Wisconsin Electric under long-term leases, and we expect Wisconsin Electric to recover the lease payments in its electric rates.

The PTF units include PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. The following table identifies certain key items related to the units:

(a)

Authorized cash costs represent the PSCW approved costs and the increases for factors such as inflation as identified in the PSCW approved lease terms for PWGS 2, and adjusted
for our ownership percentages in the case of OC 1 and OC 2.

The lease payments are based on the cash costs authorized by our
primary regulator. Under the lease terms, our return is calculated using a 12.7% return on equity and the equity ratio is assumed to be 53% for the PWGS Units and 55% for the OC Units. The interest component of the return is determined up to 180
days prior to the date that the units are placed in service.

Power the Future -

Port Washington

Background:

In December 2002, the PSCW issued a written order (the Port Order) granting Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and We Power a CPCN
to commence construction of the PWGS consisting of two 545 MW natural gas-fired combined cycle generating units on the site of Wisconsin Electric’s existing Port Washington Power Plant. The Port Order also authorized Wisconsin Gas to proceed
with the construction of a connecting natural gas lateral, which was completed in December 2004, and it authorized ATC to construct transmission system upgrades to serve PWGS 1 and PWGS 2. PWGS 1 was completed in July 2005 and placed into
service at that time. PWGS 1 was completed within the PSCW approved cost parameters. In October 2003, we received approval from FERC to transfer by long-term lease certain associated FERC jurisdictional transmission related assets from We Power to
Wisconsin Electric. Construction of PWGS 2 is well underway. Site preparation, including removal of the old coal units at the site, was completed in early 2006, and all of the major components have been procured. The unit is expected to begin
commercial operation in time for the peak summer season in 2008.

Lease Terms:

The PSCW approved the lease agreements and related
documents under which Wisconsin Electric will staff, operate and maintain PWGS 1 and PWGS 2. Key terms of the leased generation contracts include:

•

Initial lease term of 25 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;

•

Cost recovery over a 25 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;

•

Imputed capital structure of 53% equity, 47% debt;

•

Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;

•

Fixed construction cost of PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 at $309.6 million and $280.3 million (2001 dollars) subject to escalation at the GDP inflation rate;

•

Recovery of carrying costs during construction; and

•

Ongoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the Port Order, which do not include the key financial terms.

In January 2003, Wisconsin Electric filed a request with the PSCW to defer costs for recovery in future rates. The PSCW approved
the request in an open meeting in April 2003. We Power began collecting certain costs from Wisconsin Electric in the third quarter of 2003 as provided for in lease generation contracts that were signed in May 2003. We defer the lease costs
on our balance sheet, and we amortize the costs to expense as we recover the costs in rates.

Legal and Regulatory Matters:

There
are currently no legal challenges to the construction of PWGS and all construction permits have been received for PWGS 1 and PWGS 2. As a result of the enactment of the Energy Policy Act, FERC, through an amendment to Section 203 of the Federal
Power Act, has been given jurisdiction over


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2006 Form 10-K

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Cont’d)

the acquisition of generation (which includes leasing generation), an activity that previously was not subject to FERC’s jurisdiction. Under FERC’s
rules implementing the Energy Policy Act, Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and We Power filed a joint application for FERC authorization to transfer the generating assets and limited interconnection facilities of PWGS 2 through a lease
arrangement between We Power and Wisconsin Electric. We received approval from FERC for this asset transfer in December 2006.

Power the
Future -

Oak Creek Expansion

Background:

In November 2003, the PSCW issued an order
(the Oak Creek Order) granting Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and We Power a CPCN to commence construction of two 615 MW coal-fired units (the Oak Creek expansion) to be located adjacent to the site of Wisconsin Electric’s existing Oak
Creek Power Plant. We anticipate OC 1 will be operational in 2009 and OC 2 will be operational in 2010. The Oak Creek Order concluded, among other things, that there was a need for additional electric generation for Southeastern Wisconsin
and that a diversity of fuel sources best serves the interests of the State. The total cost for the two units was set at $2.191 billion, and the order provided for recovery of excess costs of up to 5% of the total project, subject to a prudence
review by the PSCW. The CPCN was granted contingent upon us obtaining the necessary environmental permits. All necessary permits have been received at this time. In June 2005, construction commenced at the site.

In November 2005, we completed the sale of approximately a 17% interest in the project to two unaffiliated entities, who will share ratably in the construction
costs.

Lease Terms:

In October 2004, the PSCW approved the lease generation contracts between Wisconsin Electric and We Power
for the Oak Creek expansion. Key terms of the leased generation contracts include:

•

Initial lease term of 30 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;

•

Cost recovery over a 30 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;

•

Imputed capital structure of 55% equity, 45% debt;

•

Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;

•

Recovery of carrying costs during construction; and

•

Ongoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the Oak Creek Order, which do not include the key financial
terms.

Legal and Regulatory Matters:

The CPCN granted for the construction of the Oak Creek expansion was the subject
of a number of legal challenges by third parties; these legal challenges were resolved in June 2005. We have received all permits necessary to commence construction. Certain of these permits continue to be contested, but remain in effect unless
and until overturned by a reviewing court or administrative law judge. The major permits are discussed below.

The WDNR issued a Chapter 30 permit for
wetlands and waterways alterations and construction on the bed of Lake Michigan for the construction of the Oak Creek expansion. The permit has been the subject of appeals since 2003. The final appeal was resolved by the Wisconsin Court of Appeals
in February 2006, and the period for appeal of that decision to the Wisconsin Supreme Court has expired.

We applied to the WDNR to modify the
existing WPDES permit that is required for operation of the water intake and discharge system for the planned Oak Creek expansion and existing Oak Creek generating units. In March 2005, the WDNR determined that the proposed cooling water intake
structure and water discharge system meets regulatory requirements and reissued the WPDES permit with specific limitations and conditions. The opponents filed a petition for judicial review in Dane County Circuit Court and a request for a contested
case proceeding with the WDNR. In September 2005, the judicial review petition was dismissed by agreement of the parties. The WDNR granted a contested case hearing that was held in March 2006. The administrative law judge upheld the issuance of
the permit in a decision issued in July 2006. In August 2006, the opponents filed for judicial review of the administrative law judge’s decision upholding the issuance of the permit. Briefing was completed in December 2006.
However, based on the federal court decision discussed below, the opponents filed a motion on January 26, 2007 requesting supplemental briefing. In a telephone conference on February 2, 2007, the Court said that additional briefing was not
necessary, but that it might request oral argument before issuing its decision regarding review of the permit. We anticipate a decision in the case in 2007.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Cont’d)

On January 26, 2007, the Federal Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, issued a decision in Riverkeeper, Inc.
v. EPA, Nos. 04-6692-ag(L) et al. (2d Cir. 2007) relating to the 316(b) rules for cooling water intake systems for existing large utility plants. The Second Circuit Court found certain portions of the rule impermissible and remanded several parts of
the rule to the EPA for further consideration or potential additional rulemaking. The WPDES permit for our Oak Creek expansion and existing Oak Creek generating units is a state permit, issued by WDNR with concurrence of EPA. Based on our
review of the Second Circuit decision, we do not believe the decision invalidates the WPDES permit for Oak Creek. However, we cannot predict what, if any, impact the decision may have on the court’s decision in the Dane County Circuit Court
case.

In May 2005, we received the Army Corps of Engineers federal permit necessary for the construction of the Oak Creek expansion. Opponents
may appeal the permit in federal court.

In addition, as a result of the enactment of the Energy Policy Act, FERC, through an amendment to Section 203
of the Federal Power Act, has been given jurisdiction over the acquisition of generation (which includes leasing generation), an activity that previously was not subject to FERC’s jurisdiction. Under FERC’s rules implementing the Energy
Policy Act, Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and We Power filed a joint application for FERC authorization to transfer the generating assets and limited interconnection facilities of OC 1 and OC 2 through a lease arrangement between We Power and
Wisconsin Electric. We received approval from FERC on these leases in December 2006.

UTILITY RATES AND REGULATORY MATTERS

The PSCW regulates our retail electric, natural gas, steam and water rates in the State of Wisconsin, while FERC regulates our wholesale power, electric transmission and
interstate gas transportation service rates. The MPSC regulates our retail electric rates in the State of Michigan. Within our regulated segment, we estimate that approximately 88% of our electric revenues are regulated by the PSCW, 7% are regulated
by the MPSC and the balance of our electric revenues are regulated by FERC. All of our natural gas revenues are regulated by the PSCW. Orders from the PSCW can be viewed at http://psc.wi.gov/ and orders from the MPSC can be viewed at
www.michigan.gov/mpsc/.

Overview:

For the period from March 2000 until December 31, 2005, the rates of Wisconsin Electric and
Wisconsin Gas were governed by an order from the PSCW in connection with the approval of the WICOR acquisition. Under this order, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas were restricted from increasing Wisconsin rates for a five year period ending
December 31, 2005, with certain limited exceptions.

The table below summarizes the anticipated annualized revenue impact of the recent Wisconsin
Electric rate changes.

(a)

In January 2006, the PSCW issued a final order authorizing an increase in steam rates of $7.8 million over the two year period of 2006 and 2007.

(b)

In November 2005, the PSCW issued a final order authorizing a fuel surcharge for $7.7 million of additional fuel costs. In March 2005, the PSCW issued an interim
order authorizing a fuel surcharge for $114.9 million that was effective until the November 2005 final order was issued by the PSCW. The final November 2005 order for $122.6 million superseded the March 2005 interim order.

(c)

In May 2004, the PSCW issued a final order authorizing an increase in electric rates for costs associated with the PWGS under construction and increased costs associated with
low-income energy assistance.

2006 Pricing:

In January 2006, Wisconsin Electric received an order from the PSCW that
allowed it to increase annual electric revenues by approximately $222.0 million or 10.6% to recover increased costs associated with investments in our PTF units, transmission services and fuel and purchased power, as well as costs associated
with additional sources of renewable energy. The rate increase was based on an authorized return on equity of 11.2%. The order also required Wisconsin Electric to refund to customers, with interest, any fuel revenues that it receives that are in
excess of fuel and purchased power costs that it incurs, as defined by the Wisconsin fuel rules. The original order stipulated that any refund would also include interest at short-term rates. This refund provision does not extend past
December 31, 2006.

During 2006, we experienced lower than expected fuel and purchased power costs. In September 2006, we requested and received
approval from the PSCW to refund favorable fuel recoveries including accrued interest at a short-term rate. In addition, in September 2006 the PSCW determined that if the total recoveries for 2006 exceeded $36 million, interest on the amount in
excess of $36 million would be paid at the rate of 11.2%, our authorized return on equity rather than at short-term rates as originally set forth in the order. During October 2006, we refunded $28.7 million including interest to Wisconsin
retail customers as a credit on their bill and we received approval from the PSCW to refund an additional $10 million, including interest in the first quarter of 2007.

For 2007, Wisconsin Electric expects to operate under a traditional fuel cost adjustment clause in the Wisconsin retail jurisdiction whereby fuel revenues may be adjusted prospectively if fuel and purchased power
costs fall outside a pre-established annual band of plus or minus 2%.


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2006 Form 10-K

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Cont’d)

Our gas operations went through a traditional rate proceeding whereby the revenues were set to recover projected
costs and to provide a return on rate base. The January 2006 order provided for increases in gas revenues totaling $60.1 million ($21.4 million or 2.9% for Wisconsin Electric gas operations and $38.7 million or 3.7% for Wisconsin Gas
gas operations). The rate increases were based on an authorized return on equity of 11.2% for the gas operations of both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas.

The steam rate proceeding was a traditional rate proceeding. The January 2006 order provided for an increase in steam rates of $7.8 million or 31.5% to be phased in over a two year period beginning in 2006. The rate increase was based
on an authorized return on equity of 11.2%.

2004 Wisconsin Gas Pricing:

In March 2004, the PSCW approved an annual rate increase of
$25.9 million related to increased costs associated with the construction of the Ixonia lateral and for increased costs associated with low-income energy assistance.

2008 Pricing:

We anticipate filing rate cases for Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas in May 2007 for new rates effective in January 2008.

Limited Rate Adjustment Requests

2005 Fuel Recovery
Filing:

In February 2005, Wisconsin Electric filed an application with the PSCW for an increase in electric rates in the amount of $114.9 million due to the increased costs of fuel and purchased power as a result of customer
growth and the increase in the reliance upon natural gas as a fuel source. We received approval for the increase in fuel recoveries on an interim basis in March 2005. In November 2005, we received the final rate order, which authorized an
additional $7.7 million in rate increases, for a total increase of $122.6 million (6.2%). In December 2005, two parties filed suit against the PSCW in Dane County Circuit Court challenging the PSCW’s decision to allow fuel cost
recovery, while allowing us to keep the savings that resulted from the WICOR acquisition. As a condition of the PSCW approval of the WICOR acquisition, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas were restricted from increasing Wisconsin rates for a five
year period ending December 31, 2005, with certain limited exceptions, but we were allowed to keep the savings generated from the merger. In July 2006, the Dane County Circuit Court affirmed the PSCW’s decision. In August 2006,
the opponents appealed this decision to the Wisconsin Court of Appeals. We anticipate a decision from the Wisconsin Court of Appeals in 2007.

Revenue Deficiencies:

In May 2004, Wisconsin Electric filed an application with the PSCW for an increase in electric and steam rates for anticipated 2005 revenue deficiencies associated with (1) costs for the new PWGS and
the Oak Creek expansion being constructed as part of our PTF strategy, (2) costs associated with our energy efficiency procurement plan and (3) costs associated with making changes to our steam utility systems as part of the reconstruction
of the Marquette Interchange highway project in downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The filing identified anticipated revenue deficiencies in 2005 attributable to Wisconsin in the amount of $84.8 million (4.5%) for the electric operations of
Wisconsin Electric and $0.5 million (3.6%) for Wisconsin Electric’s steam operations. In January 2005, as a result of the litigation involving our Oak Creek expansion, we amended this filing to reduce the total revenue request to
$52.4 million. In May 2005, the PSCW issued its final written order implementing an annualized increase in electric rates of $59.7 million (3.1%) and an increase of $0.5 million (3.6%) in steam rates.

Other Utility Rate Matters

Electric Transmission Cost
Recovery

: Wisconsin Electric divested of its transmission assets with the formation of ATC in January 2001. We now procure transmission service from ATC at FERC approved tariff rates. In connection with the formation of the ATC, our
transmission costs have escalated due to the socialization of costs within the ATC and increased transmission infrastructure requirements in the state. In 2002, in connection with the increased costs experienced by our customers, the PSCW issued an
order which allowed the deferral of transmission costs in excess of amounts imbedded in rates. We are allowed to earn a return on the unrecovered transmission costs at our weighted average cost of capital. As of December 31, 2006, we have
deferred $192.2 million of unrecovered transmission costs. In January 2006, our rates were increased by approximately $67.5 million annually to recover transmission costs that were not currently in rates. We will continue to accrue
carrying costs on the unrecovered balances.

Fuel Cost Adjustment Procedure:

Within the State of Wisconsin, Wisconsin Electric operates under a
fuel cost adjustment clause for fuel and purchased power costs associated with the generation and delivery of electricity and purchase power contracts. Imbedded within its base rates is an amount to recover fuel costs. Under the current fuel rules,
no adjustments are made to rates as long as fuel and purchased power costs are expected to be within a band of the costs imbedded in current rates for the twelve month period ending December 31. If, however, annual fuel costs are expected to
fall outside of the band, and actual costs fall outside of established fuel bands, then we may file for a change in fuel recoveries on a prospective basis. For 2006, the upper band was 2%. As discussed above, during 2006, we experienced lower than
expected fuel and purchased power costs. In September 2006, we requested and received approval from the PSCW to refund favorable fuel recoveries including accrued interest at short-term rates. Approximately $28.7 million, including interest, in
refunds were issued as a credit on customer bills in October 2006. We had favorable fuel recoveries of approximately $37.4 million, excluding interest, for 2006. We received approval from the PSCW to refund an additional $10 million,
including interest, during the first quarter of 2007. In September 2006, the PSCW determined that if the total favorable recoveries for 2006 exceeded $36 million, interest on the favorable recoveries in excess of $36 million will be
paid at the rate of 11.2%, our authorized return on equity, rather than at short-term rates as originally set forth in the order. For 2007, the band is plus or minus 2%.

In June 2006, the PSCW opened a docket (01-AC-224) in which it was looking into revising the current fuel rules (Chapter PSC 116). In February 2007, five Wisconsin utilities regulated by the fuel rules, including
Wisconsin Electric, filed a joint proposal to modify the existing rules in this docket. The proposal recommends modifying the rules to allow for escrow accounting for fuel costs outside a plus or minus 1% annual band width of fuel costs allowed in
rates. It further recommends that the escrow balance be trued-up annually following the end of each calendar year. We are unable to predict if or when the PSCW will make any changes to the existing fuel rules.

Edison Sault and Wisconsin Electric’s operations in Michigan operate under a Power Supply Cost Recovery mechanism which generally allows for the recovery of fuel
and purchase power costs on a dollar for dollar basis.

Gas Cost Recovery Mechanism:

Our natural gas operations operate under a
GCRM as approved by the PSCW. Generally, the GCRM allows for a dollar for dollar recovery of gas costs. There is an incentive mechanism under the GCRM which allows for increased revenues if we acquire gas lower than benchmarks approved by the PSCW.
During 2006 and 2005, no additional revenues were earned under the incentive portion of the GCRM and $0.2 million of additional revenues were earned in 2004 under the GCRM.

Bad Debt Costs:

In 2004, due to a combination of unusually high natural gas prices, a soft economy within our utility service territories, and limited governmental assistance available to low-income
customers, we saw a significant increase in residential uncollectible accounts receivable. These factors led us to request and receive letters from the PSCW which allowed us to defer the costs of residential bad debts to the extent that the costs
exceeded the amounts allowed in rates. As a result of these letters from the PSCW, we deferred approximately $21.2 million in 2004 related to bad debt costs.

In January 2006, the PSCW issued an order approving the amortization over the next five years of the bad debts deferred in 2004 for our gas operations. The bad debts deferred in 2004 related to electric operations will be considered
for recovery in future rates, subject to audit and approval of the PSCW.

In December 2004, we filed with the PSCW a request to implement a pilot program,
which, among other things, is designed to better match our collection efforts with the ability of low income customers to pay their bills. Included in this filing was a request to implement escrow accounting for all residential bad debt costs. In
February 2005, the PSCW approved our pilot program and our request for the use of escrow accounting. The final decision was received in March 2005. The escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs allows for deferral of Wisconsin residential
bad debt expense that exceed amounts allowed in rates. As a result of this approval from the PSCW, we escrowed approximately $3.7 million in 2006 and $17.2 million in 2005 related to bad debt costs. These amounts were not addressed in the
January 2006 rate order, and will therefore be considered for recovery in future rates, subject to audit and approval of the PSCW. We will continue following the escrow method of accounting for bad debts as approved in the March 2005 PSCW
order.

MISO Midwest Market:

In January 2005, we requested deferral accounting treatment from the PSCW for certain incremental
costs or benefits that may occur due to the implementation on April 1, 2005 of the MISO Midwest

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Cont’d)

Market. We received approval for this accounting treatment in March 2005. Additionally, in March 2005 we submitted a joint proposal to the PSCW with other
utilities requesting escrow accounting treatment for the MISO Midwest Market costs until each utility’s first rate case following April 1, 2008. The purpose of the March 2005 request for escrow accounting was to provide clarification
on costs not included in the March 2005 approval for deferral accounting treatment. The PSCW approved deferral treatment for these costs in June 2006. For additional information see Industry Restructuring and Competition — Electric
Transmission and Energy Markets — MISO.

Wholesale Electric Rates:

On August 1, 2006, Wisconsin Electric filed a wholesale
rate case with FERC. The filing requests an annual increase in rates of approximately $16.7 million applicable to four existing wholesale electric customers. In November 2006, FERC accepted the rate filing subject to refund with interest;
however, the rates have not yet been approved. Three of the existing customer’s rates are effective January 1, 2007 and the remaining $16.5 million for the largest wholesale customers’ rates will be effective May 1, 2007.
The rates are subject to refund and hearing and settlement procedures.

Depreciation Rates:

In January 2005, Wisconsin Electric and
Wisconsin Gas filed a joint application with the PSCW for certification of depreciation rates for specific classes of utility plant assets. In November 2005, we received notice from the PSCW that the proposed estimated lives, net salvage values
and depreciation rates were approved and became effective January 1, 2006. For more information, see Note A — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Nuclear Refueling Outages - 2005

:

In May 2005, we requested and received approval from the PSCW to defer replacement power costs incurred
after May 30, 2005 due to the longer-than-expected outage at Point Beach Unit 2. We deferred $22.1 million of incremental purchased power costs related to the extended outage.

Renewables, Efficiency and Conservation:

In March 2006, Wisconsin enacted new public benefits legislation, Act 141. This legislation
changes the renewable energy requirements for utilities. Act 141 requires Wisconsin utilities to provide 2% more of their total retail energy from renewable resources than their current levels by 2010, and 6% more renewable energy than their current
levels by 2015. Act 141 establishes a statewide goal that 10% of all electricity in Wisconsin be generated by renewable resources by December 31, 2015. Assuming the bulk of additional renewables is wind turbines, Wisconsin Electric must obtain
approximately 210 MW of additional renewable capacity by 2010 and another approximately 610 MW of additional renewable capacity by 2015 to meet the retail energy delivered requirements. We have already started development of additional sources of
renewable energy to comply with commitments made as part of our PTF initiative which will assist us in complying with Act 141. See Wind Generation discussion below.

Act 141 allows the PSCW to delay a utility’s implementation of the renewable portfolio standard if it finds that achieving the renewable requirement would be too expensive or would lessen reliability, or
that new renewable projects could not be permitted on a timely basis or could not be served by adequate transmission facilities. The previous law did not include similar provisions. Act 141 provides that if a utility is in compliance with the
renewable energy and energy efficiency requirements as determined by the PSCW, then the utility is considered in compliance with the Energy Priorities law. Prior to Act 141, there had been no agreement on how to determine compliance with the
Energy Priorities law, which provides that it is the policy of the PSCW, to the extent it is cost-effective and technically feasible, to consider the following options in the listed order when reviewing energy-related applications: (1) energy
conservation and efficiency, (2) noncombustible renewable energy resources, (3) combustible renewable energy resources, (4) natural gas, (5) oil or low sulfur coal and (6) high sulfur coal and other carbon-based fuels.

We are evaluating the requirements of Act 141. Additionally, the details of the new requirements are subject to administrative rulemaking that could
take until March 2007 to complete.

Act 141 also redirects the administration of energy efficiency, conservation and renewable programs from the
DOA back to the utilities and/or contracted third parties. In addition, the law requires that 1.2% of utilities’ operating revenues be set aside for these programs. We do not expect the impact of this action to be material as the 1.2%
approximates the amounts currently in our rates for these matters. The effective date of this action is July 1, 2007. The PSCW is expected to develop implementation plans over the upcoming months.

Wind Generation:

In June 2005, we purchased the development rights to two wind farm projects
(Blue Sky Green Field) from Navitas Energy Inc. We plan to develop the wind sites and construct wind turbines with a combined generating capacity of between approximately 130 and 200 MW. We filed for approval of a CPCN with the PSCW in
March 2006. A prehearing conference was held in September 2006. In addition, our direct testimony was filed in September 2006. Staff and intervenor testimony was filed in October 2006 and rebuttal testimony by all parties was filed in
November 2006. Hearings were held at the end of November 2006. In February 2007, the PSCW issued a written notice approving the CPCN. In addition to the CPCN approval, we are working to secure any additional permits necessary to commence
construction. In early 2006, the United States Congress directed the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security to investigate possible conflicts between military radar and wind turbine installations. In November 2006,
we received confirmation that Blue Sky Green Field poses no such conflict, and to date the FAA has issued all requested permits for Blue Sky Green Field.

We estimate that the capital cost of the project, excluding AFUDC, will be up to $360 million. The demand for wind turbine equipment has been strong, pushing off equipment deliveries to dates later than originally anticipated. We
currently expect the turbines to be placed in service by the end of 2008, dependent upon the availability of wind turbines and the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals.

ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITY

In response to customer demand for higher quality power required by modern equipment, we
are evaluating and updating our electric distribution system. We are taking steps to reduce the likelihood of outages by upgrading substations and rebuilding lines to upgrade voltages and reliability. These improvements, along with better technology
for analysis of our existing system, better resource management to speed restoration and improved customer communication, are near-term efforts to enhance our current electric distribution infrastructure. For the long-term, we have developed a
distribution system asset management strategy that requires increased levels of automation of both substations and line equipment to consistently provide the level of reliability needed for a digital economy.

We had adequate capacity to meet all of our firm electric load obligations during 2006. All of our generating plants performed well during the warmest periods of the
summer and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, public appeals for conservation were not required; however, pursuant to MISO’s orders, we did interrupt or curtail service to non-firm customers
who participate in load management programs in exchange for discounted rates.

We expect to have adequate capacity to meet all of our firm load obligations
during 2007. However, extremely hot weather, unexpected equipment failure or unavailability could require us to call upon load management procedures during 2007 as we have in past years.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Consistent with other companies in the
energy industry, we face significant ongoing environmental compliance and remediation challenges related to current and past operations. Specific environmental issues affecting our utility and non-utility energy segments include but are not limited
to (1) air emissions such as CO

2,

SO


, NO

x

, small particulates
and mercury, (2) disposal of combustion by-products such as fly ash, (3) remediation of former manufactured gas plant sites, (4) disposal of used nuclear fuel and (5) the eventual decommissioning of Point Beach.

We are currently pursuing a proactive strategy to manage our environmental issues including (1) substituting
new and cleaner generating facilities for older facilities as part of our PTF strategy, (2) developing additional sources of renewable electric energy supply, (3) water quality matters such as discharge limits and cooling water
requirements, (4) adding emission control equipment to existing facilities to comply with new ambient air quality standards and federal clean air rules, (5) entering into agreements with the WDNR and EPA to reduce emissions of
SO


and NO

x

by more than 65% and mercury by 50% by 2013 from our coal-fired power plants in Wisconsin and Michigan, (6) evaluating and implementing improvements to our cooling water intake systems,
(7) recycling of ash from coal-fired generating units and (8) the clean-up of former manufactured gas plant sites. The capital cost of implementing the EPA consent decree is estimated to be approximately $1 billion over the 10 years
ending 2013. These costs are

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Cont’d)

principally associated with the installation of air quality controls on Pleasant Prairie Units 1 and 2 and Oak Creek Units 5-8. Through December 31,
2006, we have spent approximately $355.0 million associated with implementing the EPA agreement. For further information concerning the consent decree, see Note S — Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in this report. For further information concerning disposal of used nuclear fuel and nuclear power plant decommissioning, see Nuclear Operations below and Note I — Nuclear Operations in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in this report, respectively.

National Ambient Air Quality
Standards:

In 2000 and 2001, Michigan and Wisconsin finalized state rules implementing phased emission reductions required to meet the NAAQS for 1-hour ozone. In 2004, the EPA began implementing NAAQS for 8-hour ozone and
PM

2.5

. The states are currently developing rules to implement the new standards. Although specific emission
control requirements are not yet defined, we believe that the revised standards will likely require significant reductions in SO


and NO

x

emissions from coal-fired generating facilities. We expect that reductions needed to
achieve compliance with the 8-hour ozone attainment standard will be implemented in stages. Reductions associated with the fine particulate matter standards are expected to be implemented in stages after the year 2010 and extending to the
year 2017. We are currently unable to predict the impact that the revised air quality standards might have on the operations of our existing coal-fired generating facilities until the states develop rules and submit State Implementation Plans
(SIP) to the EPA to demonstrate how they intend to comply with the 8-hour ozone and fine particulate matter NAAQS.

8-hour Ozone Standard:

In April 2004, the EPA designated 10 counties in Southeastern Wisconsin as nonattainment areas for the 8-hour ozone NAAQS. States are required to develop and submit SIPs to
the EPA by June 2007 to demonstrate how they intend to comply with the 8-hour ozone NAAQS. We expect that reductions needed to achieve compliance with the 8-hour ozone attainment standard will be implemented in stages and that some or all of
these reductions will be accomplished through implementation of the CAIR. See below for further information regarding CAIR. We believe that compliance with the NO

x

emission reductions requirements under the agreements with the WDNR and EPA will substantially mitigate costs to comply with the EPA’s 8-hour ozone NAAQS. However, the timing of the requirements
may be impacted by requiring earlier installation of NO

x

controls at some units, depending on how the states
implement the rules.

PM

2.5

Standard: In December 2004, the EPA designated PM

2.5

non-attainment areas in the country. All counties in the State of Wisconsin and all counties in the Upper Peninsula of
Michigan were designated as in attainment with the standard. It is unknown at this time whether Wisconsin or Michigan will require additional emission reductions as part of state or regional implementation of the PM

2.5

standard and what impact those requirements would have on operation of our existing coal-fired generation facilities.

Clean Air Interstate Rule:

The EPA issued the final CAIR regulation in
March 2005 to facilitate the states in meeting the 8-hour ozone and PM

2.5

standards by addressing the regional
transport of SO


and NO

x

. CAIR requires NO

x

and SO


emission reductions in two phases from electric generating units located in a 28-state region within the eastern United States. Wisconsin and Michigan
are affected states under CAIR. The phase 1 compliance deadline is January 1, 2009 for NO

x

and January 1,
2010 for SO


, and the phase 2 compliance deadline is January 1, 2015 for both NO

x

and SO


. Overall, the CAIR is expected to result in a 70% reduction in SO


emissions and a 65% reduction in
NO

x

emissions from 2002 emission levels. The states are required to develop and submit implementation plans by no
later than March 2007. In Wisconsin, a final CAIR rule has been approved by the WDNR and is proceeding through the administrative process. Although the impacts are uncertain until the states’ implementation plans are in place, we believe that
compliance with the NO

x

and SO


emission reductions requirements under the agreements with the WDNR and EPA will substantially mitigate costs to comply with the CAIR rule.

Clean Air Mercury Rule:

The EPA issued the final CAMR in March 2005 following the agency’s 2000 regulatory determination that utility mercury
emissions should be regulated. CAMR limits mercury emissions from new and existing coal-fired power plants, and caps utility mercury emission in two phases, applicable in 2010 and 2018. The caps limit emissions at approximately 20% and ultimately
70% below today’s utility mercury levels. The states were required to develop and submit implementation plans by November 2006, but neither state has finalized its plan yet. Until those plans are in place, it is not possible to estimate the
final impact of the CAMR, but additional expenditures are anticipated in order to meet both phases of the federal rule. Because the technology is under


Wisconsin Energy Corporation

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Cont’d)

development, it is difficult to estimate the cost. We believe the range of possible expenditures could be approximately $50 million to
$200 million. The construction air permit issued for the Oak Creek expansion is not impacted by the new rule.

The federal rule is being challenged by
a number of states including Wisconsin and Michigan. Depending on the litigation, the timing for compliance may be affected.

The WDNR independently
developed mercury emission control rules that affect electric utilities in Wisconsin and issued state-only mercury control rules in October 2004. The rules explicitly recognize an underlying state statutory restriction that state regulations
cannot be more stringent than those included in any federal program. The rules state that the WDNR must adopt state rule changes within 18 months of publication of any federal rules. State rules are to be changed to be consistent with, and no more
restrictive than, any federal rules. It is not possible to determine if there will be requirements in addition to CAMR until a rule is in place or the existing rule is set aside. Because the 18 month deadline has passed, we are reviewing our
options.

Clean Air Visibility Rule:

The EPA issued the CAVR in June 2005 to
address regional haze, or regionally-impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area. The rule defines BART requirements for electric generating units and how BART will be addressed in the 28 states subject to EPA’s CAIR. Under
CAVR, states are required to identify certain industrial facilities and power plants that affect visibility in the nation’s 156 Class I protected areas. States then determine the types of emission controls that those facilities must use to
control their emissions. The pollutants from power plants that reduce visibility include particulate matter or compounds that contribute to fine particulate formation, NO

x

, SO


and ammonia. States
must submit plans to implement CAVR to the EPA by December 2007. The reductions associated with the state plans are scheduled to begin to take effect in 2014 with full implementation before 2018. We are currently unable to predict the impact that
CAVR might have on the operations of our existing coal-fired generating facilities until the states develop rules and submit implementation plans to the EPA.

Clean Water Act:

Section 316(b) of the CWA requires that the location, design, construction and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the BTA for minimizing adverse environmental impact. This law dates back
to 1972; however, prior to September 2004, there were no federal rules that defined precisely how states and EPA regions determined that an existing intake met BTA requirements. This rule established, for the first time, national performance
standards and compliance alternatives for existing facilities that are designed to minimize the potential adverse environmental impacts to aquatic organisms associated with water withdrawals from cooling water intakes. Costs associated with
implementation of the rule for Wisconsin Electric’s Oak Creek Power Plant, We Power’s Oak Creek expansion and PWGS have been included in project costs. Studies to determine what costs, if any, that may be associated with Wisconsin
Electric’s other existing facilities are expected to take place over the next two years.

On January 26, 2007, the Federal Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit issued a decision concerning the 316(b) rule for existing facilities (Riverkeeper, Inc. v. EPA, Nos. 04-6692-ag(L) (2d Cir. 2007)). The Second Circuit Court found certain portions of the rule impermissible and remanded several
parts of the rule to the EPA for further consideration or potential additional rulemaking. Until such time as the EPA completes those actions, we cannot predict what impact the changes, if any, to the rule may have on our facilities.

Manufactured Gas Plant Sites:

We are voluntarily reviewing and addressing environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant
sites. For further information, see Note S — Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Ash
Landfill Sites:

We aggressively seek environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for our combustion byproducts. For further information, see Note S — Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

EPA—Proposed Consent Decree:

Wisconsin Electric entered into a proposed consent decree with the EPA to
address all matters relating to information requests received from the EPA pursuant to Section 114(a) of the Clean Air Act. For further information, see Note S — Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Greenhouse Gases:

There have been
international efforts seeking legally binding reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases, principally CO


,
including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change held in Kyoto, Japan. While the Bush Administration has not supported U.S. ratification of the Kyoto Protocol or other legislation requiring reductions in CO


, in 2002, the Bush Administration announced a goal of reducing the greenhouse gas intensity of the U.S. economy by 18% by 2012.
In addition, in December 2004, the DOE announced the Climate VISION program in furtherance of reduced greenhouse gas emissions. We continue to take voluntary measures to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases. However, legislative proposals
that would impose mandatory restrictions on CO


continue to be considered in Congress. The impact of any future
legislation that would require reductions in greenhouse gases cannot be assessed at this time.

We continue to support flexible, market-based strategies to
curb greenhouse gas emissions. These strategies include emissions trading, joint implementation projects and credit for early actions. We also support a voluntary approach that encourages technology development and transfer and includes all sectors
of the economy and all significant global emitters.

Our emissions in future years will continue to be influenced by several actions completed, planned or
underway as part of the PTF strategy, including:

•

Repowering the Port Washington Power Plant from coal to natural gas combined cycle units.

•

Adding coal-fired units using state-of-the-art technology as part of the Oak Creek expansion.

•

Increasing investment in energy efficiency and conservation.

•

Maintaining and increasing non-emitting generation by potentially adding approximately 130 to 200 MW of wind capacity
and increasing customer participation in the Energy for Tomorrow

renewable energy
program.

•

Successful renewal of the Point Beach units’ operating licenses.

LEGAL MATTERS

Arbitration Proceedings

:

Our largest electric customers, two iron ore mines,
operate in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The mines represent approximately 6% to 7% of our annual electric sales; however, the earnings are insignificant to us. The mines have special negotiated contracts that expire in December 2007. The
contracts have price caps for approximately 80% of the energy sales. We do not recognize revenue on amounts billed that exceed the price caps.

The
incremental power costs in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan are now determined by MISO. In April 2005, we began to bill the mines the incremental power costs as quantified by the MISO Midwest Market. The mines have notified us that they are disputing
these billings and a portion of these disputed amounts have been deposited in escrow. In September 2005, the mines notified us that they filed for formal arbitration related to the contracts. We have notified the mines that we believe that they
have failed to comply with certain notification provisions related to annual production as specified within the contracts. The arbitration hearings previously scheduled for October 2006 have been postponed and rescheduled for the third quarter of
2007 and we anticipate a decision in the fourth quarter of 2007. As of December 31, 2006, the mines have placed $29.3 million in escrow. As of December 31, 2005, the mines had placed $70.6 million in escrow. The decrease in the
escrow balance relates to amounts that we refunded without interest for the amounts billed in 2005 that exceeded the price caps. At this time, we are unable to predict the outcome of the formal arbitration process, but we believe that it will not
have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

Although it is currently uncertain, we anticipate that we will provide
power to the mines under the terms of one or more regulated tariffs to be approved by the MPSC beginning January 1, 2008.

Stray
Voltage:

On July 11, 1996, the PSCW issued a final order regarding the stray voltage policies of Wisconsin’s investor-owned utilities. The order clarified the definition of stray voltage, affirmed the level at which
utility action is required, and placed some of the responsibility for this issue in the hands of the customer. Additionally, the order established a uniform stray voltage tariff which delineates utility responsibility and provides for the recovery
of costs associated with unnecessary customer demanded services.

In recent years, dairy farmers have commenced actions or made claims against Wisconsin Electric for loss of milk
production and other damages to livestock allegedly caused by stray voltage, and more recently, ground currents resulting from the operation of its electrical system, even though that electrical system has been operated within the parameters of the
PSCW’s order. In 2003, the Wisconsin Supreme Court upheld a Court of Appeals’ affirmance of a jury verdict against Wisconsin Electric, awarding $1.2 million to the plaintiffs in a stray voltage lawsuit. The Supreme Court rejected the
argument that if a utility company’s measurement of stray voltage is below the PSCW “level of concern,” that utility could not be found negligent in stray voltage cases. Additionally, the Court held that the PSCW regulations regarding
stray voltage were only minimum standards to be considered by a jury in stray voltage litigation.

As a result of this case, claims by dairy farmers for
livestock damage have been based upon ground currents with levels measuring less than the PSCW level of concern. Even though the claims which have been made against Wisconsin Electric with respect to stray voltage and ground currents are not
expected to have a material adverse effect on its financial statements, we continue to evaluate various options and strategies to mitigate this risk.

NUCLEAR OPERATIONS

Point Beach Nuclear Plant:

Wisconsin Electric owns two 518 MW electric generating units
(Unit 1 and Unit 2) at Point Beach in Two Rivers, Wisconsin. Point Beach is operated by NMC, a joint venture of the Company and affiliates of other unaffiliated utilities. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, Point Beach provided approximately
25.3%, 20.0% and 23.7%, respectively, of Wisconsin Electric’s net electric energy supply.

Each unit at Point Beach has a scheduled refueling outage
approximately every 18 months. A refueling outage is scheduled for first quarter 2007. In the fourth quarter of 2006, Unit 2 had a scheduled refueling outage. In 2005, Unit 2 had a scheduled refueling outage over the second and third quarters, and
Unit 1 had a scheduled refueling outage over the third and fourth quarters. During the 2005 scheduled refueling outages we replaced the reactor vessel heads at each unit. As expected, this work, along with other planned maintenance, resulted in
longer than normal outages. During scheduled refueling outages, we incur significant operations and maintenance costs for work performed during the outages and we incur costs associated with replacement power. See Results of Operations for further
discussion regarding the costs associated with nuclear outages. In 2004, Unit 1 had a scheduled refueling outage in the second quarter.

In
December 2005, the NRC approved the request of NMC and Wisconsin Electric for license renewal. The new operating licenses expire in October 2030 for Unit 1 and March 2033 for Unit 2.

In February 2006, we announced that we were undertaking a formal review during 2006 regarding our options for the ownership and operation of Point Beach. At
December 31, 2006, NMC operated six nuclear generating units. In addition, another owner has announced the planned sale of its unit. This sale would further reduce the size of the fleet operated by NMC. Given these changes, we believed it was
prudent to evaluate a range of options for Point Beach. The options that we evaluated included: (1) continued operation by NMC, (2) continued operation by a third party operator other than NMC, (3) a return to in-house operation of
the plant by Wisconsin Electric, (4) a sale of the Point Beach facility and (5) a partial sale of the plant with us retaining a minority interest in the Plant. Under this fifth option, the new majority owner would operate the plant. As
part of our continuing review, we invited qualified third parties to tour Point Beach and review the data necessary to submit a bid to operate the plant or purchase all or part of the plant and operate it. We evaluated the bids received in
comparison to continued operation of Point Beach by NMC or Wisconsin Electric. In December 2006, we announced that we had reached a definitive agreement to sell Point Beach to an affiliate of FPL. If and when the sale is completed (or earlier if an
interim operating agreement with FPL is activated by us) NMC would transfer Point Beach’s operating licenses to the buyer and we would withdraw from NMC and our relationship with NMC would be terminated. We would be required to pay a
termination fee of approximately $12 million to withdraw from NMC and write-off our investment in NMC which is approximately $5 million at December 31, 2006. We also entered into a long-term power purchase agreement to purchase all of the
existing capacity and energy of the plant, which will become effective upon the closing of the sale. Wisconsin Electric will have the unilateral option, subject to PSCW direction, to select a term for the power purchase agreement of either
(i) an estimated 23 years for Unit 1 and 26 years for Unit 2, or (ii) 16 years for Unit 1 and 17 years for Unit 2. The sale of the plant and the long-term power purchase agreement are subject to review and approval by various regulatory
agencies including the NRC, the PSCW, the MPSC and FERC. We have submitted a


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2006 Form 10-K

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Cont’d)

request to the PSCW to defer any gain (net of transaction related costs) as a regulatory liability that would be applied to the benefit of our customers in
future rate proceedings.

In July 2000, our senior management authorized the commencement of initial design work for the power uprate of both units at
Point Beach. Subject to approval by the PSCW, the project could add approximately 90 MW of electrical output to Point Beach. In February 2003, Point Beach completed an equipment upgrade which resulted in a capacity increase of
7 MW per generating unit. If the proposed sale of Point Beach is completed, the uprate will be the responsibility of the new owner, FPL. In light of this, both companies are currently evaluating the timing for implementation of the power
uprate project.

During 2002 and 2003, the NRC issued Final Significance Determination letters for two red (high safety significance) inspection findings
regarding problems identified by Point Beach with the performance of the auxiliary feedwater system recirculation lines. During 2003, the NRC conducted a three-phase supplemental inspection of Point Beach in accordance with NRC Inspection Procedure
95003 to review corrective actions for the findings as well as the effectiveness of the corrective action, emergency preparedness and engineering programs.

The inspection results were presented at a public meeting in December 2003, and documented in a February 2004 NRC letter to NMC. The NRC determined that the plant is being operated in a manner that ensures public safety but also
identified several performance issues in the areas of problem identification and resolution, emergency preparedness, electrical design basis calculation control and engineering-operations communication.

NMC responded to the supplemental inspection in February 2004 with specific commitments to address the NRC concerns, including revision of the Point Beach
Excellence Plan. We were assessed a fine of $60,000 related to issues identified with our emergency preparedness. NRC reviewed the adequacy of the revised Excellence Plan and its implementation, and NMC received a confirmatory action letter in
April 2004. Since then, the NRC has conducted numerous inspections and completed reviews of activities and meetings, noting the overall results were satisfactory. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2006, the NRC closed the confirmatory
action letter and concluded that the red findings received in 2002 and 2003 will no longer be considered in the NRC’s assessment process. Point Beach will now receive routine baseline inspection by the NRC.

As a result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the NRC and the industry have been strengthening security at nuclear power plants. Security at Point Beach
remains at a high level, with limited access to the site continuing. Point Beach has responded to the NRC’s February 2002 Order for interim safeguards and security compensatory measures. Point Beach has also responded to NRC orders regarding
security of independent spent fuel storage installations, design basis threat and security officer training and work hours.

Used Nuclear Fuel
Storage and Disposal:

Wisconsin Electric is authorized by the PSCW to load and store sufficient dry fuel storage containers to allow Point Beach Units 1 and 2 to operate to the end of their original operating licenses, but not
to exceed the original 48-canister capacity of the dry fuel storage facility. The original operating licenses were set to expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2 before they were renewed and extended by the
NRC in December 2005.

Temporary storage alternatives at Point Beach are necessary until the DOE takes ownership of and permanently removes the used fuel
as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established the Nuclear Waste Fund which is composed of payments made by the generators and owners of such waste and fuel. Effective
January 31, 1998, the DOE failed to meet its contractual obligation to begin removing used fuel from Point Beach, a responsibility for which Wisconsin Electric has paid a total of $215.2 million into the Nuclear Waste Fund over the life of
Point Beach.

On August 13, 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a lawsuit brought by Maine Yankee and Northern
States Power Company that the DOE’s failure to begin performance by January 31, 1998 constituted a breach of the Standard Contract, providing clear grounds for filing complaints in the Court of Federal Claims. Consequently, Wisconsin
Electric filed a complaint on November 16, 2000 against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims. In October 2004, the Court of Federal Claims granted Wisconsin Electric’s motion for summary judgment on liability. The Court has
subsequently scheduled a trial to determine damages for September 2007. Wisconsin Electric has incurred substantial damages to date and damages continue to accrue. We are seeking

recovery of our damages in this lawsuit and we expect that any recoveries would be considered in setting future rates.

In July 2002, the President signed a resolution which allowed the DOE to begin preparation of the application to the NRC for a license to design and build a spent fuel
repository in Yucca Mountain, Nevada. In July 2006, the DOE announced plans to submit a license application to the NRC for a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain no later than June 30, 2008. The DOE also announced that if the requested
legislative changes are enacted, the repository would be able to accept spent nuclear fuel starting in early 2017.

It is not possible, at this time, to predict with certainty when the DOE will actually begin accepting used nuclear fuel.

INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND COMPETITION

Electric
Utility Industry

The regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. FERC continues to support large RTOs, which will affect the
structure of the wholesale market. To this end, the MISO implemented a bid-based market, the MISO Midwest Market, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. The MISO Midwest Market commenced operation on
April 1, 2005. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. It is uncertain when retail access might be implemented in
Wisconsin; however, Michigan has adopted retail choice which potentially affects our Michigan operations. In August 2005, President Bush signed into law the Energy Policy Act, which impacts the electric utility industry. (See Other Matters
below for additional information on the Energy Policy Act). In addition, major issues in industry restructuring, implementation of RTO markets and market power mitigation received substantial attention in 2006 and prior years. We continue to focus
on infrastructure issues through our PTF growth strategy.

Restructuring in Wisconsin:

Electric utility revenues in Wisconsin are
regulated by the PSCW. Due to many factors, including relatively competitive electric rates charged by the state’s electric utilities, the PSCW has been focused in recent years on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the State of
Wisconsin. These issues include:

•

Addition of new generating capacity in the state;

•

Modifications to the regulatory process to facilitate development of merchant generating plants;

•

Development of a regional independent electric transmission system operator;

•

Improvements to existing and addition of new electric transmission lines in the state; and

•

Addition of renewable generation.

The PSCW
continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date.

Restructuring in Michigan:

Electric utility revenues are regulated by the MPSC. In June 2000, the Governor of Michigan signed the
“Customer Choice and Electric Reliability Act” into law empowering the MPSC to implement electric retail access in Michigan. The new law provides that as of January 1, 2002, all Michigan retail customers of investor-owned utilities
have the ability to choose their electric power producer.

As of January 1, 2002, our Michigan retail customers were allowed to remain with their
regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We have maintained our generation capacity and distribution assets and provide regulated service as we have in the past. We continue
providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customer’s power supplier.

Competition and customer switching to alternative
suppliers in the companies’ service territories in Michigan has been limited. With the exception of two general inquiries, no alternate supplier activity has occurred in our service territories in Michigan, reflecting the small market area, our
competitive regulated power supply prices and a lack of interest in general in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a market for alternative electric suppliers.

Restructuring in Illinois:

In 1999, the State of Illinois passed legislation that introduced
retail electric choice for large customers and introduced choice for all retail customers in May 2002. This legislation has not had, and is not expected to have a material impact on Wisconsin Electric’s business. Wisconsin Electric had one
wholesale customer in Illinois, the City of Geneva, whose contract expired on December 31, 2005.

Electric Transmission and Energy Markets

ATC:

ATC is regulated by FERC for all rate terms and conditions of service and is a transmission-owning member of MISO. As of
February 1, 2002, operational control of ATC’s transmission system was transferred to MISO, and Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault became non-transmission owning members and customers of MISO.

MISO:

In connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO implemented a bid-based energy market, the MISO Midwest Market, which commenced
operations on April 1, 2005. As part of this energy market, the MISO developed a market-based platform for valuing transmission congestion and losses premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and
mid-Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through the use of FTRs. FTRs are allocated to market participants by MISO. A new allocation of FTRs was completed for the period of
June 1, 2006 through May 31, 2007. We were granted substantially all of the FTRs that we were permitted to request during the allocation process. Previously, our unhedged congestion costs had not been explicitly identified and were
embedded in our fuel and purchased power expenses. Due to certain changes in the units that MISO is dispatching, our unhedged congestion costs increased in 2006. These incremental congestion charges are deferred as approved by the PSCW, and we
expect to recover these costs in future rates, subject to review and approval by the PSCW.

MISO deferred the costs to develop and start-up its energy
market (new software systems and personnel). Now that the market is operational, the development and start-up costs are charged to MISO market participants, including Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault.

To mitigate the risks of this new bid-based energy market, we requested deferral accounting treatment from the PSCW in January 2005 for certain incremental costs or
benefits that may occur due to the implementation of the MISO Midwest Market. Our request excluded LMP energy costs because these costs are subject to recovery under the Wisconsin Fuel Cost Adjustment Procedure. In March 2005, the PSCW accepted
our request. We submitted another joint proposal with other utilities in March 2005, requesting escrow accounting treatment for MISO Midwest Market costs until each utility’s first rate case following April 1, 2008. The purpose
of the March 2005 request for escrow accounting was to provide clarification on costs not included in the March 2005 approval for deferral accounting treatment. The PSCW approved deferral treatment for these costs in June 2006.

In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by LSE’s located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. The current license plate
transmission rate design is scheduled to be replaced on February 1, 2008. A filing delineating a new rate design, or substantiation for maintaining the existing rate design is due at FERC by August 1, 2007. At this time, we are not able to
determine the impact of this rate design change on our transmission costs. FERC also ordered a seams elimination charge to be paid by MISO LSE’s from December 1, 2004 until March 31, 2006, to compensate transmission owners for the
loss of revenues resulting from the joining of a RTO and/or FERC’s elimination of through and out transmission charges between the MISO and PJM. FERC ordered that certain existing transmission transactions continue to pay for through and out
service from December 1, 2004 until March 31, 2006. The details of the seams elimination charge and the quantification of the existing transaction charge are the subject of a hearing process initiated by FERC in a February 2005 order. In
January 2006, Wisconsin Electric along with certain other parties to the proceeding, submitted an offer of settlement to the presiding administrative law judge that resolved all issues set for hearing that impact Wisconsin Electric with regard
to the continued payment of through and out transmission charges as well as the seams elimination charge. The administrative law judge certified the settlement to FERC, and FERC approved the settlement in April 2006.

In April 2006, FERC issued an order determining that MISO had not applied its energy markets tariff correctly in the assessment of Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee
charges. FERC ordered MISO to resettle all affected transactions retroactive to April 1, 2005. In October 2006, we received a ruling from FERC. Since the ruling, FERC’s order has been challenged by MISO and numerous other market
participants. Any resettlement associated with the order is expected in 2007 and early 2008. Due to the complexity of the order, we are unable to precisely determine the

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Cont’d)

overall financial implication to us. However, we do not believe that the result will have a material impact on our results of operations.

MISO is in the process of developing a market for two ancillary services, regulation reserves and contingency reserves. The MISO ancillary services market is currently
proposed to begin in 2008. We currently self-provide both regulation reserves and contingency reserves. In the MISO ancillary services market, we expect that we will buy/sell regulation and contingency reserves from/to the market. The MISO ancillary
services market is expected to reduce overall ancillary services costs in the MISO footprint. We anticipate achieving a net reduction in fuel costs, but are unable to determine the amount of savings we will realize at this time. The MISO ancillary
services market is expected to also enable MISO to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control.

Natural Gas Utility Industry

Restructuring in Wisconsin:

The PSCW previously instituted generic proceedings to consider
how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with
workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, we are
unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position.

OTHER MATTERS

Energy Policy Act:

In August 2005, President Bush signed into law the Energy Policy Act. Among other things, the Energy Policy Act includes tax
subsidies for electric utilities and the repeal of PUHCA 1935. The Energy Policy Act also amends federal energy laws and provides FERC with new oversight responsibilities for the electric utility industry. Implementation of the Energy Policy Act
requires the development of regulations by federal agencies, including FERC. As noted above, the Energy Policy Act and corresponding rules required us to seek FERC authorization to allow Wisconsin Electric to lease from We Power the three PTF units
that are currently being constructed by We Power. We received approval of these leases from FERC in December 2006. Additionally, the Energy Policy Act repealed PUHCA 1935 and enacted PUHCA 2005, transferring jurisdiction over holding
companies from the SEC to FERC. Wisconsin Energy and Wisconsin Electric were exempt holding companies under PUHCA 1935, and, accordingly, were exempt from that law’s provisions other than with respect to certain acquisitions of securities
of a public utility. In March 2006, Wisconsin Energy and Wisconsin Electric each filed with FERC notification of its status as a holding company as required under FERC regulations implementing PUHCA 2005 and a request for exempt status similar
to that held under PUHCA 1935. In June 2006, Wisconsin Energy and Wisconsin Electric received notice from FERC confirming their status as holding companies as required under FERC regulations implementing PUHCA 2005 and granting exempt
status similar to that held under PUHCA 1935. As federal agencies continue to develop new rules to implement the Energy Policy Act, we expect additional impacts on Wisconsin Energy and its subsidiaries in the future.

Pension Reform:

In August 2006, President Bush signed the Pension Protection Act of 2006. We are currently evaluating the Pension Protection Act of
2006, but we do not anticipate it will have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows from operating activities.

Guardian

:

In April 2006, we sold our one-third interest in Guardian to an affiliate of Northern Border Partners, L.P. for approximately $38.5 million. The sale generated an after-tax gain of approximately $1.7
million. Guardian owns an interstate natural gas pipeline from the Joliet, Illinois market hub to southeastern Wisconsin that is designed to serve the growing demand for natural gas in Wisconsin and Northern Illinois. Guardian Pipeline began
commercial operation in early December 2002. We have committed to purchase 650,000 Dth (approximately 87% of the pipeline’s total capacity) per day of capacity on the pipeline over a long-term contract that expires in December 2022.

ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

New Pronouncements:

See Note B — Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for information on new accounting pronouncements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Preparation of financial statements
and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future
events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on
varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment also may have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the
financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.

The following is a list of
accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments.

Regulatory Accounting:

Our utility subsidiaries operate under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed
to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. Under SFAS 71, the actions of our regulators may allow us to defer costs that non-regulated entities would expense. The actions of our regulators may also require us to
accrue liabilities that non-regulated companies would not. As of December 31, 2006, we had $1,091.0 million in regulatory assets and $1,472.1 million in regulatory liabilities. In the future, if we move to market based rates or if the
actions of our regulators change we may conclude that we are unable to follow SFAS 71. In this situation, continued deferral of certain regulatory asset and liability amounts on the utilities’ books, as allowed under SFAS 71, may no longer
be appropriate and the unamortized regulatory assets net of the regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after-tax non-cash charge to earnings. We continually review the applicability of SFAS 71 and have determined that it
is currently appropriate to continue following SFAS 71. In addition, each quarter we perform a review of our regulatory assets and our regulatory environment and we evaluate whether we believe that it is probable that we will recover the
regulatory assets in future rates. See Note C — Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefits:

Our reported costs of providing non-contributory defined pension benefits (described in Note O — Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements) are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the
level of contributions made to plans and earnings on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions,
including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs.

In
accordance with SFAS 87 and SFAS 158, changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining
average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants.

The following chart reflects pension plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a
change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2006 Form 10-K

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Cont’d)

In addition to pension plans, we maintain other post-retirement benefit plans which provide health and life
insurance benefits for retired employees (described in Note O — Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We account for these plans in accordance with SFAS 106. Our reported costs of providing these post-retirement
benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience including employee demographics (age and compensation levels), our contributions to the plans, earnings on plan assets and health care cost trends. Changes made to
the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future post-retirement benefit costs. Other post-retirement benefit costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on
plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the post-retirement benefit obligation and post-retirement costs. Our other post-retirement benefit plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in
actual equity market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased other post-retirement costs in future periods. Similar to accounting for pension plans, the regulators of our utility segment have
adopted SFAS 106 for rate making purposes.

The following chart reflects other post-retirement benefit plan sensitivities associated with changes in
certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.

Unbilled Revenues:

We record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our
customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers
since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage
by class, weather factors, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue
estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2006 of $3,979.0 million included accrued utility revenues of $257.8 million as of December 31, 2006.

Asset Retirement Obligations:

We account for legal liabilities for asset retirements at fair value in the period in which they are incurred according to the provisions of SFAS 143 and
FIN 47. SFAS 143 applies primarily to decommissioning costs for Point Beach included in our utility energy segment. Using a discounted future cash flow methodology, our estimated nuclear asset retirement obligation was approximately
$325.6 million at December 31, 2006. As it relates to our operations, FIN 47 applies primarily to asbestos removal costs. At December 31, 2006, we recorded an obligation of $39.6 million related to asbestos.

Calculation of the nuclear decommissioning asset retirement obligation is based upon projected decommissioning costs calculated by an independent decommissioning
consulting firm, as well as several significant assumptions including the timing of future cash flows, future inflation rates and the discount rate applied to future cash flows. Assuming the following changes in key assumptions and holding all other
assumptions constant, we estimate that our nuclear asset retirement obligation at December 31, 2006 would have changed by the following amounts:


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2006 Form 10-K

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Cont’d)

We were unable to identify a viable market for or third party who would be willing to assume this liability.
Accordingly, we have used a market-risk premium of zero when measuring our nuclear asset retirement obligation. We estimate that for each 1% increment that would be included as a market-risk premium, our nuclear asset retirement obligation would
increase by approximately $3.3 million.

For additional information concerning SFAS 143 and our estimated nuclear asset retirement obligation,
see Note F — Asset Retirement Obligations and Note I — Nuclear Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Deferred Tax Assets Valuation Allowance:

We record deferred tax asset valuation allowances in accordance with SFAS 109. As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately $3.4 million of valuation allowances that
relate to state NOLs of various non-utility subsidiaries. These NOLs begin to expire in 2008 and it is not likely that we will be able to utilize them.

During 2006 and 2005, we reduced our valuation allowances by $5.8 million and $16.3 million respectively, as we were able to conclude that it was likely that we would be able to realize certain state NOLs recorded at certain of the
non-utility subsidiaries in 2006 and at the Parent company in 2005. The 2005 conclusion was based on the favorable decision by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin in June 2005 that allowed the construction of the Oak Creek expansion as part of our PTF
plan.

The PTF generating units will be owned by our subsidiaries organized as LLCs. Once the plants become operational, taxable income or loss of the LLCs
will flow through to and be reported in the separate state income tax return of the Parent. As a result, the Parent no longer expects to generate large state taxable losses if all plants are in service. During 2005, the first of the four generating
units was put into service. The determination of future state taxable income of the Parent is a significant estimate. Factors affecting the estimate include the amounts spent and timing for construction of the PTF generating units, the amount of
debt and interest expense at the Parent and the consideration of available tax planning strategies.

If we would conclude in a future period that it was
more likely than not that some or all of the remaining state NOLs would be realized before expiration, GAAP would require that we reverse the related valuation allowance in that period. Any change to the allowance, as a result of a change in
judgment about the realization of deferred tax assets, is reported as an increase or decrease in income.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

General:

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Wisconsin Energy Corporation (Wisconsin
Energy, the Company, our, we or us), a diversified holding company, as well as our principal subsidiaries in the following operating segments:

•

Utility Energy Segment

— Consisting of Wisconsin Electric, Wisconsin Gas and Edison Sault; engaged primarily in the generation of
electricity and the distribution of electricity and natural gas; and

•

Non-Utility Energy Segment

— Consisting primarily of We Power; engaged principally in the design, development, construction and
ownership of electric power generating facilities for long-term lease to Wisconsin Electric.

Our Corporate and Other segment primarily
includes Wispark, which develops and invests in real estate. We have eliminated all significant intercompany transactions and balances from the consolidated financial statements.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of certain assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Reclassifications:

We have reclassified certain prior year financial statement amounts to conform to their current year
presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on total assets, net income or earnings per share.

Our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows has been
modified to present separately cash flows from continuing operations and cash flows from discontinued operations. Previously, we presented cash flows from continuing operations on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and cash flows from
discontinued operations were presented separately in the notes to the Financial Statements.

Revenues:

We recognize energy revenues on
the accrual basis and include estimated amounts for services rendered but not billed.

Our retail electric rates in Wisconsin are established by the PSCW
and include base amounts for fuel and purchase power costs. The electric fuel rules in Wisconsin allow us to request rate increases if fuel and purchased power costs exceed bands established by the PSCW. In a rate order issued in January 2006,
the PSCW approved a plan to refund any over-collected fuel on an annual basis for 2006. For 2007, the band is plus or minus 2%.

Our retail gas rates
include monthly adjustments which permit the recovery or refund of actual purchased gas costs. We defer any difference between actual gas costs incurred (adjusted for a sharing mechanism) and costs recovered through rates as a current asset or
liability. The deferred balance is returned to or recovered from customers at intervals throughout the year.

Accounting for MISO Energy
Transactions:

MISO implemented the MISO Midwest Market on April 1, 2005. The MISO Midwest Market operates under both day-ahead and real-time markets. We record energy transactions in the MISO on a net basis for each hour.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Cont'd)

Other Income and Deductions, Net:

We recorded the following items in Other Income and Deductions, net for the years ended December 31:

Property and Depreciation:

We record property, plant and equipment at cost. Cost
includes material, labor, overheads and capitalized interest. Utility property also includes AFUDC - Equity. Additions to and significant replacements of property are charged to property, plant and equipment at cost; minor items are charged to
maintenance expense. The cost of depreciable utility property less salvage value is charged to accumulated depreciation when property is retired.

We had
the following property in service by segment at December 31:

We include capitalized software costs associated with our utility energy segment under the caption “Property,
Plant and Equipment” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the net book value of regulated capitalized software totaled $17.8 million and $22.3 million, respectively. The net book value of other
capitalized software was approximately $1.7 million and $2.4 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The estimated useful life of our capitalized software is 5 years.

Our utility depreciation rates are certified by the state regulatory commissions and include estimates for salvage value and removal costs. Depreciation as a percent of
average depreciable utility plant was 3.7% in 2006, 3.9% in 2005 and 4.0% in 2004. Nuclear plant decommissioning costs are accrued and included in depreciation expense (see Note I). The decline in depreciation as a percent of average
depreciable utility plant was due to new depreciation rates approved by the PSCW, which became effective January 1, 2006.

For assets other than our
regulated assets, we accrue depreciation expense at straight-line rates over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives for non-regulated assets are 3 to 40 years for furniture and equipment, 2 to 5 years for software and 30 to
40 years for buildings.

Our regulated utilities collect in their rates amounts representing future removal costs for many assets that do not have an
associated ARO. We record a regulatory liability on our balance sheet for the estimated amounts we have collected in rates for future removal costs less amounts we have spent in removal activities. This regulatory liability was $630.6 million as of
December 31, 2006 and $604.2 million as of December 31, 2005.

We recorded the following CWIP by segment at December 31:

Allowance For Funds Used During Construction - Regulated:

AFUDC is included in utility plant
accounts and represents the cost of borrowed funds (AFUDC - Debt) used during plant construction and a return on stockholders’ capital (AFUDC - Equity) used for construction purposes. AFUDC - debt is recorded as a
reduction of interest expense and AFUDC - Equity is recorded in Other Income, net.

During
2006, Wisconsin Electric accrued AFUDC at a rate of 8.94%, as authorized by the PSCW. During 2005 and 2004, the authorized rate was 10.18%. Wisconsin Electric accrues AFUDC on all electric utility NO

remediation projects. Wisconsin Electric’s rates were set to provide a full return on electric safety and reliability projects so AFUDC is not accrued on these projects. Wisconsin Electric accrued AFUDC on 50% of the remaining electric, gas and
steam projects in CWIP and rates were set assuming that 50% of the CWIP balances were included in rate base.

During 2006, Wisconsin Gas accrued AFUDC at a
rate of 11.31%, as authorized by the PSCW. During 2005 and 2004, the authorized rate was 10.32%. Wisconsin Gas accrued AFUDC on specific large construction projects during 2005 and 2004. During 2006, Wisconsin Gas accrued AFUDC on 50% of CWIP
balances.

Our regulated segment recorded the following AFUDC for the years ended December 31:

Capitalized Interest and Carrying Costs - Non-Regulated Energy:

As part of the construction of
the power plants under our PTF program, we capitalize interest during construction in accordance with SFAS 34. Under the lease agreements associated with our PTF power plants, we are able to collect from utility customers the carrying costs
associated with the construction of these power plants. We defer these carrying costs collected on our balance sheet and they will be amortized to revenue over the individual lease term. For further information on the accounting for capitalized
interest and deferred carrying costs associated with the construction of our PTF power plants, see Note E.

Earnings Per Common
Share:

We compute basic earnings per common share by dividing our net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per common share reflect the potential reduction in earnings per common share
that could occur when potentially dilutive common shares are added to common shares outstanding.

We derive our potentially dilutive common shares by
calculating the number of shares issuable relating to stock options utilizing the treasury stock method. The future issuance of shares underlying the outstanding stock options depends on whether the exercise prices of the stock options are less than
the average market price of the common shares for the respective periods. Shares that are anti-dilutive are not included in the calculation.

Materials, Supplies and Inventories:

Our inventory at December 31 consists of:

Substantially all fossil fuel, materials and supplies and natural gas in storage inventories are recorded using
the weighted-average method of accounting.

Regulatory Accounting:

Our utility energy segment accounts for its regulated operations in
accordance with SFAS 71. This statement sets forth the application of GAAP to those companies whose rates are determined by an independent third-party regulator. The economic effects of regulation can result in regulated companies recording
costs that have been or are expected to be allowed in the rate making process in a period different from the period in which the costs would be charged to expense by an unregulated enterprise. When this occurs, costs are deferred as assets in the
balance sheet (regulatory assets) and recorded as expenses in the periods when those same amounts are reflected in rates. We defer all of our regulatory assets pursuant to specific orders or by a generic order issued by our primary regulator.
Additionally, regulators can impose liabilities upon a regulated company for amounts previously collected from customers and for amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers (regulatory liabilities). We expect to recover our outstanding
regulatory assets in rates over a period of no longer than 20 years. For further information, see Note C.

Derivative Financial
Instruments:

We have derivative physical and financial instruments as defined by SFAS 133 which we report at fair value. However, our use of financial instruments is limited. For further information, see Note J.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash and cash equivalents include marketable debt securities acquired three months or less from maturity.

We have nuclear decommissioning trusts that hold investments in debt and equity securities. All assets within the nuclear decommissioning trusts are
restricted to nuclear decommissioning activities as set forth by regulations promulgated by the IRS and by the PSCW. The accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows includes proceeds from investments within the nuclear decommissioning trusts
and purchases of investments within the nuclear decommissioning trusts.

Margin Accounts:

Cash deposited in brokerage accounts for
margin requirements is recorded in Other Current Assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Asset Retirement Obligations:

We adopted
SFAS 143 effective January 1, 2003. We adopted FIN 47 effective December 31, 2005. FIN 47 defines the term conditional ARO as used in SFAS 143. As defined in FIN 47, a conditional ARO refers to a legal
obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. Consistent with SFAS 143, we record a liability at
fair value for a legal ARO in the period in which it is incurred. When a new legal obligation is recorded, we capitalize the costs of the liability by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. We accrete the liability to its
present value each period and depreciate the capitalized cost over the useful life of the related asset. At the end of the asset’s useful life, we settle the obligation for its recorded amount or incur a gain or loss. As it relates to our
regulated operations, we apply SFAS 71 and recognize regulatory assets or liabilities for the timing differences between when we recover legal AROs in rates and when we would recognize these costs under SFAS 143. For further information,
see Note F.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets:

We account for goodwill and other intangible assets following SFAS 142, effective January 1, 2002. As of
December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had $441.9 million of goodwill recorded at the utility energy segment, which related to our acquisition of Wisconsin Gas in 2000.

Under SFAS 142, goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives are not subject to amortization. However, goodwill and other intangibles are subject to fair value-based rules for measuring impairment, and
resulting write-downs, if any, are to be reflected in operating expense. We assess the fair value of our SFAS 142 reporting unit by considering future discounted cash flows, a comparison of fair value based on public company trading multiples,
and merger and acquisition transaction multiples for similar companies. This evaluation utilizes the information available under the circumstances, including reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections. We perform our annual impairment
test for the reporting unit as of August 31. There was no impairment to the recorded goodwill balance as of our annual 2006 impairment test date for our reporting unit.

Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets:

We carry property, equipment and goodwill related to businesses held for sale at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less costs to sell. As of
December 31, 2006, we had no assets classified as Held for Sale. Consistent with SFAS 144, long-lived assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be
recoverable from the use and eventual disposition of the asset based on the remaining useful life. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the asset. The carrying amount
of an asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. An impairment loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset in comparison
to the fair value of the asset. For further information, see Note D.

Investments:

We account for investments in other affiliated
companies in which we do not maintain control using the equity method. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had a total ownership interest of approximately 29.4% and 33.5%, in ATC. We are represented by one out of ten ATC board members, each of
whom has one vote. Due to the voting requirements, no individual member has more than 10% of the voting control. For further information regarding such investments, see Note R.

Income Taxes:

We follow the liability method in accounting for income taxes as prescribed by SFAS 109. SFAS 109 requires the recording of deferred assets and liabilities to recognize the
expected future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in our financial statements or tax returns and the adjustment of deferred tax balances to reflect tax rate changes. We are required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax
assets would expire before being realized. We have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets. GAAP requires that, if we conclude in a future period that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax
assets would be realized before expiration, we reverse the related valuation allowance in that period. Any change to the allowance, as a result of a change in judgment about the realization of deferred tax assets, is reported in income tax expense.

Tax credits associated with regulated operations are deferred and amortized over the life of the assets. We file a consolidated Federal income tax return.
Accordingly, we allocate Federal current tax expense benefits and credits to our subsidiaries based on their separate tax computations. For further information, see Note H.

We recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in Income Taxes in our Consolidated Income Statements, as well as Regulatory Assets or Regulatory Liabilities in our Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

We collect sales and use taxes from our customers and remit these taxes to governmental authorities. These taxes are recorded in our
Consolidated Income Statements on a net basis.

Stock Options:

Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS 123R, using the
modified prospective method. We use a binomial pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted subsequent to December 31, 2005. Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for share based compensation under APB 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and we disclosed the pro forma impact of share based compensation expense under SFAS 123. Historically, all stock options have been granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of
the common stock on the date of grant and expire no later than ten years from the grant date. Accordingly, no compensation expense was recognized in connection with option grants. All options granted subsequent to December 31, 2004 vest on a
cliff-basis after a three year period. Prior to January 1, 2006, we reported benefits of tax deductions in


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2006 Form 10-K

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Cont'd)

excess of recognized compensation costs as operating cash flows. SFAS 123R requires that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as an
operating cash inflow. In addition, we previously recorded unearned stock-based compensation for non-vested restricted stock and performance share awards as “unearned compensation” in our Consolidated Statements of Common Equity. For
further discussion of this new standard and the impacts to our Consolidated Financial Statements, see Note J.

We previously adopted the disclosure
provisions of SFAS 123 as amended by SFAS 148. The fair value of our stock options at date of grant for 2006 was calculated using a binomial option-pricing model. For 2005 and 2004, the fair value of options at the date of grant was
estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:

As described more fully in the following table, our diluted earnings would have been reduced by $0.02 and $0.24
per share, respectively, had we expensed the 2005 and 2004 grants for stock-based compensation plans under SFAS 123. In 2004, the pro forma expense increased, in part, due to the effect of accelerating the vesting of stock options, which
resulted in a pro forma expense of $0.16 per share. For further information regarding equity based compensation, see Note J.

Nuclear Fuel Amortization:

We amortize our nuclear fuel inventory to fuel expense as the power
is generated, generally over a period of 60 months.

B — RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Share Based
Compensation:

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123R. In March 2005, the SEC issued SAB 107 regarding the SEC’s interpretation of SFAS 123R and the valuation of share-based payment for public companies.
This statement requires that the compensation costs relating to such transactions be recognized in the consolidated income statement. We adopted SFAS 123R and SAB 107 effective January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective
method. For additional information, see Note J.

Implicit Variable Interests:

In April 2006, the FASB issued
FSP FIN 46R-6. FSP FIN 46R-6 addresses the requirement to determine the variability to be considered in applying FIN 46R-6 based on an analysis of the design of the entity. As required, we adopted FSP FIN 46R-6
effective July 1, 2006 for any new arrangements entered into after the effective date. For further information, see Note G.

Uncertainty in Income Taxes:

In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, an interpretation of SFAS 109. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the enterprise’s
financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. We adopted FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007. For further information, see Note H.

Fair Value Measurements:

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157. SFAS 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. SFAS 157 defines fair value, provides a framework for
measuring fair value and expands disclosures related to fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently evaluating the provisions of
SFAS 157 and we expect to adopt SFAS 157 on January 1, 2008.

Pension and Other Post-retirement Plans:

In September
2006, the FASB issued SFAS 158, an amendment of SFAS 87, 88, 106 and 132R. SFAS 158 requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit post-retirement plan as an asset or liability on the balance sheet
and recognition of changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income. SFAS 158 also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end balance sheet. We
adopted SFAS 158 as of December 31, 2006. For further information, see Note O.

Financial Statement Errors:

In
September 2006, the SEC staff issued SAB 108. SAB 108 addresses the diversity in practice by registrants when quantifying the effect of an error on the financial statements. SAB 108 provides guidance on the consideration of the
effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements. We adopted the provisions of SAB 108 effective December 31, 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have any financial impact on our consolidated
financial statements.

C — REGULATORY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

Our utility energy segment accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with SFAS 71.

Our primary regulator
considers our regulatory assets and liabilities in two categories, escrowed and deferred. In escrow accounting we expense amounts that are included in rates. If actual costs exceed, or are less than the amounts that are allowed in rates, the
difference in cost is escrowed on the balance sheet as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability and the escrowed balance is considered in setting future rates. Under deferred cost accounting, we defer amounts to our balance sheet based upon
specific orders or correspondence with our primary regulator. These deferred costs will be considered in future rate setting proceedings. As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately $55.0 million of net regulatory assets that were not
earning a return.


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2006 Form 10-K

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Cont'd)

Our regulatory assets and liabilities as of December 31 consist of:

As of December 31, 2005, we recorded a minimum pension liability to reflect the funded status of our pension
plans (see Note O). Under SFAS 158, which we adopted effective December 31, 2006, we have concluded that substantially all of the unrecognized costs resulting from the recognition of the funded status of our pension and OPEB plans
qualify as a regulatory asset.

Our regulated subsidiaries record deferred regulatory assets and liabilities representing the future expected impact of
deferred taxes on utility revenues (see Note A).

In October 2002, the PSCW issued an order authorizing Wisconsin Electric to implement a
surcharge for recovery of annual electric transmission costs projected through 2005. In addition, the PSCW order authorized escrow accounting treatment for transmission costs.

As of December 31, 2006, we have deferred $79.1 million of fuel related costs. The majority of these deferred costs were incurred in 2005 as a result of an extended outage at Point Beach, increased costs
associated with reduced coal deliveries due to a railroad transportation problem and increased costs associated with the MISO Midwest Market.

Consistent
with a generic order from and past rate-making practices of the PSCW, we defer as a regulatory asset costs associated with the remediation of former manufactured gas plant sites. As of December 31, 2006, we have recorded $68.2 million of
environmental costs associated with manufactured gas plant sites as a regulatory asset, including $37.7 million of deferrals for actual remediation costs incurred and a $30.5 million accrual for estimated future site remediation (See
Note S). In addition, we have deferred $8.8 million of insurance recoveries associated with the environmental costs as regulatory liabilities. We included total actual remediation costs incurred net of the related insurance recoveries in
our 2006 rate case. We began amortizing these costs upon receiving PSCW approval in January 2006. The amortization period for these costs is five years.

As part of our PTF strategy, the PSCW approved the retirement and removal of the Port Washington Power Plant coal units to make way for construction of gas-fired facilities. In a September 27, 2003 order, the PSCW authorized
transferring the undepreciated costs and related removal amounts to a regulatory asset account. The escrowed unrecovered plant costs totaled $31.6 million at December 31, 2006.


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2006 Form 10-K

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Cont'd)

As of December 31, 2006, we have $57.0 million of escrowed bad debt costs. In 2005 and 2004, the PSCW approved our request to account for residential bad debt
costs on an escrow basis at Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Electric whereby they defer actual bad debt write-offs that exceed amounts allowed in rates, and that treatment continued through 2006.

In connection with the WICOR acquisition, we recorded the funded status of the Wisconsin Gas pension and post-retirement medical plans at fair value at the acquisition
date. Due to the expected regulatory treatment of these items, we record a regulatory liability (Deferred pension) that is being amortized over an average remaining service life of 15 years ending 2015.

D — ASSET SALES, DIVESTITURES AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

Minergy Neenah:

Effective September 27, 2006, we sold 100% of the membership interest in Minergy Neenah to a third party. The primary assets of Minergy Neenah were a Glass Aggregate plant and related operating
contracts. The plant recycled paper sludge from area paper mills into renewable energy and glass aggregate using our patented Glass Aggregate technology. The largest source of revenue for Minergy Neenah had been a long-term steam contract with an
adjacent paper mill. The mill was permanently closed as of June 30, 2006. Pursuant to the steam contract, the mill owner paid Minergy Neenah a contract termination payment. In the third quarter of 2006, we received gross proceeds from the sale
of the plant and the contract termination totaling $12.2 million and we recorded a net loss of $0.4 million that is included in Income from Discontinued Operations, net of tax. Previously, in the third quarter of 2004, we concluded the
asset was impaired and recorded a non-cash asset valuation charge of $27.0 million ($17.6 million after tax).

Wisvest -
Calumet:

Effective May 31, 2005, we sold our Calumet facility for approximately $37.0 million in cash to Tenaska Power Fund, L.P. The primary assets of Calumet were a 308 MW natural gas-fired peaking power facility in
Chicago, Illinois and related operating contracts. The transaction generated an after tax gain of approximately $4.7 million upon closing and generated approximately $32.0 million in cash tax benefits. In the third quarter of 2004, we
concluded that this asset was impaired and recorded a non-cash asset valuation charge of $122.0 million ($79.3 million after tax).

Manufacturing Segment:

Effective July 31, 2004, we sold WICOR, Inc. to Pentair, Inc. and received cash proceeds of $857 million, and Pentair, Inc. assumed approximately $25 million of third party debt.

WICOR’s only asset at the time of the sale consisted of its interest in WICOR Industries. As a condition of the sale, WICOR transferred its ownership
of Wisconsin Gas to Wisconsin Energy through a stock redemption. Prior to the transaction, Wisconsin Gas converted from a corporation to a limited liability company (collectively the “Wisconsin Gas transfer”). We expect the final
determination of cash taxes to be approximately $105 million as a result of the stock redemption described above. However, we also expect to receive future tax deductions from a step-up in the tax basis of the Wisconsin Gas assets as a result
of the Wisconsin Gas transfer. We therefore expect that substantially all of the cash taxes paid on the stock redemption will be recovered as deferred income tax assets through future deductions.

In accordance with SFAS 144, we have reclassified the assets and liabilities of Minergy Neenah as Assets held for sale in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Total assets held for sale for Minergy Neenah were $17.4 million at December 31, 2005. In addition, we have recorded the operating results of Minergy Neenah, Calumet and the Manufacturing Segment as Income from Discontinued Operations, Net
of Tax in the accompanying Consolidated Income Statements for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Previously, Minergy Neenah’s results were included in corporate and other and the Calumet operations were included in the
non-utility energy segment. See below for a summary of the components of Discontinued Operations in our Consolidated Income Statements.

E—ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING FOR POWER THE
FUTURE GENERATING UNITS

Background:

As part of our PTF strategy, our non-utility subsidiary, We Power, is building four new generating
units that will be leased to our utility subsidiary, Wisconsin Electric, under long-term leases that have been approved by the PSCW, our primary regulator. The leases are designed to recover the capital costs of the plant including a return. The
first of the four generating units was placed in service in July 2005 and is being leased to Wisconsin Electric. Wisconsin Electric will be responsible for all of the operating costs, including fuel, of the PTF units once they are placed in
service and we anticipate that we will recover the operating costs of these plants in rates. The accompanying consolidated financial statements eliminate all intercompany transactions between We Power and Wisconsin Electric, and reflect the cash
inflows from Wisconsin Electric customers and the cash outflows to our vendors and suppliers. The PTF units include PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2.

During Construction:

Under the terms of each lease, we collect in current rates amounts representing our pre-tax cost of capital (debt and equity) associated with capital expenditures for the PTF units. Our pre-tax cost of
capital is approximately 14%. The carrying costs that we collect in rates are recorded as deferred revenue, and they will be amortized to revenue over the term of each lease, once the respective unit is placed into service. During the construction
of the PTF units, we capitalize interest costs at an overall weighted-average pre-tax cost of interest of approximately 6%. Capitalized interest is included in the total cost of the PTF units.

Cash Flows:

The following table identifies key pre-tax cash outflows and inflows related to the
construction of our PTF units for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 and compares it to total WEC.

Balance Sheet:

As noted above, we collect in current rates carrying costs that are calculated based
on the cash expenditures included in CWIP multiplied by our pre-tax cost of capital (approximately 14%). The carrying costs are recorded as deferred revenue and included in Other long-term liabilities. Our total CWIP balance includes cash
expenditures, capitalized interest and accruals. The following table identifies key amounts related to our PTF units that are recorded on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2006 and 2005:

Income Statement:

Once the PTF units are placed in service, we will recover in rates the
lease costs which reflect the authorized cash construction cost of the units plus a return. The authorized cash costs are established by the PSCW. The authorized cash costs exclude capitalized interest since carrying costs are recovered during the
construction of the units. The lease payments are expected to be levelized, except that OC 1 and OC 2 will be recovered on a levelized basis that has a one time 10.6% escalation after the first 5 years of the leases. The leases

(Cont’d)

established a set return on equity component of 12.7% after tax. The interest component of the return is determined up to 180 days prior to the date that the
units are placed in service.

We recognize revenues related to the lease payments that are included in our rates. In addition, our revenues will include
the amortization of the deferred revenues that reflect the carrying costs that are collected during construction. The deferred revenue will be amortized on a straight line basis over the lease term. We will depreciate the units on a straight line
basis over their expected service life.

In July 2005, PWGS 1 was placed in service. This asset had a cost of approximately $364.3 million which
included approximately $31.1 million of capitalized interest. The asset is being depreciated over its estimated useful life of approximately 37 years. The cost of the plant, plus a return, is expected to be recovered through Wisconsin
Electric’s rates over a 25 year period at an annual amount of approximately $48 million.

SFAS 143 primarily applies to the future decommissioning costs for Point Beach. Prior to January 2003, we
recorded a long-term liability for accrued nuclear decommissioning costs. See Note I for further information about the nuclear decommissioning of Point Beach, including our investments in nuclear decommissioning trusts that are restricted to
nuclear decommissioning.

In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47. FIN 47 defines a conditional asset retirement obligation as a legal
obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. We adopted FIN 47 effective
December 31, 2005. At adoption, we recorded additional asset retirement obligations related to asbestos removal costs.

The adoption of
FIN 47 had no impact on our net income in 2006 or 2005. As it relates to our regulated operations, we apply SFAS 71 and recognize regulatory assets or liabilities for the timing differences between when we recover legal asset retirement
obligations in rates and when we would recognize these costs under FIN 47. This treatment is consistent with the adoption of SFAS 143 for our regulated operations.

G — VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

Under FIN 46 and FIN 46R, the primary beneficiary of a variable interest
entity must consolidate the related assets and liabilities.

We continue to evaluate our tolling and purchased power agreements with third parties on a
quarterly basis. After making an exhaustive effort, we concluded that for three of these agreements, we are unable to obtain the information necessary to determine whether these entities are variable interest entities. Pursuant to the terms of two
of the three agreements, we deliver fuel to the entity’s facilities and receive electric power. We pay the entity a “toll” to convert our fuel into the electric energy. The output of the facility is available for us to dispatch during
the term of the respective agreement. In the other agreement, we have rights to the firm capacity of the entity’s facility. We have approximately $603.0 million of required payments over the remaining term of these three agreements,

(Cont’d)

which expire over the next 16 years. We believe the required payments will continue to be recoverable in rates. We account for one of these agreements
as a capital lease.

In April 2006, the FASB issued FSP FIN 46R-6. As required, we adopted FSP FIN 46R-6 effective July 1,
2006 for any new arrangements entered into after the effective date. Although the adoption of FSP FIN 46R-6 did not have a material financial impact in the current period, we currently are unable to determine the potential impact in future
periods.

H — INCOME TAXES

table is a summary of income tax expense for each of the years ended December 31:

The provision for income taxes for each of the years ended December 31 differs from the amount of income tax
determined by applying the applicable U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to income before income taxes as a result of the following:

liabilities at December 31 are as follows:

Consistent with ratemaking treatment, deferred taxes are offset in the above table for temporary differences which
have related regulatory assets or liabilities.

As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had recorded $3.4 million and $11.8 million of
valuation allowances primarily related to the uncertainty of our ability to benefit from state loss carryforwards in the future. In connection with the favorable decision by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin in June 2005 to uphold the CPCN granted
by the PSCW for the construction of the Oak Creek expansion, we have concluded that it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize certain tax benefits associated with state net operating losses of the Parent that have been carried
forward from prior years. As such, in 2006 and 2005 we reversed $5.8 million and $16.3 million of

valuation allowances associated with the state tax net operating losses that have been carried forward to future
years. The remaining state loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2008 and have been reduced by a valuation allowance.

In July 2006, the FASB
issued FIN 48, an interpretation of SFAS 109. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 provides
clarification on the accounting for income taxes by setting forth a minimum recognition threshold an uncertain tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on
de-recognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We adopted FIN 48 effective
January 1, 2007. As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, we estimate that the cumulative effect on retained earnings is immaterial.

I
— NUCLEAR OPERATIONS

Point Beach Nuclear Plant:

We own two 518 MW electric generating units at Point Beach in Two Rivers,
Wisconsin. NMC operates the units on our behalf. The units were placed in service in the early 1970’s and the original operating licenses were effective through 2010 and 2013. In December 2005, the NRC renewed the operating licenses through
October 2030 for Unit 1 and March 2033 for Unit 2.

Proposed Sale of Point Beach:

In December 2006, we announced
that Wisconsin Electric signed a definitive agreement with an affiliate of FPL to sell Point Beach for approximately $998 million, subject to closing price adjustments. Under the terms of the sale, the buyer would assume the obligation to
decommission the plant, and we would transfer assets in a qualified trust for decommissioning. We would retain assets in a non-qualified decommissioning trust. Wisconsin Electric also entered into a long-term power purchase agreement to purchase all
of the existing capacity and energy of the plant, which will become effective upon closing of the sale. Wisconsin Electric will have the unilateral option, subject to PSCW direction, to select a term for the power purchase agreement of either
(i) an estimated 23 years for Unit 1 and 26 years for Unit 2, or (ii) 16 years for Unit 1 and 17 years for Unit 2. The sale of the plant and the long-term power purchase agreement are subject to review and approval by various regulatory
agencies including the NRC, PSCW, MPSC and FERC. We anticipate closing the sale during the third quarter of 2007. We have submitted a request to the PSCW to defer any gain (net of transaction related costs) as a regulatory liability that would be
applied to the benefit of our customers in future rate proceedings.

Nuclear Insurance:

The Price-Anderson Act currently limits the
total public liability for damages arising from a nuclear incident at a nuclear power plant to approximately $10.8 billion, of which $300 million is covered by liability insurance purchased from private sources. The remaining
$10.5 billion is covered by an industry retrospective loss sharing plan whereby, in the event of a nuclear incident resulting in damages exceeding the private insurance coverage, each owner of a nuclear plant would be assessed a deferred
premium of up to $100.6 million per reactor with a limit of $15 million per reactor within one calendar year. We have two reactors. We are obligated to pay our proportionate share of any such assessment as long as we own Point Beach.

Wisconsin Electric, through its membership in NEIL, carries decontamination, property damage and decommissioning shortfall insurance covering losses of up
to $2.1 billion at Point Beach. Under policies issued by NEIL, the insured member may be liable for a retrospective premium in the event of catastrophic losses exceeding the full financial resources of NEIL. Wisconsin Electric’s maximum
retrospective liability under the above policies is $17.8 million.

Wisconsin Electric also maintains insurance with NEIL through which it can recover
up to $3.5 million per week, subject to a total limit of $490 million, during any prolonged outage at Point Beach caused by accidental property damage. Wisconsin Electric’s maximum retrospective liability under this policy is
$9.8 million.

It should not be assumed that, in the event of a major nuclear incident, any insurance or statutory limitation of liability would
protect Wisconsin Electric from material adverse impact.

Nuclear Decommissioning:

We record decommissioning expense in amounts equal to
the amounts collected in rates and funded to the external trusts. Nuclear decommissioning costs are accrued over the expected service lives

of the nuclear generating units and are included in electric rates. Decommissioning funding was $17.6 million for each of the years ended 2006, 2005 and
2004. As of December 31, 2006, our non-qualified investments were $303.7 million and our qualified investments were $577.9 million. We had the following investments in Nuclear Decommissioning Trusts, stated at fair value as of December 31,
2006 and 2005:

As of December 31, 2006, approximately 66.5% of the trust funds were invested in equity securities and 33.5%
were invested in debt securities. In accordance with SFAS 115 Wisconsin Electric’s debt and equity security investments in the trusts are classified as available for sale. Gains and losses on the fund are determined on the basis of
specific identification; net unrealized gains on the fund are recorded as part of the fund. Our investments in the trusts are recorded at fair value and we are allowed regulatory treatment for the fair value adjustment. Realized gains and losses for
the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 were as follows:

Total gains and total losses by security type for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 were as follows:

The PSCW requires us to perform periodic
Decommissioning Cost Studies to evaluate the funded status of our Nuclear Decommissioning Trusts as compared with the estimated costs to perform the decommissioning work. In June 2005, we filed a new Decommissioning Cost Study with the PSCW.
The study was performed by an outside consultant and it included several assumptions as to the timing and scope of the decommissioning work. This study estimated that the cost to decommission the plant would be $712.5 million in 2004 dollars. A
prior study had estimated the cost to be $1.1 billion in 2003 dollars. The reduction in the estimated cost to decommission the plant was driven by several factors, including the timing and the scope of the work to be performed.

The June 2005 Decommissioning Cost Study was also used to estimate our ARO for nuclear decommissioning. We record an ARO for future decommissioning costs based upon the
net present value of the expected cash flows


Wisconsin Energy Corporation

associated with our legal obligation to decommission our plants. Under SFAS 143, certain costs included in the June 2005 Decommissioning Cost Study
that related to fuel management and non-nuclear demolition were excluded from the ARO calculation. Using the June 2005 study, our estimated costs for decommissioning, following SFAS 143, were $473.2 million. Our ARO for nuclear
decommissioning as of December 31, 2006 was $325.6 million.

We recover decommissioning costs in our regulated rates. We have established a
regulatory liability to reflect the difference between nuclear decommissioning costs recovered in rates and cumulative investment gains (our nuclear decommissioning trust investments) in comparison to the ARO for nuclear decommissioning that is
calculated under SFAS 143. For further information on AROs, see Note F.

The ultimate timing and amount of future cash flows associated with
nuclear decommissioning is dependent upon many significant variables including the scope of work involved, the ability to relicense the plants in the future, future inflation rates and discount rates. Because of our announced agreement to sell Point
Beach to an affiliate of FPL, we do not expect to remain obligated to decommission Point Beach if the sale is consummated. However, if that sale is not completed, based on the license renewal received by the NRC in December 2005, we do not
expect to make any significant nuclear decommissioning expenditures before the year 2030.

Decontamination and Decommissioning
Fund:

The Energy Policy Act of 1992 established a D&D Fund for the DOE’s nuclear fuel enrichment facilities. Deposits to the D&D Fund are derived in part from special assessments on utilities using enrichment services. In
October 2006, a final payment was made to the DOE. As a result, a liability no longer exists for this fund. The deferred regulatory asset will be amortized to nuclear fuel expense and included in utility rates through September 2007.

J — COMMON EQUITY

Share-Based Compensation
Plans:

We have a plan that was approved by stockholders that enables us to provide a long-term incentive through equity interests in Wisconsin Energy, to outside directors, selected officers and key employees of the Company. The plan
provides for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards and performance shares. Awards may be paid in common stock, cash or a combination thereof. All share-based compensation is fulfilled by purchases on the
open market and do not dilute shareholders’ ownership.

The following is a summary of our stock options issued through December 31, 2006:

The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding at December 31, 2006:

Aggregate Intrinsic Value (Millions)

Options Outstanding

Options Exercisable

December 31, 2006

$130.8

$103.2

In January 2007, the Compensation Committee awarded 1,371,590 non-qualified stock options at the average
market price of $47.76 to our officers and key employees under its normal schedule of awarding long-term incentive compensation.

We utilize the
straight-line attribution method for recognizing stock-based compensation expense under SFAS 123R. We recorded compensation expense, net of tax, for stock option awards made to our officers and other key employees of $4.6 million
($0.04 per share) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006.

The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the twelve
months ended December 31, 2006 was approximately $21.1 million. Tax benefits associated with our stock option awards for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 were $8.4 million.

The exercise price of a stock option under the plan is to be no less than 100% of the common stock’s fair market value on the grant date and options may not be
exercised within six months of the grant date except in the event of a change in control. In December 2004, the Compensation Committee approved the acceleration of vesting of all unvested options awarded to officers and other key employees in 2002,
2003 and 2004. In addition, the Compensation Committee determined that future option grants would be non-qualified stock options and they would vest on a cliff-basis after a three year period. The stock options that were granted prior to 2005
generally vest on a straight line basis over a four year period. Generally, options expire no later than ten years from the date of grant. In 2004, we recorded a $0.4 million charge, net of tax, in connection with the accelerated vesting of
unvested stock options. For further information regarding the accounting changes related to stock based compensation, see Note A and Note B.

On
December 31, 2005, the value of our non-vested stock options outstanding was $11.3 million, or $8.30 per share on a weighted average grant date fair value basis. On December 31, 2006 the value of our non-vested stock options outstanding
was $20.5 million or $7.94 per share on a weighted average grant date fair value basis. During the year, 36,318 stock options vested and 40,261 stock options were forfeited on a weighted average grant date fair value of $6.71 and $7.99,
respectively.

As of December 31, 2006, total compensation costs related to non-vested stock options not yet recognized was approximately $9.1
million, which is expected to be recognized over the next 19 months on a weighted-average basis.

The Compensation Committee has also approved restricted stock grants to certain key employees and directors. The
following restricted stock activity occurred during 2006, 2005 and 2004:

Recipients of the restricted shares, who have the right to vote the shares and to receive dividends, are not
required to provide consideration to us other than rendering service. Forfeiture provisions on the restricted stock generally expire 10 years after award grant subject to an accelerated expiration schedule for some of the shares based on the
achievement of certain financial performance goals.

We record the market value of the restricted stock awards on the date of grant and then we charge
their value to expense over the vesting period of the awards. We also adjust expense for acceleration of vesting due to achievement of performance goals. We recorded compensation expense, net of tax, for restricted stock awards made to our employees
and directors of $0.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006. The impact was less than $0.01 per share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006. Tax benefits realized for our restricted stock awards were
$0.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, total compensation cost related to non-vested restricted stock awards not yet recognized was approximately $2.6 million, which is expected to be
recognized over the next 52 months on a weighted-average basis.

In January 2004, the Compensation Committee granted 159,159 performance shares to our
officers and other key employees. In January 2007, 2006 and 2005 the Compensation Committee granted 136,905, 150,281 and 101,834 performance units to officers and other key employees under the Wisconsin Energy Performance Unit Plan. Under the
grants, the ultimate number of units which will be awarded is dependent upon the achievement of certain financial performance of our stock over a three year period. Under the terms of the award, participants may earn between 0% and 175% of the base
performance award. We are accruing compensation costs over the three year period based on our estimate of the final expected value of the award. In July 2006, the Compensation Committee amended the terms of the performance shares to allow the
recipients of 2004 grants to receive cash or common stock upon settlement. During the third quarter of 2006, we transferred $6.3 million from Common Equity to Other Liabilities to reflect participant elections to take cash under this amendment.
The 2005, 2006 and 2007 grants will be settled in cash. We recorded compensation expense, net of tax, for performance awards made to our employees of $4.3 million ($0.04 per share) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006. We
have not realized any tax benefits associated with our performance awards during the twelve months ended December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, total compensation cost related to non-vested performance awards not yet recognized was
approximately $6.4 million, which is expected to be recognized over the next 21 months on a weighted-average basis. The final value of the 2004 performance share award was approximately $7.2 million, which was paid to our officers and key
employees in January 2007.

Common Stock Activity:

In September 2000, the Board of Directors amended the common stock repurchase plan to
authorize us to purchase up to $400 million of our shares of common stock in the open market. In 2004, we purchased and retired approximately 1.6 million shares of common stock for $50.4 million. The repurchase plan expired on
December 31, 2004. Over the life of the repurchase plan we purchased and retired approximately 14.9 million shares of common stock for $344.0 million.

No new shares of common stock were issued in 2006 and 2005. Prior to February 2004, we issued shares of our common stock to fulfill obligations under various employee benefit plans and the dividend reinvestment plan.
We received proceeds of approximately $4.8 million during 2004, related to these share issuances. In February 2004, we announced that we did not expect to issue new shares under these programs; rather we instructed the independent

(Cont’d)

plan agents to begin purchasing the shares in the open market in lieu of issuing new shares. During 2006 and 2005, our plan agents purchased 1.1 million
shares at a cost of $48.0 million and 2.0 million shares at a cost of $75.1 million, respectively, to fulfill exercised stock options and restricted stock awards. In 2006 and 2005, we received proceeds of $26.8 million and
$47.0 million, respectively, related to the exercise of stock options.

Restrictions:

Wisconsin Energy’s ability as a
holding company to pay common dividends primarily depends on the availability of funds received from our principal utility subsidiaries, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas.

Various financing arrangements and regulatory requirements impose
certain restrictions on the ability of our principal utility subsidiaries to transfer funds to Wisconsin Energy in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances. In addition, under Wisconsin law, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas are prohibited
from loaning funds, either directly or indirectly, to Wisconsin Energy.

The Wisconsin Electric January 2006 rate order from the PSCW requires Wisconsin
Electric to maintain a capital structure (i.e., the percentage by which each of common stock, preferred stock and debt constitute the total capital invested in the utility), which has a common equity ratio range of between 48.5% and 53.5% (including
certain off-balance sheet obligations and capitalized leases, but excluding the PWGS 1 capitalized lease). The Wisconsin Gas January 2006 rate order established a test year average common equity ratio of 50.2%. Previously in a June 2004 decision,
the PSCW determined that both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas must obtain specific approval to pay dividends that exceed normal levels as long as any tax issue or appeals related to the sale of the manufacturing business and/or the conversion
of Wisconsin Gas to a limited liability company remain outstanding. The PSCW may modify such provisions by a future order.

Wisconsin Electric may not pay
common dividends to Wisconsin Energy under Wisconsin Electric’s Restated Articles of Incorporation if any dividends on Wisconsin Electric’s outstanding preferred stock have not been paid. In addition, pursuant to the terms of Wisconsin
Electric’s 3.60% Serial Preferred Stock, Wisconsin Electric’s ability to declare common dividends would be limited to 75% or 50% of net income during a twelve month period if Wisconsin Electric’s common stock equity to total
capitalization, as defined, is less than 25% and 20%, respectively.

As of December 31, 2006, the restricted net assets of consolidated and
unconsolidated subsidiaries and our equity in undistributed earnings of 50 percent or less owned investees accounted for by the equity method total approximately $2.6 billion. This amount exceeds 25 percent of our consolidated net assets as of
December 31, 2006.

See Note L for discussion of certain financial covenants related to the bank back-up credit agreements of Wisconsin Energy,
Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas.

We do not believe that these restrictions will materially affect our operations or limit any dividend payments in
the foreseeable future.

K — LONG-TERM DEBT

Debentures and Notes:

As of December 31, 2006, the maturities and sinking fund requirements of our long-term debt outstanding (excluding obligations under capital leases) were as follows:


Wisconsin Energy Corporation


2006 Form 10-K

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

-

(Cont’d)

We amortize debt premiums, discounts and debt issuance costs over the lives of the debt and we include the costs in
interest expense.

In November 2006, Wisconsin Electric issued $300 million of 5.70% Debentures due December 1, 2036. The securities were
issued under an existing $665 million shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. The net proceeds from the sale were used to retire Wisconsin Electric’s $200 million of 6-5/8% Debentures due November 15, 2006 at their
scheduled maturity and to repay outstanding commercial paper incurred for working capital requirements.

Wisconsin Energy retired at the scheduled maturity
date $250.0 million of 5.875% Notes due April 1, 2006. Short-term debt was issued to retire these notes.

In July 2005, PWGS issued
$155 million of 4.91% senior notes in a private placement. The senior notes have a mortgage style repayment feature with monthly payments of approximately $0.9 million including principal and interest. The final payment is due
July 15, 2030. The senior notes are secured by a collateral assignment of the leases between PWGS and Wisconsin Electric relating to the first PWGS gas unit that went into service in July 2005.

Wisconsin Gas retired at the scheduled maturity date $65 million of 6-3/8% Notes due November 1, 2005. In November 2005, Wisconsin Gas issued
$90 million of 5.90% Debentures due December 1, 2035. The securities were issued under shelf registration statements filed with the SEC. The proceeds from the sale were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper. The
commercial paper was incurred to both retire the $65 million of 6-3/8% Notes and for working capital requirements.

Obligations Under Capital
Leases:

In 1997, Wisconsin Electric entered into a 25-year power purchase contract with an unaffiliated independent power producer. The contract, for 236 MW of firm capacity from a gas-fired cogeneration facility, includes no
minimum energy requirements. When the contract expires in 2022, Wisconsin Electric may, at its option and with proper notice, renew for another ten years or purchase the generating facility at fair value or allow the contract to expire. We account
for this contract as a capital lease and recorded the leased facility and corresponding obligation under the capital lease at the estimated fair value of the plant’s electric generating facilities. We are amortizing the leased facility on a
straight-line basis over the original 25-year term of the contract.

We treat the long-term power purchase contract as an operating lease for rate-making
purposes and we record our minimum lease payments as purchased power expense on the Consolidated Income Statements. We paid a total of $26.1 million, $25.2 million and $24.3 million in minimum lease payments during 2006, 2005, and
2004, respectively. We record the difference between the minimum lease payments and the sum of imputed interest and amortization costs calculated under capital lease accounting as a deferred regulatory asset on our Consolidated Balance Sheets (see
Regulatory Assets—Deferred plant related — capital lease in Note C). Due to the timing and the amounts of the minimum lease payments, we expect the regulatory asset to increase to approximately $78.5 million by the year 2009 at
which time the regulatory asset will be reduced to zero over the remaining life of the contract. The total obligation under the capital lease was $159.4 million at December 31, 2006 and will decrease to zero over the remaining life of
the contract.

Wisconsin Electric also has a nuclear fuel leasing arrangement with Wisconsin Electric Fuel Trust (Trust) which is treated as a capital
lease. We lease and amortize the nuclear fuel to fuel expense as power is generated, generally over a period of 60 months. Lease payments include charges for the cost of fuel burned, financing costs and management fees. In the event that Wisconsin
Electric or the Trust terminates the lease, the Trust would recover its unamortized cost of nuclear fuel from Wisconsin Electric. Under the lease terms, Wisconsin Electric is in effect the ultimate guarantor of the Trust’s commercial paper and
line of credit borrowings that finance the investment in nuclear fuel. We recorded $4.2 million, $1.7 million and $1.4 million of interest expense on the nuclear fuel lease in fuel expense during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

On December 31, 2006, we had approximately $1.7 billion of available unused lines under our bank back-up
credit facilities on a consolidated basis. Our bank back-up credit facilities expire in March 2011 and April 2011.

The following information
relates to Short-Term Debt for the years ending December 31, 2006 and 2005:

Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas have entered into various bank back-up credit agreements to
maintain short-term credit liquidity which, among other terms, require the companies to maintain, subject to certain exclusions, a minimum total funded debt to capitalization ratio of less than 70%, 65% and 65%, respectively.

The Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas bank back-up credit agreements contain customary covenants, including certain limitations on the respective
companies’ ability to sell assets. The credit agreements also contain customary events of default, including payment defaults, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, bankruptcy proceedings, certain judgments,
ERISA defaults and change of control. In addition, pursuant to the terms of Wisconsin Energy’s credit agreement, Wisconsin Energy must ensure that certain of its subsidiaries comply with many of the covenants contained therein.

At December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with all covenants.

M — DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

We follow SFAS 133 as amended by SFAS 149, which requires that every derivative instrument
be recorded on the balance sheet as an asset or liability measured at its fair value and that changes in the derivative’s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. For most energy
related physical and financial contracts in our regulated operations that qualify as derivatives under SFAS 133, the PSCW allows the effects of the fair market value accounting to be offset to regulatory assets and liabilities. As of
December 31, 2006, we recognized $36.6 million in regulatory assets related to derivatives in comparison to $4.8 million at December 31, 2005.

We had a limited number of financial contracts that are defined as derivatives under SFAS 133 and qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. These contracts were utilized to manage the cost of gas for utility operations. In addition, these
contracts were utilized in 2004 and the first half of 2005, for gas used in testing a new generating unit under construction. Changes in the fair market values of these instruments were recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. At the date
the underlying transaction occurs, the amounts in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income for utility operations were reported in earnings and amounts related to the new generating unit were capitalized.

For the year ended December 31, 2005 the amount of hedge ineffectiveness was immaterial. We did not exclude any components of derivative gains or losses from the
assessment of hedge effectiveness.

For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we reclassified $0.4 million, $0.6 million and
$0.8 million in treasury lock agreement settlement payments deferred in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income as an increase to Interest Expense. We estimate that during the next twelve months, $0.4 million will be reclassified from
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income as a reduction in earnings.

In addition, during 2004, in conjunction with the redemption of $300 million of Wisconsin Energy
5.875% senior notes due April 1, 2006, $0.6 million of a treasury lock agreement settlement payment previously deferred in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income was reclassified to Other Income and Deductions, Net.

N — FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The carrying
amount and estimated fair value of certain of our recorded financial instruments as of December 31 are as follows:

The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, net accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term
borrowings approximates fair value due to the short term nature of these instruments. The nuclear decommissioning assets are carried at fair value as reported by the trustee (see Note I). The fair value of our preferred stock is estimated based
upon the quoted market value for the same or similar issues. The fair value of our long-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt but excluding capitalized leases, is estimated based upon quoted market value for the same or similar
issues or upon the quoted market prices of U.S. Treasury issues having a similar term to maturity, adjusted for the issuing company’s bond rating and the present value of future cash flows. The fair values of derivative financial instruments
and associated margin accounts are equal to their carrying values as of December 31, 2006.

O — BENEFITS

Pensions and Other Post-retirement Benefits:

We have noncontributory defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all of our employees. The
plans provide defined benefits based upon years of service and final average salary. In October 2006, we announced that we were making a change to pension benefits for new management employees hired subsequent to October 2006 and for those
represented employees whose unions have adopted this plan. The retirement benefit for new employees is an enhanced 401(k) plan. Existing employee’s pension benefits are unchanged. Our 2007 combined pension and savings plan costs are not
expected to be materially affected as a result of this change to the plan.

We also have OPEB plans covering substantially all of our employees. The health
care plans are contributory with participants’ contributions adjusted annually; the life insurance plans are noncontributory. The accounting for the health care plans anticipates future cost-sharing changes to the written plans that are
consistent with our expressed intent to maintain the current cost sharing levels. The post-retirement health care plans include a limit on our share of costs for recent and future retirees. We use a year end measurement date for all of our pension
and OPEB plans.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 158, which requires employers to recognize all obligations related to their pension and OPEB
plans and to quantify the funded status of the pension and OPEB plans as an asset or liability on their statement of financial position. In addition, SFAS 158 requires employers to measure the funded status of their plans as of the date of their
year-end statement of financial position.

We adopted SFAS 158 prospectively on December 31, 2006, and will continue to use a year end measurement
date for all of our pension and OPEB plans. Prior to the issuance of SFAS 158, we recorded a minimum pension liability

to reflect the funded status of our pension plans. Due to the regulatory nature of our business, we have concluded that substantially all of the unrecognized
costs resulting from the recognition of the funded status of our pension and OPEB plans qualify as a regulatory asset.

The following table shows the
incremental effect of applying SFAS 158 on individual line items in our year-end statement of financial position and compares prior year-end balances:

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit plans was $1,218.7 million and $1,251.6 million
as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Information for pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of the fair value of
assets is as follows:

The components of net periodic pension and OPEB costs are:

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 8.5% in 2006 and 9% in 2005 and 2004. This return
expectation on plan assets was determined by reviewing actual pension historical returns as well as calculating expected total trust returns using the weighted average of long-term market returns for each of the asset categories utilized in the
pension fund.

Other Post-retirement Benefits Plans:

We use various Employees’ Benefit Trusts to fund a major portion of OPEB. The
majority of the trusts’ assets are mutual funds or commingled indexed funds.

A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:

In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (Act) was signed
into law. The Act introduced a prescription drug benefit program under Medicare as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans. In 2004, the FASB issued FSP SFAS 106-2.

In 2004, in accordance with FSP SFAS 106-2, we chose to recognize the effects of the Act retroactively effective January 1, 2004. Calculated actuarially,
the Act resulted in a reduction of $24.1 million in our benefit obligation. In addition, we recorded a reduction to SFAS 106 expense of $4.7 million in 2004. In January 2005, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services
released final regulations to implement the new prescription drug benefit under Part D of Medicare. It was determined that our employer sponsored plans met these regulations and that the previously determined actuarial measurements do not need
to be revised.

In October 2005, we announced that we were offering to our retirees a Medicare Advantage program as an option within our existing
post-retirement medical and drug plans. The Medicare Advantage program is part of the Act, and offers post-65 medical and drug benefits through private insurance carriers. The Medicare Advantage program is expected to reduce the cost of post-65
medical and drug costs for our retirees and the Company. Due to this change, we remeasured the fair value of our OPEB plans in the fourth quarter of 2005 in accordance with SFAS 106. In 2005, the impact of this remeasurement and the FSP SFAS
106-2 benefit was approximately a $4.4 million reduction to SFAS 106 expense.

Plan Assets:

In our opinion, current pension
trust assets and amounts which are expected to be contributed to the trusts in the future will be adequate to meet pension payment obligations to current and future retirees. Our pension plans asset allocation at December 31, 2006 and 2005, and
our target allocation for 2007, by asset category, are as follows:

Our OPEB plans asset allocation at December 31, 2006 and 2005, and our target allocation for 2007, by asset
category, are as follows.

Our common stock is not included in equity securities. Investment managers are specifically prohibited from
investing in our securities or any affiliate of ours except if part of a commingled fund or index fund.

The target asset allocations were established by our Investment Trust Policy Committee, which oversees investment
matters related to all of our funded benefit plans. The asset allocations are monitored by the Investment Trust Policy Committee.

Cash
Flows:

Based on our PSCW approved funding policy and current IRS funding requirements, we expect to contribute
$38.3 million to fund pension benefits and $12.5 million to fund OPEB plans in 2007. Of the $38.3 million expected to be contributed to fund pension benefits in 2007, we estimate $33.0 million will be for our qualified pension
plans. We contributed $55.4 million to our qualified pension plans during 2006. We did not make a contribution to our qualified pension plan during 2005.

The entire contribution to the OPEB plans during 2006 was discretionary as the plans are not subject to any minimum regulatory funding requirements.

The following table identifies our expected benefit payments over the next 10 years.

Savings Plans:

We sponsor savings plans which allow employees to contribute a portion of their
pre-tax and or after-tax income in accordance with plan-specified guidelines. Under these plans we expensed matching contributions of $10.4 million, $10.7 million and $10.5 million during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Severance Plans:

In 2004, we incurred $30.5 million ($18.3 million after-tax) of severance costs. The majority of the severance
costs related to an enhanced severance package offered to selected management employees of Wisconsin Energy and its subsidiaries who voluntarily resigned in the fourth quarter of 2004. The program was enacted to help reduce the upward pressure on
operating expenses.

Approximately 200 employees received severance benefits during 2004. At December 31, 2004, we accrued $6.6 million for
severance benefits. As of December 31, 2006, all of the severance related benefits were paid.

P — GUARANTEES

We enter into various guarantees to provide financial and performance assurance to third parties on behalf of our affiliates. As of December 31, 2006, we had
the following guarantees:

(Cont’d)

A non-utility energy segment guarantee in support of Wisvest-Connecticut, which we sold in December 2002 to PSEG,
provides financial assurance for potential obligations relating to environmental remediation under the original purchase agreement for Wisvest-Connecticut with United Illuminating. The potential obligations for environmental remediation, which are
unlimited, are reimbursable by PSEG under the terms of the sale agreement in the event that we are required to perform under the guarantee.

Other
guarantees support obligations of our affiliates to third parties under loan agreements and surety bonds. In the event our affiliates fail to perform, we would be responsible for the obligations.

Wisconsin Electric guarantees the potential retrospective premiums that could be assessed under Wisconsin Electric’s nuclear insurance program (see Note I).

Subsidiary guarantees support loan obligations and surety bonds between our affiliates and third parties. In the event our affiliates fail to perform, our
subsidiary would be responsible for the obligations.

Postemployment benefits:

Postemployment benefits provided to former or inactive
employees are recognized when an event occurs. The estimated liability, excluding severance benefits, for such benefits was $13.0 million as of December 31, 2006.

Q — SEGMENT REPORTING

Our reportable operating segments at December 31, 2006 include a utility energy
segment and a non-utility energy segment. In July 2004, our manufacturing segment was sold to Pentair, Inc. We have organized our reportable operating segments based in part upon the regulatory environment in which our utility subsidiaries
operate. In addition, the segments are managed separately because each business requires different technology and marketing strategies. The accounting policies of the reportable operating segments are the same as those described in Note A.

Our utility energy segment primarily includes our electric and natural gas utility operations. Our electric utility operation engages in the generation,
distribution and sale of electric energy in southeastern (including metropolitan Milwaukee), east central and northern Wisconsin and in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Our natural gas utility operation is engaged in the purchase, distribution and
sale of natural gas to retail customers and the transportation of customer-owned natural gas throughout Wisconsin. Our non-utility energy segment derives its revenues primarily from the ownership of electric power generating facilities for long-term
lease to Wisconsin Electric and economic interests in other energy-related entities.

Summarized financial information concerning our reportable operating
segments for each of the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, is shown in the following table. The segment information below includes non-cash impairment charges of $149.0 million ($96.9 million after tax or $0.81 per
share) in 2004, which are now included in income from discontinued operations as the sale of these businesses was announced or completed in 2005. These impairment charges are primarily related to the non-utility energy segment (see Note D).
Substantially all of our long-lived assets and operations are domestic.

Guardian:

In April 2006, we sold our one third ownership interest in Guardian. As such, the
tables below reflect activity through April 2006 with respect to Guardian. We have committed to purchase 650,000 Dth per day of capacity (approximately 87% of the pipeline’s total capacity) under the terms of a 10 year
transportation agreement expiring December 2022.

Nuclear Management Company:

At December 31, 2006, NMC, which operates Point
Beach, was owned by our affiliate, WEC Nuclear Corporation, and the affiliates of two other unaffiliated investor-owned utilities in the region. Wisconsin Electric pays NMC a plant operating charge. In December 2006, we announced our intention
to sell Point Beach to an affiliate of FPL. If and when the sale is completed (or earlier if an interim operating agreement with FPL is activated by us), the operating licenses for Point Beach will transfer from NMC to the buyer and our relationship
with NMC will be terminated.

We provided and received services from the following associated companies during 2006, 2005 and 2004:

At December 31, 2006 and 2005 our consolidated balance sheets included receivable and payable balances with
the following associated companies:

S — COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Capital Expenditures:

We have made certain commitments in connection with 2007 capital expenditures. During 2007, we estimate that total capital expenditures will be approximately $1.4 billion.

Operating Leases:

We enter into long-term purchase power contracts to meet a portion of our anticipated increase in future electric
energy supply needs. These contracts expire at various times through 2013. Certain of these contracts were deemed to qualify as operating leases. In addition, we have various other operating leases including leases for vehicles and coal cars.

Future minimum payments for the next five years and thereafter for our operating lease contracts are as follows:

Divested Assets:

Pursuant to the terms of the sale agreement for Minergy Neenah, we have agreed
to customary indemnification provisions related to post-closing obligations and other matters. Our maximum aggregate exposure under the indemnification provisions is $0.3 million.

Pursuant to the terms of the sale agreement for Calumet, Wisvest has agreed to customary indemnification provisions related to environmental conditions and other matters. Except for retention of the full exposure to
indemnify Tenaska for environmental claims related to certain property no longer leased or owned by Wisvest or any of its subsidiaries, Wisvest’s maximum aggregate exposure under the indemnification provisions is $35 million. Pursuant to
the terms of the agreement, we have guaranteed post-closing obligations under the agreement, including indemnity obligations.

Pursuant to the terms of the
sales agreement for WICOR Wisconsin Energy agreed to customary indemnification provisions related to certain environmental, asbestos, and product liability matters associated with the manufacturing business. In addition, the amount of cash taxes and
future deferred income tax benefits are subject to a number of factors including appraisals of the fair value of Wisconsin Gas assets and applicable tax laws. Any changes in the estimates of taxes and indemnification matters will be recorded as an
adjustment to the gain on sale and reported in discontinued operations in the period the adjustment is determined. We have established reserves related to these customary indemnification and tax matters.

Environmental Matters:

We periodically review our exposure for environmental remediation costs as evidence becomes available indicating that our
liability has changed. Given current information, including the following, we believe that future costs in excess of the amounts accrued and/or disclosed on all presently known and quantifiable environmental contingencies will not be material to our
financial position or results of operations.

We have a program of comprehensive environmental remediation planning for former manufactured gas plant sites
and coal-ash disposal sites. We perform ongoing assessments of manufactured gas plant sites and related disposal sites used by Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas, and coal ash disposal/landfill sites used by Wisconsin Electric, as discussed below.
We are working with the WDNR in our investigation and remediation planning. At this time, we cannot estimate future remediation costs associated with these sites beyond those described below.

Manufactured Gas Plant Sites:

We have identified several sites at which Wisconsin Electric, Wisconsin Gas, or a predecessor company historically owned
or operated a manufactured gas plant. We have substantially completed planned remediation activities at some of those sites and certain other sites are subject to ongoing monitoring. Remediation at additional sites is currently being performed, and
other sites are being investigated or monitored. We have also identified other sites that may have been impacted by historical manufactured gas plant activities. Based upon ongoing analysis, we estimate that the future costs for detailed site
investigation and future remediation costs may range from $25 to $50 million over the next ten years. This estimate is dependent upon several variables including, among other things, the extent of remediation, changes in technology and changes
in regulation. As of December 31, 2006, we have established reserves of $30.5 million related to future remediation costs.

The PSCW has allowed
Wisconsin utilities, including Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas, to defer the costs spent on the remediation of manufactured gas plant sites, and has allowed for these costs to be recovered in rates over five years. Accordingly, we have recorded
a regulatory asset for remediation costs.

Ash Landfill Sites:

Wisconsin Electric aggressively seeks environmentally acceptable, beneficial
uses for its coal combustion by-products. However, these coal-ash by-products have been, and to a small degree, continue to be disposed in company-owned, licensed landfills. Some early designed and constructed landfills may allow the release of low
levels of constituents resulting in the need for various levels of monitoring or adjusting. Where Wisconsin Electric has become aware of these conditions, efforts have been expended to define the nature and extent of any release, and work has been
performed to address these conditions. The costs of these efforts are recovered under the fuel clause for Wisconsin Electric and are expensed as incurred. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, Wisconsin Electric incurred $0.5 million, $0.1 million
and $1.8 million, respectively, in coal-ash remediation expenses. As of December 31, 2006, we have no reserves established related to ash landfill sites.

EPA - Proposed Consent Decree:

In April 2003, Wisconsin Electric and the EPA announced that a consent decree had been reached that resolved all issues related to a request for information that had been issued by the EPA.
Under the consent decree, Wisconsin Electric agreed to significantly reduce its air emissions from its coal-fired generating facilities. The reductions are expected to be achieved by 2013 through a combination of installing new pollution control
equipment, upgrading existing equipment and retiring certain older units. Through December 31, 2006, we have spent approximately $355.0 million associated with implementing the EPA agreement and the ultimate capital cost of
implementing this agreement is estimated to be $1 billion through the year 2013.

The consent decree, amended to include the State of Michigan, has been
filed with a federal court for approval. Various intervenor groups have commented on the consent decree and we believe that the briefings and subsequent discovery is complete. At this time, we are unable to predict the timing or the ultimate
resolution of the federal court’s consideration; however, we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of this matter will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Wisconsin Energy Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of capitalization of Wisconsin Energy Corporation and subsidiaries (the
“Company”) as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, common equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and the financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2006, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements
taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 22, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Wisconsin Energy Corporation:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Wisconsin Energy
Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper
management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006 of the Company and our report dated February 22, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial
statements and financial statement schedules.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon such evaluation, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective (i) in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act and (ii) to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of Wisconsin Energy Corporation’s and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its evaluation under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework, our management concluded that Wisconsin Energy Corporation’s and
subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2006.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also,
projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as auditors of our financial
statements has issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of Wisconsin Energy Corporation’s and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006. Deloitte &
Touche’s report is included in this report.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2006 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Parent Company Only)

SCHEDULE I - CONDENSED PARENT COMPANY

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Cont’d)

1. The consolidated financial statements of Wisconsin Energy Corporation reflect certain businesses
as discontinued operations. The related assets for these discontinued operations are recorded as assets held for sale in the consolidated financial statements. For Parent Company only presentation, the investments in discontinued operations are
recorded in Investment in subsidiary companies. In the Wisconsin Energy Corporation consolidated financial statements, we have reported assets held for sale of zero and $17.4 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The
condensed Parent Company income statements and cash flow statements report the earnings of these businesses as discontinued operations. For Parent Company only presentation, investment in subsidiaries are accounted for using the equity method. The
condensed Parent Company financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of Wisconsin Energy Corporation appearing in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

2. Wisconsin Energy’s ability as a holding company to pay common dividends primarily depends on the availability of funds received from the Parent Company’s
principal utility subsidiaries, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas.

Various financing arrangements and regulatory requirements impose certain restrictions on the ability of the Parent Company’s principal utility subsidiaries to
transfer funds to the Parent Company in the form of cash dividends or advances. In addition, under Wisconsin law, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas are prohibited from loaning funds, either directly or indirectly, to the Parent Company.

Wisconsin Energy does not believe that these restrictions will materially affect the Parent Company’s operations or limit any dividend payments in
the foreseeable future.

3. In September 2004, the Parent Company used cash proceeds from the sale of WICOR Industries for the redemption of $300 million
of Wisconsin Energy 5.875% senior notes due April 1, 2006. In September 2004, the Parent Company recorded $17.0 million of costs associated with this early redemption, which are included in Other Income, net for the year ended December 31,
2004.

4. The assets, obligations and components of the Parent Company’s pension costs are allocated by Wisconsin Energy’s actuary to each of the
participating companies as if each participating company had its own plan. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 158 which requires employers to recognize all obligations related to their pension plan and to quantify the funded status of the
pension plan as an asset or liability on their statement of financial position. In addition, SFAS 158 requires employers to measure the funded status of their plan as of the date of their year-end statement of financial position.

Wisconsin Energy adopted SFAS 158 prospectively on December 31, 2006, and will continue to use a year end measurement date for its pension plan. Due to the
regulatory nature of its business, Wisconsin Energy has concluded that substantially all of the unrecognized pension costs resulting from the recognition of the funded status of its pension plan qualify as a regulatory asset.

Prior to the issuance of SFAS 158, the Parent Company recorded a minimum pension liability to reflect the funded status of the unallocated portion of its pension
liability. Upon adoption of SFAS 158, the unallocated portion of its pension liability and the associated regulatory asset are recorded by the respective subsidiaries of Wisconsin Energy. As of December 31, 2006 the Parent Company recorded a
pension liability of $3.2 million and a regulatory asset of $1.7 million to reflect the funded status of the pension plan under SFAS 158. As of December 31, 2005, the Parent Company recorded a pension liability of $130.8 million and a
regulatory asset of $127.0 million under SFAS 132.

5. As of December 31, 2006, the maturities of the Parent Company long-term debt outstanding were as follows:

Wisconsin Energy amortizes debt premiums, discounts and debt issuance costs over the lives of the debt and
includes the costs in interest expense.

Wisconsin Energy retired at the scheduled maturity date $250.0 million of 5.875% Notes due April 1,
2006. Short-term debt was issued to retire these notes.

Wisconsin Energy has entered into a bank back-up credit agreement to maintain short-term liquidity
which, among other terms, requires the Company to maintain, subject to certain exclusions, a minimum total funded debt to capitalization ratio of less than 70%.

Wisconsin Energy’s bank back-up credit agreement contains customary covenants, including certain limitations on its ability to sell assets. The credit agreement also contains customary events of default, including payment defaults,
material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, bankruptcy proceedings, certain judgments, ERISA defaults and change of control. In addition, pursuant to the terms of its credit agreement, Wisconsin Energy must ensure that
certain of its subsidiaries comply with many of the covenants contained therein.

At December 31, 2006, Wisconsin Energy was in compliance with all
covenants.

6. Wisconsin Energy and certain of its subsidiaries enter into various guarantees to provide financial and performance assurance to third
parties on behalf of affiliates. As of December 31, 2006, Wisconsin Energy had the following guarantees:

Utility guarantees support obligations of the utility segment under surety bonds and worker’s compensation.

Wisconsin Energy’s guarantees in support of our Non-Utility Energy segment guaranty performance and payment obligations of We Power and Wisvest. A
guarantee in support of Wisvest-Connecticut which we sold in December 2002 to PSEG provides financial assurance for potential obligations relating to environmental

remediation under the original purchase agreement with United Illuminating. The potential obligations for environmental remediation, which are unlimited, are
reimbursable by PSEG under the terms of the sale agreement in the event that Wisconsin Energy is required to perform under the guarantee. Guarantees also support obligations to third parties under the agreement with PSEG for the sale of Wisvest -
Connecticut and post-closing obligations including indemnity obligations related to environmental condition and other matters under the Calumet facility sale agreement which was effective May 31, 2005. Wisconsin Energy’s maximum aggregate
exposure under the indemnification provisions of the Calumet facility sale agreement, except for retention of the full exposure to indemnify for environmental claims related to certain property no longer leased or owned by Wisconsin Energy or its
subsidiaries, is $35 million.

The guarantees which support We Power are for obligations under purchase, construction and lease agreements with the
utility segment and third parties.

Wisconsin Energy also has another guarantee to support an environmental indemnification, which is unlimited, associated
with the Minergy Neenah plant and indemnifications related to the post-closing obligations under the Minergy Neenah sale agreement, which was effective September 7, 2006.

Wisconsin Energy’s other guarantees also support obligations to third parties under purchase and loan agreements and surety bonds. In the event the guarantee fails to perform, Wisconsin Energy would be
responsible for the obligations.
