COMPANY BACKGROUND

In this report, "Intuitive Surgical," "we," "us," and
"our" refer to Intuitive Surgical, Inc.  Intuitive™®,

da
Vinci

™, EndoWrist™, InSite™ and Navigator™ are
trademarks of Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

We design and manufacture the

da Vinci

Surgical
System, an advanced surgical system that we believe represents a new generation
of surgery -- the third generation. We believe that this new generation of
surgery, which we call Intuitive surgery, is a revolutionary advance similar in
scope to the previous two generations of surgery -- open surgery and minimally
invasive surgery, or MIS. Our

da Vinci

Surgical System consists of a
surgeon's console, a patient-side cart, a high performance vision system and our
proprietary instruments. By placing computer-enhanced technology between the
surgeon and patient, we believe that our system enables surgeons to perform
better surgery in a manner never before experienced. The

da Vinci

Surgical System seamlessly translates the surgeon's natural hand movements
on instrument controls at a console into corresponding micro-movements of
instruments positioned inside the patient through small puncture incisions, or
ports. Our

da Vinci

Surgical System is the only commercially available
technology that can provide the surgeon with the intuitive control, range of
motion, fine tissue manipulation capability and 3-D visualization characteristic
of open surgery, while simultaneously allowing the surgeon to work through the
small ports of minimally invasive surgery.

In March 1997, surgeons using an early prototype of our
technology successfully performed Intuitive surgery on humans. Beginning in May
1998, surgeons using our technology successfully performed what we believe were
the world's first computer-enhanced closed chest heart surgeries, including
mitral valve repair, dissection of an internal mammary artery and grafting of a
coronary artery. In early 2000, surgeons using our technology successfully
completed what we believe was the world's first beating heart bypass procedure
using only small ports. In July 2000, we received marketing clearance from the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the

da Vinci

Surgical System
to assist in the control of Intuitive Surgical endoscopic instruments including:
rigid endoscopes, blunt and sharp endoscopic dissectors, scissors, scalpels,
forceps/pickups, needle holders, endoscopic retractors, stabilizers,
electrocautery, and accessories during laparoscopic surgical procedures such as
cholecystectomy or Nissen fundoplication. We received clearance for a non-cardiac
thoracoscopic surgery indication for the product in March 2001.
Additionally, in May 2001 we received clearance for use of our products in
laparoscopic prostatectomy procedures.  As of December 31, 2001, we have sold 89
of our

da Vinci

Surgical Systems and surgeons using our technology have
successfully completed several  thousand surgery procedures of various types.

The first generation of surgery, open surgery, remains the
predominant form of surgery and is still used in almost every area of the body.
However, the large incisions required for open surgery create significant trauma
to the patient, resulting in long hospitalization and recovery times, high
hospitalization costs, as well as significant pain and suffering. Over the past
several decades, the second generation of surgery, MIS surgery, has reduced
trauma to the patient by allowing some surgeries to be performed through small
ports rather than large incisions, resulting in shorter recovery times, fewer
complications and reduced hospitalization costs. MIS surgery has been widely
adopted for certain surgical procedures, but it has not been widely adopted for
complex procedures. We believe surgeons have been slow to adopt MIS surgery for
complex procedures because they generally find that fine tissue manipulations,
such as dissecting and suturing, using these techniques are more difficult to
learn and perform, and are less precise, than in open surgery.

Intuitive surgery overcomes many of the shortcomings of both
open surgery and MIS surgery. Surgeons operate while seated comfortably at a
console viewing a bright and sharp 3-D image of the surgical field. This
immersive visualization results in surgeons no longer feeling disconnected from
the surgical field and the instruments, as they do when using an endoscope in
MIS surgery. While seated at the console, the surgeon manipulates instrument
controls in a natural manner, just as he or she has been trained to do in open
surgery. Our technology is designed to provide surgeons with a range of motion
in the surgical field analogous to the motions of a human wrist, while filtering
out the tremor inherent in every surgeon's hand. In designing our products, we
have focused on making our technology as simple as possible to use. In our
experience, based on over a thousand procedures, surgeons can learn to
manipulate our instruments with only a short amount of training and can learn to
perform Intuitive surgery with less training than is required for MIS surgery.

Our products are designed to make a broad range of open
surgical and MIS procedures suitable for Intuitive surgery. The

da Vinci

Surgical System is designed to allow surgeons to perform better surgery
while providing patients with the benefits of MIS surgery. We believe that these
advantages will enable us to drive a fundamental change in surgery.

Third Generation Surgery: The Intuitive Surgical Solution

Our technology is designed to return to the surgeon the
range of motion, fine tissue control and 3-D vision characteristic of open
surgery while simultaneously allowing the surgeon to work through the ports used
in MIS surgery. All this is accomplished in an intuitive manner, in the same way
that the movements of a surgeon's hands in open surgery are entirely intuitive.

We believe that our technology overcomes many of the
limitations of existing MIS surgery in the following ways:

Natural Instrument Movements. Our technology is designed to directly
transform the surgeon's natural hand movements outside the body into
corresponding micromovements inside the patient's body. For example, a hand
movement to the right outside the body causes the instrument inside the patient
to be moved to the right, eliminating the backward nature of existing MIS
surgery.

EndoWrist Instruments Provide Natural Dexterity and Range of Motion. Our
technology is designed to provide surgeons with a range of motion in the
surgical field analogous to the motions of a human hand and wrist. Our
proprietary instruments, which we call EndoWrist instruments, incorporate
"wrist" joints that enable surgeons to reach behind tissues and suture with
precision, just as they can in open surgery. The surgeon controls the joint's
movements from the surgeon's console using natural hand and wrist movements.
EndoWrist joints are located near the tips of all of our instruments.

More Precise Movements and Reduced Tremor. With our technology, the surgeon
can also use "motion scaling," a feature that translates, for example, a three
millimeter hand movement outside the patient's body into a one millimeter
instrument movement in the surgical field inside the patient's body. Motion
scaling is designed to allow greater precision than is normally achievable in
both open and MIS surgery. In addition, our technology is designed to filter out
the tremor inherent in every surgeon's hands.

Immersive 3-D Visualization. Our vision system, which we call the InSite
vision system, is designed to give surgeons the perception that their hands are
immersed in the surgical field even though they are outside the patient's body.
As a result, we believe that surgeons no longer feel disconnected from the
surgical field and the instruments, as they currently do with MIS surgery. In
addition, we believe that the InSite system provides a much brighter and sharper
image than any other 3-D endoscope vision system. The InSite system also
incorporates our proprietary Navigator camera control technology that allows the
surgeon to easily change, move, zoom and rotate his or her field of vision. The
combination of these features offers what we believe is the most advanced
surgical vision system available today.

Easy to Learn and Perform. In designing our products, we have focused on
making our technology as simple as possible to use, even though it is inherently
complex. We believe that tissue manipulations using our products are as natural
as hand movements in open surgery. In our experience, based on feedback from
surgeons who have performed hundreds of procedures, surgeons can learn to
manipulate our instruments with only a short amount of training. Learning to
perform surgical procedures using the

da Vinci

Surgical System will vary
depending on the complexity of the procedure and the surgical team's experience
with MIS surgery techniques.

Multi-Specialty Surgical Platform. The

da Vinci

Surgical System is designed to
enable surgeons to perform surgery in virtually any part of the body. To date,
surgeons have used the

da Vinci

Surgical System to perform over 100
different types of surgical procedures.

We believe that these advantages give the patient the
benefits of less traumatic MIS surgery while restoring to the surgeon the range
of motion and fine tissue control possible with open surgery, along with further
enhancements such as tremor reduction, motion scaling and superior
visualization.

We believe that our technology has the potential to change
surgical procedures in three basic ways:

Convert Open Procedures to Intuitive Surgery. We believe our technology will
make a number of surgical procedures that currently are performed only with open
surgical techniques suitable for Intuitive surgery.

Facilitate Difficult MIS Operations. We believe surgical procedures that
today are performed only rarely using MIS techniques will be performed routinely
and with confidence using Intuitive surgery. Some procedures have been adapted
for port-based techniques but are extremely difficult and are currently
performed by a limited number of highly skilled surgeons. We believe our

da
Vinci

Surgical System will enable more surgeons at more institutions to
perform these procedures.

Simplify Existing, High-Volume MIS Procedures. We believe surgical
procedures that today are performed routinely using MIS techniques will be
performed more quickly and safely with Intuitive surgery. For example, over the
past decade, approximately 85% of gall bladder removals performed in the United
States have been converted to MIS surgery. We believe that the

da Vinci

Surgical System will make these procedures easier, faster and more cost
effective to perform.

INTUITIVE SURGICAL'S PRODUCTS

Our principal products include the

da Vinci

Surgical System and a variety of "smart disposable" EndoWrist instruments.

da Vinci

Surgical System

Surgeon's Console. The

da Vinci

Surgical System
allows the surgeon to operate while comfortably seated at an ergonomic console
viewing a 3-D image of the surgical field. The surgeon's fingers grasp the
instrument controls below the display with wrists naturally positioned relative
to his or her eyes. Using hardware, software, algorithms, mechanics and optics,
our technology is designed to seamlessly translate the surgeon's hand movements
into precise and corresponding real-time microsurgical movements of the
EndoWrist instruments inside the patient.

Patient-Side Cart. The patient-side cart, which can be easily
moved next to the operating table, holds electromechanical arms that manipulate
the instruments inside the patient. Three arms attached to the cart can be
easily positioned as appropriate, and then locked into place. The first two
arms, one representing the left hand and one the right hand of the surgeon, hold
our EndoWrist instruments. The third arm positions the endoscope, allowing the
surgeon to easily change, move, zoom and rotate his or her field of vision.

3-D Vision System. The vision system includes our InSite high
resolution 3-D endoscope with two separate vision channels linked to two high
resolution, progressively scanned color monitors. The vision system also
incorporates our InSite image processing equipment comprised of high performance
video cameras, specialized edge enhancement and noise reduction equipment. The
resulting 3-D image has high resolution and contrast and no flicker or cross-fading,
which occurs in single monitor systems, and minimizes eye fatigue. Our
vision system allows the surgeon to move his or her head in the viewer without
affecting image quality.

EndoWrist Instruments

We manufacture a variety of EndoWrist instruments, each
of which incorporates a wrist joint for natural dexterity, with tips customized
for various surgical procedures. These EndoWrist instruments are currently
approximately seven millimeters in diameter. The instruments mount onto the
electromechanical arms that represent the surgeon's left and right hands and
provide the mechanical capability necessary for performing complex tissue
manipulations through ports. At their tips, the various EndoWrist instruments
include forceps, scissors, electrocautery, scalpels and other surgical tools
that are readily familiar to the surgeon from open and MIS surgery. Generally, a
variety of EndoWrist instruments are selected and used interchangeably during
the surgery. Where instrument tips need to incorporate a disposable component,
for example, scalpel blades, we sell disposable inserts. We plan to continue to
add new types of EndoWrist instruments for additional types of surgical
procedures.

The EndoWrist instruments are "smart disposables" because
they are resterilizable and reusable for a defined number of procedures or hours
of use. A custom computer chip inside each instrument performs several functions
that help determine how the system and instruments work together. When an
EndoWrist instrument is attached to an arm of the patient-side cart, the chip
performs an "electronic handshake" that ensures the instrument was manufactured
by us and recognizes the type and function of the instrument and number of past
uses or hours. For example, the chip distinguishes between scissors and a
scalpel and controls the unique functions of different instruments as
appropriate. In addition, the chip will not allow the instrument to be used for
more than the prescribed number of procedures or hours so that its performance
meets specifications during each procedure. In addition, we can sell the
instrument for a fixed number of uses or hours and effectively price our
EndoWrist instruments on a per-procedure or per-hour basis.

USING THE DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEM

During a procedure, the patient-side cart is
positioned next to the operating table with the electromechanical arms arranged
to provide access to the initial ports selected by the surgeon. Metal tubes
attached to the arms are inserted through the ports, and the EndoWrist
instruments are introduced through the tubes into the patient's body. The
surgeon then performs the procedure while sitting comfortably at the surgeon's
console, manipulating the instrument controls and viewing the operation through
our InSite vision system. When a surgeon needs to change an instrument, as is
done many times during an operation, the instrument is withdrawn from the
surgical field using the controls at the console, in similar fashion to the way
a surgeon withdraws instruments from the patient in MIS surgery. A scrub nurse
standing near the patient removes the unwanted instrument from the
electromechanical arm and replaces it with the new instrument, in a process
designed to be rapid enough not to disturb the natural flow of the procedure. As
a result, the scrub nurse plays a role similar to that played in open and MIS
surgery. At the conclusion of the operation, the metal tubes are removed from
the patient's body and the small incisions are sutured or stapled.

OUR STRATEGY

Our goal is to establish Intuitive surgery as the
standard for complex surgical procedures and many other procedures currently
performed using either open or MIS surgery. We intend to accomplish this
objective both by pioneering new types of endoscopic surgery and by making
existing MIS procedures easier, safer and more cost effective. Over time, our
strategy is to broaden the number of procedures performed using the

da Vinci

Surgical System and to educate surgeons and hospitals as to the benefits of
Intuitive surgery. Key elements of this strategy include:

Focus on Key Institutions. Our marketing efforts are focused
on large multi-specialty care hospitals where a majority of complex surgical
procedures are performed. Following the initial placement at a given hospital,
we intend to expand the number of physicians who use the

da Vinci

Surgical System and work with the hospitals and their surgeons to promote
patient education as to the benefits of Intuitive surgery. We believe that these
efforts will result in increased usage per system, leading to high volume sales
of instruments and sales of additional systems at each hospital. In addition, we
believe such efforts will benefit early-adopting hospitals by increasing their
market share in the procedures and specialties that benefit from Intuitive
surgery. We expect these efforts to increase demand for our products among
competitive hospitals, surgeons and referring physicians.

Focus on Leading Surgeons to Drive Rapid and Broad Adoption.
We will place significant emphasis on marketing the

da Vinci

Surgical
System to leading surgeons who are considered to be the "thought leaders" in
their institutions and fields. These surgeons typically perform complex surgical
procedures that are currently not adaptable to MIS techniques. For example,
cardiac procedures, of which over one million are currently performed annually
worldwide, are among the most difficult to perform using MIS techniques. This
strategy puts surgeons at the forefront of procedure development and provides
them an opportunity to maintain a competitive edge in their specialty. We
believe that early adoption of our products by surgical thought leaders will
give many other surgeons the confidence that the

da Vinci

Surgical System
can be used for all types of surgical procedures.

Develop Protocols for New Surgical Procedures. We intend to
leverage our relationships with key institutions and surgical thought leaders to
develop protocols for new surgical procedures. These protocols would include
guidance on patient screening, port placement, interaction of the surgical team
and advice on the sequence and selection of tools and maneuvers. We believe that
establishing protocols for a given procedure will facilitate the broader
adoption of Intuitive surgery for that procedure.

Maintain Market Leadership. We intend to maintain our
leadership advantage by continuing to develop and enhance our technology and to
communicate the benefits of our

da Vinci

Surgical System to surgeons,
hospitals and patients. We will continue to improve our

da Vinci

Surgical
System through software and hardware enhancements and by developing new surgical
instruments. We will also continue to develop our surgical platform to
facilitate and support future surgical innovations.

CLINICAL CONTRIBUTIONS

We believe our technology is capable of enhancing or
enabling a wide variety of procedures in many surgical specialties. To date,
surgeons using our

da Vinci

Surgical System have performed over a
thousand surgery procedures of various types including general and vascular
surgery, gynecologic and urologic surgery, and cardiovascular surgery. These
applications, as well as potential applications for orthopedic surgery, are
described below.

General and Vascular Surgery

Aortic Aneurysms. A common vascular procedure is the
repair of aortic aneurysms, which are sacs formed by the dilation of the wall of
the main artery in the body. Aneurysms are caused primarily by atherosclerosis,
which is characterized by the deposition of fatty substances in large and
medium-sized arteries, such as the arteries that lead to the heart and brain.
Surgical treatment involves clamping the aorta and making long incisions at
multiple sites to resect and replace the aneurysm with a synthetic graft. Once
the aorta is clamped, time is of the essence, since procedures are typically
done without heart/lung bypass machines. Thus, only a narrow window of time for
completion is available. Currently, some aneurysms are treated by intravascular
stent-grafts. These stent-grafts can be inserted through the main artery in the
thigh, called the femoral artery, and do not require an incision. However, the
necessity of traversing the femoral artery to gain access to the aorta limits
the usage of this technique. We believe that the capability of our technology to
deliver to the surgeon enhanced dexterity and the ability to suture grafts,
alone or in conjunction with stent-grafts, will help convert this procedure from
open surgery to Intuitive surgery.

Aorto-Femoral Bypass. The lower portion of the abdominal
aorta is often a location of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerotic blockage of this
portion of the aorta restricts blood flow to the lower body. To treat this
condition using open surgery, a synthetic graft is attached above and below the
blockage. This procedure currently requires open surgery because of the need to
suture the grafts in place. We believe that with our technology, surgeons will
be able to perform the required suturing of arteries, called an anastomosis,
through ports and avoid the large incision currently required.

Cholecystectomy. Removal of the gallbladder, or
cholecystectomy, is the most common procedure performed by general surgeons. The
procedure is used to treat cholecystitis, which is an inflammation of the gall
bladder. Although a minimally invasive approach, called a laparoscopic
cholecystectomy, is now well accepted for routine cases, there is great
variability in the level of skill required to accomplish the procedure. The
skill level necessary to complete a laparoscopic cholecystectomy is dependent on
the disease status the surgeon discovers after the abdomen is entered. For
example, acute cholecystitis can result in inflammation and the abnormal union
of tissues resulting from the formation of new fibrous tissue in the
inflammatory process. As a result, very meticulous surgery to access gallbladder
anatomy can be required. Similarly, during the operation, the surgeon may find a
condition known as choledocolithiasis, or stones in the common bile duct. The
surgeon may choose to incise or cut the common duct to extract stones that are
caught between the liver and intestine. Exploration of the common bile duct is
an extremely delicate procedure that requires micro-sutures to be placed in the
common duct. Most surgeons will not do this procedure laparoscopically because
of its difficulty. This usually results in a conversion to open technique or
another surgical or delicate gastrointestinal endoscopic procedure to extract
the stones. With our technology, we believe that the surgeon will have expanded
capability to deal with complicated cholecystectomies and can avoid subjecting
the patient to a second procedure.

Nissen Fundoplication. Nissen fundoplication is a general
surgical procedure that is performed to correct esophageal reflux. Esophageal
reflux disease is a digestive disorder that affects the muscle connecting the
esophagus with the stomach. As an elective procedure, Nissen fundoplication is
currently performed on only a small fraction of candidates who suffer from this
condition because the open surgical procedure is quite invasive. An MIS
alternative exists, but there are only a limited number of surgeons skilled in
the procedure. We believe that our technology will significantly improve the
ease of performing the Nissen procedure through ports. Specifically, our
technology will address the two most difficult steps in this procedure, which
are made more difficult by existing MIS techniques, esophageal dissection and
suturing of the fundus of the stomach. If adoption of our technology becomes
widespread for Nissen procedures, we believe that the number of surgeons able to
perform a Nissen procedure using port-based techniques will increase. Further,
we expect that the widespread availability of a port-based approach may
significantly expand the number of surgeries performed.

Colon Resection. Removal of the colon or large bowel is a
common general surgical procedure done for both benign and malignant disease.
Colon resection is accomplished in a variety of ways by removing all or part of
the colon. These procedures are complicated and involve resecting a portion of
diseased tissue and then re-anastomosing the two ends of the colon to re-establish
continuity of intestinal flow. When using existing MIS techniques, the
challenge is to have enough manipulating capability to perform fine dissection
of the colon and then to be able to sew or staple the ends of the bowel to
accomplish the re-anastomosis. The MIS procedure is currently performed by only
a small fraction of general surgeons. By making dissection significantly more
precise, we believe that our products will allow port-based colon resection to
be performed more widely.

Hernia Repair. An inguinal hernia is a condition in which
tissue protrudes through the wall of the pelvis. It is caused by a defect or
weakness in the lining covering the pelvic region. Repair of inguinal hernia is
the second most common procedure done in general surgery. There are a variety of
hernia procedures available that use both open and MIS techniques. However, the
lack of precise dissection capability inhibits adoption of the MIS procedures.
Specifically, the delicate dissection of some of the structures and the
peritoneal sac, which often adheres to the pelvic anatomy, is very difficult for
surgeons to accomplish using MIS techniques. We believe that our technology will
encourage surgeons to convert hernia procedures to the port-based approach by
removing the training barrier that limits its adoption.

Gynecologic Surgery

General Gynecology. Laparoscopy has been used for several
decades in a large number of diagnostic infertility procedures. Although there
are a variety of therapeutic infertility procedures that can currently be
performed by some gynecologists using existing MIS techniques, these procedures
are relatively difficult to perform using existing MIS tools because of the lack
of tissue control, inability to perform fine dissection, and limited suturing
capability. We believe that our technology will provide gynecologists with the
ability to do sophisticated procedures such as tubal re-anastomosis and
dissection of ovarian cysts, as well as common procedures such as surgical
removal of an ovary or fallopian tube.

Hysterectomy. Removal of the uterus is one of the most
commonly performed surgeries in gynecology and it can be done by using open or
MIS techniques. Like colon resection, it demands a significant degree of tissue
manipulation in the dissection and ligation, or tying, of blood vessels,
ligaments and other pelvic structures. Further, laparoscopic techniques used in
this procedure increase the risk of injury to the ureters, which are vital
structures that provide the conduit for urine between the kidney and bladder. It
is often difficult to ensure the identification and prevention of injury to the
ureters and bladder with conventional MIS instruments because of the limited
angles at which these instruments can be positioned. We believe that our
products will increase the surgeon's dexterity in this procedure and, as a
result, will have a significant impact on safety, operating time, and rate of
adoption of port-based techniques in hysterectomy.

Bladder Neck Suspension. Bladder incontinence is a widespread
condition affecting middle aged women, which can be treated surgically with a
procedure known as bladder neck suspension. This procedure involves elevation of
the bladder neck by suspension with sutures, surgically recreating the normal
angle of the urethra and re-establishing bladder sphincter control. The
procedure works well in open surgery and is the "gold standard" for correction
of bladder incontinence. However, because of its long recovery time, most
candidates are discouraged from undergoing the procedure using open surgical
technique. Instead, they use adult diapers for their incontinence, which is an
embarrassment and inconvenience. Bladder neck suspension can currently be done
laparoscopically but is difficult to perform because of the need to suture at
awkward angles using existing MIS instruments. We believe our technology may
provide a better solution for suturing the bladder neck and would represent an
advance in the ease of performing incontinence surgery.

Orthopedic Surgery

Arthroscopy. Many knee surgeries are accomplished by an
MIS technique called arthroscopy. This technique is well accepted in the
surgical community. However, many of the more sophisticated maneuvers in
arthroscopy, such as suturing torn meniscal tissue, are very difficult with
existing MIS instruments. The meniscus is a structure located in the knee joint
that provides a surface and cushion upon which the bones of the knee joint can
move. We believe that our technology and the capabilities of our EndoWrist
instruments will increase the ease with which complex arthroscopic procedures
such as advanced knee and shoulder arthroscopy can be performed.

Spinal Surgery. Disc removal and spinal fusion are common
procedures performed in open spinal surgery. MIS techniques where surgeons
approach the spine through the abdomen and use laparoscopic methods to expose
the anterior portion of the spine and lumbar disc space are just emerging. This
procedure requires both delicate and precise dissection and retraction of
tissue, and would benefit greatly from the enhanced capabilities offered by the

da Vinci

Surgical System. We believe that our technology may make this
procedure safer, easier, more precise, and allow more surgeons to perform it
with confidence.

Cardiothoracic Surgery

Internal Mammary Artery Dissection. In a coronary artery
bypass graft procedure used in cardiac surgery, a blocked coronary artery is
bypassed with a graft. When available, an artery from the chest called the
internal mammary artery is dissected from its natural position and grafted into
place to perform the bypass. Because the internal mammary artery is located on
the underside of the anterior surface of the chest, dissection of the vessel is
challenging using existing surgical instruments through the three- to five-inch
incision currently used in a coronary artery bypass graft procedure. Our
products have multiple joints that emulate the surgeon's shoulders and elbows,
allowing exact positioning of the instruments inside the patient's chest. In
addition, the EndoWrist joints permit the surgeon to reach behind the tissues
for easier dissection of the internal mammary artery. Thus, we believe that the
internal mammary artery can be dissected with greater ease and precision using
our technology.

Coronary Anastomosis. Coronary artery bypass graft surgery
demands that the surgeon delicately dissect and precisely suture very small
structures, which are less than two millimeters in diameter, under significant
magnification. These procedures are difficult when performed in open surgery.
They are even more difficult when performed using an endoscopic or limited
incision approach, and extraordinarily difficult to perform when the heart is
beating. As a result, this procedure is typically done as open surgery by
stopping the heart and using a heart/lung bypass machine. Our technology is
designed to allow surgeons to perform scaled instrument movements that can be
even more precise than the movements used in open surgery, thus enabling precise
suturing of single and multiple coronary vessels on a stopped or beating heart.

Mitral and Aortic Valve Repair/Replacement. Valve repair and
replacement surgeries are challenging even when using open surgical techniques.
Significant exposure of the surgical field is essential to the identification
and precise manipulation of valves and other structures inside the heart, and is
key to successful surgical outcomes with minimal complications. Motion scaling
allows a surgeon using our

da Vinci

Surgical System to maneuver
instruments inside the patient even more precisely than is possible in open
surgery. Our system has already enabled heart valve repairs to be performed
through small ports in a manner that could not have been accomplished with open
surgery. Replacement of valves currently requires a small incision, even if the
majority of the procedure is eventually performed through ports using our
technology, because the replacement valve itself is too large to be inserted
into the chest through a port. However, new valve designs that can be delivered
through ports are being developed, and the small incisions necessary today to
deliver a replacement valve to the heart may eventually not be required,
allowing a surgeon using the

da Vinci

Surgical System to replace a valve
entirely using ports.

Thoracoscopy. A number of procedures performed in the thorax,
or chest cavity, can be accomplished by minimally invasive methods. These
methods are generally referred to as thoracoscopic procedures. They include
various types of lung resection, biopsy procedures, node dissections, nerve
resections and esophageal surgery. Conventional thoracoscopic tools have all the
limitations of conventional laparoscopic tools, such as "backward" movement and
limited range of motion. The capability of our technology to operate dexterously
in the often very small and restrictive space of the chest cavity is believed to
offer significant clinical value in the performance of advanced thoracoscopic
procedures.

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION

We market our products through a direct sales force in
the United States and most of Europe. We have also entered into agreements with
distributors in Italy and Japan. Our marketing and sales strategy in the United
States and Europe involves the use of a combination of area sales managers,
technical sales representatives and clinical training specialists. As of
December 31, 2001, we had 70 employees in sales and marketing. We expect to
significantly increase our sales and marketing force as we expand our business.

The role of our technical sales representatives is to educate
physicians and surgeons on the advantages of Intuitive surgery and the clinical
applications that our technology makes possible. We also train our technical
sales representatives to educate hospital management on the potential benefits
of early adoption of our technology and the potential for increased local market
share that may result from Intuitive surgery. Once a hospital has installed a

da Vinci

Surgical System, our sales force will help introduce the
technology to other surgical specialties within the hospital.

Clinical training specialists provide training and support to
physicians and other hospital staff. We employ service technicians to install
our

da Vinci

™ Surgical Systems and to provide non-clinical
technical expertise, service and maintenance. We believe that this combination
of technical sales representatives, clinical training specialists and service
technicians provides an appropriate balance of professional selling skills while
maintaining an appropriate level of technical expertise in the field.

Our

da Vinci

Surgical System has a lengthy sales and
purchase order cycle because it is a major capital item and requires the
approval of senior management at purchasing institutions. Particularly during
the period in which our sales volume is low, this may contribute to fluctuations
in our quarterly operating results.

TECHNOLOGY

Using key technologies, we have designed the

da Vinci

Surgical System to ensure intuitive control and fail-safe operation of the
system. The system updates arm and instrument positions over 1,000 times per
second, thereby ensuring real-time connectivity between the surgeon's hand
movements and the movements of the instrument tips. A backup battery is included
in the system that can power the system for more than 20 minutes in case of
power loss or fluctuation. This 20-minute period is believed to be sufficient
either to reestablish the power supply or for the hospital back-up power system
to become effective.

Monitoring the operation of the system at all times is a
network of approximately 20 micro-controllers that checks for proper system
performance. System misuse or system fault can be detected and the system can be
transitioned to a safe state in micro-seconds. The system also includes a sensor
that detects the presence of the surgeon's head in the viewer. If the surgeon
removes his or her head from the viewer, the system automatically disengages and
locks the instruments in place to prevent their inadvertent movement.

The instrument controls at the surgeon's console have eight
degrees of freedom of motion that allow the surgeon to move each hand through a
workspace approximately one cubic foot in volume. These degrees of freedom allow
the surgeon to orient his or her hands without limitation. The instrument
controls are constructed with very low friction cables and gear transmissions to
ensure smooth operation. Furthermore, critical components are constructed of
magnesium and titanium to provide high mechanical stiffness and low inertia,
ensuring a light and responsive feel to the surgeon.

The electromechanical arms of the patient-side cart are
gravitationally counterbalanced to allow for smooth, easy and safe positioning
of the instruments in the patient. The arms have seven degrees of freedom,
allowing for control of position, orientation, translation and grip of the
instrument, all inside the body. Redundant sensors are designed to ensure fail-safe
operation of the instrument tips.

Unlike other 3-D systems, our InSite vision system relies on
two entirely separate vision channels. Two eyepieces are linked by a precisely
designed optical assembly to two high resolution, and high contrast medical
grade monitors, which have been specially designed to have a high visual update
rate that eliminates flicker and thus, reduces eye fatigue. Our stereo endoscope
uses two separate high-resolution optical channels to improve image clarity. The
stereo images pass through video processing electronics that provide specialized
edge enhancement and noise reduction. A foot switch at the surgeon's console
operates a focus controller on the endoscope. The endoscope self-regulates the
temperature of its tip to eliminate fogging during procedures.

Our EndoWrist instruments use a wrist joint architecture
driven by tiny but very high strength, flexible tungsten cables. Each tungsten
cable is a "metal rope" constructed from over 200 fibers that are each less than
one thousandth of an inch in diameter. These cables are similar in function to
the tendons of a human wrist and are used to drive fluid motions of the wrist
joint. The instruments each contain a custom memory chip that records and stores
data each time the instrument is placed on the system. The chip contains
encrypted security codes to protect against use of non-Intuitive Surgical
instruments so that only our instruments will work with the

da Vinci

Surgical System. The chip identifies the type of tool being inserted so that
different instrument types can be controlled uniquely by the system. The chip
also records usage of the instrument and expires the instrument after its
prescribed life.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Since our inception in late 1995, we have encountered and
solved a number of technical hurdles. We have patented and continue to pursue
patent and other intellectual property protection for the technology that we
have developed to overcome such hurdles. In addition to developing our own
patent portfolio, we have spent significant resources in acquiring exclusive
license rights to necessary and desirable patents and other intellectual
property from SRI International and IBM, who were early leaders in applying
robotics to surgery. One of the strengths of our portfolio is that the licensed
SRI International and IBM patents have original filing dates as early as January
1992 and June 1991, respectively. We have also exclusively licensed a patent
application from MIT concerning robotic surgery. In April 2000, we exclusively
licensed an extensive minimally invasive heart surgery patent portfolio from
Heartport, Inc. in the field of robotic surgery. These patents cover many
different forms of minimally invasive robotic surgery, including single- and
multi-vessel coronary artery bypass grafts, heart valve repair and replacement
and beating heart stabilization. In June 2001, we entered into a non-exclusive
patent license with Olympus Optical Co., Ltd. of Japan for several robotic
surgery patents.  As of February 19, 2002, we hold exclusive field-of-use
licenses for over 70 United States patents and approximately 40 foreign patents,
and own outright 15 U.S. patents that expire no earlier than 2016. We also own
or have licensed numerous pending United States and foreign patent applications,
several of which were recently allowed. Our patents and patent applications
relate to a number of important aspects of our technology, including our
surgeon's console, electromechanical arms, vision system and our EndoWrist
instruments. We intend to continue to file additional patent applications to
seek protection for other proprietary aspects of our technology.

Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain
patent and copyright protection for our products and processes, to preserve our
trade secrets, to operate without infringing or violating valid and enforceable
proprietary rights of third parties, and to prevent others from infringing our
proprietary rights. We intend to take action to protect our intellectual
property rights when we believe doing so is necessary and appropriate. In
addition, our strategy is to actively pursue patent protection in the United
States and in foreign jurisdictions for technology that we believe is
proprietary and that offers a potential competitive advantage, and to license
appropriate technologies when necessary or desirable. We cannot be certain that
we will be able to obtain adequate protection for our technology or licenses on
acceptable terms. Furthermore, if any protection we obtain is reduced or
eliminated, others could use our intellectual property without compensating us,
resulting in harm to our business. In addition, the laws of certain foreign
countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do
the laws of the United States. See "Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Factors Affecting Operating
Results." Others may assert that our products infringe their intellectual
property rights, which may cause us to engage in costly disputes and, if we are
not successful in defending ourselves, could also cause us to pay substantial
damages and prohibit us from selling our products. In this regard, see "Item 3:
Legal Proceedings" for a description of pending cases and interferences before
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office regarding our

da Vinci

Surgical
System.

SRI International License Agreement

After receiving funding in 1990 from the U.S. Advanced
Research Projects Agency, SRI International conducted research to develop a
"telesurgery" system to allow surgeons to perform surgery on the battlefield
from a remote location. SRI International developed the precise
electromechanics, force-feedback systems, vision systems and surgical
instruments needed to build and demonstrate a prototype system that could
accurately reproduce a surgeon's hand motions with remote surgical instruments.
In 1995, John G. Freund, M.D., one of our founders, acquired an option to
license SRI International's telesurgery technology, which resulted in SRI
International granting us a license.

Under the terms of our license agreement with SRI
International, we have an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use the
SRI International technology developed before September 12, 1997, including all
patents and patent applications resulting from such work, in the field of
manipulating tissues and medical devices in animal and human medicine, including
surgery, laparoscopic surgery and microsurgery. We also have the right of first
negotiation with respect to any SRI International technology developed in these
areas before September 12, 1999 but after September 12, 1997.

Our license with SRI International will terminate upon the
last expiration of the patents licensed from SRI International or December 20,
2012, whichever is later. Currently, the last patent expiration date is in 2016,
although this could change. SRI International may terminate the license in the
event of a material, uncured breach of our obligations. In the event SRI
International terminates the license, we cannot assure you that the necessary
licenses could be reacquired from SRI International on satisfactory terms, if at
all.

IBM License Agreement

IBM conducted research on the application of computers
and robotics to surgery during the late 1980s and early 1990s. IBM performed
some of this work in conjunction with the Johns Hopkins Medical Center. Our
license agreement with IBM covers a number of technologies related to the
application of computers and robotics to surgery. Under the terms of this
agreement, we have an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to a number of
IBM patents and patent applications in the field of surgery performed on animals
and humans. We also have a non-exclusive license from IBM to practice in the
areas of neurology, ophthalmology, orthopedics and biopsies. Under the license,
we were obligated to make two payments to IBM, which were tied to revenue
milestones.  The final payment became payable in December 2001 and was paid in
March 2002. The IBM license agreement will terminate upon the last expiration of
the licensed patents. Currently, the last patent expiration date is in 2016,
although this could change. IBM could have terminated the license had we failed
to make the required payments. IBM may terminate the license in the event of a
material, uncured breach of our obligations.  In the event IBM terminates the
license agreement, we cannot assure you that necessary licenses could be
reacquired from IBM on satisfactory terms, if at all.

In March 2001, consistent with the terms of our license
agreement with IBM, Intuitive and IBM jointly sued Computer Motion, Inc. in the
U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging infringement of U.S.
Patent No. 6,201,984.  Trial in this case is presently set for the third quarter
of 2002.  See "Item 3: Legal Proceedings" for a more detailed description of
this litigation.

MIT License Agreement

After receiving funding from the U.S. Department of the
Army, several researchers at MIT conducted research on various aspects of
robotic surgical systems. As a result of that work, several patent applications
were filed. Both MIT and the Army waived their rights to all but one of these
applications, which the inventors ultimately assigned to us. MIT owns the other
application. Under the terms of our license agreement with MIT, we have an
exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to this patent application in the
field of medical devices. The MIT license will terminate upon the last
expiration of any patents issuing from the licensed patent application. MIT also
has the right to terminate the MIT license in the event of a material, uncured
breach of our obligations under the license. In the event MIT terminates the
license, we cannot assure you that we would be able to reacquire a license from
MIT on satisfactory terms, if at all.

Heartport, Inc. License Agreement

Since its inception in the early 1990s, Heartport, Inc.
has developed an extensive patent portfolio covering systems and methods for
performing many different aspects of minimally invasive heart surgery, including
single- and multi-vessel coronary artery bypass grafts, heart valve repair and
replacement, and beating heart stabilization. In April 2000, we acquired an
exclusive, worldwide license in the field of robotic surgery to much of
Heartport's portfolio, including many issued U.S. patents so far and many still-pending
U.S. and foreign applications. The license is royalty-free unless we
sell instruments for robotic surgery procedures that are not operated by the
robotic surgery system, in which case we pay a small royalty.

Our license will terminate upon the last expiration of the
patents licensed from Heartport. Currently, the last patent expiration date is
in 2015, although this could change. Heartport may terminate the license in the
event of a material, uncured breach of our obligations. In the event Heartport
terminates the license, we cannot assure you that the necessary or desirable
licenses could be reacquired from Heartport on satisfactory terms, if at all.
Intuitive's exclusive license survives Johnson & Johnson's acquisition of
Heartport.

In April 2001, Heartport became part of the Cardiovations
Division of Ethicon, Inc., a Johnson & Johnson Company.  Ethicon, Inc.
therefore is now Intuitive's licensor under the Heartport license.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Substantially all of our research and development activity is performed
internally. Our research and development team is divided into four groups:
software engineering, systems analysis, electrical engineering and mechanical
engineering. In addition, various members of the research and development team
support the design and development of the manufacturing processes used in
fabricating our products.

MANUFACTURING

Prior to February 2002, we leased a 13,000 square foot
manufacturing facility in Mountain View, California. We used this facility and
our manufacturing personnel to produce the systems and instruments that were
sold and used in clinical trials through December 2001. The manufacture of our
products is a complex operation involving a number of separate processes and
components.

In February 2002, we moved our manufacturing facility to
Sunnyvale, California.  We now lease approximately 18,000 square feet of
manufacturing space.

We purchase both custom and off-the-shelf components from a
large number of certified suppliers and subject them to stringent quality
specifications. We periodically conduct quality audits of suppliers and have
established a supplier certification program. Some of the components necessary
for the assembly of our products are currently provided to us by sole source
suppliers or single source suppliers. We purchase components through purchase
orders rather than long-term supply agreements and generally do not maintain
large volumes of inventory. The disruption or termination of the supply of
components could cause a significant increase in the costs of these components,
which could affect our profitability. A disruption or termination in the supply
of components could also result in our inability to meet demand for our
products, which could harm our ability to generate revenues, lead to customer
dissatisfaction and damage our reputation.

COMPETITION

We consider our primary competition to be existing open
or MIS surgical techniques. Our success depends in part on convincing hospitals,
surgeons and patients to convert procedures to Intuitive surgery from open or
existing MIS surgery.

We also face competition from several companies that are
developing new approaches and products for the minimally invasive surgery
market, and, in particular, minimally invasive cardiac surgery. Many of these
companies have an established presence in the field of MIS, including Boston
Scientific Corporation, CardioThoracic Systems, Inc., a division of Guidant
Corporation, C.R. Bard, Inc., Guidant Corporation, Heartport, Inc., Ethicon
Endo-Surgery, Inc., a division of Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic, Inc., and
United States Surgical Corporation, a division of Tyco International Ltd. If we
are unable to compete successfully with these companies our revenues will
suffer.

In addition, a limited number of companies are using robots
and computers in surgery, including Brock Rogers Surgical, Inc., Computer
Motion, Inc., Integrated Surgical Systems, Inc., Johns Hopkins University
Engineering Research Consortium, Maquet AG, MicroDexterity Systems, Inc.,
Armstrong Healthcare Ltd., and Ross-Hime Designs, Inc. Our revenues may be
reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and market products that are
more effective or less expensive than our products.

We believe that the primary competitive factors in the market
we address are capability, safety, efficacy, ease of use, price, quality,
reliability, and effective sales, support, training and service. The length of
time required for products to be developed and to receive regulatory and
reimbursement approval is also an important competitive factor.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

United States

Our products and operations are subject to extensive
and rigorous regulation by the FDA. The FDA regulates the research, testing,
manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, promotion,
distribution, and production of medical devices in the United States to ensure
that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their
intended uses. In addition, the FDA regulates the export of medical devices
manufactured in the United States to international markets.

Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the "FFDCA"),
medical devices are classified into one of three classes -- Class I, Class II or
Class III -- depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device
and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Our current
products are Class II medical devices.

Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness
can be assured by adherence to a set of guidelines, which include compliance
with the applicable portions of the FDA's Quality System Regulation ("QSR"),
facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events,
and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and
promotional materials (the "General Controls"). Some Class I devices also
require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification
process described below.

Class II devices are those which are subject to the General
Controls and most require premarket demonstration of adherence to certain
performance standards or other special controls, as specified by the FDA, and
clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for these
devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification procedure. For
most Class II devices, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket
notification submission, demonstrating that the device is "substantially
equivalent" to either:

(1) a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976,
the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted, or

(2) to another commercially available, similar device which
was subsequently cleared through the 510(k) process.

If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially
equivalent, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device. By
regulation, the FDA is required to clear a 510(k) within 90 days of submission
of the application. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer. The FDA
may require further information, including clinical data, to make a
determination regarding substantial equivalence. If the FDA determines that the
device, or its intended use, is not "substantially equivalent", the FDA will
place the device, or the particular use of the device, into Class III, and the
device sponsor must then fulfill much more rigorous premarketing requirements.

A Class III product is a product which has a new intended use
or uses advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to a use or
technology with respect to a legally marketed device. The safety and
effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be assured solely by the General
Controls and the other requirements described above. These devices almost always
require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.

Approval of a premarket approval application ("PMA") from the
FDA is required before marketing of a Class III product can proceed. The PMA
process is much more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. A
PMA application, which is intended to demonstrate that the device is safe and
effective, must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical
studies and human clinical trials and existing research material, and must
contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description
of the methods, facilities, and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed
labeling. Once the FDA determines that an application is sufficiently complete
to permit a substantive review, the FDA will accept the application for review.
The FDA, by statute and by regulation, has 180 days to review a filed PMA
application, although the review of an application frequently occurs over a
significantly longer period of time, sometimes up to several years. In approving
a PMA application or clearing a 510(k) application, the FDA may also require
some form of post-market surveillance, whereby the manufacturer follows certain
patient groups for a number of years and makes periodic reports to the FDA on
the clinical status of those patients when necessary to protect the public
health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.

When FDA approval of a Class I, Class II or Class III device
requires human clinical trials, and if the device presents a "significant risk"
(as defined by the FDA) to human health, the device sponsor is required to file
an investigational device exemption ("IDE") application with the FDA and obtain
IDE approval prior to commencing the human clinical trial. If the device is
considered a "non-significant" risk, IDE submission to the FDA is not required.
Instead, only approval from the Institutional Review Board overseeing the
clinical trial is required. Human clinical studies are generally required in
connection with approval of Class III devices and to a much lesser extent for
Class I and II devices.

In addition, our manufacturing processes are required to
comply with the FDA's Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) requirements contained
in its Quality System Regulation (QSR). The QSR covers, among other things, the
methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes,
controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, and shipping of the Company's
products. The QSR also requires maintenance of a device master record, device
history record, and complaint files. The Company's domestic facility, records,
and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by
the FDA.

In July 1997, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the surgeon's
console and patient cart to be used with only rigid endoscopes, blunt
dissectors, retractors and stabilizer instruments. In November 1997, we withdrew
a subsequent 510(k) submission covering additional instruments necessary for
performing most surgical procedures, including scissors, scalpels,
forceps/pickups, needle holders, clip appliers and electrocautery, after the FDA
indicated that substantial clinical data would be required to support
clearance.

In January 1999, we filed a 510(k) submission with clinical data, seeking
clearance for the

da Vinci

Surgical System and EndoWrist instruments for
laparoscopic surgical procedures. In May 1999, the FDA determined that our
products were not eligible for 510(k) clearance but would instead be required to
undergo the PMA approval process. On June 16, 1999, after review of the clinical
data on the use of our products in laparoscopic surgical procedures, the FDA's
General Surgery Advisory Panel recommended approval. In November 1999, we filed
a PMA application to commercialize our products for laparoscopic surgery, which
was accepted for review by the FDA in December 1999. In March 2000, the FDA
inspected our Mountain View facility and determined, after conducting an
extensive audit, that our facility and manufacturing practices were consistent
with Good Manufacturing Processes.  In June 2000, the FDA determined that the
PMA approval process was inappropriate for the

da Vinci

Surgical System and
re-classified the device as class II.  The Premarket Approval Application submitted
in November 1999 was closed and the original 510(k) application reactivated.  In
July 2000, we received a letter from  the FDA informing us of their decision to
clear the

da Vinci

Surgical System for use in laparoscopic surgery.  The
decision to reclassify the device to class II also means that future submissions
for the

da Vinci

Surgical System may be reviewed under the premarket
notification process unless changes to the intended use significantly change the
safety and effectiveness of the device, in which case a PMA may be required.

Subsequent to Intuitive's July 2000 clearance of the

da Vinci

Surgical
System, we have obtained additional 510(k) clearances from the FDA to include
non-cardiac thoracoscopic surgical procedures (March 2001) and laparoscopic
radical prostatectomy (May 2001).  In November 2000, we submitted an
investigational device exemption application to the FDA requesting permission to
conduct a multi-center clinical evaluation of the

da Vinci

Surgical System for
mitral valve repair.  In December 2000, we received a letter from the FDA
approving the trials for mitral valve repair.  We have commenced this clinical
trial and, if completed, we expect to submit a 510(k) to the FDA requesting
permission to expand the intended use for the

da Vinci

Surgical System to
include mitral valve repair.  In July 2001, we submitted an investigational
device exemption application to the FDA requesting permission to conduct a
multi-center evaluation of the

da Vinci

Surgical System for atrial septal defect
closure.  In August 2001, we received a letter from the FDA approving trials for
atrial septal defect closure.  We have commenced this clinical trial and, if
completed, we expect to submit a 510(k) to the FDA requesting permission to
expand the intended use for the

da Vinci

Surgical System to include atrial
septal defect closure.  In January 2001, we submitted an investigational device
exemption application to the FDA requesting permission to conduct a multi-center
evaluation of the

da Vinci

Surgical System for totally endoscopic coronary
artery bypass grafting.  In April 2001, we received a letter from the FDA
approving trials for totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass grafting.  We
have commenced this clinical trial and, if completed, we expect to submit a
510(k) to the FDA requesting permission to expand the intended use for the da
Vinci

Surgical System to include totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass
grafting.  While each of these trials is in progress, we cannot assure you that
such trials will produce clinical data adequate to support a 510(k) application.

We are subject to inspection and market surveillance by the FDA to determine
compliance with regulatory requirements. If the FDA finds that we have failed to
comply, the agency can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging
from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions. The FDA also has the
authority to request repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any medical
device manufactured or distributed by us. Our failure to comply with applicable
requirements could lead to an enforcement action that may have an adverse effect
on our financial condition and results of operations.

California Regulation

The state of California requires that we obtain a
license to manufacture medical devices and subjects us to periodic inspection.
Our facilities and manufacturing processes were inspected in February 1998. We
passed the inspection and received our device manufacturing license from the
Food and Drug Branch (FDB) of the California Department of Health Service in
March 1998. In March 2002, our facilities and manufacturing processes in our
Sunnyvale facility were re-inspected by the FDB.  We passed this audit and are
awaiting issuance of our device manufacturing license renewal.

Foreign Regulation

In order for us to market our products in other countries, we must
obtain regulatory approvals and comply with extensive safety and quality
regulations in other countries. These regulations, including the requirements
for approvals or clearance and the time required for regulatory review, vary
from country to country. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in any foreign
country in which we plan to market our products may harm our ability to generate
revenue and harm our business.

Commercialization of medical devices in Europe is regulated by the European
Union. The European Union presently requires that all medical products bear the
CE mark, an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and
demonstrated clinical effectiveness. Compliance with the Medical Device
Directive, as certified by a recognized European Notified Body, permits the
manufacturer to affix the CE mark on its products. In January 1999, following an
audit of our quality system and Mountain View facility, we received permission
from DGM, our Notified Body and agent of the Danish Government, to affix the CE
mark to our

da Vinci

Surgical System and EndoWrist instruments for general
surgical use, Class II-b. Additional CE approvals for use of our

da Vinci

Surgical System and EndoWrist instruments in cardiac surgery were received in
September 1999 and February 2000, Class III.

If we modify existing products or develop new products in the future, we will
need to apply for permission to affix the CE mark to such products. In addition,
we will be subject to annual regulatory audits in order to maintain the CE mark
permissions we have already obtained. We cannot be certain that we will be able
to obtain permission to affix the CE mark for new or modified products or that
we will continue to meet the quality and safety standards required to maintain
the permissions we have already received. If we are unable to maintain
permission to affix the CE mark to our products, we will no longer be able to
sell our products in member countries of the European Union.

The Ministry of Health and Welfare regulates
commercialization and reimbursement of medical devices in Japan. We have
developed a clinical trial strategy for laparoscopic surgical use of the

da
Vinci

Surgical System and EndoWrist instruments with our commercial partner in
Japan.  In May 2001 the proposed clinical trial strategy was approved by the
Ministry of Health and Welfare.  We commenced this clinical trial in June 2001
and, if completed, we expect to submit appropriate documentation to the Ministry
of Health and Welfare requesting permission to commercialize the

da Vinci

Surgical System for conduct of laparoscopic surgical procedures in Japan.  We
are currently in the process of developing a cardiothoracic surgical clinical
strategy with our commercial partner to facilitate conduct of an evaluation
ultimately permitting expansion of the intended use for

da Vinci

Surgical System
to include various cardiothoracic surgical procedures.  However, we cannot
assure you that we will succeed in procuring the required approvals to market
our products in Japan or elsewhere, even if we develop a strategy and ultimately
apply for these approvals.

THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT

In the United States and international markets where we
intend to sell our products, the government and health insurance companies
together are responsible for hospital and surgeon reimbursement for virtually
all surgical procedures. Governments and insurance companies generally reimburse
hospitals and physicians for surgery when the procedures are considered non-
experimental and non-cosmetic. In the United States, reimbursement for medical
procedures under the Medicare and Medicaid programs is administered by Centers
for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Generally speaking, procedure codes are
assigned by the American Medical Association using the copyrighted Current
Procedural Terminology codes, which are in turn incorporated in the Medicare and
Medicaid programs coding system. Applications for new procedure codes may be
submitted to the American Medical Association.

Governments and insurance companies carefully review and
increasingly challenge the prices charged for medical products and services.
Reimbursement rates from private companies vary depending on the procedure
performed, the third-party involved, the insurance plan involved, and other
factors. Medicare reimburses hospitals a prospectively determined fixed amount
for the costs associated with an in-patient hospitalization based on the
patient's discharge diagnosis, and reimburses physicians a prospectively
determined fixed amount based on the procedure performed. This fixed amount is
paid regardless of the actual costs incurred by the hospital or physician in
furnishing the care and is unrelated to the specific devices used in that
procedure. Thus, any reimbursements that hospitals obtain for performing surgery
with our products will generally have to cover any additional costs that
hospitals incur in purchasing our products.

Domestic institutions will typically bill the services
performed with our products to various third-party payors, such as Medicare,
Medicaid and other government programs and private insurance plans. Because the

da Vinci

Surgical System has been cleared for commercial distribution in
the United States by the FDA, Medicare reimbursement is available for use of the
device in laparoscopic and thoracoscopic procedures and procedures conducted
under an approved investigational device exemption application. We believe that
the additional procedures we intend to target are generally already reimbursable
by government agencies and insurance companies. If hospitals do not obtain
sufficient reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures performed with
our products, or if governmental and private payors' policies do not permit
reimbursement for surgical procedures performed using our products, we may not
be able to generate the revenues necessary to support our business. In such
circumstances, we may have to apply to the American Medical Association for a
unique Current Procedural Terminology code covering computer-enhanced surgery.
If an application for a unique code is required, reimbursement for any use of
our products may be unavailable until an appropriate code is granted. The
application process, from filing until adoption of a new code, can take two or
more years.

In countries outside the United States, reimbursement is
obtained from various sources, including governmental authorities, private
health insurance plans, and labor unions. In most foreign countries, private
insurance systems may also offer payments for some therapies. Additionally,
health maintenance organizations are emerging in certain European countries. To
effectively conduct our business, we may need to seek international
reimbursement approvals, and we do not know if these required approvals will be
obtained in a timely manner or at all.

Any regulatory or legislative developments in domestic or
foreign markets that eliminate or reduce reimbursement rates for procedures
performed with our products could harm our ability to sell our products or cause
downward pressure on the prices of our products, either of which would affect
our ability to generate the revenues necessary to support our business.

EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2001, we had 241
employees, 50 of whom were engaged directly in research and development, 81 in
manufacturing and service and 110 in marketing, sales, and administrative
activities. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining
agreement, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.

ITEM 2: PROPERTIES

We leased approximately 50,000 square feet in Mountain
View, California.  The lease expired in February 2002 and was not renewed.

Effective January 2002, we lease approximately 83,000 square feet in
Sunnyvale, California. The facility is leased through April 2007, and we have an
option to extend the lease for an additional five-year term.

ITEM 3: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On May 10, 2000, Computer Motion, Inc. filed a lawsuit in
United States District Court for the Central District of California (Case No.
CV00-4988 CBM) alleging that by making, using, selling or offering for sale our

da Vinci

Surgical System, we are infringing United States Patent Numbers
5,524,180, 5,762,458, 5,815,640, 5,855,583, 5,878,193,  5,907,664, and
6,001,108, in willful disregard of Computer Motion's patent rights. On June 1,
2000, Computer Motion amended its lawsuit to allege that we also infringe U.S.
Patent Number 6,063,095. On October 30, 2000, Computer Motion filed a motion
seeking to add U.S. Patent Number 6,102,850 to the litigation. Each of these
nine patents concerns methods and devices for conducting various aspects of
robotic surgery. Until February 2001, the litigation was proceeding in the early
stages of discovery, with no trial date set. In February 2001, in response to
our request, the District Court stayed -- put on hold -- all proceedings in the
litigation because of the declaration by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
("PTO") of three "interference" proceedings between a single SRI patent
application exclusively licensed to us and three of Computer Motion's patents
(see next paragraph). In February 2002, the District Court extended the stay
through a status conference presently scheduled for late March 2002 at which the
parties will discuss with the Court the propriety of further extending the stay
through decisions by the PTO in the interferences. The Computer Motion action
seeks damages based upon the making, using, selling and offering for sale of our
products and processes, and seeks to enjoin our continued activities relating to
these products. This action subjects us to potential liability for damages,
including treble damages, and could require us to cease making, using or selling
the affected products, or to obtain a license in order to continue to
manufacture, use or sell the affected products. While we continue to believe we
have multiple meritorious defenses to this action, we cannot assure you that we
ultimately will prevail on any issue in the litigation or that we will be able
to successfully defend Computer Motion's charges, nor can we provide assurance
that any license required would be made available on commercially acceptable
terms, if at all. Failure to successfully defend against the Computer Motion
action could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Due
to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the
ultimate outcome of this matter at this time and, therefore, cannot estimate the
range of possible loss.

On December 7 and 8, 2000, the PTO declared three
interferences between a single SRI patent application exclusively licensed to
Intuitive and three of Computer Motion's patents, Numbers 5,855,583, 5,878,193
and 5,907,664.  An interference is a proceeding within the U.S. Patent Office to
resolve questions regarding the patentability of inventions and who first
invented subject matter claimed by two or more patents or patent applications.
These three interferences resulted from requests for interference filed in May
through July 1999.  Because the SRI patent application licensed to Intuitive was
filed in January 1992 and Computer Motion's three patents were filed no earlier
than August 1992 and as late as February 1996, SRI/Intuitive is the "Senior
Party" in each interference. As "Junior Party," Computer Motion bears the burden
of proving that it is entitled to keep its patents.  In papers filed with the
PTO in March 2001, Computer Motion admitted that SRI/Intuitive filed for its
involved patent application before Computer Motion thought of its inventions.
We therefore anticipate that a second "priority" phase of each
interference to determine which party invented the technology first will be
unnecessary.  During the first half of 2001, the parties filed over 20 motions
in the three interferences.  On October 10, 2001, the PTO held a hearing on all
motions filed in all three interferences.  Decisions regarding all of the
motions are presently expected by the end of April 2002.

In September 2000, we filed a Notice of Opposition in the
European Patent Office ("EPO") challenging European Patent No. 653,922, which
was issued to Computer Motion in 1999 and is related to several of the patents
now involved in the California litigation and the interference proceedings. An
Opposition proceeding allows the EPO to determine whether the challenged patent
should be revoked in its entirety, should be amended, or should remain
unaltered. In its Notice of Opposition, Intuitive cited numerous prior art
references not cited to the EPO during the '922 patent's original prosecution.
A hearing is expected sometime in 2002.

On March 30, 2001, Intuitive and International Business
Machines Corporation ("IBM") jointly filed suit against Computer
Motion, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware.  The
complaint alleges that by continuing to make, use, sell, and offer for sale its
AESOP and ZEUS voice-controlled products, Computer Motion willfully infringes
U.S. Patent No. 6,201,984.  The '984 patent which concerns various aspects of
voice control of surgical instruments issued to IBM in early March 2001 and is
exclusively licensed to us.  The '984 patent predates by several years Computer
Motion's development of voice-controlled surgical robots.  Because Computer
Motion's voice-controlled HERMES product interfaces with the AESOP and ZEUS
products, HERMES is also implicated in the patent infringement complaint.  Trial
is presently set for the third quarter of 2002.  The Court so far has denied
Computer Motion's request to add its own U.S. Patent No. 6,244,809 to this
Delaware litigation and has refused to entertain Computer Motion's allegations
that we infringe the '809 patent by making, using, selling and offering for sale
our

da Vinci

Surgical System.  The Delaware Court has also refused
Computer Motion's request to transfer the litigation to California.

On September 1, 2000, Brookhill-Wilk 1, LLC ("Wilk") filed a
lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York (Case No. 00 Civ. 6599 (NRB) alleging that by making, using, selling or
offering for sale our

da Vinci

Surgical System, we are infringing U.S.
Patent Nos. 5,217,003 and 5,368,015 in willful disregard of Wilk's patent
rights. These patents concern methods and devices for "remote" surgery. In March
2001, Wilk withdrew its assertion of infringement of the '015 patent against
Intuitive, leaving only the '003 patent at issue in the suit. On November 8,
2001, the District Court granted summary judgment of noninfringement of the '003
patent in our favor and dismissed Wilk's complaint in its entirety.  Wilk has
since filed a notice with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to
appeal the summary judgment ruling. Briefing on the appeal should conclude in
mid-2002, with a hearing date possible towards the end of 2002 or in early 2003.
We believe the appellate court will uphold the summary judgment of
noninfringement.  If we lose Wilk's suit against us, it will hurt our
competitive position, may be costly to us and may prevent us from selling our
products. In addition, if we lose the patent suit, we may need to obtain from
Wilk a license to this technology if we are to continue to market our products
that have been found to infringe Wilk's patents. This license could be
expensive, which could seriously harm our business. We believe that we have
multiple meritorious defenses in this action. However, litigation is
unpredictable and we may not prevail with any of these defenses. If Wilk is
successful in its suit against us and is unwilling to grant us a license, we may
be required to stop selling our products that are found to infringe Wilk's
patents unless we can redesign them so they do not infringe Wilk's patents,
which we may be unable to do. In addition, if we lose the patent suit, we could
be required to pay Wilk damages, including treble damages, which could be
substantial and harm our financial position.

ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis should be read in
conjunction with "Selected Consolidated Financial Data" and our consolidated
financial statements and the related notes.

Except for historical information, the discussion in this report contains
forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as
statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. The cautionary
statements made in this report should be read as applying to all related
forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this report. Our actual
results could differ materially from those discussed here. Factors that could
cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in "-- Factors
Affecting Operating Results" below as well as those discussed elsewhere.

OVERVIEW

We design, manufacture, and market the

da Vinci

Surgical System, an advanced surgical system that we believe represents a
new generation of surgery. The

da Vinci

Surgical System consists of a
surgeon's console, a patient-side cart, a high performance vision system and
proprietary instruments. The

da Vinci

Surgical

System seamlessly
translates the surgeon's natural hand movements on instrument controls at a
console into corresponding micro-movements of instruments positioned inside the
patient through small puncture incisions, or ports. We believe that the

da
Vinci

Surgical System is the only commercially available technology that can
provide the surgeon with the intuitive control, range of motion, fine tissue
manipulation capability and 3-D visualization characteristic of open surgery,
while simultaneously allowing the surgeon to work through the small ports of
minimally invasive surgery or MIS. By placing computer-enhanced technology
between the surgeon and the patient, we believe that the

da Vinci

Surgical System enables surgeons to perform better surgery while giving
patients the benefits of MIS surgery, including decreased trauma and
postoperative pain, reduced surgical complications, shorter hospital stays and
lower total treatment costs.

In 1999, we obtained permission from the European Union to
affix the CE Mark to the

da Vinci

Surgical System and EndoWrist
instruments for general surgical and cardiac surgical use. Based on this
approval, we recognized revenue for the first time in the second quarter of 1999
for the sale of our products. In July 2000, we received clearance from the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, to begin commercialization of our

da
Vinci

Surgical System in the United States for use in laparoscopic surgical
procedures. In March 2001, we received clearance from the FDA for use of our

da Vinci

Surgical System in non-cardiac thoracoscopic surgical
procedures.  In May 2001, we received market clearance from the FDA to promote
use of the

da Vinci

Surgical System for performance of laparoscopic
radical prostatectomy procedures.

To date, the majority of our revenues have come from the
sales of the

da Vinci

Surgical System, which are high revenue dollar
items. A smaller percentage of revenues have come from sales of EndoWrist
instruments and accessories, which are lower revenue dollar items. A small
percentage of revenue also comes from ongoing service of installed

da Vinci

Surgical Systems. Although we expect the majority of our revenues to
continue to come from the sale of

da Vinci

Surgical Systems over the next
few years, the percentage of revenue from our EndoWrist instruments and service
should continue to increase. Due to the high dollar revenue per system sold,
small variations in system unit sales may cause revenue to vary significantly
from quarter to quarter. During the useful life of each installed

da Vinci

Surgical System, we expect to generate recurring revenue through sales of
the EndoWrist instruments and accessories and ongoing service.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Sales. Sales for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2001 were $51.7 million, up 94% from $26.6 million for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2000. The sales increase was primarily due to an increase in the
number of

da Vinci

Surgical Systems sold to 49 in 2001 from 28 in 2000.
Fiscal year 2000 sales were up $16.4 million, or 161%, from $10.2 million for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999. The sales increase was primarily due to
an increase in the number of

da Vinci

Surgical Systems sold to 28 in 2000
from 12 in 1999.

Gross Profit. Gross profit for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2001 was $23.5 million, or 45% of sales, compared to $8.6 million, or 32% of
sales in the previous fiscal year. The improvement in gross profit compared to
the prior year resulted from sales growth and increased manufacturing
efficiencies. Fiscal year 2001 and 2000 gross profit were both negatively
impacted by a $1.0 million non-routine royalty charge that became due to IBM
when Intuitive Surgical exceeded $50.0 million in annual revenue in 2001 and
$25.0 million in 2000. Excluding the impact of this charge, fiscal year 2001
gross profit would have been $24.5 million, or 47% of sales, and fiscal year
2000 gross profit would have been $9.6 million or 36% of sales.  The 2001
royalty payment represents the final royalty obligation under our agreement with
IBM.

Fiscal year 1999 gross profit was $919,000, or 9%. Fiscal
year 1999 was the first year in which revenue was recognized.

Research and Development Expenses. Fiscal year 2001 research
and development costs were $13.9 million, up 18% from $11.7 million in fiscal
year 2000. The increase was due to headcount increases and higher prototype
material costs.  Fiscal year 2000 research and development expenses of $11.7
million were up 5% from $11.1 million in 1999.  The increase was primarily due
to headcount increases, offset by a decrease caused by classifying manufacturing
costs as cost of sales instead of research and development beginning in the
second quarter of 1999, as sales were recorded for the first time, and lower
fiscal year 2000 prototype materials costs.

Research and development expenses include costs associated
with the design, development, testing and enhancement of our products. These
enhancements represent significant improvements to our products. Research and
development expenses also include expenditures for clinical trials and purchases
of laboratory supplies. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
We expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and
development and anticipate that research and development expenses will continue
to increase in the future.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling,
general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2001 were $30.0 million, up
57% from $19.1 million for fiscal year 2000. The year-over-year increase was due
in large part to increases in headcount in the field service and sales functions
to support increased revenue and a larger installed base of

da Vinci

Surgical Systems. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal
year 2000 were $9.8 million higher than fiscal 1999 expenses of $9.3 million.
This increase was primarily due to headcount increases resulting from growing
sales and marketing activities as the

da Vinci

Surgical System

received US FDA clearance in fiscal year 2000.

Selling, general and administrative expenses include
personnel costs for sales, marketing and administrative personnel, tradeshow
expenses, legal expenses, regulatory fees and general corporate expenses.
Selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in the
future to support our expanding business.

Deferred Compensation. We record deferred compensation as the
difference between the exercise price of options granted and the fair value of
our common stock at the time of grant for financial reporting purposes. Deferred
compensation is amortized to research and development expenses and selling,
general and administrative expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000
and 1999, the Company recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation of
$1.6 million, $2.5 million and $865,000, respectively. For fiscal years 2001,
2000 and 1999 non-cash deferred compensation expense included in research and
development expenses was $1.0 million, $1.9 million and $653,000, respectively.
For fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999 non-cash deferred compensation expense
included in selling, general and administrative expenses was $560,000, $684,000
and $212,000, respectively.  Deferred compensation recorded through December 31,
2001 was $8.9 million with accumulated amortization of $8.0 million. The
remaining $886,000 will be amortized over the remaining vesting periods of the
options, generally four years from the date of grant, using a graded-vesting
method. Future amortization of deferred compensation at December 31, 2001 is as
follows: 2002 -- $662,000; and 2003 -- $227,000. The amount of deferred
compensation expense to be recorded in future periods may decrease if unvested
options for which deferred compensation has been recorded are subsequently
canceled.

Interest Income. Interest income decreased 8% to $3.9 million
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001 from $4.3 million in fiscal 2000.
The decrease resulted primarily from lower interest rates earned on cash and
short-term investment balances in 2001.  Fiscal year 2000 interest income was
$2.8 higher than fiscal year 1999 resulting from higher cash and short-term
investment balances, driven by the exercise of warrants to purchase preferred
stock in March 2000, yielding approximately $34.8 million in net proceeds, and
our initial public offering in June and July 2000, which raised net proceeds of
approximately $46.8 million.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Prior to our initial public offering, operations were
financed primarily through sales of our preferred stock, yielding net proceeds
of approximately $127.3 million, and equipment financing arrangements yielding
approximately $7.5 million. In June and July 2000, we completed the initial
public offering of 5,750,000 shares of our common stock and realized net
proceeds of approximately $46.8 million.

As of December 31, 2001, we had cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments of $66.7 million, compared to $89.4 million at December
31, 2000 and $26.3 million at December 31, 1999. Working capital at December 31,
2001 was $67.9 million, compared to $83.8 million at December 31, 2000 and $22.0
million at December 31, 1999. The fiscal year 2001 decrease in cash and
investments and working capital was primarily attributable to cash used to fund
operating losses and to acquire fixed assets.  The fiscal year 2000 increase in
cash and investments and working capital was primarily due to proceeds from
issuance of preferred stock of $34.8 million and initial public offering
proceeds of $46.8 million, offset by cash used to fund operating losses.

Net cash used in operating activities was $18.6 million for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $12.8 million for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2000 and $15.9 for the fiscal year ended December
31, 1999. The increase in cash used in operations during 2001 compared to 2000
reflects higher working capital requirements in 2001, primarily caused by the
growth in the Company's receivable balances.  The accounts payable and other
accrued liabilities remained relatively flat. The decrease in cash used in
operations in 2000 compared to 1999 resulted primarily from a lower net loss for
2000 after adjusting for non-cash charges for depreciation and deferred
compensation.

Net cash provided by investing activities was $11.2 million
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, compared to net cash used in
investing activities of $50.8 million in 2000 and $10.3 million used in 1999.
Fiscal year 2001 cash provided resulted from the net conversion of short-term
investments into cash to support operations. The increase in cash used in
investing activities between 2000 and 1999 is related to the purchase of short-
term investments with the net proceeds from our initial public offering in June
and July 2000 and from the exercise of warrants to purchase preferred stock in
March 2000.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $771,000 for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $82.2 million for 2000 and
$20.2 million for 1999. Fiscal year 2001 cash provided by financing resulted
from proceeds from the issuance of common stock (resulting mainly from the
employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of stock options) for $2.3
million, offset by the net repayment of long-term equipment financing debt of
$1.5 million.  Cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2000 related
primarily to our initial public offering in June and July 2000, yielding net
proceeds of $46.8 million. Proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock were
$34.8 million and $19.3 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Our capital requirements depend on numerous factors,
including market acceptance of our products, the resources we devote to
developing and supporting our products and other factors. We expect to devote
substantial capital resources to continue our research and development efforts,
to expand our customer support and product development activities and for other
general corporate activities. We believe that our current cash and short-term
investment balances, together with revenue to be derived from the sale of our
products, will be sufficient to  meet our liquidity requirements at least
through 2003. During or after this period, if cash generated by operations is
insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may need to sell
additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit arrangements.
Additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.
The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in
additional dilution to our stockholders.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Company believes the following represent its critical accounting
policies:

Revenue Recognition.  In certain cases, revenue from direct
system sales is generated from multiple element  arrangements which require
judgement in the areas of delivery, customer acceptance, installation and
collectibility.  Revenue is recognized as specific elements indicated in sales
contracts are executed. If an element is essential to the functionality of the
system, revenue is deferred until that essential element is delivered. The fair
value of each undelivered element that is not essential to the functionality of
the system is deferred until performance occurs. The fair value of an
undelivered element is based upon an estimate made by management. Amounts billed
in excess of revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue on the balance
sheet.

Warranties.  We provide for the estimated costs of product
warranties at the time revenue is recognized.  The Company's estimate of costs
to service its warranty obligations is based upon historical experience and
expectation of future conditions.  Should warranty claim activity and the costs
associated with servicing those claims differ from the Company's estimates,
revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.  The allowance for doubtful
accounts is based upon management estimates.  Factors underlying these estimates
include analysis of days outstanding, customer payment history and management
judgement.  The allowance is adjusted regularly to reflect current data and
activity.

Inventory Reserves. We write our inventory down for estimated
obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost
of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future
demand and market conditions. If actual future demand or market conditions are
less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs
may be required.

Intangible Assets.  We have intangible assets on our balance
sheet related to the acquisition of patents.  The valuation and classification
of these assets and the assignment of useful amortization lives involves
judgments and the use of estimates. The testing of these intangibles for
impairment under established accounting guidelines is required on an ongoing
basis. Changes in business conditions could potentially require future
adjustments to asset valuations.

Contingencies. We are subject to proceedings, lawsuits and
other claims related to our products, patents and other matters. We are required
to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters
as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of
reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful
analysis of each individual issue. The required reserves may change in the
future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a
change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters.

A complete description of all significant accounting policies
is included in Note 1 in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements, in
Item 14 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board  (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133"). We
adopted SFAS 133 effective January 1, 2001. This statement establishes
accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, be
recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its
fair value. The statement also requires that changes in the derivative's fair
value be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are
met. The adoption of SFAS 133, as amended, has not had a significant impact on
our financial position or results of operations.

In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 "Business
Combinations" and SFAS No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets," effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001.
SFAS No. 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all
business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001, and that the use of the
pooling-of-interest method is no longer allowed.  Under SFAS No. 142 goodwill
and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be
amortized but will be subject to an annual impairment test in accordance with
the new standards.  Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over
their respective useful lives. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 141 and SFAS No.
142 as of January 1, 2002.  The Company does not currently believe that the
adoption of SFAS No. 141 and SFAS No. 142 will have a significant impact on its
financial position or results of operations.

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144 "Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets", effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2001.  SFAS No. 144 addresses financial
accounting and reporting for impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and
supersedes SFAS 121.  The Company will adopt SFAS No. 144 as of January 1, 2002.
The Company does not currently believe that the adoption of SFAS No. 144 will
have a significant impact on its financial position or results of
operations.

FACTORS AFFECTING OPERATING RESULTS

OUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE BELOW SECURITIES ANALYSTS' OR
INVESTORS' EXPECTATIONS, WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO DECLINE.

Because of our limited operating history, we have limited
insight into trends that may emerge in our market and affect our business. The
revenue and income potential of our market are unproven, and we may be unable to
generate significant commercial revenues. In addition, our costs may be higher
than we, securities analysts or investors expect. If we fail to generate
sufficient revenues or our costs are higher than we expect, our results of
operations will suffer, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.
Further, future revenue from sales of our products, if any, will be difficult to
forecast because the market for new surgical technologies is still evolving. Our
results of operations will depend upon numerous factors, including:

the progress and results of clinical trials;

actions relating to regulatory matters;

the extent to which our products gain market acceptance;

our timing and ability to develop our manufacturing and sales and marketing
capabilities;

demand for our products;

the progress of surgical training in the use of our products;

our ability to develop, introduce and market new or enhanced versions of our
products on a timely basis;

product quality problems;

our ability to protect our proprietary rights;

our ability to license additional intellectual property rights; and

third-party payor reimbursement policies.

Our operating results in any particular period will not be a reliable
indication of our future performance. It is likely that in some future quarters,
our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or
investors. If this occurs, the price of our common stock, and the value of your
investment, will likely decline.

WE HAVE A LARGE ACCUMULATED DEFICIT, WE EXPECT FUTURE LOSSES, AND WE MAY
NOT ACHIEVE OR MAINTAIN PROFITABILITY.

We have incurred substantial losses since inception and we
expect to incur substantial additional operating losses for at least the next
two years, primarily as a result of expected increases in expenses for our
manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities, research and development
activities, clinical trials and regulatory approval applications. The extent of
our future losses and the timing of profitability are highly uncertain, and we
may never achieve profitable operations. If the time required to generate
significant revenues and achieve profitability is longer than anticipated, we
may not be able to continue our operations. Our net loss for the year ended
December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999 were $16.7 million, $18.5 million, and $18.4
million, respectively.  As of December 31, 2001, we had an accumulated deficit
of $110.4 million.

WE EXPERIENCE LONG AND VARIABLE SALES CYCLES, WHICH COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE
IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR ANY GIVEN QUARTER.

Our

da Vinci

Surgical System has a lengthy sales and
purchase order cycle because it is a major capital item and generally requires
the approval of senior management at purchasing institutions. These factors may
contribute to substantial fluctuations in our quarterly operating results,
particularly during the periods in which our sales volume is low. Because of
these fluctuations, it is likely that in some future quarters, our operating
results could fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors.
If that happens, the market price of our stock would likely decrease. These
fluctuations also mean that you will not be able to rely upon our operating
results in any particular period as an indication of future performance.

BECAUSE A SMALL NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS HAVE AND ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO
ACCOUNT FOR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR REVENUES, OUR REVENUES COULD DECLINE
DUE TO THE LOSS OR DELAY OF A SINGLE CUSTOMER ORDER.

A relatively small number of customers account for a
significant portion of our total revenues. In 1999, 2000, and 2001, the majority
of our revenues came from the sales of

da Vinci

Surgical Systems, which
are high revenue dollar items. Due to the high dollar revenue per system sold,
small variations in system unit sales may cause revenue to vary significantly
from quarter to quarter. For the year ended December 31, 1999, two customers, AB
Medica SRL, located in Italy, and Marubeni America Corporation, located in New
York, each accounted for 16% of our total sales. AB Medica SRL and Marubeni
America Corporation are our Italian and Japanese distributors, respectively. For
the year ended December 31, 2000, none of our customers accounted for 10% or
greater of total sales. For the year ended December 31, 2001 AB Medica SRL
accounted for 15% of total sales.

We expect that revenues from a limited number of new
customers will account for a large percentage of total revenues in future
quarters. Our ability to attract new customers will depend on a variety of
factors, including the capability, safety, efficacy, ease of use, price, quality
and reliability of our products and effective sales, support, training and
service. The loss or delay of individual orders could have a significant impact
on revenues and operating results. Our failure to add new customers that make
significant purchases of our products would reduce our future revenues.

IF OUR PRODUCTS DO NOT ACHIEVE MARKET ACCEPTANCE, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO
GENERATE THE REVENUE NECESSARY TO SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS.

Our products represent a fundamentally new way of performing
surgery. Achieving physician, patient and third-party payor acceptance of
Intuitive surgery as a preferred method of performing surgery will be crucial to
our success. If our products fail to achieve market acceptance, hospitals will
not purchase our products and we will not be able to generate the revenue
necessary to support our business. We believe that physicians' and third-party
payors' acceptance of the benefits of procedures performed using our products
will be essential for acceptance of our products by patients. Physicians will
not recommend the use of our products unless we can demonstrate that they
produce results comparable or superior to existing surgical techniques. Even if
we can prove the effectiveness of our products through clinical trials, surgeons
may elect not to use our products for any number of other reasons. For example,
cardiologists may continue to recommend conventional open heart surgery simply
because such surgery is already so widely accepted. In addition, surgeons may be
slow to adopt our products because of the perceived liability risks arising from
the use of new products and the uncertainty of reimbursement from third-party
payors.

We expect that there will be a learning process involved for
surgical teams to become proficient in the use of our products. Broad use of our
products will require training of surgical teams. Market acceptance could be
delayed by the time required to complete this training. We may not be able to
rapidly train surgical teams in numbers sufficient to generate adequate demand
for our products. Although we are in the process of developing training programs
for surgical teams, we cannot be certain that our training programs will be cost
effective or sufficient to meet our customers' needs.

WE ARE INVOLVED IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LITIGATION WITH COMPUTER MOTION
AND BROOKHILL-WILK 1, LLC THAT MAY HURT OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, MAY BE COSTLY
TO US AND MAY PREVENT US FROM SELLING OUR PRODUCTS.

On May 10, 2000, Computer Motion, Inc. filed a lawsuit in
United States District Court for the Central District of California (Case No.
CV00-4988 CBM) alleging that by making, using, selling or offering for sale our

da Vinci

Surgical System, we are infringing United States Patent Numbers
5,524,180, 5,762,458, 5,815,640, 5,855,583, 5,878,193, 5,907,664 and 6,001,108,
in willful disregard of Computer Motion's patent rights. On June 1, 2000,
Computer Motion amended its lawsuit to allege that we also infringe U.S. Patent
Number 6,063,095. On October 30, 2000, Computer Motion filed a motion seeking to
add U.S. Patent Number 6,102,850 to the litigation. These patents concern
methods and devices for conducting various aspects of robotic surgery. On
December 7 and 8, 2000, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("PTO") declared
three interferences between a single SRI patent application exclusively licensed
to us and three of Computer Motion's patents, Numbers 5,855,583, 5,878,193, and
5,907,664. In light of those declarations of interference, the District Court in
February 2001 stayed -- put on hold -- all proceedings in the litigation for one
year while the PTO conducts the interference proceedings. In February 2002, the
District Court extended the stay through a late March 2002 status conference, at
which time the parties and the Court will discuss the propriety of further
extending the stay in light of the ongoing interferences.

In connection with our joint litigation with IBM Corporation
against Computer Motion in Delaware, Computer Motion has alleged infringement of
its U.S. Patent No. 6,244,809.  Although the Delaware Court refused to allow
Computer Motion to sue us on this '809 patent in Delaware, Computer Motion may
attempt to assert this patent against us in California if the California
litigation continues.

If the California litigation proceeds notwithstanding the
interferences, and if we ultimately lose Computer Motion's suit against us, it
will hurt our competitive position, may be costly to us and may prevent us from
selling our products. In addition, if we lose the patent suit, we will need to
obtain from Computer Motion a license to this technology if we are to continue
to market our products that have been found to infringe Computer Motion's
patents. This license could be expensive, or could require us to license to
Computer Motion some of our technology which would result in a partial loss of
our competitive advantage in the marketplace, each of which could seriously harm
our business.  If Computer Motion is successful in its suit against us and is
unwilling to grant us a license, we will be required to stop selling our
products that are found to infringe Computer Motion's patents unless we can
redesign them so they do not infringe Computer Motion's patents, which we may be
unable to do. In addition, if we lose the patent suit, we could be required to
pay Computer Motion damages, including treble damages, which could be
substantial and harm our financial position.

On September 1, 2000, Brookhill-Wilk 1, LLC ("Wilk") filed a
lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York (Case No. 00 Civ. 6599 (NRB)) alleging that by making, using, selling or
offering for sale our

da Vinci

Surgical System, we are infringing U.S.
Patent Nos. 5,217,003 and 5,368,015 in willful disregard of Wilk's patent
rights. These patents concern methods and devices for "remote" surgery. In March
2001, Wilk withdrew its assertion of the '015 patent against Intuitive. On
November 8, 2001, the District Court granted summary judgment of noninfringement
of the '003 patent in our favor and dismissed Wilk's complaint in its entirety
without prejudice.  Wilk has since filed a notice with the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit to appeal the summary judgment ruling. Briefing on the
appeal should conclude in mid-2002, with a hearing date possible towards the end
of 2002 or in early 2003. If we lose on appeal and ultimately also lose Wilk's
suit against us, it will hurt our competitive position, may be costly to us and
may prevent us from selling our products. If we lose the patent suit, we may
need to obtain from Wilk a license to this technology if we are to continue to
market our products that have been found to infringe Wilk's patents. This
license could be expensive, which could seriously harm our business.  If Wilk is
successful in its suit against us and is unwilling to grant us a license, we may
be required to stop selling our products that are found to infringe Wilk's
patents unless we can redesign them so they do not infringe Wilk's patents,
which we may be unable to do. In addition, if we lose the patent suit, we could
be required to pay Wilk damages, including treble damages, which could be
substantial and harm our financial position.

The foregoing  proceedings, will be expensive to litigate, may be protracted
and our confidential information may be compromised. Whether or not we are
successful in this lawsuit, these proceedings could consume substantial amounts
of our financial and managerial resources. At any time Computer Motion or Wilk
may file additional claims against Intuitive Surgical, or we may file claims
against Computer Motion or Wilk, which could increase the risk, expense and
duration of the litigations. Further, because of the substantial amount of
discovery often involved in connection with this type of litigation, there is a
risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by
disclosure. For more information on our litigation with Computer Motion, see
"Item 1: Business -- Legal Proceedings."

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO PROTECT THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CONTAINED IN OUR
PRODUCTS FROM USE BY THIRD PARTIES, OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE IN THE MARKET WILL BE
HARMED.

Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining
patent and other intellectual property protection for the technologies contained
in our products, and on successfully defending our patents and other
intellectual property against third party challenges.

We will incur substantial costs in obtaining patents and, if
necessary, defending our proprietary rights. The patent positions of medical
device companies, including ours, can be highly uncertain and involve complex
and evolving legal and factual questions. We cannot assure you that we will
obtain the patent protection we seek, or that the protection we do obtain will
be found valid and enforceable if challenged. We also cannot assure you that we
will be able to develop additional patentable proprietary technologies. If we
fail to obtain adequate protection of our intellectual property, or if any
protection we obtain is reduced or eliminated, others could use our intellectual
property without compensating us, resulting in harm to our business. We may also
determine that it is in our best interests to voluntarily challenge a third
party's products or patents in litigation or administrative proceedings,
including patent interferences or reexaminations. Given the early priority dates
of some of our licensed patents, we believe one or more patent proceedings may
be in our best interests. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries do
not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of
the United States.

OTHERS MAY ASSERT THAT OUR PRODUCTS INFRINGE THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
RIGHTS, WHICH MAY CAUSE US TO ENGAGE IN COSTLY DISPUTES AND, IF WE ARE NOT
SUCCESSFUL IN DEFENDING OURSELVES, COULD ALSO CAUSE US TO PAY SUBSTANTIAL
DAMAGES AND PROHIBIT US FROM SELLING OUR PRODUCTS.

We are aware of both United States and foreign patents issued
to third parties that relate to computer-assisted surgery and minimally invasive
surgery. Some of these patents on their face appear broad enough to cover one or
more aspects of our present technology, and may cover aspects of our future
technology. We do not know whether any of these patents, if challenged, would be
held valid, enforceable and infringed. From time to time, we receive, and likely
will continue to receive, letters from third parties inviting us to license
their patents. We may be sued by, or become involved in an administrative
proceeding because of one or more of these third parties, regardless of the
merits or likely outcome of such suit or proceeding. We cannot assure you that a
court or administrative body would agree with any arguments or defenses we have
concerning invalidity, unenforceability or noninfringement of any third-party
patent. In addition to the issued patents of which we are aware, other parties
may have filed, and in the future are likely to file, patent applications
covering surgical products that are similar or identical to ours. We cannot
assure you that any patents issuing from applications filed by a third party
will not cover our products or will not have priority over our patent
applications.

The medical device industry has been characterized by
extensive litigation and administrative proceedings regarding patents and other
intellectual property rights, and companies have employed such actions to gain a
competitive advantage. If third parties assert infringement or other
intellectual property claims against us as Computer Motion and Brookhill-Wilk 1,
LLC have done, our technical and management personnel will experience a
significant diversion of time and effort and we will incur large expenses
defending ourselves. If third parties in any patent action are successful, our
patent portfolio may be damaged, we may have to pay substantial damages,
including treble damages, and we may be required to stop selling our products or
obtain a license which, if available at all, may require us to pay substantial
royalties. We cannot be certain that we will have the financial resources or the
substantive arguments to defend our patents from infringement or claims of
invalidity or unenforceability, or to defend against allegations of infringement
of third-party patents. In addition, any public announcements related to
litigation or administrative proceedings initiated by us, or initiated or
threatened against us, could cause our stock price to decline.

THE RIGHTS AND MEASURES WE RELY ON TO PROTECT THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
UNDERLYING OUR PRODUCTS MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO PREVENT THIRD PARTIES FROM USING
OUR TECHNOLOGY WHICH COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE IN THE MARKET.

In addition to patents, we typically rely on a combination of
trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure agreements and other
contractual provisions and technical security measures to protect our
intellectual property rights. Nevertheless, these measures may not be adequate
to safeguard the technology underlying our products. If they do not protect our
rights adequately, third parties could use our technology, and our ability to
compete in the market would be reduced. In addition, employees, consultants and
others who participate in developing our products may breach their agreements
with us regarding our intellectual property, and we may not have adequate
remedies for the breach. We also may not be able to effectively protect our
intellectual property rights in some foreign countries. For a variety of
reasons, we may decide not to file for patent, copyright or trademark protection
outside the United States. We also realize that our trade secrets may become
known through other means not currently foreseen by us. Notwithstanding our
efforts to protect our intellectual property, our competitors may independently
develop similar or alternative technologies or products that are equal or
superior to our technology and products without infringing any of our
intellectual property rights, or may design around our proprietary technologies.
For further information on our intellectual property and the difficulties in
protecting it, see "Item 1: Business -- Intellectual Property."

OUR PRODUCTS RELY ON LICENSES FROM THIRD PARTIES, AND IF WE LOSE ACCESS TO
THESE TECHNOLOGIES, OUR REVENUES COULD DECLINE.

We rely on technology that we license from others, including technology that
is integral to our products. We have entered into license agreements with SRI
International, IBM Corporation, MIT, Olympus Optical Co., Ltd., and Heartport,
Inc., now part of Johnson & Johnson. Any of these agreements may be
terminated for breach. If any of these agreements is terminated, we may be
unable to reacquire the necessary license on satisfactory terms, or at all. The
loss or failure to maintain these licenses could prevent or delay further
development or commercialization of our products. See "Item 1: Business --
Intellectual Property."

PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS OF LITIGATION EVENTS MAY CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO
DECLINE.

During the course of our administrative proceedings
and/or lawsuits with Computer Motion and Brookhill-Wilk 1, LLC, there may be
public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, and other interim
proceedings or developments in the litigation. If securities analysts or
investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial
negative effect on the trading price of our stock.

OUR PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO A LENGTHY AND UNCERTAIN DOMESTIC REGULATORY
PROCESS.  IF WE DO NOT OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN THE NECESSARY DOMESTIC REGULATORY
APPROVALS, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MARKET AND SELL OUR PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED
STATES.

Our products and operations are subject to extensive
regulation in the United States by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or
FDA. The FDA regulates the research, testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling,
storage, recordkeeping, promotion, distribution, and production of medical
devices in the United States to ensure that medical products distributed
domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. In order for us to
market certain products for use in the United States, we generally must first
obtain clearance from the FDA, pursuant to Section 510(k) of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FFDCA"). Clearance under Section 510(k) requires
demonstration that a new device is substantially equivalent to another legally
marketed device. If we modify our products after they receive FDA clearance, the
FDA may require us to submit a separate 510(k) or PMA for the modified product
before we are permitted to market the products in the U.S. In addition, if we
develop products in the future that are not considered to be substantially
equivalent to a legally marketed device, we will be required to obtain FDA
approval by submitting a premarket approval application ("PMA").

The FDA may not act favorably or quickly in its review of our
510(k) or PMA submissions, or we may encounter significant difficulties and
costs in our efforts to obtain FDA clearance or approval, all of which could
delay or preclude sale of new products in the United States. Furthermore, the
FDA may request additional data, require us to conduct further testing, or
compile more data, including clinical data, in support of a 510(k) submission.
The FDA may also, instead of accepting a 510(k) submission, require us to submit
a PMA, which is typically a much more complex application than a 510(k). To
support a PMA, the FDA would likely require that we conduct one or more clinical
studies to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, rather than
substantially equivalent to another legally marketed device. We may not be able
to meet the requirements to obtain 510(k) clearance or PMA approval, or the FDA
may not grant any necessary clearances or approvals. In addition, the FDA may
place significant limitations upon the intended use of our products as a
condition to a 510(k) clearance or PMA approval. Product applications can also
be denied or withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory requirements or
the occurrence of unforeseen problems following approval. Any delays or failure
to obtain FDA clearance or approvals of new products we develop, any limitations
imposed by the FDA on new product use or the costs of obtaining FDA clearance or
approvals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

In order to conduct a clinical investigation involving human
subjects for the purpose of demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of a
device, a company must, among other things, apply for and obtain Institutional
Review Board ("IRB") approval of the proposed investigation. In addition, if the
clinical study involves a "significant risk" (as defined by the FDA) to human
health, the sponsor of the investigation must also submit and obtain FDA
approval of an investigational device exemption ("IDE") application. We may not
be able to obtain FDA and/or IRB approval to undertake clinical trials in the
U.S. for any new devices we intend to market in the United States in the future.
If we obtain such approvals, we may not be able to comply with the IDE and other
regulations governing clinical investigations or the data from any such trials
may not support clearance or approval of the investigational device. Failure to
obtain such approvals or to comply with such regulations could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
For additional information concerning regulatory approvals of our products, see
"Item 1: Business -- Government Regulation."

OUR PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY PROCESSES AND
APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS. IF WE DO NOT OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN THE NECESSARY
INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY APPROVALS, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MARKET AND SELL OUR
PRODUCTS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES.

To be able to market and sell our products in other
countries, we must obtain regulatory approvals and comply with the regulations
of those countries. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals,
and the time required for regulatory review vary from country to country.
Obtaining and maintaining foreign regulatory approvals are expensive, and we
cannot be certain that we will receive regulatory approvals in any foreign
country in which we plan to market our products. If we fail to obtain regulatory
approval in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products, our
ability to generate revenue will be harmed.

The European Union requires that manufacturers of medical
products obtain the right to affix the CE mark to their products before selling
them in member countries of the European Union. The CE mark is an international
symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with
applicable European medical device directives. In order to obtain the right to
affix the CE mark to products, a manufacturer must obtain certification that its
processes meet certain European quality standards. In January 1999, we received
permission to affix the CE mark to our

da Vinci

Surgical System and
EndoWrist instruments for general surgical use. We received additional CE
approvals for use of our

da Vinci

Surgical System and EndoWrist
instruments in cardiac surgery in September 1999 and February 2000.

If we modify existing products or develop new products in the
future, including new instruments, we will need to apply for permission to affix
the CE mark to such products. In addition, we will be subject to annual
regulatory audits in order to maintain the CE mark permissions we have already
obtained. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain permission to
affix the CE mark for new or modified products or that we will continue to meet
the quality and safety standards required to maintain the permissions we have
already received. If we are unable to maintain permission to affix the CE mark
to our products, we will no longer be able to sell our products in member
countries of the European Union.

IF INSTITUTIONS OR SURGEONS ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN REIMBURSEMENT FROM THIRD-PARTY
PAYORS FOR PROCEDURES USING OUR PRODUCTS, OR IF REIMBURSEMENT IS
INSUFFICIENT TO COVER THE COSTS OF PURCHASING OUR PRODUCTS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO
GENERATE SUFFICIENT SALES TO SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS.

Domestic institutions will typically bill the services
performed with our products to various third-party payors, such as Medicare,
Medicaid and other government programs and private insurance plans. If hospitals
do not obtain sufficient reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures
performed with our products, or if government and private payors' policies do
not permit reimbursement for surgical procedures performed using our products,
we may not be able to generate the revenues necessary to support our business.
In such circumstances, we may have to apply to the American Medical Association
for a unique Current Procedural Terminology code covering computer-enhanced
surgery. If an application for a unique code is required, reimbursement for any
use of our products may be unavailable until an appropriate code is granted. The
application process, from filing until adoption of a new code, can take two or
more years.

Our success in international markets also depends upon the
eligibility of our products for reimbursement through government-sponsored
health care payment systems and third-party payors. Reimbursement practices vary
significantly by country. Many international markets have government-managed
healthcare systems that control reimbursement for new products and procedures.
Other foreign markets have both private insurance systems and government-managed
systems that control reimbursement for new products and procedures. Market
acceptance of our products may depend on the availability and level of
reimbursement in any country within a particular time. In addition, health care
cost containment efforts similar to those we face in the United States are
prevalent in many of the other countries in which we intend to sell our products
and these efforts are expected to continue. For further information on third-party
reimbursement policies, see "Item 1: Business -- Third-Party
Reimbursement."

BECAUSE OUR MARKETS ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, CUSTOMERS MAY
CHOOSE TO PURCHASE OUR COMPETITORS' PRODUCTS OR MAY NOT ACCEPT INTUITIVE
SURGERY, WHICH WOULD RESULT IN REDUCED REVENUE AND LOSS OF MARKET SHARE.

Intuitive surgery is a new technology that must compete with
established minimally invasive surgery and open surgery. These procedures are
widely accepted in the medical community and in many cases have a long history
of use. We also face competition from several companies that are developing new
approaches and products for the minimally invasive surgery market. In addition,
we presently face increasing competition from companies who are developing
robotic and computer-assisted surgical systems. Our revenues may be reduced or
eliminated if our competitors develop and market products that are more
effective or less expensive than our products. If we are unable to compete
successfully, our revenues will suffer. We may not be able to maintain or
improve our competitive position against current or potential competitors,
especially those with greater resources.

In many cases, the medical conditions that can be treated
using our products can also be treated by pharmaceuticals or other medical
devices and procedures. Many of these alternative treatments are also widely
accepted in the medical community and have a long history of use. In addition,
technological advances could make such treatments more effective or less
expensive than using our products, which could render our products obsolete or
unmarketable. We cannot be certain that physicians will use our products to
replace or supplement established treatments or that our products will be
competitive with current or future technologies.

IF SOFTWARE DEFECTS ARE DISCOVERED IN OUR PRODUCTS, WE MAY INCUR
ADDITIONAL UNFORESEEN COSTS, HOSPITALS MAY NOT PURCHASE OUR PRODUCTS AND OUR
REPUTATION MAY SUFFER.

Our products do incorporate computer software.  Software can
contains errors or failures, especially when first introduced. In addition, new
products or enhancements may contain undetected errors or performance problems
that, despite testing, are discovered only after commercial shipment. Because
our products are designed to be used to perform complex surgical procedures, we
expect that our customers will have an increased sensitivity to software
defects. We cannot assure you that our software will not experience errors or
performance problems in the future. If we experience software errors or
performance problems, any of the following could occur:

delays in product shipments;

loss of revenue;

delay in market acceptance;

diversion of our resources;

damage to our reputation;

increased service or warranty costs; or

product liability claims.

WE HAVE LIMITED EXPERIENCE IN MANUFACTURING OUR PRODUCTS AND MAY ENCOUNTER
MANUFACTURING PROBLEMS OR DELAYS THAT COULD RESULT IN LOST REVENUE.

We have manufactured a limited number of our products for
sales to customers. We may be unable to establish or maintain reliable, high-volume
manufacturing capacity. Even if this capacity can be established and
maintained, the cost of doing so may increase the cost of our products and
reduce our ability to compete. We may encounter difficulties in scaling up
production of our products, including:

problems involving production yields;

quality control and assurance;

component supply shortages;

shortages of qualified personnel; and

compliance with state, federal and foreign regulations.

Manufacturing our products is a complex process. If demand
for our products exceeds our manufacturing capacity, we could develop a
substantial backlog of customer orders. If we are unable to establish and
maintain larger-scale manufacturing capabilities, our ability to generate
revenues will be limited and our reputation in the marketplace would be damaged.

IF OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES DO NOT CONTINUE TO MEET FEDERAL, STATE OR
EUROPEAN MANUFACTURING STANDARDS, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO TEMPORARILY CEASE ALL OR
PART OF OUR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, WHICH WOULD RESULT IN PRODUCT DELIVERY
DELAYS AND LOST REVENUE.

Our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic
inspection by regulatory authorities and our operations will continue to be
regulated by the FDA for compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice
requirements contained in the FDA's Quality System Regulations (QSR). We are
also required to comply with the ISO 9000 series standards in order to produce
products for sale in Europe. If we fail to continue to comply with Good
Manufacturing Practice requirements or ISO 9000 series standards, we may be
required to cease all or part of our operations until we comply with these
regulations. We are currently in compliance with ISO 9000 series standards. In
March 2000, the FDA inspected our Mountain View facility and the Good
Manufacturing Practice issues raised during the inspection have been
satisfactorily resolved with the FDA. Maintaining such compliance is difficult
and costly. We cannot be certain that our facilities will be found to comply
with Good Manufacturing Practice requirements or the ISO 9000 series standards
in future audits by regulatory authorities.

The state of California also requires that we maintain a
license to manufacture medical devices. Our facilities and manufacturing
processes were inspected in February 1998. In March 1998, we passed the
inspection and received a device manufacturing license from the California
Department of Health Services.  In March 2002, our facilities and manufacturing
processes in our Sunnyvale facility were re-inspected by the FDB.  We passed
this audit and are awaiting issuance of our device manufacturing license
renewal.  We will be subject to periodic inspections by the California
Department of Health Services and if we are unable to maintain this license
following any future inspections, we will be unable to manufacture or ship any
products.

OUR RELIANCE ON SOLE AND SINGLE SOURCE SUPPLIERS COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO
MEET DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IN A TIMELY MANNER OR WITHIN BUDGET.

Some of the components necessary for the assembly of our
products are currently provided to us by sole source suppliers or single source
suppliers. We purchase components through purchase orders rather than long-term
supply agreements and generally do not maintain large volumes of inventory. The
disruption or termination of the supply of components could cause a significant
increase in the costs of these components, which could affect our profitability.
A disruption or termination in the supply of components could also result in our
inability to meet demand for our products, which could harm our ability to
generate revenues, lead to customer dissatisfaction and damage our reputation.
Furthermore, if we are required to change the manufacturer of a key component of
our products, we may be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains
facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all
applicable regulations and guidelines. The delays associated with the
verification of a new manufacturer could delay our ability to manufacture our
products in a timely manner or within budget.

THE USE OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD RESULT IN PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS THAT
COULD BE EXPENSIVE, DIVERT MANAGEMENT'S ATTENTION AND HARM OUR BUSINESS.

Our business exposes us to significant risks of product
liability claims. The medical device industry has historically been litigious,
and we face financial exposure to product liability claims if the use of our
products were to cause injury or death. There is also the possibility that
defects in the design or manufacture of our products might necessitate a product
recall. Although we maintain product liability insurance, the coverage limits of
these policies may not be adequate to cover future claims. Particularly as sales
of our products increase, we may be unable to maintain product liability
insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or adequate amounts. A product
liability claim, regardless of its merit or eventual outcome, could result in
significant legal defense costs. A product liability claim or any product
recalls could also harm our reputation or result in a decline in revenues.

OUR GROWTH WILL PLACE A SIGNIFICANT STRAIN ON OUR MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND
RESOURCES AND, IF WE FAIL TO MANAGE OUR GROWTH, OUR ABILITY TO MARKET, SELL AND
DEVELOP OUR PRODUCTS MAY BE HARMED.

In order to complete clinical trials, scale-up manufacturing,
expand marketing and distribution capabilities and develop future products, we
must expand our operations. We expect that future expansion will occur
particularly in the areas of sales and marketing, manufacturing and research and
development. This expansion will likely result in new and increased
responsibilities for management personnel and place significant strain upon our
management, operating and financial systems and resources. We plan to sell our
products primarily through direct sales, and we currently have a small sales
organization. Our products require a complex marketing and sales effort targeted
at several levels within a prospective customer's organization. We will continue
to expand our sales team over the next 12 months to achieve our sales growth
goals. We will face significant challenges and risks in building and managing
our sales team, including managing geographically dispersed sales efforts and
adequately training our sales people in the use and benefits of our products. To
accommodate our growth and compete effectively, we will be required to improve
our information systems, create additional procedures and controls and expand,
train, motivate and manage our work force. Our future success will depend in
part on the ability of current and future management personnel to operate
effectively, both independently and as a group. We cannot be certain that our
personnel, systems, procedures and controls will be adequate to support our
future operations.

IF WE LOSE OUR KEY PERSONNEL OR ARE UNABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN
ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL, OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE WILL BE HARMED.

We are highly dependent on the principal members of our
management and scientific staff. In order to pursue our product development,
marketing and commercialization plans, we will need to hire additional qualified
personnel with expertise in research and development, clinical testing,
government regulation, manufacturing, sales and marketing, and finance. Our
product development plans depend in part on our ability to attract and retain
engineers with experience in mechanics, software and optics. Attracting and
retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success, and competition
for qualified personnel is intense, particularly in Silicon Valley. We may not
be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the
competition for such personnel among technology and healthcare companies, and
universities. The loss of any of these persons or our inability to attract and
retain qualified personnel could harm our business and our ability to compete.

INTERNATIONAL SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS ACCOUNT FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF
OUR REVENUES, WHICH EXPOSES US TO RISKS INHERENT IN INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.
OUR GROWTH MAY BE LIMITED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR
INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES.

Our business currently depends in large part on our
activities in Europe, and a component of our growth strategy is to expand our
presence into additional foreign markets. Sales to markets outside of the United
States accounted for approximately 34%, 36% and 91% of our sales for the year
ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. We will be subject to a
number of challenges that specifically relate to our international business
activities. These challenges include:

failure of local laws to provide the same degree of protection against
infringement of our intellectual property;

protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competitors,
which could slow our growth in international markets;

the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation;

the expense of establishing facilities and operations in new foreign
markets; and

building an organization capable of supporting geographically dispersed
operations.

Currently, a majority of our international sales are
denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, an increase in the value of the U.S.
dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive
in international markets. If we are unable to meet and overcome these
challenges, our international operations may not be successful, which would
limit the growth of our business.

FAILURE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL OR GENERATE THE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL
NECESSARY TO EXPAND OUR OPERATIONS AND INVEST IN NEW PRODUCTS COULD REDUCE OUR
ABILITY TO COMPETE, RESULT IN LOWER REVENUES AND MAY PREVENT US FROM TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF MARKET OPPORTUNITIES.

We expect that our existing capital resources and the revenue
to be derived from the sale of our products will be sufficient to meet our
working capital and capital expenditure needs at least through 2003. After that,
we may need to raise additional funds and we cannot be certain that we will be
able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. If we need
additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms, we may not be able
to, among other things:

develop or enhance our products and services;

acquire technologies, products or businesses;

expand operations in the United States or internationally;

hire, train and retain employees; or

respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital requirements.

Our failure to do any of these things could result in lower
revenues and could harm our business.

SALES BY CURRENT STOCKHOLDERS COULD CAUSE OUR COMMON STOCK
PRICE TO DECLINE.

The market price of our common stock could decline as a
result of sales of a large number of shares in the market. These sales may also
make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time
and at a price that we deem appropriate to raise funds through future offerings
of common stock. As of December 31, 2001, several entities beneficially owned
more than 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, including Allan G.
Lozier, Investor Guernsey Ltd. and PaTMarK Company, Inc.

On May 8, 2001, June 21, 2001, and October 29, 2001, Mayfield
Fund distributed 1,734,176, 891,801, and 875,237 shares of Intuitive common
stock to its Partners, respectively.

On December 14, 2001, Morgan Stanley Venture Investors III,
LP distributed 37,231 shares of Intuitive common stock to its Partners and
Morgan Stanley Venture Partners III, LP distributed 387,769 shares of Intuitive
common stock to its Partners.

ITEM 7A: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are not subject to any meaningful market risks related
to currency, commodity prices or similar matters. We are sensitive to short-term
interest rate fluctuations to the extent that such fluctuations impact the
interest income we receive on the investment of the remaining proceeds from our
June 2000 initial public offering.

The primary objective of our investment activities is to
preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from
our investments without significantly increasing risk. Some of the securities
that we invest in may have market risk. This means that a change in prevailing
interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate.
For example, if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at
the then-prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises, the
principal amount of our investment will probably decline. To minimize this risk
in the future, we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and
short-term investments in a variety of securities. We classify our cash
equivalents and marketable securities as "fixed-rate" if the rate of
return on such instruments remains fixed over their term. These "fixed-rate"
investments include commercial paper and government and non-government debt
securities. We classify our cash equivalents and marketable
securities as "variable-rate" if the rate of return on such
investments varies based on the change in a predetermined index or set of
indices during their term.  These "variable-rate" investments
primarily included money market accounts. The average duration of all of our
investments as of December 2001 was approximately 1.5 years.  At December 31,
2001, approximately 54% of our investment portfolio was composed of investments
with original maturities of one year of less. The following table presents the
amounts of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments that may be
subject to interest rate risk and the weighted average interest rates by year of
maturity ($ in thousands):

                                ----------------------------
                                Weighted average     Fair

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Board of Directors and Stockholders

Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
of Intuitive Surgical, Inc. as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001. Our audits also
included the financial statement schedule listed in the index at Item 14(a).
These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Intuitive Surgical, Inc. at December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the consolidated
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects, the
information set forth therein.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Operations

Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (the "Company") was
incorporated in Delaware on November 9, 1995 and is engaged in the development,
manufacture and marketing of products designed to provide the flexibility of
open surgery while operating through ports. In 1999, the Company began to
manufacture, market and sell its products in Europe and the United States. The
Company expects to expend substantial additional funds and continue to incur
significant operating losses for at least the next two years as it continues to
fund clinical trials in support of regulatory approvals and expands research and
development activities, manufacturing capabilities and sales and marketing
activities.

Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with an original maturity from date of purchase of 90 days or less to be cash
equivalents for the purpose of balance sheet and statement of cash flows
presentation. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates
market value at December 31, 2001 and 2000.

Short-Term Investments

All short-term investments are classified as
available-for-sale and therefore carried at fair value. The Company views its
available-for-sale portfolio as available for use in its current operations.
Accordingly, all investments are classified as short-term, even though the
stated maturity date may be one year or more beyond the current balance sheet
date. Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value based upon quoted
market prices of the securities. Unrealized gains and losses on such securities,
when material, are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity.
Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in
interest income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific
identification method. Interest and dividends on securities classified as
available-for-sale are included in interest income.

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency of each foreign subsidiary is
its local currency. Foreign assets and liabilities are translated into U.S.
dollars at year-end exchange rates when appropriate, while components of the
income statement are translated using average exchange rates in effect
throughout the year. Gains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions
are included in the consolidated statement of operations. Translation
adjustments of balance sheet items are included as a component of stockholders'
equity.

Concentrations of Risk

Financial instruments which subject the Company to
potential risk consists of its cash equivalents, short-term investments,
accounts receivable, and foreign exchange contracts. The counterparties to the
agreements relating to the Company's investment securities and foreign exchange
contracts consist of various major corporations and financial institutions of
high credit standing. We believe the financial risks associated with these
financial instruments are minimal. For the year ended December 31, 2001, one
customer accounted for 15% of total sales.  For the year ended December 31,
2000, none of our customers accounted for 10% or greater of total sales. The
Company extends reasonably short collection terms but does not require
collateral. The Company provides reserves for potential credit losses but has
not experienced significant losses to date.

The Company's

da Vinci

Surgical System, related
instruments and accessories and service have accounted for all of the Company's
sales for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. Purchases of key parts and
components used to manufacture our products are from limited supply sources. The
inability of any of these suppliers to fulfill our supply requirements may
negatively impact future operating results.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost
(determined on a first-in, first-out basis) or market value.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of
accumulated depreciation. Property and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line
basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to
five years.

Intangible and Other Assets

Purchased intangible assets represent patents which
are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed
using the straight-line method over the expected useful life of six years. At
December 31, 2001, gross intangible assets totaled $4.7 million and related
accumulated amortization was $1.4 million.  At December 31, 2000 gross
intangible assets totaled $4.7 million and related accumulated amortization was
$584,000.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," we evaluate long-lived assets, including
intangible and other assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be
recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to that
asset. The amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the
carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. There were no long-lived
assets that were considered to be impaired during the periods presented.

Software Development Costs

We account for our software costs in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86, "Accounting for the
Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed".
Software development costs are included in research and development and are
generally expensed as incurred.  The time periods involved and costs incurred
between achieving technological feasibility and the general availability of our
software enhancements are insignificant.  Production and distribution costs are
also minimal.  Accordingly, we have not capitalized any software development
costs to date.

Warranty Accrual

The Company's standard policy is to warrant all
shipped systems against defects in design, materials and workmanship by
replacing failed parts during the first year of ownership. The warranty accrual
is reduced by the cost of the replacement parts and labor over the warranty
period. Estimated expenses for warranty obligations are accrued at the time
revenue is recognized and are included in cost of sales.

Other Financial Instruments

The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts
that are designated to reduce a portion of its exposure to foreign currency risk
from operational and balance sheet exposures resulting from changes in foreign
currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from sales denominated in foreign
currencies. The forward contracts, which have only nominal intrinsic value at
the time of purchase, are denominated in the same foreign currency in which the
sales are denominated. The gains and losses on these forward contracts as well
as the offsetting losses and gains on the hedged receivables are recognized
depending on whether the derivative instrument is designated and qualifies as
part of a hedging relationship and, if so, the nature of the hedging activity.
During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company did not designate and
qualify any forward contracts as part of a hedging relationship.  Accordingly,
changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge
treatment, as well as the ineffective portion of a particular hedge, are
recognized currently in earnings.  All derivative instruments are recorded as
either current assets or accrued liabilities in the balance sheet at fair value.

The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for
speculative trading purposes, nor does it hold or issue leveraged derivative
financial instruments.  At December 31, 2001, the Company had no outstanding
derivative instruments.

Research and Development

Research and development costs, which include
clinical and regulatory costs, are expensed to operations as incurred in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 2, "Accounting
for Research and Development Costs."

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results
could differ materially from these estimates.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company has adopted the provisions of Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation" ("SFAS 123"). In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123, the
Company applies APB Opinion 25 ("APB 25"), "Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees" and related interpretations in accounting for its stock option grants
to employees and directors with an exercise price equal to or in excess of the
fair value of the shares at the date of grant. The Company accounts for stock
awards granted to non-employees in accordance with SFAS 123 and related
interpretations. (See Note 9, Stockholders' Equity.)

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or service has been rendered, the
price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured.

Revenue from system sales is generally recognized upon
installation for direct sales and upon shipment for sales to our distributors.
If substantial contractual obligations exist after system installation, revenue
is recognized after such obligations are fulfilled.  In certain instances,
contract terms may provide for customer acceptance and transfer of title to
occur prior to installation for direct sales.  In those instances, we account
for the sale as a multiple element arrangement and defer revenue recognition on
the fair value of any undelivered elements, including installation.  The fair
value of the undelivered elements are then recognized when the outstanding
obligations are fulfilled.

Our distributors do not have price protection rights. One of
our distributors has return rights under limited circumstances. Such rights are
accounted for under the provisions of SFAS No. 48. To date, we have not had any
returns of our systems.

Revenue from sales of instruments and accessories is
recognized upon shipment. Revenue related to future commitments under service
contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the service period.  Amounts
billed in excess of revenue recognized are included as deferred revenue in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Our

da Vinci

Surgical System contains a software
component. We believe that the software element of our

da Vinci

Surgical
System is an incidental part of the system. The software element within our
product is not sold or marketed separately to customers and the software does
not operate independently of the surgical system. Furthermore, the software
development effort does not require a significant cost to the Company relative
to the overall development cost of the product. As such, the software we provide
is incidental to the surgical system as a whole and the software revenue
guidance provided in SOP 97-2 is not applicable to our revenues.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
Advertising costs for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999 were
$1.5 million, $1.1 million and $448,000, respectively.

Shipping and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs are incurred by the
Company and are recorded as cost of goods sold in the income statement.

Segment Disclosures

The Company operates in one segment, the development
and marketing of products designed to The Company operates in one segment, the
development and marketing of products designed to provide the flexibility of
open surgery while operating through ports. For the year ended December 31,
2001, sales to the U.S. and Europe accounted for 69% and 31% of total sales,
respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2000, sales to the U.S. and Europe
accounted for 68% and 32% of total sales, respectively. For the year ended
December 31, 1999, sales to the U.S. and Europe accounted for 25% and 75% of
total sales, respectively. Sales in the U.S. included sales to the Company's
Japanese distributor's U.S. subsidiary, which represented 3%, 4% and 16% of
total sales for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133"). We
adopted SFAS 133 effective January 1, 2001. This statement establishes
accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, be
recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its
fair value. The statement also requires that changes in the derivative's fair
value be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are
met. The adoption of SFAS 133, as amended, has not had a significant impact on
our financial position or results of operations.

In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 "Business
Combinations" and SFAS No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets," effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001.
SFAS No. 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all
business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001, and that the use of the
pooling-of-interest method is no longer allowed.  Under SFAS No. 142 goodwill
and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be
amortized but will be subject to an annual impairment test in accordance with
the new standards.  Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over
their respective useful lives. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 141 and SFAS No.
142 as of January 1, 2002.  The Company does not currently believe that the
adoption of SFAS No. 141 and SFAS No. 142 will have a significant impact on its
financial position or results of operations.

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144 "Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets", effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2001.  SFAS No. 144 addresses financial accounting
and reporting for impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and supersedes
SFAS 121.  The Company will adopt SFAS No. 144 as of January 1, 2002.  The
Company does not currently believe that the adoption of SFAS No. 144 will have a
significant impact on its financial position or results of operations.

6. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN

Effective May 1, 1996, the Company established a defined contribution
retirement plan (the "Plan"). All U.S. employees who are at least 21 years of
age are eligible to participate. Contributions of up to 15% of compensation may
be made by employees to the Plan through salary withholdings. Employer
contributions are made solely at the Company's discretion. No employer
contributions were made to the Plan for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000,
and 1999.

7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Operating Leases

We leased approximately 50,000 square feet in
Mountain View, California.  The lease expired in February 2002 and was not
renewed.

The Company entered into a lease arrangement for office space
in Sunnyvale, California effective January 2002. The lease expires April 30,
2007. The lease includes a renewal option for one additional five-year term.

Future minimum rental commitments under the operating leases
as of December 31, 2001 are as follows (in thousands):

2002.............................. $   1,328
      2003..............................     1,881
      2004..............................     2,681

                                          =========

Rent expense was approximately $936,000, $884,000, and
$882,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.
Rental income from a sublease was approximately $175,000 and $244,000 for the
years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. This sublease agreement
expired in July 2000.

Contingencies

The arrangement entered into with IBM in December
1997 provides for two payments of $1.0 million each upon the Company reaching
revenue milestones, as defined, of $25.0 million and $50.0 million,
respectively. Each $1.0 million payment is due and payable after the end of the
fiscal year in which the cumulative total of all sales of products and services
in that year meet the revenue milestone. The Company reached the $25.0 million
revenue milestone in fiscal year 2000 and therefore accrued a $1.0 million
royalty payable at December 31, 2000. The Company reached the $50.0 million
revenue milestone in fiscal year 2001 and therefore accrued a $1.0 million
royalty payable at December 31, 2001.  Other than described, no further payments
are due under the IBM arrangement.

On May 10, 2000, Computer Motion, Inc. filed a lawsuit in
United States District Court for the Central District of California (Case No.
CV00-4988 CBM) alleging that by making, using, selling or offering for sale our

da Vinci

Surgical System, we are infringing United States Patent Numbers
5,524,180, 5,762,458, 5,815,640, 5,855,583, 5,878,193, 5,907,664 and 6,001,108
in willful disregard of Computer Motion's patent rights. On June 1, 2000,
Computer Motion amended its lawsuit to allege that we also infringe U.S. Patent
Number 6,063,095. On October 30, 2000, Computer Motion filed a motion seeking to
add U.S. Patent Number 6,102,850 to the litigation. Each of these nine patents
concerns methods and devices for conducting various aspects of robotic surgery.
Until February 2001, the litigation was proceeding in the early stages of
discovery, with no trial date set. In February 2001, in response to Intuitive's
request, the District Court stayed -- put on hold -- all proceedings in the
litigation because of the declaration by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
("PTO") of three "interferences" proceedings between a single SRI patent
application exclusively licensed to us and three of Computer Motion's patents
(see next paragraph). In February 2002, over Computer Motion's objection, the
District Court extended the stay through a status conference presently scheduled
for late March 2002.  At that conference, Intuitive and Computer Motion will
discuss with the Court the propriety of further extending the stay through
decisions by the Patent Office in the interferences. The Computer Motion action
seeks damages based upon the making, using, selling and offering for sale of our
products and processes, and seeks to enjoin our continued activities relating to
these products. This action subjects us to potential liability for damages,
including treble damages, and could require us to cease making, using or selling
the affected products, or to obtain a license in order to continue to
manufacture, use or sell the affected products. While we continue to believe we
have multiple meritorious defenses to this action, we cannot assure you that we
ultimately will prevail on any issue in the litigation or that we will be able
to successfully defend Computer Motion's charges, nor can we provide assurance
that any license required would be made available on commercially acceptable
terms, if at all. Failure to successfully defend against the Computer Motion
action could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Due
to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the
ultimate outcome of this matter at this time and, therefore, cannot estimate the
range of possible loss.

On December 7 and 8, 2000, the U.S. Patent Office formally
declared three interference proceedings between a single SRI patent application
licensed to Intuitive and three of Computer Motion's patents: Nos. 5,855,583,
5,878,193, and 5,907,664.   An interference is a proceeding within the U.S.
Patent Office to resolve questions regarding the patentability of inventions and
who first invented subject matter claimed by two or more patents or patent
applications.  These three interferences resulted from requests for interference
filed in May through July 1999.  Because the SRI patent application licensed to
Intuitive was filed in January 1992 and Computer Motion's three patents were
filed no earlier than August 1992 and as late as February 1996, SRI/Intuitive
will be the "Senior Party" in each interference. As "Junior Party," Computer
Motion will bear the burden of proving that it is entitled to keep its patents.
During the first half of 2001, the parties filed over 20 motions in the three
interferences.  On October 10, 2001, the PTO held a hearing on all motions filed
in all three interferences.  Decisions regarding all of the motions are
presently expected by the end of April 2002.

In September 2000, we filed a Notice of Opposition in the
European Patent Office ("EPO") challenging European Patent No. 653,922, which
was issued to Computer Motion in 1999 and is related to several of the patents
now involved in the U.S. litigation and the interference proceedings. An
Opposition proceeding allows the EPO to determine whether the challenged patent
should be revoked in its entirety, should be amended, or should remain
unaltered. In its Notice of Opposition, Intuitive cited numerous prior art
references not cited to the EPO during the '922 patent's original prosecution.

On March 30, 2001, Intuitive and International Business
Machines Corporation ("IBM") jointly filed suit against Computer
Motion, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware.  The
complaint alleges that by continuing to make, use, sell, and offer for sale its
AESOP and ZEUS voice-controlled products, Computer Motion willfully infringes
U.S. Patent No. 6,201,984.  The '984 patent which concerns various aspects of
voice control of surgical instruments issued to IBM in early March 2001 and is
exclusively licensed to us.  The '984 patent predates by several years Computer
Motion's development of voice-controlled surgical robots.  Because Computer
Motion's voice-controlled HERMES product interfaces with the AESOP and ZEUS
products, HERMES is also implicated in the patent infringement complaint.  Trial
is presently set for the third quarter of 2002.  The Court so far has denied
Computer Motion's request to add its own U.S. Patent No. 6,244,809 to this
Delaware litigation and has refused to entertain Computer Motion's allegations
that we infringe the '809 patent by making, using, selling and offering for sale
our

da Vinci

Surgical System.  The Delaware Court has also refused
Computer Motion's request to transfer the litigation to California.

On September 1, 2000, Brookhill-Wilk 1, LLC ("Wilk") filed a
lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York (Case No. 00 Civ. 6599 (NRB)) alleging that by making, using, selling or
offering for sale our

da Vinci

Surgical System, we are infringing U.S.
Patent Nos. 5,217,003 and 5,368,015 in willful disregard of Wilk's patent
rights. These patents concern methods and devices for "remote" surgery. In March
2001, Wilk withdrew its assertion of the "015 patent against Intuitive, leaving
only the '003 patent at issue in the suit. On November 8, 2001, the District
Court granted summary judgment of noninfringement of the '003 patent in our
favor and dismissed Wilk's complaint in its entirety.  Wilk has since filed a
notice with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to appeal the
summary judgment ruling. Briefing on the appeal should conclude in mid-2002,
with a hearing date possible towards the end of 2002 or in early 2003.  We
believe the appellate court will uphold the summary judgment of noninfringement.
However, if we lose the appeal and ultimately also lose Wilk's suit against us,
it will hurt our competitive position, may be costly to us and may prevent us
from selling our products. In addition, if we lose the patent suit, we may need
to obtain from Wilk a license to this technology if we are to continue to market
our products that have been found to infringe Wilk's patents. This license could
be expensive, which could seriously harm our business. We believe that we have
multiple meritorious defenses in this action. However, litigation is
unpredictable and we may not prevail with any of these defenses. If Wilk is
successful in its suit against us and is unwilling to grant us a license, we may
be required to stop selling our products that are found to infringe Wilk's
patents unless we can redesign them so they do not infringe Wilk's patents,
which we may be unable to do. In addition, if we lose the patent suit, we could
be required to pay Wilk damages, including treble damages, which could be
substantial and harm our financial position.

The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that
arise in the normal course of its business. We cannot assure that we will
prevail in these matters nor can we assure that any remedy could be reached on
commercially viable terms, if at all. Due to the inherent uncertainties of
litigation, the Company cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of these
matters at this time and, therefore, cannot estimate the range of possible
loss.

8. NOTES PAYABLE

Notes payable consists of the following (in thousands):

December 31,
                                                                     ------------------

Notes payable are collateralized by fixed assets specified
under each agreement. Assets collateralized under these agreements total $7.2
million and $8.0 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Certain of
the notes payable contain covenants pertaining to profitability levels and
certain other financial ratios. As of December 31, 2001, the Company is in
compliance with all covenants. Principal maturities of notes payable at December
31, 2001 are as follows: 2002 -- $1.63 million; 2003 -- $606,000; and 2004 --
$166,000.

The fair value of notes payable is estimated based on current
interest rates available to the Company for debt instruments with similar terms,
degrees of risk and remaining maturities. The carrying values of these
obligations approximate their respective fair values as of December 31, 2001 and
2000.

9. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

Convertible Preferred Stock

During the first quarter of the year ended December
31, 2000, the Company issued 3,593,875 shares of Series F convertible preferred
stock, upon exercise of warrants at a weighted-average exercise price of $9.84
per share, for net proceeds of $34.8 million.

Each share of Series A, B, C, D and E convertible preferred
stock then outstanding was converted automatically upon the closing of the
Company's initial public offering on a one-for-one basis into 19,134,375 shares
of common stock. Each share of Series F convertible preferred stock was
converted on a 1.02363638 basis into 3,678,798 shares of common stock.

On June 13, 2000, as part of the initial public offering of
our common stock, we issued 5,000,000 shares of our common stock at an offering
price of $9.00 per share. On July 13, 2000, the underwriters exercised in full
their over-allotment option to purchase an additional 750,000 shares at $9.00
per share. Cash proceeds from the sale of the 5,750,000 shares of common stock,
net of underwriters' discount and offering expenses, totaled approximately $46.8
million.

Common Stock

The Company has reserved the following shares of
common stock for the exercise of warrants and the issuance of options and rights
granted under the Company's stock option plans as follows:

December 31,
                                       -----------------------
                                          2001        2000

                                       =========== ===========

The Company has previously issued shares of common stock, which are
subject to the Company's right to repurchase at the original issuance price upon
the occurrence of certain events as defined in the agreements relating to the
sale of such stock. As of December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999 shares subject to
repurchase were 34,561, 409,612, and 1,232,006, respectively.

Warrants

In April 1997, in connection with one of the notes
payable discussed in Note 8, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 11,000
shares of common stock at an exercise price of $5.00 per share. In August 2000,
this warrant was exercised under a net exercise provision resulting in the
issuance of 7,774 shares of common stock.

In conjunction with the issuance of Series E convertible
preferred stock, the Company issued to each purchaser a warrant to purchase
shares in Series F convertible preferred stock at a price initially equal to
$8.00 per preferred share. Warrants to purchase 5,096,875 shares of Series F
convertible preferred stock were issued. The exercise price increased on every
subsequent one-month anniversary of the issuance date by $0.1667 per month up to
a maximum exercise price of $10.00 per preferred share. During the year ended
December 31, 2000, warrants to purchase 3,593,875 shares of Series F convertible
preferred stock were exercised at a weighted-average exercise price of $9.84 per
share for net proceeds of $34.8 million. The unexercised warrants expired in
March 2000.

In June 2000, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 5,081
shares of common stock at an exercise price of $9.00 per share to one company.
The warrant, which was fully vested and immediately exercisable, expires in June
2010. The value of the warrant was estimated using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model and was determined to be immaterial.

In April 2000, the Company entered into an agreement with
Heartport, Inc. to exclusively license a number of Heartport's patents in
exchange for cash of $3.0 million and a warrant to purchase 200,000 shares of
common stock at an exercise price of $3.00 per share. In accordance with EITF
96-18, "Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than
Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling Goods or Services," the
value of the warrant was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model
with the following assumptions: stock price on the date of grant of $9.90 per
share, risk-free interest rate of 6.5%, contractual life of 5 years, volatility
of 0.75 and no dividend yield, resulting in a value of $1.7 million. As a result
of this agreement, we capitalized approximately $4.7 million as intangible and
other assets, which will be amortized over the estimated useful life of the
patents which is approximately six years. The warrant, which was fully vested
and immediately exercisable was exercised by Heartport, Inc. in June 2001.

Stock Option Plans

In January 1996, the Board of Directors adopted, and
the stockholders approved, the 1996 Equity Incentive Plan (the "1996 Plan")
under which employees, consultants and directors may be granted Incentive Stock
Options ("ISOs") and Nonstatutory Stock Options ("NSOs") to purchase shares of
the company's common stock. The 1996 Plan permits ISOs to be granted at an
exercise price not less than the fair value on the date of grant and NSOs at an
exercise price not less than 85% of the fair value on the date of grant. Options
granted under the 1996 Plan generally expire 10 years from the date of grant and
become exercisable upon grant subject to repurchase rights in favor of the
Company until vested. Options generally vest 12.5% upon completion of 6 months
service and 1/48 per month thereafter; however, options may be granted with
different vesting terms as determined by the Board of Directors. A total of
4,840,000 shares of common stock have been authorized for issuance pursuant to
the 1996 Plan as of December 31, 2001.

In March 2000, the Board of Directors adopted the 2000 Equity
Incentive Plan, which took effect upon the closing of the Company's initial
public offering. The Company has reserved an additional 5,160,000 shares under
this plan. This plan is an amendment and restatement of the 1996 Plan. Also in
March 2000, the Board of Directors adopted the 2000 Non-Employee Directors'
Stock Option Plan and the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Company has
reserved 300,000 and 1,000,000 shares for the issuances under these plans,
respectively. These plans were also effective upon the closing of the Company's
initial public offering.  Each of these plans contains an evergreen provision
whereas the authorized shares are automatically increased concurrent with the
Company's annual meeting of shareholders.  In May 2001, the Company reserved an
additional 1,986,600 shares for the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan, 107,487 shares
for the 2000 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan and 179,145 shares for
the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

Option activity under the 1996 and 2000 Plans was as follows:

Under the 1996 and 2000 Plans, the Company may also
grant rights to purchase restricted stock. Terms and conditions of these rights
are determined by the Board of Directors. However, no right shall be granted at
an exercise price which is less than 85% of the fair value of the Company's
common stock on the date of grant. Exercise of these share purchase rights are
made pursuant to restricted stock purchase agreements containing provisions
established by the Board of Directors. These provisions give the Company the
right to repurchase the shares at the original purchase price of the stock. The
right expires at a rate determined by the Board of Directors, generally at a
rate of 12.5% after 6 months and 1/48 per month thereafter. For the years ended
December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, the Company repurchased 22,171, 36,969, and
117,677 shares under the 1996 and 2000 Plans.

As of December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, 6,837,440,
5,263,970, and 203,997 shares were available for future grant under the 1996 and
2000 Plans.

For the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, the
Company recorded deferred stock compensation of $0, $4.1 million, and $619,000,
respectively, representing the difference between the exercise price and the
fair value for accounting purposes of the Company's common stock on the date
such options were granted. For the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and
1999, the Company recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation of $1.6
million, $2.5 million, and $800,000, respectively. As of December 31, 2001 and
2000, the Company had $886,000 and $2.5 million of remaining unamortized
deferred compensation, respectively. Such amount is included as a reduction of
stockholders' equity and is being amortized over the vesting period of the
underlying options using the graded-vesting method. Future amortization of
deferred compensation at December 31, 2001 is as follows: 2002 -- $662,000 and
2003 -- $227,000.

Stock-Based Compensation

Pro forma information regarding net loss is required
by SFAS No. 123, as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options
under the fair value method of SFAS 123. Option valuation models require the
input of highly subjective assumptions. Because the Company's employee stock
options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded
options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially
affect the fair value estimate, in management's opinion, the existing models do
not necessarily provide a reliable measure of the fair value of its employee
stock options.

The weighted-average estimated fair value of these options
during fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999 was $3.4, $1.07, and $1.37 per share,
respectively. The fair value of these options was estimated at the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following weighted-average
assumptions:

We have elected to follow APB 25 in accounting for our
employee stock options. Under APB 25, we recognize no compensation expense in
our financial statements except in connection with the grant of restricted stock
for nominal consideration and unless the exercise price of our employee stock
option is less than the market price of the underlying stock on the grant date.

We determined the following pro forma information regarding net income and
earnings per share as if we had accounted for our employee stock options under
the fair value method prescribed by SFAS 123. For purposes of pro forma
disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options is amortized to expense
over the vesting periods. The pro forma information is as follows (in thousands,
except per share amounts):

10. INCOME TAXES

There is no provision for income taxes because the
Company has incurred operating losses.

Deferred income taxes reflect tax carryforwards and the net
tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting and the amount used for income tax purposes.
Significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets are as follows (in
thousands):

As of December 31,
                                                   --------------------
                                                     2001       2000

                                                   =========  =========

Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon
future earnings; the timing and amount of which are uncertain. Accordingly, the
net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance. The
valuation allowance increased by $7.8 million and $7.0 million during the years
ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. As of December 31, 2001, the
Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal tax purposes of
approximately $72.0 million which expire in the years 2010 through 2021 and
federal research and development tax credits of approximately $2.7 million which
expire in the years 2011 through 2021. Utilization of the Company's net
operating loss may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the
ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar
state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of the net
operating loss before utilization.

11. OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

At December 31, the fair value of the Company's other
financial instruments is as follows (in thousands):

Forward foreign exchange contracts. $      --  $      --  $      --  $      67

At December 31, outstanding notional amounts for
derivative financial instruments are as follows (in thousands):

2001       2000
                                     ---------  ---------
Forward foreign exchange contracts. $      --  $     781

While the contract or notional amounts provide one
measure of the volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount of
the Company's exposure to credit risk. The amounts potentially subject to credit
risk (arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of
their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the
counterparties' obligations exceed the obligations of the Company. The Company
controls credit risk through credit approvals, limits, and monitoring
procedures. See additional information at "Other financial instruments"
contained in Note 1.

At December 31, 2001 the Company did not hold any forward
exchange contracts.

At December 31, 2000 the Company had forward foreign exchange
contracts of approximately 2 months duration, to exchange euro and Belgian
Francs for U.S. dollars in the total gross notional amount of $781,000. This
notional amount represents forward contracts to sell foreign currency of
$781,000.
