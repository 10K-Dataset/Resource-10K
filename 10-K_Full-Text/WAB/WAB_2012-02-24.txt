PART I

Item 1.

BUSINESS

General

Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation, doing business as Wabtec Corporation, is a Delaware corporation with headquarters at 1001
Air Brake Avenue in Wilmerding, Pennsylvania. Our telephone number is 412-825-1000, and our website is located at

www.wabtec.com

. All references to “we”, “our”, “us”, the “Company” and
“Wabtec” refer to Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries. Westinghouse Air Brake Company (“WABCO”) was formed in 1990 when it acquired certain assets and operations from American Standard, Inc., now
known as Trane (“Trane”). In 1999, WABCO merged with MotivePower Industries, Inc. (“MotivePower”) and adopted the name Wabtec.

Today, Wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of value-added, technology-based equipment and services for the global rail industry. We believe we hold approximately a 50% market share in
North America for our primary braking-related equipment and a leading position in North America for most of our other product lines. Our highly engineered products, which are intended to enhance safety, improve productivity and reduce maintenance
costs for customers, can be found on virtually all U.S. locomotives, freight cars, subway cars and buses. In 2011, the Company had sales of almost $2 billion and net income of about $170 million. In 2011 sales of aftermarket parts and services
represented about 57% of total sales, while sales to customers outside of the U.S. accounted for about 47% of total sales.

Industry
Overview

The Company primarily serves the worldwide freight rail and passenger transit industries. As such, our operating
results are largely dependent on the level of activity, financial condition and capital spending plans of the global railroad and transit industries. Many factors influence these industries, including general economic conditions; rail traffic, as
measured by freight tonnage and passenger ridership; government spending on public transportation; and investment in new technologies by freight rail and passenger transit systems.

According to a recent study by UNIFE, the Association of the European Rail Industry, the accessible global market for railway products
and services is more than $100.0 billion, and it is expected to grow at 2%-2.5% annually through 2016. The three largest markets, which represent about 80% of the total market, are Europe, Asia-Pacific and North America.

In North America, railroads carry about 43% of intercity freight, as measured by ton-miles, which is more than any other mode of
transportation. They are an integral part of the continent’s economy and transportation system, serving nearly every industrial, wholesale and retail sector. Through direct ownership and operating partnerships, U.S. railroads are part of an
integrated network that includes railroads in Canada and Mexico, forming what is regarded as the world’s most-efficient and lowest-cost freight rail service. There are more than 500 railroads operating in North America, with the largest
railroads, referred to as “Class I,” accounting for more than 90% of the industry’s revenues. Although the railroads carry a wide variety of commodities and goods, coal is the single-largest item, representing about 45% of carloadings
in 2011. Intermodal traffic—the movement of trailers or containers by rail in combination with another mode of transportation—has been the railroads’ fastest-growing market segment in the past 10 years. Railroads operate in a
competitive environment, especially with the trucking industry, and are always seeking ways to improve safety, cost and reliability. New technologies offered by Wabtec and others in the industry can provide some of these benefits.

Demand for our freight related products and services in North America is driven by a number of factors, including:

•

Rail traffic.

The Association of American Railroads (AAR) compiles statistics that gauge the level of activity in the freight rail industry. Two
important statistics are revenue ton-miles and carloadings,



which are generally referred to as “rail traffic”. In 2011, revenue ton-miles increased 3.2%, carloadings increased 2.2%, and intermodal carloadings increased 5.4%, as rail traffic
continued to rebound from the 2008-09 economic recession in the U.S.

•

Demand for new locomotives.

Currently, the active locomotive fleet for Class I railroads in North America is about 24,000. The average number of
new locomotives delivered over the past 10 years was about 800 annually. In 2011, about 1,075 new, heavy-haul locomotives were delivered, compared to about 575 in 2010.

•

Demand for new freight cars

. Currently, the active freight car fleet in North America is about 1.4 million. The average number of new freight
cars delivered over the past 10 years was about 45,000 annually. In 2011, about 48,000 new freight cars were delivered, compared to about 17,000 cars in 2010.

In the U.S., the passenger transit industry is dependent largely on funding from federal, state and local governments, and from fare box
revenues. With about 40% of the nation’s passenger transit vehicles, the New York City region is the largest passenger transit market in the U.S., but most major cities also offer either rail or bus transit services.

Demand for North American passenger transit products is driven by a number of factors, including:

•

Government funding.

The U.S. federal government provides money to local transit authorities, primarily to fund the purchase of new equipment and
infrastructure for their transit systems. Under a multi-year spending bill known as SAFETEA-LU, federal government funding increased on average by 6-8% annually from 2005-09. SAFETEA-LU expired in September 2009 but funding has been maintained at
current levels until a new bill is completed. In 2012, Congress is expected to discuss a new funding bill, but there can be no assurance that future funding will increase or be maintained at current levels. The number of new transit cars delivered
in 2011 was about 850, compared to about 1,100 in 2010. The number of new buses delivered in 2011 was about 4,700 compared to about 5,300 in 2010. In the past 10 years, the average number of new transit cars delivered annually is about 600, and the
average number of new buses delivered annually is about 4,800.

•

Ridership

. Ridership provides fare box revenues to transit authorities, which use these funds, along with state and local money, primarily for
equipment and system maintenance. Based on preliminary figures from the American Public Transportation Association, ridership on U.S. transit vehicles increased about 2% in 2011, after a 1% decrease in 2010 due to the economic recession. Prior to
2009, ridership had increased for six consecutive years.

Outside of North America, many of the rail systems
have historically been focused on passenger transit, rather than freight. In recent years, however, railroads in countries such as Australia, Brazil, India and China have been investing capital to expand and improve both their freight and passenger
rail systems. Throughout the world, some government-owned railroads are being sold to private owners, who often look to improve the efficiency of the rail system by investing in new equipment and new technologies. According to UNIFE, emerging
markets are expected to grow at above-average rates as global trade creates increases in freight volumes and urbanization leads to increased demand for efficient mass-transportation systems. As this growth occurs, Wabtec expects to have additional
opportunities to provide products and services in these markets.

In Europe, the majority of the rail system serves the
passenger transit market, which is expected to continue growing as high fuel costs and environmental factors encourage investment in public mass transit. France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Italy are the largest transit markets, representing
about two-thirds of passenger traffic in the European Union. In their most recent financial reports, SNCF (French national railway) and Deutsche Bahn (German national railway) reported increases in passenger traffic of 3.8% for the first nine months
of 2011 and 1.3% for the first six months of 2011, respectively. About 75% of freight traffic in Europe is hauled by truck, while rail accounts for about 20%. The largest freight markets in Europe are Germany, Poland



and the United Kingdom. In the first half of 2011, Deutsche Bahn reported an 8% increase in freight-related revenues compared to the same period in 2010. According to UNIFE, the European rail
market consists of about 33,000 locomotives, about 700,000 freight cars and about 150,000 passenger transit cars. In recent years, the European market purchased on average about 1,300 new locomotives, about 1,000 new freight cars and about 8,500 new
passenger transit cars annually.

The Asia/Pacific market is now the second-largest geographic segment, according to a recent
UNIFE study. This market consists primarily of China, India and Australia. Growth has been driven by the continued urbanization of China and India, and by investment in freight rail infrastructure to serve the mining and natural resources markets in
those countries, as well as in Australia. According to UNIFE, this market consists of about 34,000 locomotives and about 1 million freight cars. Wabtec estimates that rail equipment spending in China decreased in 2011, as the government
continued to invest in expansion of its freight and passenger rail network, but curtailed investments in high-speed rail due to a crash in July 2011. The Indian government forecasted that in 2011 freight rail traffic increased about 12% and
passenger rail traffic increased about 5%. India is expected to increase spending significantly in 2012 as it seeks to modernize its rail system.

Business Segments and Products

We provide our products and services
through two principal business segments, the Freight Group and the Transit Group, both of which have different market characteristics and business drivers.

The Freight Group primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing freight cars and locomotives, builds new switcher locomotives, rebuilds freight locomotives, supplies railway
electronics, positive train control equipment, signal design and engineering services, and provides related heat exchange and cooling systems. Customers include large, publicly traded railroads, leasing companies, manufacturers of original equipment
such as locomotives and freight cars, and utilities. As discussed previously, demand in the freight market is primarily driven by rail traffic, and deliveries of new locomotives and freight cars. In 2011, the Freight Group accounted for 61% of our
total sales, with about 75% of its sales in North America and the remainder to international customers. In 2011, slightly more than half of the Freight Group’s sales were in aftermarket.

The Transit Group primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing passenger transit vehicles, typically subway cars
and buses, builds new commuter locomotives and refurbishes subway cars. Customers include public transit authorities and municipalities, leasing companies, and manufacturers of subway cars and buses around the world. As discussed previously, demand
in the transit market is primarily driven by government funding at all levels and passenger ridership. In 2011, the Transit Group accounted for 39% of our total sales, with about half of its sales in North America and the remainder to international
customers. About two-thirds of the Transit Group’s sales are in the aftermarket and the remainder in the original equipment market.

Following is a summary of our leading product lines in both aftermarket and original equipment across both of our business segments:

We have become a leader in the rail industry by capitalizing on the strength of our existing products, technological capabilities and new product innovation, and by our ability to harden products to
protect them from severe conditions, including extreme temperatures and high-vibration environments. Supported by our technical staff of over 850 engineers and specialists, we have extensive experience in a broad range of product lines, which
enables us to provide comprehensive, systems-based solutions for our customers.

Over the past several
years, we introduced a number of significant new products, including electronic braking equipment and train control equipment that encompasses onboard digital data and global positioning communication protocols. In 2007, for example, the Federal
Railroad Administration (FRA) approved the use of our Electronic Train Management System

®

, which offers safety
benefits to the rail industry. In 2008, the U.S. federal government enacted a rail safety bill that mandates the use of Positive Train Control (“PTC”) technology, which includes on-board locomotive computer and related software, on a
majority of the locomotives and track in the U.S. With our Electronic Train Management System

®

, we are the
leading supplier of this on-board train control equipment, and we are working with the U.S. Class I railroads, commuter rail authorities and other industry suppliers to implement this technology by the December 31, 2015 deadline set in the rail
safety bill. As part of its new surface transportation funding bill, a House committee has proposed extending this deadline to December 31, 2020.

In 2011, Wabtec recorded about $125 million of revenue from implementation of PTC projects both foreign and domestic. These projects include: A $165 million contract to design and install a train control
system for MRS Logistica, the fourth-largest railroad in Brazil; a $63 million contract to provide train control equipment and services for Denver Transit Partners for three new commuter rail lines; and a $27 million contract to provide train
control equipment for Metrolink, a commuter rail agency in Los Angeles.

For additional information on our business segments,
see Note 19 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.

Competitive
Strengths

Our key strengths include:

•

Leading market positions in core products

. Dating back to 1869 and George Westinghouse’s invention of the air brake, we are an established
leader in the development and manufacture of pneumatic braking



equipment for freight and passenger transit vehicles. We have leveraged our leading position by focusing on research and engineering to expand beyond pneumatic braking components to supplying
integrated parts and assemblies for the locomotive through the end of the train. We are a recognized leader in the development and production of electronic recording, measuring and communications systems, positive train control equipment, highly
engineered compressors and heat exchangers for locomotives, and a leading manufacturer of freight car components, including electronic braking equipment, draft gears, trucks, brake shoes and electronic end-of-train devices. We are also the leading
manufacturer of commuter locomotives and a leading provider of braking equipment, door assemblies, lifts and ramps, and couplers for passenger transit vehicles.

•

Breadth of product offering with a stable mix of original equipment market (OEM) and aftermarket business

. Our product portfolio is one of the
broadest in the rail industry, as we offer a wide selection of quality parts, components and assemblies across the entire train. We provide our products in both the original equipment market and the aftermarket. Our substantial installed base of
products with end-users such as the railroads and the passenger transit authorities is a significant competitive advantage for providing products and services to the aftermarket because these customers often look to purchase safety- and
performance-related replacement parts from the original equipment components supplier. In addition, as OEMs and Class I railroad operators attempt to modernize fleets with new products designed to improve and maintain safety and efficiency, these
products must be designed to be interoperable with existing equipment. Over the last several years, more than 50% of our total net sales have come from our aftermarket products and services business.

•

Leading design and engineering capabilities

. We believe a hallmark of our relationship with our customers has been our leading design and
engineering practice, which has, in our opinion, assisted in the improvement and modernization of global railway equipment. We believe both our customers and the government authorities value our technological capabilities and commitment to
innovation, as we seek not only to enhance the efficiency and profitability of our customers, but also to improve the overall safety of the railways through continuous improvement of product performance. The Company has an established record of
product improvements and new product development. We have assembled a wide range of patented products, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage. Wabtec currently owns over 1,250 active patents worldwide and over 500 U.S. patents.
During the last three years, we have filed for more than 350 patents worldwide in support of our new and evolving product lines.

•

Experience with industry regulatory requirements.

The U.S. rail industry is governed by the AAR and by the FRA. These groups mandate rigorous
manufacturer certification, new product testing and approval processes that we believe are difficult for new entrants to meet cost-effectively and efficiently without the scale and extensive experience we possess.

•

Experienced management team and the Wabtec Performance System

. The Company has implemented numerous initiatives that enable us to manage
successfully through cycles in the rail supply market. For example, the Wabtec Performance System (WPS), an ongoing program that focuses on lean manufacturing principles and continuous improvement across all aspects of our business, has been a part
of the Company’s culture for more than 20 years. As a result, our management team has improved our cost structure, operating leverage and financial flexibility, and placed the Company in an excellent position to benefit from growth
opportunities.

Business strategy

Using WPS, we strive to generate sufficient cash to invest in our growth strategies and to build on what we consider to be a leading position as a low-cost producer in the industry while maintaining
world-class product quality, technology and customer responsiveness. Through WPS and employee-directed initiatives such as Kaizen, a Japanese-developed team concept, we continuously strive to improve quality, delivery and productivity, and to reduce
costs. These efforts enable us to streamline processes, improve product reliability and



customer satisfaction, reduce product cycle times and respond more rapidly to market developments. Over time, these lean initiatives have enabled us to increase operating margins, improve cash
flow and strengthen our ability to invest in the following growth strategies:

•

Expand globally and into new product markets

. We believe that international markets represent a significant opportunity for future growth. In
2011, sales to non-U.S. customers were $916.3 million, including export sales from the Company’s U.S. operations of $410.6 million. We intend to increase our existing international sales through strategic acquisitions, direct sales of products
through our existing subsidiaries and licensees, and joint ventures with railway suppliers which have a strong presence in their local markets. We are specifically targeting markets that operate significant fleets of U.S.-style locomotives and
freight cars, including Australia, Brazil, China, India, Russia, South Africa, and other select areas within Europe and South America. In addition, we have opportunities to sell certain products that we currently manufacture for the rail industry
into other industrial markets, such as mining, off-highway and energy. These products include heat exchangers and friction materials.

•

Expand aftermarket sales

. Historically, aftermarket sales are less cyclical than OEM sales because a certain level of aftermarket maintenance
and service work must be performed, even during an industry slowdown. In 2011, Wabtec’s aftermarket sales and services represented approximately 57% of the Company’s total sales. Wabtec provides aftermarket parts and services for its
components, and the Company is seeking to expand this business with new customers such as short-line and regional railroads, or with customers who currently perform the work in-house. In this way, we expect to take advantage of the rail industry
trend toward outsourcing, as railroads and transit authorities focus on their core function of transporting goods and people

.

•

Accelerate new product development

. We continue to emphasize research and development funding to create new and improved products. We are
focusing on technological advances, especially in the areas of electronics, braking products and other on-board equipment, as a means of new product growth. We seek to provide customers with incremental technological advances that offer immediate
benefits with cost-effective investments. In 2008, the U.S. federal government enacted a rail safety bill that mandates the use of PTC technology on a majority of the locomotives and track in the U.S. As the leading supplier of on-board train
control equipment, Wabtec is working with the U.S. Class I railroads, commuter rail authorities and other industry suppliers to implement this technology.

•

Seek acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances

. We are exploring acquisition, joint venture and alliance opportunities using a disciplined,
selective approach and rigorous financial criteria. Such acquisitions will not only be expected to meet these financial criteria but also achieve our growth strategies of global expansion, new products and expanding aftermarket sales. All of these
expansion strategies will help Wabtec to grow profitably, expand geographically, and dampen the impact from potential cycles in the North American rail industry.

Recent Acquisitions and Joint Ventures

Wabtec has completed certain
significant acquisitions in support of its growth strategies mentioned above:

•

November 2011, Wabtec acquired Fulmer Company, a leading manufacturer of motor components for rail, power generation and other industrial markets, for
a net purchase price of approximately $13.6 million.

•

November 2011, Wabtec acquired Bearward Engineering, a UK-based manufacturer of cooling systems and related equipment for power generation and other
industrial markets, for a net purchase price of approximately $43.6 million.

•

June 2011, we acquired an aftermarket transit parts business from GE Transportation, a parts supply business for propulsion and control systems for the
passenger transit car aftermarket in North America, for a net purchase price of $21.1 million.



•

February 2011, the Company acquired Brush Traction Group, a UK-based provider of locomotive overhauls, services and aftermarket components, for a net
purchase price of approximately $30.7 million.

•

November 2010, Wabtec acquired substantially all of the assets of Swiger Coil Systems, a manufacturer of traction motors and electric coils for the
rail and power generation markets, for a net purchase price of approximately $43.0 million.

•

August 2010, we acquired Bach-Simpson, a designer and manufacturer of electronic instrumentation devices for rail and transit markets, for a net
purchase price of approximately $12.0 million, and on July 28, 2010, the Company acquired G&B, a manufacturer of railroad track and signaling products, for a net purchase price of approximately $31.8 million.

•

March 2010, the Company acquired Xorail, a leading provider of signal engineering and design services, for a net purchase price of $39.9 million.

Backlog

The Company’s backlog was about $1.55 billion at December 31, 2011. For 2011, about 57% of sales came from aftermarket orders, which typically carry lead times of less than 30 days, and are not
recorded in backlog for a significant period of time.

The Company’s contracts are subject to standard industry
cancellation provisions, including cancellations on short notice or upon completion of designated stages. Substantial scope-of-work adjustments are common. For these and other reasons, completion of the Company’s backlog may be delayed or
cancelled. The railroad industry, in general, has historically been subject to fluctuations due to overall economic conditions and the level of use of alternative modes of transportation.

The backlog of firm customer orders as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, and the expected year of completion are as
follows:

Engineering and Development

To execute our strategy to develop new products, we invest in a variety of engineering and development activities. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, we invested about
$37.2 million, $40.2 million and $42.4 million, respectively, on product development and improvement activities. The engineering resources of the Company are allocated between research and development activities and the execution of original
equipment customer contracts.

Our engineering and development program is largely focused upon train control and new braking
technologies, with an emphasis on applying electronics to traditional pneumatic equipment. Electronic braking has been used in the transit industry for years, and freight railroads are conducting pilot programs to test its reliability and benefits.
Freight railroads have generally been slower to accept the technology due to issues over interoperability, connectivity and durability. We are proceeding with efforts to enhance the major components for existing hard-wired braking equipment and
development of new electronic technologies for the freight railroads. Sometimes we conduct specific research projects in conjunction with universities, customers and other railroad product suppliers.



We use our Product Development System (PDS) to develop and monitor new product programs. The
system requires the product development team to follow consistent steps throughout the development process, from concept to launch, to ensure the product will meet customer expectations and internal profitability targets.

Intellectual Property

We have more than 1,250 active patents worldwide. We also rely on a combination of trade secrets and other intellectual property laws,
nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our intellectual property.

Certain trademarks, among them the name WABCO

®

, were acquired or
licensed from American Standard Inc., now known as Trane, in 1990 at the time of our acquisition of the North American operations of the Railway Products Group of Trane. Other trademarks have been developed through the normal course of business, or
acquired as a part of our ongoing merger and acquisition program.

We have entered into a variety of license agreements as
licensor and licensee. We do not believe that any single license agreement is of material importance to our business or either of our business segments as a whole.

We have issued licenses to the two sole suppliers of railway air brakes and related products in Japan, Nabtesco and Mitsubishi Electric Company. The licensees pay annual license fees to us and also assist
us by acting as liaisons with key Japanese passenger transit vehicle builders for projects in North America. We believe that our relationships with these licensees have been beneficial to our core transit business and customer relationships in North
America.

Customers

Our customers include railroads and passenger transit authorities throughout North America, as well as in the United Kingdom, Australia, Europe, Asia, South Africa and South America; manufacturers of
transportation equipment, such as locomotives, freight cars, subway vehicles and buses; and lessors of such equipment.

In
2011, about 47% of sales were to customers outside the U.S. and to more than 100 countries throughout the world. About 57% of sales were in the aftermarket, with a majority of our remaining sales to OEMs of locomotives, freight cars, subway vehicles
and buses.

Top customers can change from year to year. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, our top five
customers accounted for 17% of net sales: General Electric Transportation, Eversholt (formally HSBC) Rail (UK) Ltd., CSX Transportation, Electro Motive (or CAT), and Union Pacific. No one customer represents 10% or more of consolidated sales. We
believe that we have strong relationships with all of our key customers.

Competition

We believe that we hold approximately a 50% market share in North America for our primary braking-related equipment and a leading market
position in North America for most of our other product lines. On a global basis, our market shares are smaller. We operate in a highly competitive marketplace. Price competition is strong because we have a relatively small number of customers and
they are very cost-conscious.

In addition to price, competition is based on product performance and technological leadership,
quality, reliability of delivery, and customer service and support.

Our principal competitors vary across product lines.
Within North America, New York Air Brake Company, a subsidiary of the German air brake producer Knorr-Bremse AG, is our principal overall OEM competitor. Our competition for locomotive, freight and passenger transit service and repair is mostly from
the railroads’ and



passenger transit authorities’ in-house operations, Electro-Motive Diesel, GE Transportation Systems, and New York Air Brake/Knorr. We believe our key strengths, which include leading market
positions in core products, breadth of product offering with a stable mix of OEM and aftermarket business, leading design and engineering capabilities, significant barriers to entry and an experienced management team, enable us to compete
effectively in this marketplace. Outside of North America, no individual company is our principal competitor in all our operating locations. Largest competitors for Brake and Transit products are Faiveley Transport and Knorr-Bremse.

Employees

At
December 31, 2011, we had 8,648 full-time employees, approximately 25% of whom were unionized. A majority of the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements are within North America and these agreements are generally effective from
2012 through 2014. Agreements expiring at various times during 2012 cover approximately 17% of the Company’s workforce. We consider our relations with employees and union representatives to be good, but cannot assure that future contract
negotiations will be favorable to us.

Regulation

In the course of our operations, we are subject to various regulations of agencies and other entities. In the United States, these include principally the FRA and the AAR. The FRA administers and enforces
federal laws and regulations relating to railroad safety. These regulations govern equipment and safety standards for freight cars and other rail equipment used in interstate commerce. The AAR oversees a wide variety of rules and regulations
governing safety and design of equipment, relationships among railroads with respect to railcars in interchange and other matters. The AAR also certifies railcar builders and component manufacturers that provide equipment for use on railroads in the
United States. New products generally must undergo AAR testing and approval processes. As a result of these regulations and those stipulated in other countries in which we derive our revenues, we must maintain certain certifications as a component

Item 1A.

RISK FACTORS

Prolonged unfavorable
economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business.

Unfavorable general economic and market conditions
in the United States and internationally could have a negative impact on our sales and operations. To the extent that these factors result in continued instability of capital markets, shortages of raw materials or component parts, longer sales
cycles, deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

We are dependent upon key customers.

We rely on several key
customers who represent a significant portion of our business. Our top customers can change from year to year. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, our top five customers accounted for 17% of our net sales. While we believe our
relationships with our customers are generally good, our top customers could choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with us. In addition, many of our customers place orders for products on an as-needed basis and operate in cyclical
industries. As a result, their order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future. Such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers, and may be subject to delays and cancellations.
As a result of our dependence on our key customers, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition if we lost any one or more of our key customers or if there is a reduction in their
demand for our products.

Our business operates in a highly competitive industry.

We operate in a competitive marketplace and face substantial competition from a limited number of established competitors in the United
States and abroad, some of which may have greater financial resources than we do. Price competition is strong and, coupled with the existence of a number of cost conscious customers, has historically limited our ability to increase prices. In
addition to price, competition is based on product performance and technological leadership, quality, reliability of delivery and customer service and support. There can be no assurance that competition in one or more of our markets will not
adversely affect us and our results of operations.

We intend to pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances that involve a number
of inherent risks, any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits.

One aspect of our business strategy
is to selectively pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances that we believe will improve our market position, and provide opportunities to realize operating synergies. These transactions involve inherent risks and uncertainties, any one of
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition including:

•

difficulties in achieving identified financial and operating synergies, including the integration of operations, services and products;

•

diversion of Management’s attention from other business concerns;

•

the assumption of unknown liabilities; and

•

unanticipated changes in the market conditions, business and economic factors affecting such an acquisition.

We cannot assure that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions, joint ventures or other business combinations. If we are
unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to consummate strategic acquisitions, we may be unable to fully implement our business strategy, and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result. In addition, our
ability to engage in strategic acquisitions will be dependent on our ability to raise substantial capital, and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement our acquisition strategy on terms satisfactory to us, if at all.



As we introduce new products and services, a failure to predict and react to consumer demand could
adversely affect our business.

We have dedicated significant resources to the development, manufacturing and marketing
of new products. Decisions to develop and market new transportation products are typically made without firm indications of customer acceptance. Moreover, by their nature, new products may require alteration of existing business methods or threaten
to displace existing equipment in which our customers may have a substantial capital investment. There can be no assurance that any new products that we develop will gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace or that such products will be able to
compete successfully with other new products or services that may be introduced by competitors. In addition, we may incur additional warranty or other costs as new products are tested and used by customers.

A portion of our sales are related to delivering products and services to help our U.S. railroad and transit customers meet the Positive Train
Control (PTC) mandate from the U.S. federal government, which requires the use of on-board locomotive computers and software by December 31, 2015.

For the year ended December 31, 2011, we had sales of about $125 million related to PTC. As part of its new surface transportation funding bill, a House committee has proposed extending the PTC deadline
to December 31, 2020, which could affect the rate of industry spending on this technology. Should the federal government change its mandate by amending the timing, scope or requirements of the safety bill, there could be an adverse impact on our
revenues in future periods, and would cause us to reassess the staffing, resources and assets deployed in delivering Positive Train Control services.

Our revenues are subject to cyclical variations in the railway and passenger transit markets and changes in government spending.

The railway industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations due to overall economic conditions, the use of alternate
methods of transportation and the levels of federal, state and local government spending on railroad transit projects. In economic downturns, railroads have deferred, and may defer, certain expenditures in order to conserve cash in the short term.
Reductions in freight traffic may reduce demand for our replacement products.

The passenger transit railroad industry is also
cyclical. New passenger transit car orders vary from year to year and are influenced greatly by major replacement programs and by the construction or expansion of transit systems by transit authorities. A substantial portion of our net sales have
been, and we expect that a material portion of our future net sales will be, derived from contracts with metropolitan transit and commuter rail authorities and Amtrak. To the extent that future funding for proposed public projects is curtailed or
withdrawn altogether as a result of changes in political, economic, fiscal or other conditions beyond our control, such projects may be delayed or cancelled, resulting in a potential loss of business for us, including transit aftermarket and new
transit car orders. There can be no assurance that economic conditions will be favorable or that there will not be significant fluctuations adversely affecting the industry as a whole and, as a result, us.

A growing portion of our sales may be derived from our international operations, which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an
international level.

In fiscal year 2011, approximately 47% of our consolidated net sales were to customers outside of
the U.S. and we intend to continue to expand our international operations in the future. We currently conduct our international operations through a variety of wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures in Australia, Austria, Brazil,
Canada, China, Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Italy, Macedonia, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, Spain, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. As a result, we are subject to various risks, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on
those operations and on our business as a whole, including:

•

lack of complete operating control;



•

lack of local business experience;

•

currency exchange fluctuations and devaluations;

•

foreign trade restrictions and exchange controls;

•

difficulty enforcing agreements and intellectual property rights;

•

the potential for nationalization of enterprises; and

•

economic, political and social instability and possible terrorist attacks against American interests.

In addition, certain jurisdictions have laws that limit the ability of non-U.S. subsidiaries and their affiliates to pay dividends and
repatriate cash flows.

We may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.

In the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding
costs associated with variable-rate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements. There can be no assurance that any of these
measures will be effective. Any material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to us.

We may have
liability arising from asbestos litigation.

Claims have been filed against the Company and certain of its affiliates
in various jurisdictions across the United States by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing products. Most of these claims have been made against our wholly owned subsidiary, Railroad Friction Products
Corporation (RFPC), and are based on a product sold by RFPC prior to the time that the Company acquired any interest in RFPC.

Most of these claims, including all of the RFPC claims, are submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity or to
non-affiliated companies that retain the liabilities for the asbestos-containing products at issue. We cannot, however, assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors or insurers will remain financially
viable. Our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims, as is the case with other pending litigation, cannot be estimated.

It is Management’s belief that the potential range of loss for asbestos-related bodily injury cases is not reasonably determinable at present due to a variety of factors, including: (1) the
asbestos case settlement history of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, RFPC; (2) the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation in general; and (3) the uncertainty of asbestos litigation in particular. Despite this
uncertainty, and although the results of the Company’s operations and cash flows for any given period could be adversely affected by asbestos-related lawsuits, Management believes that the final resolution of the Company’s asbestos-related
cases will not be material to the Company’s overall financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In general, this belief is based upon: (1) Wabtec’s and RFPC’s history of settlements and dismissals of
asbestos-related cases to date; (2) the inability of many plaintiffs to establish any exposure or causal relationship to RFPC’s product; and (3) the inability of many plaintiffs to demonstrate any identifiable injury or compensable
loss.

More specifically, as to RFPC, Management’s belief that any losses due to asbestos-related cases would not be
material is also based on the fact that RFPC owns insurance which provides coverage for asbestos-related bodily injury claims. To date, RFPC’s insurers have provided RFPC with defense and indemnity in these actions. The overall number of new
claims being filed against RFPC has dropped significantly in recent years; however, these new claims, and all previously filed claims, may take a significant period of time to resolve. As to Wabtec and its divisions, Management’s belief that
asbestos-related cases will not have a material impact is also based on



its position that it has no legal liability for asbestos-related bodily injury claims, and that the former owners of Wabtec’s assets retained asbestos liabilities for the products at issue.
To date, Wabtec has been able to successfully defend itself on this basis, including two arbitration decisions and a judicial opinion, all of which confirmed Wabtec’s position that it did not assume any asbestos liabilities from the former
owners of certain Wabtec assets. Although Wabtec has incurred defense and administrative costs in connection with asbestos bodily injury actions, these costs have not been material, and the Company has no information that would suggest these costs
would become material in the foreseeable future.

We are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations.

We are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water, the handling, storage and
disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances. We believe our operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and
regulations applicable to our business; however, there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements.

Future climate change regulation could result in increased operating costs, affect the demand for our products or affect the ability of our
critical suppliers to meet our needs.

The Company has followed the current debate over climate change and the related
policy discussion and prospective legislation. The potential challenges for the Company that climate change policy and legislation may pose have been reviewed by the Company. Any such challenges are heavily dependent on the nature and degree of
climate change legislation and the extent to which it applies to our industry. At this time, the Company cannot predict the ultimate impact of climate change and climate change legislation on the Company’s operations. Further, when or if these
impacts may occur cannot be assessed until scientific analysis and legislative policy are more developed and specific legislative proposals begin to take shape. Any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of
greenhouse gas could require us to incur increased operating costs, and could have an adverse effect on demand for our products. In addition, the price and availability of certain of the raw materials that we use could vary in the future as a result
of environmental laws and regulations affecting our suppliers. An increase in the price of our raw materials or a decline in their availability could adversely affect our operating margins or result in reduced demand for our products.

Our manufacturer’s warranties or product liability may expose us to potentially significant claims.

We warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products. Accordingly, we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty
claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death, or does not conform to our customers’ specifications. In addition, in recent years, we have introduced a number of new products for which we do not
have the same level of historical warranty experience. Although we have not had any material product liability or warranty claims made against us and we currently maintain liability insurance coverage, we cannot assure that product liability claims,
if made, would not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. The possibility exists for these types of warranty claims to result in costly product recalls,
significant repair costs and damage to our reputation.

Labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and
profitability.

We collectively bargain with labor unions that represent approximately 25% of our employees. Our
current collective bargaining agreements are generally effective from 2012 through 2014. Agreements expiring at various times during 2012 cover approximately 17% of the Company’s workforce. Failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes
or other labor protests which could disrupt our operations. If we were to experience a strike or work stoppage, it would be difficult for us to find a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills



to replace these employees. We cannot assure that we will reach any such agreement or that we will not encounter strikes or other types of conflicts with the labor unions of our personnel. Such
labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, could cause us to lose revenues and customers and might have permanent effects on our business.

From time to time we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers.

From time to time, we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers regarding routine delivery and performance issues as well as
adjustments for design changes and related extra work. These disputes are generally resolved in the ordinary course of business without having a material adverse impact on us.

Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health.

At
December 31, 2011, we had total debt of $395.9 million. If it becomes necessary to access our available borrowing capacity under the 2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement, along with carrying the $245.0 million currently borrowed under this
facility and the $150.0 million 6.875% senior notes, being indebted could have important consequences to us. For example, it could:

•

increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our
cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;

•

place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt; and

•

limit our ability to borrow additional funds.

The indenture for our $150 million 6.875% senior notes due in 2013 and our 2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement contain various covenants that limit our Management’s discretion in the operation of
our businesses.

The indenture governing the notes and our credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our
Management’s discretion.

The 2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement limits the Company’s ability to declare or pay cash
dividends and prohibits the Company from declaring or making other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. The 2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations: incurrence
of additional indebtedness; mergers, consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions; additional liens; sale and leasebacks; permissible investments, loans and advances; certain debt payments; capital expenditures; and imposes a minimum interest
expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio.

The indenture under which the senior notes were issued contains
covenants and restrictions which limit among other things, the following: the incurrence of indebtedness, payment of dividends and certain distributions, sale of assets, change in control, mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens.

The integration of our recently completed acquisitions may not result in anticipated improvements in market position or the realization
of anticipated operating synergies or may take longer to realize than expected.

In 2010 and 2011, we completed
multiple acquisitions with a combined investment of $235.8 million. Although we believe that the acquisitions will improve our market position and realize positive operating results,



including operating synergies, operating expense reductions and overhead cost savings, we cannot be assured that these improvements will be obtained. The management and acquisition of businesses
involves substantial risks, any of which may result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, including:

•

the uncertainty that an acquired business will achieve anticipated operating results;

•

significant expenses to integrate;

•

diversion of Management’s attention;

•

departure of key personnel from the acquired business;

•

effectively managing entrepreneurial spirit and decision-making;

•

integration of different information systems;

•

unanticipated costs and exposure to unforeseen liabilities; and

•

impairment of assets.

Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

Wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of
value-added, technology-based products and services for the global rail industry. Our products are found on virtually all U.S. locomotives, freight cars and passenger transit vehicles, as well as in more than 100 countries throughout the world. Our
products enhance safety, improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers, and many of our core products and services are essential in the safe and efficient operation of freight rail and passenger transit vehicles. Wabtec is a global
company with operations in 18 countries. In 2011, about 47% of the Company’s revenues came from customers outside the U.S.

Management
Review and Future Outlook

Wabtec’s long-term financial goals are to generate cash flow in excess of net income,
maintain a strong credit profile while minimizing our overall cost of capital, increase margins through strict attention to cost controls and implementation of the Wabtec Performance System, and increase revenues through a focused growth strategy,
including global and market expansion, new products and technologies, aftermarket products and services, and acquisitions. In addition, Management evaluates the Company’s current operational performance through measures such as quality and
on-time delivery.

The Company monitors a variety of factors and statistics to gauge market activity. The North America
freight rail industry is largely driven by general economic conditions, which can cause fluctuations in rail traffic. Based on those fluctuations, railroads can increase or decrease purchases of new locomotives and freight cars. In 2011 U.S. freight
rail traffic increased due to the improving overall economy. According to the Association of American Railroads, in 2011, revenue ton-miles increased 3.2%, carloadings increased 2.2% and intermodal loadings increased 5.4%, compared to the same
period of 2010, as rail traffic rebounded from the 2008-09 economic recession. This has had a favorable effect on the Company’s Freight Group, with increased demand for new locomotives and freight cars, and for aftermarket products and
services. About 15% of the Company’s revenues are directly related to deliveries of new freight cars, so the improvement in that market has had a favorable effect on the Company’s financial results. Whether demand continues to improve will
depend largely on continued strength in the overall economy and in rail traffic volumes.

In 2008, the U.S. government enacted
rail safety legislation that requires certain freight and passenger railroads to equip certain locomotives with positive train control (“PTC”) technology by the end of 2015. This technology includes an on-board locomotive
computer and related software, which are being developed by Wabtec. As the industry leader, Wabtec expects to benefit from increased sales of train control-related products and engineering services as the technology is deployed throughout the
industry. PTC revenue was about 125 million in 2011.

The North American transit rail industry is driven by government
spending and ridership. According to the American Public Transportation Association, spending under SAFETEA-LU, the federal government’s transportation funding bill increased about 6% in 2009 and remained consistent in 2010 and 2011, while
ridership decreased about 4% and 1% in 2009 and 2010, respectively, due to the recession and its impact on employment levels. Ridership increased about 2% in 2011. Although SAFETEA-LU expired in September 2009, the bill has been extended through
March 2012, with funding at about 2009 levels. Spending in 2012 is expected to remain at about current levels, and Congress is now considering various multi-year funding bills.

In 2011, market conditions improved in the North America freight rail market. Demand for new freight cars and locomotives was higher, due
to increasing freight rail traffic. In the passenger transit market during 2011, the Company believes that existing levels of federal funding and ridership resulted in consistent demand for new equipment and aftermarket parts when compared to
previous years; however, most government entities at all levels are facing budget issues, which could have a negative effect on demand for the Company’s products and services.



Wabtec continues to expand its presence in freight rail and passenger transit markets
outside the U.S., particularly in Europe, Asia-Pacific and South America. In Europe, the majority of the rail system serves the passenger transit market, which is larger than the transit market in the U.S. Our presence in the U.K., Germany and Italy
has positioned the Company to take advantage of this market. Asia-Pacific is a growth market and our various joint ventures and direct exports to China have positioned the Company to take advantage of this growth. Economic growth in Australia has
been an area of expansion for the Company as commodity suppliers use our products to meet the demands of their regional customers. Recently, the Company has announced a contract and an acquisition in Brazil, allowing us to expand our presence in
that market.

In 2012 and beyond, general economic and market conditions in the United States and internationally could have
an impact on our sales and operations. To the extent that these factors cause instability of capital markets, shortages of raw materials or component parts, longer sales cycles, deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our
products effectively, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, we face risks associated with our four-point growth strategy including the level of investment that customers are willing to make in
new technologies developed by the industry and the Company, and risks inherent in global expansion. When necessary, we will modify our financial and operating strategies to reflect changes in market conditions and risks.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following table shows our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years indicated.

2011 COMPARED TO 2010

The following table summarizes the results of operations for the period:



The following table shows the major components of the change in sales in 2011 from 2010:

Net sales increased by $460.6 million to $1,967.6 million in 2011 from $1,507.0 million in 2010. The
increase is due to higher freight group sales of $355.8 million primarily from increased demand for freight original equipment, electronics and aftermarket products; and sales related to acquisitions of $128.3 million. Partially offsetting this
increase was lower sales of $87.4 million primarily from the completion of certain transit locomotive build contracts and lower sales from certain transit original equipment contracts. The Company realized a net sales increase of $29.6 million and
an income from operations increase of $4.1 million due to favorable effects of foreign exchange. Net income for 2011 was $170.1 million or $3.51 per diluted share. Net income increased due to higher sales volume and operating margins.

Freight Group sales increased by $425.6 million, or 54.2%, due to higher sales of $281.5 million from specialty products and electronics,
primarily resulting from increased demand for original equipment rail products, original equipment heat exchange products and aftermarket rail products; $47.7 million for brake products resulting from higher car build and increased rail traffic;
$47.6 million from acquisitions and $26.6 million from demand for freight overhaul and remanufacturing services. For the Freight Group, net sales improved by $13.3 million due to favorable effects of foreign exchange.

Transit Group sales increased by $35.1 million, or 4.9%, due to increased sales of $80.7 million from acquisitions and $25.1 million
resulting from increased demand for electronics; partially offset by decreased sales of $87.0 million from the completion of certain transit locomotive build contracts and lower sales from certain transit original equipment contracts. For the
Transit Group, net sales improved by $16.3 million due to favorable effects of foreign exchange.

Cost of Sales and
Gross profit

Cost of Sales increased by $339.3 million to $1,397.2 million in 2011 from $1,057.9 million in 2010. In 2011, cost of sales, as a percentage of sales was 71.0% compared to 70.2% in the same period of 2010. This increase is the
result of (i) increased costs in the transit segment related to certain long-term contracts, partially offset by (ii) higher margin product sales (freight and aftermarket) increased as a percentage of total sales compared to other
products.

During 2011, raw material costs increased as a percentage of sales to approximately 44% in 2011 from 41% in 2010.
Labor costs as a percentage of sales were approximately 11% in 2011 and 2010. Overhead costs decreased as a percentage of sales to approximately 16% in 2011 from 18% in 2010. Freight Group raw material costs increased as a percentage of sales to
approximately 44% in 2011 from 40% in 2010. Freight Group labor costs decreased as a percentage of sales to approximately 10% in 2011 from 11% in 2010, and overhead costs decreased as a percentage of sales to approximately 15% in 2011 from 18% in
2010. Transit Group raw material costs as a percentage of sales were approximately 43% in 2011 and 2010. Transit Group labor costs increased as a percentage of sales to approximately 12% in 2011 from 11% in 2010, and overhead costs increased as a
percentage of sales to 19% in 2011 from 18% in 2010. In general, raw material costs as a percentage of sales



increased reflecting the higher mix of revenue generated from freight original equipment sales and aftermarket services, which has a higher raw material component as cost of sales. Overhead costs
vary as a percentage of sales depending on product mix and changes in sales volume. In addition, included in costs of sales is warranty expense. The provision for warranty expense is generally established for specific losses, along with historical
estimates of customer claims as a percentage of sales, which can cause variability in warranty expense between quarters. Warranty expense was $3.0 million lower in 2011 compared to 2010 because of the completion of certain transit contracts, which
had required creating initial warranty reserves. Gross profit increased to $570.2 million in 2011 compared to $449.1 million in 2010, for the reasons discussed above. Accordingly, for 2011, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 29.0% compared
to 29.8%, for 2010.

Operating expenses

The following table shows our operating expenses:

Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $51.6 million in 2011 compared to 2010 because of
$19.0 million of expenses from acquisitions and other growth initiatives, an $18.1 million charge for a court ruling, $11.9 million of incentive and non-cash compensation and $4.0 million of other certain one-time charges, partially offset by a
benefit of $2.4 million from a settlement related to a prior acquisition. Engineering expense decreased by $3.0 million in 2011 compared 2010 as the Company focused engineering resources on completing original equipment contracts which caused the
related engineering costs to be charged to cost of sales. Amortization expense increased in 2011 compared to 2010 due to amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions. Total operating expenses were 15.2% and 16.3% of sales for 2011 and
2010, respectively.

Income from operations

Income from operations totaled $270.7 million or 13.8% of sales in
2011 compared to $202.8 million or 13.5% of sales in 2010. Income from operations increased due to higher sales volume, partially offset by increased operating expenses discussed above.

Interest expense, net

Overall interest expense, net, decreased due to higher interest income realized on higher invested
cash balances.

Other expense, net

The Company recorded foreign exchange losses of $2.0 million in 2011 and
foreign exchange losses of $1.0 million in 2010 due to the effect of currency exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions that are non U.S. dollar denominated and charged or credited to earnings.

Income taxes

The effective income tax rate was 33.4% and 34.1% in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in the
effective tax rate is primarily due to a tax benefit of approximately $1.9 million which is due primarily to the settlement of examinations in various tax jurisdictions.

Net income

Net income for 2011 increased $47.0 million, compared to 2010. The increase in net income is due to higher sales volume, partially offset by increased operating expenses.



2010 COMPARED TO 2009

The following table summarizes the results of operations for the period:

The following table shows the major components of the change in sales in 2010 from 2009:

Net sales increased by $105.4 million to $1,507.0 million in 2010 from $1,401.6 million in 2009. The
increase is due to higher sales of $100.2 million from increased customer demand for freight original equipment and aftermarket products, freight overhaul and remanufacturing services, and sales related to acquisitions of $86.1 million. Partially
offsetting this increase was lower sales of $85.1 million, resulting from the completion of a certain transit original equipment contract, lower demand for transit car overhauls and the completion of certain transit locomotive build contracts. The
Company realized a net sales increase of $4.2 million due to favorable effects of foreign exchange, but net earnings were not materially impacted by foreign exchange. Net income for 2010 was $123.1 million or $2.56 per diluted share. Net income for
2009 was $115.1 million or $2.39 per diluted share. Net income increased due to higher sales volume and operating margins, partially offset by higher income tax expense.

Freight Group sales increased by $196.1 million or 33.3% due to higher sales of $81.8 million from acquisitions, $63.1 million for specialty products and electronics, primarily resulting from increased
customer demand for original equipment heat exchange products and aftermarket rail products; $20.4 million for brake products, resulting from increased rail traffic and aftermarket demand for brakes and valves; $13.6 million for other freight
products, primarily resulting from increased international demand; and freight overhaul and remanufacturing services increased $3.0 million. For the Freight Group, net sales improved by $14.1 million due to the favorable effects of foreign exchange.

Transit Group’s sales decreased by $90.7 million or 11.2%. Sales decreased $65.2 million because of the completion of a
major original equipment contract early in 2010. Sales also decreased by $19.0 million due to lower levels of transit car overhauls and the completion of certain contracts for the manufacture of locomotives in 2010. These decreases were partially
offset by sales from acquisitions of $4.3 million. For the Transit Group, net sales were reduced by $9.9 million due to unfavorable effects of foreign exchange.



Cost of Sales and Gross profit

Cost of Sales increased by $49.6 million to
$1,057.9 million in 2010 compared to $1,008.3 million in 2009. In 2010, cost of sales, as a percentage of sales was 70.2% compared to 71.9% in 2009. This decrease is the result of (i) higher margin product sales (freight and aftermarket)
increased as a percentage of total sales compared to other products, and (ii) decreased costs in the transit segment due to efficiencies realized on certain long-term contracts.

During 2010, raw material costs decreased as a percentage of sales to approximately 41% in 2010 from 43% in 2009. Labor costs as a
percentage of sales were approximately 11% in 2010 and 2009. Overhead costs as a percentage of sales were approximately 18% in 2010 and 2009. Freight group raw material costs decreased as a percentage of sales to approximately 40% in 2010 from 41%
in 2009. Freight group labor costs as a percentage of sales were approximately 11% in 2010 and 2009, and overhead costs decreased as a percentage of sales to approximately 18% in 2010 from 23% in 2009. Transit group raw material costs as a
percentage of sales were approximately 43% in 2010 and 2009. Transit group labor costs increased as a percentage of sales to approximately 11% in 2010 from 10% in 2009, and overhead costs increased as a percentage of sales to approximately18% in
2010 from 17% in 2009. In general, raw material costs as a percentage of sales decreased reflecting the higher mix of revenue generated from contracts delivering train control and other related services, which has a higher labor component as cost of
sales. Overhead costs vary as a percentage of sales depending on product mix and changes in sales volume. In addition, included in costs of sales is warranty expense. The provision for warranty expense is generally established for specific losses,
along with historical estimates of customer claims as a percentage of sales, which can cause variability in warranty expense between quarters. Warranty expense was $2.4 million higher in 2010 compared to 2009 due to increased Freight Group sales.
Gross profit increased to $449.1 million in 2010 compared to $393.3 million in 2009, for the reasons discussed above. Accordingly, in 2010, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 29.8% compared to 28.1% in 2009.

Operating expenses

The following table shows our operating expenses:

Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $34.9 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily
due to $17.3 million of expenses from acquisitions, and $16.7 million of incentive and non-cash compensation. Engineering expense decreased by $2.2 million in 2010 compared to 2009 as the company focused engineering resources on completing original
equipment contracts. Costs related to engineering for specific customer contracts are included in the labor element of cost of sales. Total operating expenses were 16.3% and 15.2% of sales for 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Income from operations

Income from operations totaled $202.8 million or 13.5% of sales in 2010 compared to $180.0 million
or 12.8% of sales in 2009. Income from operations increased due to higher sales volume and operating margins.

Interest
expense, net

Overall interest expense, net, decreased. Interest expense is higher due to increased borrowings, offset by interest income on higher invested cash balances.

Other expense, net

The Company recorded foreign exchange expense of $1.0 million due to the effect of currency exchange
rate changes on intercompany transactions that are non U.S. dollar denominated amounts and charged or credited to earnings. This was offset by $0.9 million of other miscellaneous income.



Income taxes

The effective income tax rate was 34.1% and 29.6% in 2010 and
2009, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a benefit recorded in 2009 related to the settlement of examinations in various taxing jurisdictions.

Net income

Net income for 2010 increased $8.0 million, compared to 2009. The increase in net income is due to higher sales
volume and operating margins, partially offset by higher income tax expense.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity is provided by operating cash flow and borrowings under the Company’s unsecured credit facility with a consortium of
commercial banks. The following is a summary of selected cash flow information and other relevant data:

Operating activities

. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, cash provided by operations was $248.6 million,
$176.1 million and $162.3 million, respectively. In comparison to 2010, increased cash provided by operations in 2011 resulted from higher net income and higher non-cash items, partially offset by a net increase in working capital. In 2011, accounts
receivable increased by $68.7 million, primarily due to higher sales and inventory increased by $79.5 million from the prior year. These increases were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of $60.0 million. All other operating assets
and liabilities, net, provided cash of $123.1 million due primarily to the payment timing of certain accrued liabilities.

In
comparison to 2009, increased cash provided by operations in 2010 resulted from higher net income and higher non-cash items, partially offset by a net increase in working capital. In 2010, accounts receivable increased by $34.3 million, primarily
due to higher sales and inventory increased by $1.7 million from the prior year. These increases were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of $44.3 million. All other operating assets and liabilities, net, used cash of $20.2 million
due primarily to the payment timing of certain accrued liabilities.

Investing activities.

In 2011, 2010 and
2009, cash used in investing activities was $146.2 million, $156.3 million and $115.2 million, respectively. Net cash paid for acquisitions was $109.0 million, $138.2 million and $96.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and
2009, respectively. Refer to Note 3 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information on acquisitions. In 2009, the Company sold a facility for net cash proceeds of $3.6 million to an unrelated third party.
Capital expenditures were $38.0 million, $20.8 million, and $18.3 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Financing activities

.

In 2011, cash used in financing activities was $46.8 million, which included
$257.0 million in proceeds from debt and $243.5 million of repayments of debt on the revolving credit facility, $39.7 million of debt repayments on the term loan and other debt, $3.8 million of dividend payments and $26.0 million of Wabtec stock
repurchases. In 2010, cash provided by financing activities was $25.8 million, which included $248.4 million in proceeds from debt and $185.4 million of repayments of debt on the revolving credit facility,



$32.7 million of debt repayments on the term loan and other debt, $1.9 million of dividend payments and $8.4 million of Wabtec stock repurchases. In 2009, cash used for financing activities was
$13.0 million, which included $197.5 million in proceeds from debt and $162.5 million of repayments of debt on the revolving credit facility, $30.8 million of debt repayments on the term loan and other debt, $1.9 million of dividend payments and
$19.7 million of Wabtec stock repurchases.

The following table shows outstanding indebtedness at December 31, 2011 and
2010.

Cash balance at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $285.6 million and $236.9 million, respectively.

2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement

On November 7, 2011, the Company refinanced its existing revolving credit and term loan facility with a consortium of commercial banks. This “2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement” provides the
company with a $600 million, five-year revolving credit facility. The Company incurred approximately $1.9 million of deferred financing cost related to the 2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement. The facility expires on November 7, 2016. The
2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement borrowings bear variable interest rates indexed to the indices described below. At December 31, 2011, the Company had available bank borrowing capacity, net of $48.9 million of letters of credit, of
approximately $306.1 million, subject to certain financial covenant restrictions.

Under the 2011 Refinancing Credit
Agreement, the Company may elect a Base Rate of interest or an interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) of interest (“the Alternate Rate”). The Base Rate adjusts on a daily basis and is the greater of
the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5% per annum, the PNC, N.A. prime rate or the Daily LIBOR Rate plus 100 basis points, plus a margin that ranges from 0 to 75 basis points. The Alternate Rate is based on quoted LIBOR rates plus a margin
that ranges from 75 to 175 basis points. Both the Base Rate and Alternate Rate margins are dependent on the Company’s consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios. The initial Base Rate margin is 25 basis points and the Alternate Rate
margin is 125 basis points.

At December 31, 2011 the weighted average interest rate on the Company’s variable rate
debt was 1.53%. To reduce the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of this variable-rate debt, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements which effectively convert a portion of the debt from a variable to a fixed-rate borrowing
during the term of the swap contracts. On December 31, 2011, the notional value of the interest rate swaps outstanding was $107.0 million and effectively changed the Company’s interest rate on bank debt at December 31, 2011 from a
variable rate to a fixed rate of 2.19%. The interest rate swap agreements mature on December 31, 2012. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty. However, since only the cash interest payments are
exchanged, exposure is significantly less than the notional amount. The counterparty is a large financial institution with an excellent credit rating and history of performance. The Company currently believes the risk of nonperformance is
negligible.

On January 12, 2012, the Company entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a
notional value of $150 million. The effective date of the interest rate swap agreement is July 31, 2013, and the



termination date is November 7, 2016. The impact of the interest rate swap agreement will be to convert a portion of the Company’s then outstanding debt from a variable rate to a
fixed-rate borrowing. During the term of the interest rate swap agreement the interest rate on the notional value will be fixed at 1.415%. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty. However, since only
the cash interest payments are exchanged, exposure is significantly less than the notional amount. The counterparty is a large financial institution with an excellent credit rating and history of performance. The Company currently believes the risk
of nonperformance is negligible.

The 2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement limits the Company’s ability to declare or pay
cash dividends and prohibits the Company from declaring or making other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. The 2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations:
incurrence of additional indebtedness; mergers, consolidations, sales of assets and acquisitions; additional liens; sale and leasebacks; permissible investments, loans and advances; certain debt payments; and imposes a minimum interest expense
coverage ratio of 3.0 and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio of 3.25. The Company does not expect that these measurements will limit the Company in executing our operating activities. See Note 8 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.

2008 Refinancing Credit Agreement

On November 4, 2008, the Company refinanced its then existing unsecured revolving credit agreement with a consortium of commercial
banks. This “2008 Refinancing Credit Agreement” provided the company with a $300 million five-year revolving credit facility and a $200 million five-year term loan facility. The Company incurred $2.9 million of deferred financing cost
related to the 2008 Refinancing Credit Agreement. Both facilities were set to expire in January 2013.

Under the 2008
Refinancing Credit Agreement, the Company may have elected a Base Rate of interest or an interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) of interest (“the Alternate Rate”). The Base Rate adjusted on a daily
basis and is the greater of the PNC, N.A. prime rate, 30-day LIBOR plus 150 basis points or the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5% per annum, plus a margin that ranges from 25 to 50 basis points. The Alternate rate was based on quoted LIBOR
rates plus a margin that ranges from 125 to 200 basis points. Both the Base Rate and Alternate Rate margins are dependent on the Company’s consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios.

6.875% Senior Notes Due August 2013.

In August 2003, the Company issued $150 million of Senior Notes due in 2013 (“the
Notes”). The Notes were issued at par. Interest on the Notes accrues at a rate of 6.875% per annum and is payable semi-annually on January 31 and July 31 of each year. The proceeds were used to repay debt outstanding under the
Company’s existing credit agreement, and for general corporate purposes. The principal balance is due in full at maturity.

The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and rank pari passu with all existing and future senior debt and senior to all
our existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the Company. The indenture under which the Notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things, the following: the incurrence of indebtedness, payment of dividends
and certain distributions, sale of assets, change in control, mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens. The Company is in compliance with these measurements and covenants and expects that these measurements will not be any type of
limiting factor in executing our operating activities.

Management believes that based on current levels of operations and
forecasted earnings, cash flow and liquidity will be sufficient to fund working capital and capital equipment needs as well as meeting debt service requirements. If sources of funds were to fail to satisfy the Company’s cash requirements, the
Company may need to refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing. There is no assurance that such new financing alternatives would be available, and, in any case, such new financing, if available, would be expected to be more costly
and burdensome than the debt agreements currently in place.



Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company is obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and have certain
contingent commitments such as debt guarantees. The Company has grouped these contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements into operating activities, financing activities, and investing activities in the same manner as they are
classified in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows to provide a better understanding of the nature of the obligations and arrangements and to provide a basis for comparison to historical information. The table below provides a summary of
contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2011:

(1)

Purchase obligations for the purposes of this disclosure have been defined as a contractual obligation that is in excess of $100,000 annually, and $200,000 in total.

Item 15 of this report.

(3)

Annual payments to participants are expected to continue into the foreseeable future at the amounts or ranges noted. Pension benefit payments are based on actuarial
estimates using current assumptions for discount rates, expected return on long-term assets and rate of compensation increases. The Company expects to contribute about $7.1 million to pension plan investments in 2012. See further disclosure in Note
9 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.

(4)

Annual payments to participants are expected to continue into the foreseeable future at the amounts or ranges noted. Postretirement payments are based on actuarial

(5)

Interest payments are payable January and July of each year at 6.875% of $150 million Senior Notes due in 2013. Interest payments for the Revolving Credit Facility and
Capital Leases are based on contractual terms and the Company’s current interest rates.

(6)

Scheduled principal repayments of outstanding loan balances are disclosed in Note 8 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV,
Item 15 of this report.

(7)

Shareholder dividends are subject to approval by the Company’s Board of Directors, currently at an annual rate of approximately $5.8 million.

(8)

The annual capital expenditure budget is subject to approval by the Board of Directors. The 2012 budget amount was approved at the December 2011 Board of Directors
meeting.

(9)

which are uncertain except for $1.8 million that may become payable during 2012. Refer to Note 10 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information on uncertain tax positions.

Obligations for operating activities.

The Company has entered into $88.3 million of material long-term non-cancelable materials
and supply purchase obligations. Operating leases represent multi-year obligations for rental of facilities and equipment. Estimated pension funding and post retirement benefit payments are based on actuarial estimates using current assumptions for
discount rates, expected return on long-term assets, rate of compensation increases and health care cost trend rates. Benefits paid for pension obligations were $12.5 million and $13.6 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Benefits paid for post
retirement plans were $1.9 million and $1.9 million in 2011 and in 2010, respectively.

Obligations for financing
activities.

Cash requirements for financing activities consist primarily of long-term debt repayments, interest payments and dividend payments to shareholders. The Company has historically paid quarterly dividends to shareholders, subject to
quarterly approval by our Board of Directors, currently at a rate of approximately $5.8 million annually.

The Company
arranges for performance bonds to be issued by third party insurance companies to support certain long term customer contracts. At December 31, 2011 initial value of performance bonds issued on the Company’s behalf is about $48.9 million.

Obligations for investing activities.

The Company typically spends approximately $35 million to $45 million a year for
capital expenditures, primarily related to facility expansion efficiency and modernization, health and safety, and environmental control. The Company expects annual capital expenditures in the future will be within this range.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of the financial statements
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires Management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities and the reported amounts



of revenues and expenses. Areas of uncertainty that require judgments, estimates and assumptions include the accounting for derivatives, environmental matters, warranty reserves, the testing of
goodwill and other intangibles for impairment, pensions and other postretirement benefits, and tax matters. Management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments and estimates, and actual results will inevitably
differ from those estimates and assumptions that are used to prepare the Company’s financial statements at any given time. Despite these inherent limitations, Management believes that Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) and the financial statements and related footnotes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the Company. A discussion of the judgments and uncertainties associated with accounting for derivatives
and environmental matters can be found in Notes 2 and 18, respectively, in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.

A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report and is incorporated by reference herein. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the Company to provide the users of the financial
statements with useful and reliable information about the Company’s operating results and financial condition.

In the ordinary course of business, Wabtec is exposed
to risks that increases in interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with its variable-rate debt. The Company’s variable rate debt represents 35% and 32% of total long-term debt at December 31, 2011 and 2010,
respectively. On an annual basis a 1% change in the interest rate for variable rate debt at December 31, 2011 would increase or decrease interest expense by about $1.4 million.

To reduce the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of this variable-rate debt, the Company entered into interest rate swap
agreements which effectively converted a portion of the debt from a variable to a fixed-



rate borrowing during the term of the swap contracts. Refer to “Financial Derivatives and Hedging Activities” in Note 2 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”
included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report for additional information regarding interest rate risk.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

The Company is subject to certain risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent our
operations are conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For the year ended December 31, 2011, approximately 53% of Wabtec’s net sales were to the United States, 9% to the United Kingdom, 8% to Canada, 6% to Australia, 5% to
Mexico, 2% to Germany, and 17% in other international locations. (See Note 19 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report). To reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates,
the Company has periodically entered into foreign currency forward contracts. Refer to “Financial Derivatives and Hedging Activities” in Note 2 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of
this report for more information regarding foreign currency exchange risk.

Our market risk exposure is not substantially
different from our exposure at December 31, 2010.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORTS TO WABTEC SHAREHOLDERS

Management’s Report on Financial Statements and Practices

The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) were prepared by Management, which is responsible for their
integrity and objectivity. The statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and include amounts that are based on Management’s best judgments and estimates. The other financial information included in the
10-K is consistent with that in the financial statements.

Management also recognizes its responsibility for conducting the
Company’s affairs according to the highest standards of personal and corporate conduct. This responsibility is characterized and reflected in key policy statements issued from time to time regarding, among other things, conduct of its business
activities within the laws of host countries in which the Company operates and potentially conflicting outside business interests of its employees. The Company maintains a systematic program to assess compliance with these policies.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Management has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management has excluded Brush Traction Group (“Brush”), Bearward Engineering (“Bearward”) and Fulmer Company
(“Fulmer”) from its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 because the Company acquired Brush effective February 25, 2011, Bearward effective November 3, 2011 and Fulmer effective
November18, 2011.Brush, Bearward and Fulmer are wholly owned subsidiaries whose total assets represents 2.8%, 2.9% and 0.7%, respectively and whose total net assets represents 3.6%, 2.9% and 1.3%, respectively, and net income represents 1.8%, -0.4%
and 0.0%, respectively and whose customer revenues represents 2.5%, 0.6% and 0.1%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011.

Based on its assessment, Management has concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2011, based on criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, has been audited by
Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation as of December 31,
2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed
in the index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s Management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by Management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 24, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON
INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation:

We have audited Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies
Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of
and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Brush Traction Group (“Brush”), Bearward Engineering (“Bearward”) and Fulmer Company (“Fulmer”),
which are included in the 2011 consolidated financial statements of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation and constituted 2.8%, 2.9% and 0.7%, respectively, of total assets and 3.6%, 2.9% and 1.3%, respectively, of total net assets as of
December 31, 2011, and 1.8%-0.4% and 0.0%, respectively, of net income and 2.5%, 0.6% and 0.1%, respectively, of customer revenue for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Westinghouse Air Brake
Technologies Corporation also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Brush, Bearward, and Fulmer.

In our opinion, Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the COSO
criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States), the consolidated balance sheets of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2011 and our report dated February 24, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

BUSINESS

Wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of value-added, technology-based products and services for the
global rail industry. Our products are found on virtually all U.S. locomotives, freight cars and passenger transit vehicles, as well as in more than 100 countries throughout the world. Our products enhance safety, improve productivity and reduce
maintenance costs for customers, and many of our core products and services are essential in the safe and efficient operation of freight rail and passenger transit vehicles. Wabtec is a global company with operations in 18 countries. In 2011, about
47% of the Company’s revenues came from customers outside the U.S.

2.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its majority owned subsidiaries. Such statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Sales between subsidiaries are billed at prices consistent with sales to third parties and are eliminated in
consolidation.

Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments purchased with an original
maturity of three months or less.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts
receivable reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available evidence. The allowance for
doubtful accounts was $8.4 million and $7.5 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined under the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Inventory costs include material, labor and overhead.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment additions are stated at cost. Expenditures for renewals and
improvements are capitalized. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The Company provides for book depreciation principally on the straight-line method. Accelerated depreciation methods are utilized for income
tax purposes.

Leasing Arrangements

The Company conducts a portion of its operations from leased facilities and
finances certain equipment purchases through lease agreements. In those cases in which the lease term approximates the useful life of the leased asset or the lease meets certain other prerequisites, the leasing arrangement is classified as a capital
lease. The remaining arrangements are treated as operating leases.

Intangible Assets

Goodwill and other
intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized. Other intangibles (with definite lives) are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives. Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when indicators
of impairment are present. The Company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually. The Company performs its annual impairment test during the fourth quarter after the annual forecasting process is
completed, and also tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Periodically, Management of the Company assesses whether or not an indicator of impairment is present that
would necessitate an impairment analysis be performed.

In September 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Updated
(“ASU”) 2011-08 which amends the rules for testing goodwill for impairment. Under the new rules, an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a
determination that it is more



likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely
than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. We adopted ASU 2011-08 for our 2011 annual goodwill impairment test.

In assessing the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than
its carrying amount, we assess relevant events and circumstances that may impact the fair value and the carrying amount of the reporting unit. The identification of relevant events and circumstances and how these may impact a reporting unit’s
fair value or carrying amount involve significant judgments and assumptions. The judgment and assumptions include the identification of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, Wabtec
specific events and share price trends and making the assessment on whether each relevant factor will impact the impairment test positively or negatively and the magnitude of any such impact.

If our qualitative assessment concludes that it is probable that we have an impairment, the Company then performs a quantitative
assessment. In the first step of the quantitative assessment, our assets and liabilities, including existing goodwill and other intangible assets, are assigned to the identified reporting units to determine the carrying value of the reporting units.

The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company prepares its goodwill impairment
analysis by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit, using an income approach (a discounted cash flow model) as well as a market approach, with its carrying value. The income approach and the market approach are equally weighted in
arriving at fair value, which the Company has applied consistently.

The discounted cash flow model requires several
assumptions including future sales growth, EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margins and capital expenditures for the reporting units. The discounted cash flow model also requires the use of a discount rate and a terminal revenue growth rate
(the revenue growth rate for the period beyond the three years forecasted by the reporting units), as well as projections of future operating margins.

The market approach requires several assumptions including EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) multiples for comparable companies that operate in the same markets as
the Company’s reporting units.

Warranty Costs

Warranty costs are accrued based on Management’s
estimates of repair or upgrade costs per unit and historical experience. Warranty expense was $19.9 million, $22.8 million and $20.4 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Accrued warranty was $50.6 million and $35.5 million at
December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the liability
method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws. The provision for income taxes includes
federal, state and foreign income taxes.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company recognizes compensation expense
for stock-based compensation based on the grant date fair value amortized ratably over the requisite service period following the date of grant.

Financial Derivatives and Hedging Activities

The Company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Forward contracts are
agreements with a counterparty to exchange two distinct currencies at a set exchange rate for delivery on a set date at some point in the future. There is no exchange of funds until the delivery date. At the delivery date the Company can either take
delivery of the currency or settle on a net basis. At December 31, 2011, the Company had no forward contracts.



At December 31, 2010, the Company had forward contracts for the sale of South African
Rand (ZAR) and the purchase of U.S. Dollars (USD). The Company concluded that these foreign currency forward contracts qualify for cash flow hedge accounting which permits the recording of the fair value of the forward contract and corresponding
adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, on the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had forward contracts with a notional value of 24.7million ZAR (or $3.4 million U.S.) with an average exchange rate of 7.19
ZAR per $1 USD, resulting in the recording of a current liability of $192,000 and a corresponding offset in accumulated other comprehensive income of $122,000, net of tax.

To reduce the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of this variable-rate debt, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements which effectively converted a portion of the debt from a
variable to a fixed-rate borrowing during the term of the swap contract. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty. However, since only the cash interest payments are exchanged, exposure is
significantly less than the notional amount. The counterparty is a large financial institution with an excellent credit rating and history of performance. The Company currently believes the risk of nonperformance is negligible. The Company concluded
that the interest rate swap agreements qualify for special cash flow hedge accounting which permits the recording of the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, on
the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had interest rate swap agreements with a notional value of $107.0 million and which effectively changed the Company’s interest rate on bank debt at December 31, 2011 from a
variable rate to a fixed rate of 2.19%. The interest rate swap agreements mature on December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2011, the Company recorded a current liability of $1.4 million and a corresponding offset in accumulated other
comprehensive loss of $0.9 million, net of tax.

Foreign Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities of foreign
subsidiaries, except for the Company’s Mexican operations whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, are translated at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date while income and expenses are translated at the average
rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Foreign currency gains and losses resulting from transactions, and the translation of financial statements are recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements based upon the provisions
of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 830, “Foreign Currency Matters.” The effects of currency exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions and balances of a long-term investment nature are accumulated and carried as
a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The effects of currency exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions that are denominated in a currency other than an entity’s functional currency are charged or credited to earnings.
Foreign exchange transaction losses recognized in other (expense) income, net were $2.0 million, $1.0 million and $1.3 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Noncontrolling Interests

In accordance with ASC 810, the Company has classified noncontrolling interests as equity on our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2011
and 2010. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was not material.

Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as net income and all other non-owner changes in shareholders’ equity. The Company’s accumulated other
comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments, foreign currency hedges, foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps, and pension and post retirement related adjustments.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized in accordance with ASC 605 “Revenue Recognition.” Revenue is recognized
when products have been shipped to the respective customers, title has passed and the price for the product has been determined.

In general, the Company recognizes revenues on long-term contracts based on the percentage of completion method of accounting. The units-of-delivery method or other input-based or output-based measures,
as appropriate, are used to measure the progress toward completion of individual contracts. Contract revenues and



cost estimates are reviewed and revised quarterly at a minimum and adjustments are reflected in the accounting period as such amounts are determined. Provisions are made currently for estimated
losses on uncompleted contracts.

Certain pre-production costs relating to long-term production and supply contracts have been
deferred and will be recognized over the life of the contracts. Deferred pre-production costs were $15.4 million and $11.9 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Significant Customers and Concentrations of Credit Risk

The Company’s trade receivables are from rail and transit
industry original equipment manufacturers, Class I railroads, railroad carriers and commercial companies that utilize rail cars in their operations, such as utility and chemical companies. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of the
Company’s consolidated net sales in 2011, 2010 and 2009.

Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs

All fees
billed to the customer for shipping and handling are classified as a component of net revenues. All costs associated with shipping and handling is classified as a component of cost of sales.

Research and Development

Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. For the years ended
December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company incurred costs of approximately $37.2 million, $40.2 million and $42.4 million, respectively.

Employees

As of December 31, 2011, approximately 25% of the Company’s workforce was covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements are generally effective from 2012
through 2014. Agreements expiring in 2012 cover approximately 17% of the Company’s workforce.

Earnings Per
Share

Basic and diluted earnings per common share is computed in accordance with ASC 260 “Earnings Per Share.” Unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether
paid or unpaid) are participating securities and included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method included in ASC 260-10-55. (See Note 11 “Earnings Per Share” included herein)

Reclassifications

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified, where necessary, to conform to the current year
presentation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual amounts could differ from the estimates. On an ongoing basis, Management reviews its estimates based on currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates.

Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized. Other intangibles (with definite lives)
are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed annually during the fourth quarter for impairment (See Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies” included herein). Goodwill and indefinite live intangible assets were not impaired at December 31, 2011 and 2010.



Goodwill was $587.5 million and $545.8 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010,
respectively. The change in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment for the year ended December 31, 2011 is as follows:

As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company’s trademarks had a net carrying amount of $114.6

LONG-TERM DEBT

Long-term debt consisted of the following:



2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement

On November 7, 2011, the Company refinanced its existing revolving credit and term loan facility with a consortium of commercial
banks. This “2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement” provides the company with a $600 million, five-year revolving credit facility. The Company incurred approximately $1.9 million of deferred financing cost related to the 2011 Refinancing
Credit Agreement. The facility expires on November 7, 2016. The 2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement borrowings bear variable interest rates indexed to the indices described below. At December 31, 2011, the Company had available bank
borrowing capacity, net of $48.9 million of letters of credit, of approximately $306.1 million, subject to certain financial covenant restrictions.

Under the 2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement, the Company may elect a Base Rate of interest or an interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) of interest (“the
Alternate Rate”). The Base Rate adjusts on a daily basis and is the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5% per annum, the PNC, N.A. prime rate or the Daily LIBOR Rate plus 100 basis points plus a margin that ranges from 0 to
75 basis points. The Alternate Rate is based on quoted LIBOR rates plus a margin that ranges from 75 to 175 basis points. Both the Base Rate and Alternate Rate margins are dependent on the Company’s consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow
ratios. The initial Base Rate margin is 25 basis points and the Alternate Rate margin is 125 basis points.

At
December 31, 2011 the weighted average interest rate on the Company’s variable rate debt was 1.53%. To reduce the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of this variable-rate debt, the Company entered into interest rate swap
agreements which effectively convert a portion of the debt from a variable to a fixed-rate borrowing during the term of the swap contracts. On December 31, 2011, the notional value of the interest rate swaps outstanding was $107.0 million and
effectively changed the Company’s interest rate on bank debt at December 31, 2011 from a variable rate to a fixed rate of 2.19%. The interest rate swap agreements mature on December 31, 2012. The Company is exposed to credit risk in
the event of nonperformance by the counterparty. However, since only the cash interest payments are exchanged, exposure is significantly less than the notional amount. The counterparty is a large financial institution with an excellent credit rating
and history of performance. The Company currently believes the risk of nonperformance is negligible.

On January 12,
2012, the Company entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of $150 million. The effective date of the interest rate swap agreement is July 31, 2013, and the termination date is November 7, 2016.
The impact of the interest rate swap agreement will be to convert a portion of the Company’s then outstanding debt from a variable rate to a fixed-rate borrowing. During the term of the interest rate swap agreement the interest rate on the
notional value will be fixed at 1.415%. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty. However, since only the cash interest payments are exchanged, exposure is significantly less than the notional amount.
The counterparty is a large financial institution with an excellent credit rating and history of performance. The Company currently believes the risk of nonperformance is negligible.

The 2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement limits the Company’s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the Company from
declaring or making other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. The 2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations: incurrence of additional indebtedness; mergers,
consolidations, sales of assets and acquisitions; additional liens; sale and leasebacks; permissible investments, loans and advances; certain debt payments; and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio of 3.0 and a maximum debt to cash flow
ratio of 3.25. The Company does not expect that these measurements will limit the Company in executing our operating activities.

Refinancing Credit Agreement

On November 4, 2008, the Company had refinanced its existing unsecured revolving credit
agreement with a consortium of commercial banks. This “2008 Refinancing Credit Agreement” provided the company with a $300 million five-year revolving credit facility and a $200 million five-year term loan facility. The Company incurred
$2.9 million of deferred financing cost related to the 2008 Refinancing Credit Agreement. Both facilities were set to expire in January 2013.



Under the 2008 Refinancing Credit Agreement, the Company may have elected a Base Rate of
interest or an interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) of interest (“the Alternate Rate”). The Base Rate adjusted on a daily basis and is the greater of the PNC, N.A. prime rate, 30-day LIBOR plus 150
basis points or the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5% per annum, plus a margin that ranges from 25 to 50 basis points. The Alternate rate was based on quoted LIBOR rates plus a margin that ranges from 125 to 200 basis points. Both the Base
Rate and Alternate Rate margins are dependent on the Company’s consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios.

6.875% Senior
Notes Due August 2013

In August 2003, the Company issued $150 million of Senior Notes due in 2013 (“the Notes”).
The Notes were issued at par. Interest on the Notes accrues at a rate of 6.875% per annum and is payable semi-annually on January 31 and July 31 of each year. The proceeds were used to repay debt outstanding under the Company’s
existing credit agreement, and for general corporate purposes. The principal balance is due in full at maturity.

The Notes
are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and rank pari passu with all existing and future senior debt and senior to all our existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the Company. The indenture under which the Notes were issued contains
covenants and restrictions which limit among other things, the following: the incurrence of indebtedness, payment of dividends and certain distributions, sale of assets, change in control, mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens.

Debt and Capital Leases

Scheduled principal repayments of debt and capital lease balances as of December 31, 2011 are as follows:

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans that cover certain U.S., Canadian, German, and United Kingdom employees and which provide benefits of stated amounts for each year of service of the
employee. The Company uses a December 31 measurement date for the plans.



The following tables provide information regarding the Company’s defined benefit
pension plans summarized by U.S. and international components.

Obligations and Funded Status



The aggregate accumulated benefit obligation for the U.S. pension plans was $51.7 million
and $47.2 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The aggregate accumulated benefit obligation for the international pension plans was $133.9 million and $131.2 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Components of Net Periodic Benefit Costs

Other Changes in Plan Assets and Benefit Obligations Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income during 2011 are as
follows:

The weighted average assumptions in the following table represent the rates used to develop the actuarial
present value of the projected benefit obligation for the year listed and also the net periodic benefit cost for the following year.



The discount rate is based on settling the pension obligation with high grade, high yield
corporate bonds, and the rate of compensation increase is based on actual experience. The expected return on plan assets is based on historical performance as well as expected future rates of return on plan assets considering the current investment
portfolio mix and the long-term investment strategy.

As of December 31, 2011 the following table represents the amounts
included in other comprehensive loss that are expected to be recognized as components of periodic benefit costs in 2012.

Pension Plan Assets

The Company has established formal investment policies for the assets associated with our pension plans. Objectives include maximizing long-term return at acceptable risk levels and diversifying among
asset classes. Asset allocation targets are based on periodic asset liability study results which help determine the appropriate investment strategies. The investment policies permit variances from the targets within certain parameters. The
composition plan assets consist primarily of equity security funds, debt security funds, and temporary cash and cash equivalent investments. The assets held in these funds are generally passively managed and are valued at the net asset value per
share multiplied by the number of shares held as of the measurement date. Generally, all plan assets are considered Level 2 based on the fair value valuation hierarchy (See Note 17 “Fair Value Measurement” included herein). Plan assets by
asset category at December 31, 2011 and 2010 are as follows:

The U.S. pension plan has a target asset allocation of 50% equity securities and 50% debt securities. The
international pension plans have target asset allocations of 60% equity securities and 40% debt securities. Investment policies are determined by the respective Plan’s Pension Committee and set forth in its Investment Policy. Rebalancing of the
asset allocation occurs on a quarterly basis.

Cash Flows

The Company’s funding methods are based on governmental requirements and differ from those methods used to recognize pension expense. The Company expects to contribute $1.7 million to the U.S. plans
and $5.4 million to the international plans during 2012.



Benefit payments expected to be paid to plan participants are as follows:

Post Retirement Benefit Plans

In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company has provided certain unfunded postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for a portion of North American employees. The Company is not
obligated to pay health care and life insurance benefits to individuals who had retired prior to 1990.

The Company uses a
December 31 measurement date for all post retirement plans. The following tables provide information regarding the Company’s post retirement benefit plans summarized by U.S. and international components.

The assumed health care cost trend rate for the U.S. plans grades from an initial rate of 7.4% to an
ultimate rate of 4.5% by 2027 and for international plans from 8.2% to 4.5% by 2030. A 1% increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate will increase the service and interest cost components of the expense recognized for the U.S. and
international postretirement plans by approximately $206,000 and $29,000, respectively, for 2012, and increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $4.23 million and $269,000, respectively. A 1% decrease in the assumed
health care cost trend rate will decrease the service and interest cost components of the expense recognized for the U.S. and international postretirement plans by approximately $175,000 and $24,000, respectively, for 2012, and decrease the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $3.6 million and $233,000, respectively.

Cash Flows

Benefit payments expected to be paid to plan participants are as follows:

Defined Contribution Plans

The Company also participates in certain defined contribution plans and multiemployer pension plans. Costs recognized under these plans are summarized as follows:

The 401(k) savings plan is a participant directed defined contribution plan that holds shares of the
Company’s stock as one of the investment options. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the plan held on behalf of its participants about 403,400 shares with a market value of $28.2 million, and 433,300 shares with a market value of $22.9
million, respectively.

Additionally, the Company has stock option based benefit and other plans further described in Note 12.

The Company contributes to several multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under collective bargaining agreements that
cover certain of its union-represented employees. The risks of participating in such



plans are different from the risks of single-employer plans. Assets contributed to a multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating
employers. If a participating employer ceases to contribute to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. If the Company ceases to have an obligation to contribute to the multiemployer plan
in which it had been a contributing employer, it may be required to pay to the plan an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan and on the history of the Company’s participation in the plan prior to the cessation of its obligation to
contribute. The amount that an employer that has ceased to have an obligation to contribute to a multiemployer plan is required to pay to the plan is referred to as a withdrawal liability.

The Company’s participation in multiemployer plans for the year ended December 31, 2011 is outlined in the table below. For
plans that are not individually significant to the Company, the total amount of contributions is presented in the aggregate.

(1)

The Company’s contribution represents more than 5% of the total contributions to the plan.

(2)

Adopted a Funding Improvement Plan on August 26, 2010 reducing the accrual rate from $80 to $60 for service accruing on or after January 1, 2011. New
contracts will require a minimum of $15/week increase in the contribution rate during each year of the agreement.

(a)

The “EIN / PN” column provides the Employer Identification Number and the three-digit plan number assigned to a plan by the Internal Revenue Service.

(b)

The most recent Pension Protection Act Zone Status available for 2010 and 2009 is for plan years that ended in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The zone status is based on
information provided to the Company and other participating employers by each plan and is certified by the plan’s actuary. A plan in the “red” zone has been determined to be in “critical status”, based on criteria
established under the Internal Revenue Code (“Code”), and is generally less than 65% funded. A plan in the “yellow” zone has been determined to be in “endangered status”, based on criteria established under the Code,
and is generally less than 80% funded. A plan in the “green” zone has been determined to be neither in “critical status” nor in “endangered status”, and is generally at least 80% funded.

(c)

The “FIP/RP Status Pending/Implemented” column indicates whether a Funding Improvement Plan, as required under the Code to be adopted by plans in the
“yellow” zone, or a Rehabilitation Plan, as required under the Code to be adopted by plans in the “red” zone, is pending or has been implemented as of the end of the plan year that ended in 2011.

(d)

The “Surcharge Imposed” column indicates whether the Company’s contribution rate for 2011 included an amount in addition the contribution rate specified
in the applicable collective bargaining agreement, as imposed by a plan in “critical status”, in accordance with the requirements of the Code.

10.

INCOME TAXES

The Company is responsible for filing consolidated U.S., foreign and combined, unitary or separate state income tax
returns. The Company is responsible for paying the taxes relating to such returns, including any subsequent adjustments resulting from the redetermination of such tax liabilities by the applicable taxing authorities. The components of the income
from operations before provision for income taxes for the Company’s domestic and foreign operations for the years ended December 31 are provided below:



Undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately
$303.0 million at December 31, 2011. Those earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested; accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal and state income taxes has been provided thereon. Upon repatriation of those earnings, in the form of
dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to both U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred
U.S. income tax liability is not practicable due to the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation. Withholding taxes of approximately $3.2 million would be payable upon remittance of all previously unremitted earnings at
December 31, 2011.

The consolidated provision for income taxes included in the Statement of Income consisted of the
following:

A reconciliation of the United States federal statutory income tax rate to the effective income tax rate
on operations for the years ended December 31 is provided below:

The effective income tax rate for 2011 included a net tax benefit of approximately $1.9 million which is
due primarily to the settlement of examinations in various tax jurisdictions.

Deferred income taxes result from temporary
differences in the recognition of income and expense for financial and income tax reporting purposes. These deferred income taxes will be recognized as future tax benefits or costs when the temporary differences reverse.



Components of deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:

A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. In 2011, a $2.5 million valuation allowance for foreign tax credit carryforwards was released because the related foreign withholding taxes have been claimed as U.S. tax deductions rather than carried
forward as a deferred tax asset.

Federal Research and Development credits of approximately $1.5 million have been fully
utilized in 2011. Other state and foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately $4.6 million are set to expire in various periods from 2013 to 2028. State net operating loss carryforwards in the amount of $64.5 million are set to expire in
various periods from 2013 to 2032.

As of December 31, 2011, the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax
positions was $8.2 million, of which $2.1 million, if recognized, would favorably affect the Company’s effective income tax rate. As of December 31, 2010, the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions was $10.0
million, of which $3.1 million, if recognized, would favorably affect the Company’s effective tax rate. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions follows:

The Company includes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As
of December 31, 2011, the total interest and penalties accrued was approximately $2.8 million and $1.5 million,



respectively. As of December 31, 2010, the total interest and penalties accrued was approximately $3.1 million and $1.7 million, respectively.

The Internal Revenue Service is currently auditing the 2009 and 2010 tax years. With limited exception, the Company is no longer subject
to examination by various U.S. and foreign taxing authorities for years before 2008.

At this time, the Company believes that
it is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $1.8 million may change within the next 12 months due to the expiration of statutory review periods and current examinations.

11.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

The computation of earnings per share from operations is as follows:

Options to purchase approximately 25,000, 15,000, and 79,200 shares of Common Stock were outstanding in
2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options’ exercise price exceeded the average market price of the common shares.

12.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

As of December 31, 2011, the Company maintains employee stock-based compensation plans for stock options,
restricted stock, and incentive stock awards as governed by the 2011 Stock Incentive Compensation Plan



(the “2011 Plan”) and the 2000 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the 2000 Plan). The 2011 Plan was approved by stockholders of Wabtec on May 11, 2011. The Company also maintains a
Non-Employee Directors’ Fee and Stock Option Plan (Directors Plan). As of December 31, 2011, the number of shares available for future grants under the 2000 Plan was 453,322 shares. No awards may be made under the 2000 Plan or the
Directors Plan subsequent to October 31, 2016. The 2011 Plan has a 10 year term through March 27, 2021 and provides a maximum of 1,900,000 shares for grants or awards.

Stock-based compensation expense was $18.6 million, $11.8 million and $3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and
2009, respectively. The Company recognized associated tax benefits related to the stock-based compensation plans of $5.1 million, $3.0 million and $1.6 million for the respective periods. Included in the stock-based compensation expense for 2011
above is $2.7 million of expense related to stock options, $4.4 million related to non-vested restricted stock, $10.6 million related to incentive stock awards and $900,000 related to awards issued for Directors’ fees. At December 31,
2011, unamortized compensation expense related to those stock options, non-vested restricted shares and incentive stock awards expected to vest totaled $20.9 million and will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.3 years.

Stock Options

Stock options are granted to eligible employees and directors at the fair market value, which is the average of the
high and low Wabtec stock price on the date of grant. Under the 2011 Plan and the 2000 Plan, options become exercisable over a four year vesting period and expire 10 years from the date of grant.

The Directors Plan, as amended, authorizes a total of 500,000 shares of Common Stock to be issued. Generally, options issued under the
plan become exercisable over a three-year vesting period and expire ten years from the date of grant and restricted stock issued under the plan vests one year from the date of grant. In addition, as compensation for directors’ fees, a total of
13,500 shares have been awarded to non-employee directors for the year ended December 31, 2009. As compensation for directors’ fees for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company issued a total of 11,636 and 18,302 shares
of restricted stock to non-employee directors. The total number of shares issued under the plan as of December 31, 2011 was 391,938 shares.

The following table summarizes the Company’s stock option activity and related information for the 2011 Plan, the 2000 Plan and Directors Plan for the years ended December 31:



Options outstanding at December 31, 2011 were as follows:

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

The dividend yield is based on the Company’s dividend rate and the current market price of the
underlying common stock at the date of grant. Expected life in years is determined from historical stock option exercise data. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The risk-free interest rate is
based on the 7 year U.S. Treasury bond rates for the expected life of the option.

Restricted Stock and Incentive Stock

Beginning in 2006 the Company adopted a restricted stock program. As provided for under the 2011 and 2000 Plans, eligible employees are granted restricted stock that generally vests over four years from the date of grant. Under the Directors
Plan, restricted stock awards vest one year from the date of grant.

In addition, the Company has issued incentive stock
awards to eligible employees that vest upon attainment of certain cumulative three-year performance goals. The incentive stock awards included in the table below represent the number of shares that may vest if the performance targets are met. As of
December 31, 2011, based on the Company’s performance, we estimate that these stock awards will vest and have recorded compensation expense accordingly. If our estimate of the number of these stock awards expected to vest changes in a
future accounting period, compensation expense could be reduced and will be recognized over the remaining vesting period.



The following table summarizes the restricted stock activity for the 2011Plan, the 2000 Plan
and the Directors Plan, and incentive stock awards activity for the 2011 Plan and the 2000 Plan with related information for the years ended December 31:

Compensation expense for the non-vested restricted stock and incentive stock awards is based on the
closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant and recognized over the applicable vesting period.

PREFERRED STOCK

The Company’s authorized capital stock includes 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The Board of Directors has
the authority to issue the preferred stock and to fix the designations, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such class or series, including dividend rates, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption and liquidation
preferences, without any further vote or action by the Company’s shareholders. The rights and preferences of the preferred stock would be superior to those of the common stock. At December 31, 2011 and 2010 there was no preferred stock
issued or outstanding.

17.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

ASC 820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
fair value and explains the related disclosure requirements. ASC 820 indicates, among other things, that a fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or
liability or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability and defines fair value based upon an exit price model.

Valuation Hierarchy.

ASC 820 establishes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to valuation used to measure fair value. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as
follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on the Company’s assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities
at fair value. A financial asset or liability’s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.



The following table provides the liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring
basis as of December 31, 2011, which are included in other current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance sheet:

The following table provides the liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of
December 31, 2010, which are included in other current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance sheet:

As a result of our global operating activities the Company is exposed to market risks from changes in
foreign currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial position. When deemed appropriate, the Company minimizes these risks through entering into foreign currency forward contracts. The foreign currency
forward contracts are valued using broker quotations, or market transactions in either the listed or over-the counter markets. As such, these derivative instruments are classified within level 2.

The Company’s defined benefit pension plan assets consist primarily of equity security funds, debt security funds and temporary cash
and cash equivalent investments. Generally, all plan assets are considered Level 2 based on the fair value valuation hierarchy (See Note 9 “Employee Benefit Plans” included herein).

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company is subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water, the
handling, storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances. The Company believes its operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the
various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business; however, there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements.

Under terms of the purchase agreement and related documents for the 1990 Acquisition, American Standard, Inc., now known as
Trane (“Trane”), has indemnified the Company for certain items including, among other things, certain environmental claims the Company asserted prior to 2000. If Trane was unable to honor or meet these indemnifications, the Company would
be responsible for such items. In the opinion of Management, Trane currently has the ability to meet its indemnification obligations.

Claims have been filed against the Company and certain of its affiliates in various jurisdictions across the United States by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing
products. Most of these claims have been made against our wholly owned subsidiary, Railroad Friction Products Corporation (“RFPC”), and are based on a product sold by RFPC prior to the time that the Company acquired any interest in RFPC.



Most of these claims, including all of the RFPC claims, are submitted to insurance carriers
for defense and indemnity or to non-affiliated companies that retain the liabilities for the asbestos-containing products at issue. We cannot, however, assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors or
insurers will remain financially viable. Our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims, as is the case with other pending litigation, cannot be estimated.

It is Management’s belief that the potential range of loss for asbestos-related bodily injury cases is not reasonably determinable
at present due to a variety of factors, including: (1) the asbestos case settlement history of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, RFPC; (2) the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation in general; and (3) the
uncertainty of asbestos litigation in particular. Despite this uncertainty, and although the results of the Company’s operations and cash flows for any given period could be adversely affected by asbestos-related lawsuits, Management believes
that the final resolution of the Company’s asbestos-related cases will not be material to the Company’s overall financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In general, this belief is based upon: (1) Wabtec’s and
RFPC’s history of settlements and dismissals of asbestos-related cases to date; (2) the inability of many plaintiffs to establish any exposure or causal relationship to RFPC’s product; and (3) the inability of many plaintiffs to
demonstrate any identifiable injury or compensable loss.

More specifically, as to RFPC, Management’s belief that any
losses due to asbestos-related cases would not be material is also based on the fact that RFPC owns insurance which provides coverage for asbestos-related bodily injury claims. To date, RFPC’s insurers have provided RFPC with defense and
indemnity in these actions. The overall number of new claims being filed against RFPC has dropped significantly in recent years; however, these new claims, and all previously filed claims, may take a significant period of time to resolve. As to
Wabtec and its divisions, Management’s belief that asbestos-related cases will not have a material impact is also based on its position that it has no legal liability for asbestos-related bodily injury claims, and that the former owners of
Wabtec’s assets retained asbestos liabilities for the products at issue. To date, Wabtec has been able to successfully defend itself on this basis, including two arbitration decisions and a judicial opinion, all of which confirmed Wabtec’s
position that it did not assume any asbestos liabilities from the former owners of certain Wabtec assets. Although Wabtec has incurred defense and administrative costs in connection with asbestos bodily injury actions, these costs have not been
material, and the Company has no information that would suggest these costs would become material in the foreseeable future.

On October 18, 2007, Faiveley Transport Malmo AB (“Faiveley Malmo”) filed a request for arbitration with the International
Chamber of Commerce alleging breach of contract and trade secret violations relating to the Company’s manufacture and sale of certain components. In the international arbitration proceeding, Faiveley Malmo originally alleged $128 million in
damages, but later reduced its claim to $91 million in damages. An ICC International Court of Arbitration Arbitral Tribunal heard the case during the first half of 2009 and issued an award dated December 21, 2009. Pursuant to the Award, the
Company was required to make a $3.9 million royalty payment to Faiveley Malmo, with respect to Faiveley Malmo’s claims against the Company alleging breach of contract and trade secret violations. On May 14, 2010, Faiveley Transport USA,
Inc., Faiveley Transport Nordic AB, Faiveley Transport Amiens S.A.S, and Ellcon National, Inc. filed a complaint against Wabtec Corporation in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. That complaint was amended on June 8,
2010. The claims in the amended complaint include misappropriation of trade secrets, unfair competition, tortious interference with prospective business relations, tortious interference with prospective economic advantage, and unjust enrichment. On
April 13, 2011, a judge issued an order, without an opinion, that granted the plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment on three of their four claims and denied Wabtec’s motion for summary judgment. A jury trial on damages took
place from June 20, 2011 to June 28, 2011, and the jury awarded the plaintiffs $18.1 million. On July 29, 2011, after considering post-trial motions on prejudgment interest and on potential adjustments to the jury’s award, the
Court entered a final verdict in the amount of $18.1 million, plus interest. The Company appealed the verdict, and this appeal is pending. The Company recorded a charge in the second quarter in the amount of $18.1 million.

The Company and a wholly owned subsidiary, Standard Car Truck Company (“SCTC”), were sued for patent infringement by Amsted
Industries Incorporated (“Amsted”) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern



District of Illinois. Amsted did not allege any specific amount of damages. The Company moved to dismiss Amsted’s amended complaint. SCTC answered Amsted’s amended
complaint, asserting defenses and counterclaims including non-infringement, patent invalidity, and unreasonable delays in pursuing the claim. SCTC also moved to transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
Illinois. The parties entered into a settlement agreement resolving this matter effective February 17, 2012. The Company does not believe that the settlement will have a material effect on the Company.

The Company is subject to a RCRA Part B Closure Permit (“the Permit”) issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and
the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, Division of Environmental Quality relating to the monitoring and treatment of groundwater contamination on, and adjacent to, the MotivePower Inc. (Boise, Idaho) facility. In compliance with the Permit, the
Company has completed an accelerated plan for the treatment of contaminated groundwater, and continues onsite and offsite monitoring for hazardous constituents. Reflected in the commitments and contingencies line of the consolidated balance sheet,
the Company has accruals of approximately $501,000 at December 31, 2011, the estimated remaining costs for remediation and monitoring. The Company was in compliance with the Permit at December 31, 2011.

Foster Wheeler Energy Corporation (FWEC), the seller of the Mountaintop, Pennsylvania property to the predecessor of one of the
Company’s subsidiaries in 1989, agreed to indemnify the Company’s predecessor and its successors and assigns against certain identified environmental liabilities for which FWEC executed a Consent Order Agreement with the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) and EPA. Management believes that this indemnification arrangement is enforceable for the benefit of the Company and that FWEC has the financial resources to honor its obligations under this
indemnification arrangement.

Young Radiator ceased manufacturing operations at its Racine, Wisconsin facility in the early
1990s. Investigations prior to the acquisition of Young revealed some levels of contamination on the Racine property. The Company has completed a comprehensive site evaluation and implemented a groundwater remediation program under Wisconsin’s
voluntary remediation program. Site monitoring is being conducted to demonstrate attainment of Wisconsin’s cleanup requirements. The Company believes the regulating authority is generally in agreement with the selected remediation approach and
findings presented to-date.

From time to time the Company is involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its
operations in the ordinary course of business. As of the date hereof, the Company is involved in no litigation that the Company believes will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
