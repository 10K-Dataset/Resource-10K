PART I

Item 1.

BUSINESS

General

Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation, doing business as Wabtec Corporation, is a Delaware corporation with headquarters at 1001
Air Brake Avenue in Wilmerding, Pennsylvania. Our telephone number is 412-825-1000, and our website is located at

www.wabtec.com

. All references to “we”, “our”, “us”, the “Company” and
“Wabtec” refer to Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries. Westinghouse Air Brake Company (“WABCO”) was formed in 1990 when it acquired certain assets and operations from American Standard, Inc., now
known as Trane (“Trane”). In 1999, WABCO merged with MotivePower Industries, Inc. (“MotivePower”) and adopted the name Wabtec.

Today, Wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of value-added, technology-based equipment and services for the global rail industry. We believe we hold approximately a 50% market share in
North America for our primary braking-related equipment and a leading position in North America for most of our other product lines. Our highly engineered products, which are intended to enhance safety, improve productivity and reduce maintenance
costs for customers, can be found on virtually all U.S. locomotives, freight cars, subway cars and buses. In 2010, the Company had sales of about $1.5 billion and net income of about $123 million. In 2010 sales of aftermarket parts and services
represented about 55% of total sales, while sales to customers outside of the U.S. accounted for about 46% of total sales.

Industry
Overview

The Company primarily serves the worldwide freight rail and passenger transit industries. As such, our operating
results are largely dependent on the level of activity, financial condition and capital spending plans of the global railroad and transit industries. Many factors influence these industries, including general economic conditions; rail traffic, as
measured by freight tonnage and passenger ridership; government spending on public transportation; and investment in new technologies by freight rail and passenger transit systems.

According to a recent study by UNIFE, the Association of the European Rail Industry, the global market for railway products and services
is more than $100.0 billion. The three largest markets, which represent about 85% of the total market, are Europe, North America and Asia-Pacific.

In North America, railroads carry about 43% of intercity freight, as measured by ton-miles, which is more than any other mode of transportation. They are an integral part of the continent’s economy
and transportation system, serving nearly every industrial, wholesale and retail sector. Through direct ownership and operating partnerships, U.S. railroads are part of an integrated network that includes railroads in Canada and Mexico, forming what
is regarded as the world’s most-efficient and lowest-cost freight rail service. There are more than 500 railroads operating in North America, with the largest railroads, referred to as “Class I,” accounting for more than 90% of the
industry’s revenues. Although the railroads carry a wide variety of commodities and goods, coal is the single-largest item, representing about 45% of carloadings in 2010. Intermodal traffic—the movement of trailers or containers by rail in
combination with another mode of transportation—has been the railroads’ fastest-growing market segment in the past 10 years. Railroads operate in a competitive environment, especially with the trucking industry, and are always seeking ways
to improve safety, cost and reliability. New technologies offered by Wabtec and others in the industry can provide some of these benefits.

Demand for our freight related products and services in North America is driven by a number of factors, including:

•

Rail traffic.

The Association of American Railroads (AAR) compiles statistics that gauge the level of activity in the freight rail industry. Two
important statistics are revenue ton-miles and carloadings,



which are generally referred to as “rail traffic”. In 2010, revenue ton-miles increased 8.5%, carloadings increased 7.3%, and intermodal carloadings increased 14.2%, as rail traffic
rebounded strongly from the 2008-09 economic recession in the U.S.

•

Demand for new locomotives.

Currently, the active locomotive fleet for Class I railroads in North America is about 24,000 units. The average
number of new locomotives delivered over the past 10 years was about 1,000 annually. In 2010, about 575 new, heavy-haul locomotives were delivered, compared to about 700 in 2009.

•

Demand for new freight cars

. Currently, the active freight car fleet in North America is about 1.4 million. The average number of new freight
cars delivered over the past 10 years was about 45,000 annually. In 2010, about 17,000 new freight cars were delivered, compared to about 22,000 cars in 2009.

In the U.S., the passenger transit industry is dependent largely on funding from federal, state and local governments, and from fare box
revenues. With about 40% of the nation’s passenger transit vehicles, the New York City region is the largest passenger transit market in the U.S., but most major cities also offer either rail or bus transit services.

Demand for North American passenger transit products is driven by a number of factors, including:

•

Government funding.

The U.S. federal government provides money to local transit authorities, primarily to fund the purchase of new equipment and
infrastructure for their transit systems. Under a multi-year spending bill known as SAFETEA-LU, federal government funding has increased on average by 6-8% annually since 2005. Due in part to this increased government funding, the number of cars
delivered in 2010 remained well above the 10 year average, at about 1,100, compared to about 1,300 in 2009. The number of new buses delivered in 2010 was about 5,200 compared to about 5,400 in 2009. In the past 10 years, the average number of new
transit cars delivered annually is about 600, and the average number of new buses delivered annually is about 4,800. SAFETEA-LU expired in September 2009 but funding has been maintained at current levels until a new bill is completed. In 2011,
Congress is expected to discuss a new funding bill, but there can be no assurance that future funding will increase or be maintained at current levels.

•

Ridership

. Ridership provides fare box revenues to transit authorities, which use these funds, along with state and local money, primarily for
equipment and system maintenance. Based on preliminary figures from the American Public Transportation Association, ridership on U.S. transit vehicles decreased about 1% in 2010, after a 4% decrease in 2009 due to the economic recession. Prior to
2009, ridership had increased for six consecutive years.

Outside of North America, many of the rail systems
have historically been focused on passenger transit, rather than freight. In recent years, however, railroads in countries such as Australia, India and China have been investing capital to expand and improve both their freight and passenger rail
systems. Throughout the world, some government-owned railroads are being sold to private owners, who often look to improve the efficiency of the rail system by investing in new equipment and new technologies. These investment programs represent
opportunities for Wabtec to provide products and services.

In Europe, the majority of the rail system serves the passenger
transit market, which is expected to continue growing as high fuel costs and environmental factors encourage investment in public mass transit. France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Italy are the largest transit markets, representing about
two-thirds of passenger traffic in the European Union. About 75% of freight traffic in Europe is hauled by truck, while rail accounts for about 20%. The largest freight markets in Europe are Germany, Poland and the United Kingdom. According to
UNIFE, the European market consists of about 33,000 locomotives, about 700,000 freight cars and about 150,000 passenger transit cars. In recent years, the European market purchased on average about 1,300 new locomotives, about 1,000 new freight cars
and about 7,500 new passenger transit cars annually.



The Asia/Pacific market is expected to be the second-largest geographic segment by 2016,
according to the UNIFE study. Growth is expected to be driven by the continued urbanization of countries such as China and India, and by investment in freight rail infrastructure to serve the mining and natural resources markets in those countries,
as well as in Australia. According to UNIFE, this market consists of about 34,000 locomotives and about 1.0 million freight cars.

Business Segments and Products

We provide our products and services through two principal business segments, the Freight Group and the Transit Group, both of which have different market characteristics and business drivers.

The Freight Group primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing freight cars and locomotives, builds new switcher
locomotives, rebuilds freight locomotives, supplies railway electronics, positive train control equipment, signal design and engineering services, and provides related heat exchange and cooling systems. Customers include large, publicly traded
railroads, leasing companies, manufacturers of original equipment such as locomotives and freight cars, and utilities. As discussed previously, demand in the freight market is primarily driven by rail traffic, and deliveries of new locomotives and
freight cars. In 2010, the Freight Group accounted for 52% of our total sales, with about two-thirds of its sales in North America and the remainder to international customers. About two-thirds of the Freight Group’s sales are in the
aftermarket and the remainder in the original equipment market.

The Transit Group primarily manufactures and services
components for new and existing passenger transit vehicles, typically subway cars and buses, builds new commuter locomotives and refurbishes subway cars. Customers include public transit authorities and municipalities, leasing companies, and
manufacturers of subway cars and buses around the world. As discussed previously, demand in the transit market is primarily driven by government funding at all levels and passenger ridership. In 2010, the Transit Group accounted for 48% of our total
sales, with about half of its sales in North America and the remainder to international customers. About half of the Transit Group’s sales are in the aftermarket and half in the original equipment market.

Following is a summary of our leading product lines in both aftermarket and original equipment across both of our business segments:

•

Railway braking equipment and related components

•

Freight car truck components

•

Draft gears, couplers and slack adjusters

•

Air compressors and dryers

•

Positive train control equipment and electronically controlled pneumatic braking products

•

Railway electronics, including event recorders, monitoring equipment and end of train devices

•

Signal design and engineering services

•

Friction products, including brake shoes and pads

•

•

Traction motors

•

Accessibility lifts and ramps for buses and subway cars

•

Heat exchangers and cooling products for locomotives and power generation equipment

•

Commuter and switcher locomotives



•

Transit car and locomotive overhauls

We have become a leader in the rail industry by capitalizing on the strength of our existing products, technological capabilities and new product innovation, and by our ability to harden products to
protect them from severe conditions, including extreme temperatures and high-vibration environments. Over the past several years, we introduced a number of significant new products including electronic braking equipment and train control equipment
that encompasses onboard digital data and global positioning communication protocols. In 2007, for example, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) approved the use of our Electronic Train Management System

®

, which offers safety benefits to the rail industry. In 2008, the U.S. federal government enacted a rail safety bill
that mandates the use of positive train control technology, which includes on-board locomotive computer and related software, on a majority of the locomotives and track in the U.S. by December 31, 2015. As the leading supplier of on-board train
control equipment, Wabtec is working with the railroads and transit authorities to implement this technology. Supported by our technical staff of over 550 engineers and specialists, we have extensive experience in a broad range of product lines,
which enables us to provide comprehensive, systems-based solutions for our customers.

For additional information on our
business segments, see Note 19 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.

Competitive Strengths

Our key strengths include:

•

Leading market positions in core products

. Dating back to 1869 and George Westinghouse’s invention of the air brake, we are an established
leader in the development and manufacture of pneumatic braking equipment for freight and passenger transit vehicles. We have leveraged our leading position by focusing on research and engineering to expand beyond pneumatic braking components to
supplying integrated parts and assemblies for the locomotive through the end of the train. We are a recognized leader in the development and production of electronic recording, measuring and communications systems, positive train control equipment,
highly engineered compressors and heat exchangers for locomotives, and a leading manufacturer of freight car components, including electronic braking equipment, draft gears, trucks, brake shoes and electronic end-of-train devices. We are also the
leading manufacturer of commuter locomotives and a leading provider of braking equipment, door assemblies, lifts and ramps, and couplers for passenger transit vehicles.

•

Breadth of product offering with a stable mix of original equipment market (OEM) and aftermarket business

. Our product portfolio is one of the
broadest in the rail industry, as we offer a wide selection of quality parts, components and assemblies across the entire train. We provide our products in both the original equipment market and the aftermarket. Our substantial installed base of
products with end-users such as the railroads and the passenger transit authorities is a significant competitive advantage for providing products and services to the aftermarket because these customers often look to purchase safety- and
performance-related replacement parts from the original equipment components supplier. In addition, as OEMs and Class I railroad operators attempt to modernize fleets with new products designed to improve and maintain safety and efficiency, these
products must be designed to be interoperable with existing equipment. Over the last several years, more than 50% of our total net sales have come from our aftermarket products and services business.

•

Leading design and engineering capabilities

. We believe a hallmark of our relationship with our customers has been our leading design and
engineering practice, which has, in our opinion, assisted in the improvement and modernization of global railway equipment. We believe both our customers and the government authorities value our technological capabilities and commitment to
innovation, as we seek not only to enhance the efficiency and profitability of our customers, but also to improve the overall safety of the railways through continuous improvement of product performance. The Company



has an established record of product improvements and new product development. We have assembled a wide range of patented products, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.
Wabtec currently owns over 1,250 active patents worldwide and over 500 U.S. patents. During the last three years, we have filed for more than 350 patents worldwide in support of our new and evolving product lines.

•

Experience with industry regulatory requirements.

The U.S. rail industry is governed by the AAR and by the FRA. These groups mandate rigorous
manufacturer certification, new product testing and approval processes that we believe are difficult for new entrants to meet cost-effectively and efficiently without the scale and extensive experience we possess.

•

Experienced management team and the Wabtec Performance System

. The Company has implemented numerous initiatives that enable us to manage
successfully through cycles in the rail supply market. For example, the Wabtec Performance System (WPS), an ongoing program that focuses on lean manufacturing principles and continuous improvement across all aspects of our business, has been a part
of the company’s culture for more than 20 years. As a result, our management team has improved our cost structure, operating leverage and financial flexibility, and placed the Company in an excellent position to benefit from growth
opportunities.

Business strategy

Using WPS, we strive to generate sufficient cash to invest in our growth strategies and to build on what we consider to be a leading position as a low-cost producer in the industry while maintaining
world-class product quality, technology and customer responsiveness. Through WPS and employee-directed initiatives such as Kaizen, a Japanese-developed team concept, we strive to improve quality, delivery and productivity continuously, and to reduce
costs. These efforts enable us to streamline processes, improve product reliability and customer satisfaction, reduce product cycle times and respond more rapidly to market developments. Over time, these lean initiatives have enabled us to increase
operating margins, improve cash flow and strengthen our ability to invest in the following growth strategies:

•

Expand globally and into new product markets

. We believe that international markets represent a significant opportunity for future growth. In
2010, sales to non-U.S. customers were $692.0 million, including export sales from the Company’s U.S. operations of $327.2 million. We intend to increase our existing international sales through strategic acquisitions, direct sales of products
through our existing subsidiaries and licensees, and joint ventures with railway suppliers which have a strong presence in their local markets. We are specifically targeting markets that operate significant fleets of U.S.-style locomotives and
freight cars, including Australia, Brazil, China, India, Russia, South Africa, and other select areas within Europe and South America. In addition, we have opportunities to sell certain products that we currently manufacture for the rail industry
into other industrial markets, such as mining, off-highway and energy. These products include heat exchangers and friction materials.

•

Expand aftermarket sales

. Historically, aftermarket sales are less cyclical than OEM sales because a certain level of aftermarket maintenance
and service work must be performed, even during an industry slowdown. In 2010, Wabtec’s aftermarket sales and services represented approximately 55% of the Company’s total sales. Wabtec provides aftermarket parts and services for its
components, and the Company is seeking to expand this business with new customers such as short-line and regional railroads, or with customers who currently perform the work in-house. In this way, we expect to take advantage of the rail industry
trend toward outsourcing, as railroads and transit authorities’ focus on their core function of transporting goods and people

.

•

Accelerate new product development

. We continue to emphasize research and development funding to create new and improved products. We are
focusing on technological advances, especially in the areas of electronics, braking products and other on-board equipment, as a means of new product growth. We seek to provide customers with incremental technological advances that offer immediate
benefits with



cost-effective investments. In 2008, the U.S. federal government enacted a rail safety bill that mandates the use of positive train control technology on a majority of the locomotives and track
in the U.S. by December 31, 2015. As the leading supplier of on-board train control equipment, Wabtec is working with the railroads and transit authorities to implement this technology.

•

Seek acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances

. We are exploring acquisition, joint venture and alliance opportunities using a disciplined,
selective approach and rigorous financial criteria. Such acquisitions will not only be expected to meet these financial criteria but also achieve our growth strategies of global expansion, new products and expanding aftermarket sales. All of these
expansion strategies will help Wabtec to grow profitably, expand geographically, and dampen the impact from potential cycles in the North American rail industry.

Recent Acquisitions and Joint Ventures

Wabtec has completed certain
significant acquisitions in support of its growth strategies:

•

November 2010, Wabtec acquired substantially all of the assets of Swiger Coil Systems, a manufacturer of traction motors and electric coils for the
rail and power generation markets for a net purchase price of approximately $43.0 million.

•

August 2010, we acquired Bach-Simpson, a designer and manufacturer of electronic instrumentation devices for rail and transit markets, for a net
purchase price of approximately $12.0 million, and on July 28, 2010, the Company acquired G&B, a manufacturer of railroad track and signaling products, for a net purchase price of approximately $31.8 million.

•

March 2010, the Company acquired Xorail, a leading provider of signal engineering and design services, for a net purchase price of $39.9 million.

•

October 2009, the Company acquired Unifin International LP, and its affiliate, Cardinal Pumps and Exchangers, Inc. (“Unifin”), a manufacturer
of cooling systems and related equipment for the power generation and transmission industry for a net purchase price of $92.9 million.

•

December 2008, the Company acquired 100% of the stock of Standard Car Truck Company (“SCT”), for $302.6 million, net of cash. SCT is a
manufacturer and designer of stabilization systems for freight cars, including engineered truck (undercarriage) components such as springs, friction wedges and wear plates. Its Barber

®

brand truck design is used throughout the world and holds a leading share of the North American market. The company also manufactures and services locomotives
components, including compressors and pumps.

•

June 2008, Wabtec acquired 100% of the stock of POLI S.p.A. (“POLI”) for €55.2 million ($87.0 million), net of cash received. POLI
is a European-based manufacturer of rail braking equipment including brake discs for high-speed applications, as well as tread brake units and pneumatic brake valves that meet International Union of Railways (“UIC”) standards.

Expanding its presence in key geographic areas, Wabtec made several investments. As of December 31,
2010, the Company acquired Adantech, a Brazilian manufacturer of brake shoes and pads for subway cars, locomotives and freight cars. In September 2010, we formed a joint venture in China to manufacture transformer oil coolers, generator coolers and
related products for the power generation market, for a 60% interest in Hubei Dengfeng Unifin Electrical Equipment Cooling System Co., Ltd. (“Unifin DF”). In December 2008, Wabtec acquired the majority of Beijing Wabtec Huaxia
Technology Company, Ltd, which manufactures friction products for the freight car market in China. Also in December 2008, the Company formed a joint venture in Shenyang, China, which manufactures braking related components for the China freight
market. Increasing upon its original investment, in September 2010, Wabtec contributed an additional $8.0 million into this joint venture. In 2008, the Company formed a joint venture in South Africa to manufacture friction products.



Backlog

The Company’s backlog was about $1.08 billion at December 31, 2010. For 2010, about 55% of sales came from aftermarket orders, which typically carry lead times of less than 30 days, and are not
recorded in backlog for a significant period of time. As such, the Company’s backlog is mostly an indicator of future original equipment sales, primarily for the Transit Group, and not aftermarket sales.

The Company’s contracts are subject to standard industry cancellation provisions, including cancellations on short notice or upon
completion of designated stages. Substantial scope-of-work adjustments are common. For these and other reasons, completion of the Company’s backlog may be delayed or cancelled. The railroad industry, in general, has historically been subject to
fluctuations due to overall economic conditions and the level of use of alternative modes of transportation.

The backlog of
firm customer orders as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, and the expected year of completion are as follows:

Engineering and Development

To execute our strategy to develop new products, we invest in a variety of engineering and development activities. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, we invested about
$40.2 million, $42.4 million and $39.0 million, respectively, on product development and improvement activities. The engineering resources of the Company are allocated between research and development activities and the execution of original
equipment customer contracts.

Our engineering and development program is largely focused upon train control and new braking
technologies, with an emphasis on applying electronics to traditional pneumatic equipment. Electronic braking has been used in the transit industry for years, and freight railroads are conducting pilot programs to test its reliability and benefits.
Freight railroads have generally been slower to accept the technology due to issues over interoperability, connectivity and durability. We are proceeding with efforts to enhance the major components for existing hard-wired braking equipment and
development of new electronic technologies for the freight railroads. Sometimes we conduct specific research projects in conjunction with universities, customers and other railroad product suppliers.

We use our Product Development System (PDS) to develop and monitor new product programs. The system requires the product development team
to follow consistent steps throughout the development process, from concept to launch, to ensure the product will meet customer expectations and internal profitability targets.

Intellectual Property

We have more than 1,250 active patents worldwide. We
also rely on a combination of trade secrets and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our intellectual property.

Certain trademarks, among them the name WABCO

®

, were acquired or licensed from American Standard Inc., now known as Trane, in 1990 at the time of our acquisition of the North American operations of the Railway
Products Group of Trane. Other trademarks have been developed through the normal course of business, or acquired as a part of our ongoing merger and acquisition program.



We have entered into a variety of license agreements as licensor and licensee. We do not
believe that any single license agreement is of material importance to our business or either of our business segments as a whole.

We have issued licenses to the two sole suppliers of railway air brakes and related products in Japan, Nabtesco and Mitsubishi Electric Company. The licensees pay annual license fees to us and also assist
us by acting as liaisons with key Japanese passenger transit vehicle builders for projects in North America. We believe that our relationships with these licensees have been beneficial to our core transit business and customer relationships in North
America.

Customers

Our customers include railroads and passenger transit authorities throughout North America, as well as in the United Kingdom, Australia, Europe, Asia, South Africa and South America; manufacturers of
transportation equipment, such as locomotives, freight cars, subway vehicles and buses; and lessors of such equipment.

In
2010, about 46% of sales were to customers outside the U.S. and to approximately 100 countries throughout the world. About 55% of sales were in the aftermarket, with a majority of our remaining sales to OEMs of locomotives, freight cars, subway
vehicles and buses.

Top customers can change from year to year. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, our top
five customers accounted for 18% of net sales: Metrolinx (formerly Greater Toronto Transit Authority), Eversholt (formally HSBC) Rail (UK) Ltd., General Electric Transportation, Virginia Railway Express, and CSX Transportation. No one customer
represents 10% or more of consolidated sales. We believe that we have strong relationships with all of our key customers.

Competition

We believe that we hold approximately a 50% market share in North America for our primary braking-related equipment and a
leading market position in North America for most of our other product lines. On a global basis, our market shares are smaller. We operate in a highly competitive marketplace. Price competition is strong because we have a relatively small number of
customers and they are very cost-conscious.

In addition to price, competition is based on product performance and
technological leadership, quality, reliability of delivery, and customer service and support.

Our principal competitors vary
across product lines. Within North America, New York Air Brake Company, a subsidiary of the German air brake producer Knorr-Bremse AG, is our principal overall OEM competitor. Our competition for locomotive, freight and passenger transit service and
repair is mostly from the railroads’ and passenger transit authorities’ in-house operations, Electro-Motive Diesel, GE Transportation Systems, and New York Air Brake/Knorr. We believe our key strengths, which include leading market
positions in core products, breadth of product offering with a stable mix of OEM and aftermarket business, leading design and engineering capabilities, significant barriers to entry and an experienced management team, enable us to compete
effectively in this marketplace.

Employees

At December 31, 2010, we had 6,654 full-time employees, approximately 28% of whom were unionized. A majority of the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements are within North America and
these agreements are generally effective from 2011 through 2013. Agreements expiring in 2011 cover approximately 11% of the Company’s workforce. We consider our relations with employees and union representatives to be good, but cannot assure
that future contract negotiations will be favorable to us.



Regulation

In the course of our operations, we are subject to various regulations of agencies and other entities. In the United States, these include principally the FRA and the AAR. The FRA administers and enforces
federal laws and regulations relating to railroad safety. These regulations govern equipment and safety standards for freight cars and other rail equipment used in interstate commerce. The AAR oversees a wide variety of rules and regulations
governing safety and design of equipment, relationships among railroads with respect to railcars in interchange and other matters. The AAR also certifies railcar builders and component manufacturers that provide equipment for use on railroads in the
United States. New products generally must undergo AAR testing and approval processes. As a result of these regulations and those stipulated in other countries in which we derive our revenues, we must maintain certain certifications as a component
manufacturer and for products we sell.

Effects of Seasonality

Our business is not typically seasonal, although the third quarter results may be impacted by vacation and plant shutdowns at several of our major customers during this period.

Item 1A.

RISK FACTORS

Prolonged unfavorable
economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business.

Unfavorable general economic and market conditions
in the United States and internationally could have a negative impact on our sales and operations. To the extent that these factors result in continued instability of capital markets, shortages of raw materials or component parts, longer sales
cycles, deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

We are dependent upon key customers.

We rely on several key
customers who represent a significant portion of our business. Our top customers can change from year to year. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, our top five customers accounted for 18% of our net sales. While we believe our
relationships with our customers are generally good, our top customers could choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with us. In addition, many of our customers place orders for products on an as-needed basis and operate in cyclical
industries. As a result, their order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future. Such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers, and may be subject to delays and cancellations.
As a result of our



dependence on our key customers, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition if we lost any one or more of our key customers or if
there is a reduction in their demand for our products.

Our business operates in a highly competitive industry.

We operate in a competitive marketplace and face substantial competition from a limited number of established competitors in the United
States and abroad, some of which may have greater financial resources than we do. Price competition is strong and, coupled with the existence of a number of cost conscious purchasers, has historically limited our ability to increase prices. In
addition to price, competition is based on product performance and technological leadership, quality, reliability of delivery and customer service and support. There can be no assurance that competition in one or more of our markets will not
adversely affect us and our results of operations.

We intend to pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances that involve a number
of inherent risks, any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits.

One aspect of our business strategy
is to selectively pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances that we believe will improve our market position, and provide opportunities to realize operating synergies. These transactions involve inherent risks and uncertainties, any one of
which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, including:

•

difficulties in achieving identified financial and operating synergies, including the integration of operations, services and products;

•

diversion of Management’s attention from other business concerns;

•

the assumption of unknown liabilities; and

•

unanticipated changes in the market conditions, business and economic factors affecting such an acquisition.

We cannot assure that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions, joint ventures or other business combinations. If we are
unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to consummate strategic acquisitions, we may be unable to fully implement our business strategy, and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result. In addition, our
ability to engage in strategic acquisitions will be dependent on our ability to raise substantial capital, and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement our acquisition strategy on terms satisfactory to us, if at all.

As we introduce new products and services, a failure to predict and react to consumer demand could adversely affect our business.

We have dedicated significant resources to the development, manufacturing and marketing of new products. Decisions to
develop and market new transportation products are typically made without firm indications of customer acceptance. Moreover, by their nature, new products may require alteration of existing business methods or threaten to displace existing equipment
in which our customers may have a substantial capital investment. There can be no assurance that any new products that we develop will gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace or that such products will be able to compete successfully with
other new products or services that may be introduced by competitors. In addition, we may incur additional warranty or other costs as new products are tested and used by customers.

Our revenues are subject to cyclical variations in the railway and passenger transit markets and changes in government spending.

The railway industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations due to overall economic conditions, the use of alternate
methods of transportation and the levels of federal, state and local government



spending on railroad transit projects. In economic downturns, railroads have deferred, and may defer, certain expenditures in order to conserve cash in the short term. Reductions in freight
traffic may reduce demand for our replacement products.

The passenger transit railroad industry is also cyclical. New
passenger transit car orders vary from year to year and are influenced greatly by major replacement programs and by the construction or expansion of transit systems by transit authorities. A substantial portion of our net sales have been, and we
expect that a material portion of our future net sales will be, derived from contracts with metropolitan transit and commuter rail authorities and Amtrak. To the extent that future funding for proposed public projects is curtailed or withdrawn
altogether as a result of changes in political, economic, fiscal or other conditions beyond our control, such projects may be delayed or cancelled, resulting in a potential loss of business for us, including transit aftermarket and new transit car
orders. There can be no assurance that economic conditions will be favorable or that there will not be significant fluctuations adversely affecting the industry as a whole and, as a result, us.

A growing portion of our sales may be derived from our international operations, which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an
international level.

In fiscal year 2010, approximately 46% of our consolidated net sales were to customers outside of
the U.S. and we intend to continue to expand our international operations in the future. We currently conduct our international operations through a variety of wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures in Australia, Brazil, Canada,
China, Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Italy, Macedonia, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, Spain, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. As a result, we are subject to various risks, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on those
operations and on our business as a whole, including:

•

lack of complete operating control;

•

lack of local business experience;

•

currency exchange fluctuations and devaluations;

•

foreign trade restrictions and exchange controls;

•

difficulty enforcing agreements and intellectual property rights;

•

the potential for nationalization of enterprises; and

•

economic, political and social instability and possible terrorist attacks against American interests.

In addition, certain jurisdictions have laws that limit the ability of non-U.S. subsidiaries and their affiliates to pay dividends and
repatriate cash flows.

We may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.

In the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding
costs associated with variable-rate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements. There can be no assurance that any of these
measures will be effective. Any material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to us.

We may have
liability arising from asbestos litigation.

Claims have been filed against the Company and certain of its affiliates
in various jurisdictions across the United States by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing products. Most of these claims have been made against our wholly owned subsidiary, Railroad Friction Products
Corporation (RFPC), and are based on a product sold by RFPC prior to the time that the Company acquired any interest in RFPC.



Most of these claims, including all of the RFPC claims, are submitted to insurance carriers
for defense and indemnity or to non-affiliated companies that retain the liabilities for the asbestos-containing products at issue. We cannot, however, assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors or
insurers will remain financially viable. Our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims, as is the case with other pending litigation, cannot be estimated.

It is Management’s belief that the potential range of loss for asbestos-related bodily injury cases is not reasonably determinable
at present due to a variety of factors, including: (1) the asbestos case settlement history of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, RFPC; (2) the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation in general; and (3) the
uncertainty of asbestos litigation in particular. Despite this uncertainty, and although the results of the Company’s operations and cash flows for any given period could be adversely affected by asbestos-related lawsuits, Management believes
that the final resolution of the Company’s asbestos-related cases will not be material to the Company’s overall financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In general, this belief is based upon: (1) Wabtec’s and
RFPC’s history of settlements and dismissals of asbestos-related cases to date; (2) the inability of many plaintiffs to establish any exposure or causal relationship to RFPC’s product; and (3) the inability of many plaintiffs to
demonstrate any identifiable injury or compensable loss.

More specifically, as to RFPC, Management’s belief that any
losses due to asbestos-related cases would not be material is also based on the fact that RFPC owns insurance which provides coverage for asbestos-related bodily injury claims. To date, RFPC’s insurers have provided RFPC with defense and
indemnity in these actions. The overall number of new claims being filed against RFPC has dropped significantly in recent years; however, these new claims, and all previously filed claims, may take a significant period of time to resolve. As to
Wabtec and its divisions, Management’s belief that asbestos-related cases will not have a material impact is also based on its position that it has no legal liability for asbestos-related bodily injury claims, and that the former owners of
Wabtec’s assets retained asbestos liabilities for the products at issue. To date, Wabtec has been able to successfully defend itself on this basis, including two arbitration decisions and a judicial opinion, all of which confirmed Wabtec’s
position that it did not assume any asbestos liabilities from the former owners of certain Wabtec assets. Although Wabtec has incurred defense and administrative costs in connection with asbestos bodily injury actions, these costs have not been
material, and the Company has no information that would suggest these costs would become material in the foreseeable future.

We are
subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations.

We are subject to a variety of environmental laws and
regulations governing discharges to air and water, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances. We believe our operations currently
comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business; however, there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur
significant costs to comply with such requirements.

Future climate change regulation could result in increased operating costs, affect
the demand for our products or affect the ability of our critical suppliers to meet our needs.

The Company has
followed the current debate over climate change and the related policy discussion and prospective legislation. The potential challenges for the Company that climate change policy and legislation may pose have been reviewed by the Company. Any such
challenges are heavily dependent on the nature and degree of climate change legislation and the extent to which it applies to our industry. At this time, the Company cannot predict the ultimate impact of climate change and climate change legislation
on the Company’s operations. Further, when or if these impacts may occur cannot be assessed until scientific analysis and legislative policy are more developed and specific legislative proposals begin to take shape. Any laws or regulations that
may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gas could require us to incur increased operating costs, and could have an adverse effect on demand for our products. In addition, the price and availability of certain of the



raw materials that we use could vary in the future as a result of environmental laws and regulations affecting our suppliers. An increase in the price of our raw materials or a decline in their
availability could adversely affect our operating margins or result in reduced demand for our products.

Our manufacturer’s
warranties or product liability may expose us to potentially significant claims.

We warrant the workmanship and
materials of many of our products. Accordingly, we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death, or does not conform to our customers’
specifications. In addition, in recent years, we have introduced a number of new products for which we do not have the same level of historical warranty experience. Although we have not had any material product liability or warranty claims made
against us and we currently maintain liability insurance coverage, we cannot assure that product liability claims, if made, would not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable
terms, if at all. The possibility exists for these types of warranty claims to result in costly product recalls, significant repair costs and damage to our reputation.

Labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.

We collectively bargain with labor unions that represent approximately 28% of our employees. Our current collective bargaining agreements are generally effective from 2011 through 2013. Agreements
expiring in 2011 cover approximately 11% of the Company’s workforce. Failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes or other labor protests which could disrupt our operations. If we were to experience a strike or work stoppage, it would
be difficult for us to find a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills to replace these employees. We cannot assure that we will reach any such agreement or that we will not encounter strikes or other types of conflicts with the
labor unions of our personnel. Such labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, could cause us to lose revenues and customers and might have permanent effects on our business.

From time to time we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers.

From time to time, we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers regarding routine delivery and performance issues as well as
adjustments for design changes and related extra work. These disputes are generally resolved in the ordinary course of business without having a material adverse impact on us.

Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health.

At
December 31, 2010, we had total debt of $422.1 million. If it becomes necessary to access our available borrowing capacity under the 2008 Refinancing Credit Agreement, along with carrying the $271.5 million currently borrowed under this
facility and the $150.0 million 6.875% senior notes, being indebted could have important consequences to us. For example, it could:

•

increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our
cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;

•

place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt; and

•

limit our ability to borrow additional funds.



The indenture for our $150 million 6.875% senior notes due in 2013 and our 2008 Refinancing Credit
Agreement contain various covenants that limit our Management’s discretion in the operation of our businesses.

The indenture governing the notes and our credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our Management’s discretion.

The 2008 Refinancing Credit Agreement limits the Company’s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the
Company from declaring or making other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. The 2008 Refinancing Credit Agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations: incurrence of additional indebtedness;
mergers, consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions; additional liens; sale and leasebacks; permissible investments, loans and advances; certain debt payments; capital expenditures; and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and
a maximum debt to cash flow ratio.

The indenture under which the senior notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions
which limit among other things, the following: the incurrence of indebtedness, payment of dividends and certain distributions, sale of assets, change in control, mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens.

The integration of our recently completed acquisitions may not result in anticipated improvements in market position or the realization of
anticipated operating synergies or may take longer to realize than expected.

In 2009 and 2010, we completed multiple
acquisitions with a combined investment of $221.5 million. Although we believe that the acquisitions will improve our market position and realize positive operating results, including operating synergies, operating expense reductions and overhead
cost savings, we cannot be assured that these improvements will be obtained. The management and acquisition of businesses involves substantial risks, any of which may result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations,
including:

•

the uncertainty that an acquired business will achieve anticipated operating results;

•

significant expenses to integrate;

•

diversion of Management’s attention;

•

departure of key personnel from the acquired business;

•

effectively managing entrepreneurial spirit and decision-making;

•

integration of different information systems;

•

unanticipated costs and exposure to unforeseen liabilities; and

•

impairment of assets.

Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

Wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of
value-added, technology-based products and services for the global rail industry. Our products are found on virtually all U.S. locomotives, freight cars and passenger transit vehicles, as well as in approximately 100 countries throughout the world.
Our products enhance safety, improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers, and many of our core products and services are essential in the safe and efficient operation of freight rail and passenger transit vehicles. Wabtec is a
global company with operations in 17 countries. In 2010, about 46% of the Company’s revenues came from customers outside the U.S.

Management Review and Outlook

Wabtec’s long-term financial goals are to generate cash flow in excess of net income, maintain a strong credit profile while minimizing our overall cost of capital, increase margins through strict
attention to cost controls, and increase revenues through a focused growth strategy, including global and market expansion, new products and technologies, aftermarket products and services, and acquisitions. In addition, Management evaluates the
Company’s short-term operational performance through measures such as quality and on-time delivery.

The Company monitors
a variety of factors and statistics to gauge market activity. The freight rail industry is largely driven by general economic conditions, which can cause fluctuations in rail traffic. Based on those fluctuations, railroads can increase or decrease
purchases of new locomotives and freight cars. In 2010, U.S. freight rail traffic increased due to the improving overall economy and this has had a favorable effect on the Company’s Freight Group. Deliveries of new locomotives and freight cars
were lower than 2009 levels, but order rates have picked up in recent quarters. In 2010, revenue ton-miles increased 8.5%, carloadings increased 7.3% and intermodal loadings increased 14.2%, as rail traffic rebounded strongly from the 2008-09
economic recession in the U.S. As a lingering effect from the recession, 2010 deliveries of new freight locomotives decreased about 20% and deliveries of new freight cars decreased about 25%, although both markets are expected to increase in 2011.
About 15% of the Company’s revenues are directly related to deliveries of new freight locomotives and freight cars, so an improvement in those markets would have a favorable effect on the Company’s financial results. Whether demand
continues to improve will depend largely on continued strength in the overall economy and in rail traffic volumes.

In 2008,
the U.S. government enacted rail safety legislation that requires certain freight and passenger railroads to equip certain locomotives with positive train control technology by the end of 2015. This technology includes an on-board
locomotive computer and related software, which are being developed by Wabtec. As the industry leader, Wabtec expects to benefit from increased sales of train control-related products as the technology is deployed throughout the industry.

The North American transit rail industry is driven by government spending and ridership. Spending under SAFETEA-LU, the
federal government’s transportation funding bill increased about 6% in 2009 and remained consistent in 2010, while ridership decreased about 4% and 1% in 2009 and 2010, respectively, due to the recession and its impact on employment levels.
Although SAFETEA-LU was scheduled to expire in September 2009, the bill was extended through March 4, 2011, with funding at about 2009 levels. Spending in 2011 is expected to remain at current levels at least until a new bill has been passed. In
early 2009, the U.S. federal government passed new spending legislation designed to stimulate the U.S. economy, with up to $20 billion to be spent on freight and passenger transportation, as follows: $8.4 billion for public transportation, $8
billion for high-speed rail, $1.5 billion for discretionary intermodal projects, and $1.3 billion for AMTRAK. Most of this funding has already been allocated to specific projects, and Wabtec expects to benefit slightly from this additional spending,
as transit authorities invest in new locomotives and buses.



In 2011, if the economy continues to improve, the Company expects conditions to generally
improve in the freight rail market and to be slightly weaker in the passenger transit market. Demand for new freight cars and locomotives are expected to be higher, due to increasing freight rail traffic. In the passenger transit market, the Company
believes that stable federal funding and ridership would result in stable demand for new equipment and aftermarket parts; however, most government entities at all levels are expected to continue facing budget issues, which could have a negative
effect on demand for the Company’s products and services. In response to current market conditions, Wabtec may continue to take certain actions to reduce costs, including plant consolidations, work force reductions and general spending cuts.
Management believes these actions will not affect the company’s ability to continue to invest in its strategic growth initiatives.

Wabtec continues to expand its presence in freight rail and passenger transit markets outside the U.S., particularly in Europe, Asia-Pacific and South America. In Europe, the majority of the rail system
serves the passenger transit market, which is much larger than the transit market in the U.S. Asia-Pacific is the fastest-growing market segment, led by China’s plans to spend at record levels.

In 2011 and beyond, unfavorable general economic and market conditions in the United States and internationally could have a negative
impact on our sales and operations. To the extent that these factors cause instability of capital markets, shortages of raw materials or component parts, longer sales cycles, deferral or delay of customer order or an inability to market our products
effectively, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, we face risks associated with our four-point growth strategy include the level of investment that customers are willing to make in new
technologies developed by the industry and the Company, and risks inherent in global expansion. When necessary, we will modify our financial and operating strategies to reflect changes in market conditions and risks.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following table shows our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years indicated.



2010 COMPARED TO 2009

The following table summarizes the results of operations for the period:

Net sales increased by
$105.4 million to $1,507.0 million in 2010 from $1,401.6 million in 2009. The increase is due to higher Freight Group sales of $100.2 million from original equipment and aftermarket, and sales related to acquisitions of $86.1 million. Partially
offsetting this increase was lower Transit Group sales of $85.1 million. The Company realized a net sales increase of $4.2 million due to favorable effects of foreign exchange, but net earnings were generally not impacted by foreign exchange. Net
income for 2010 was $123.1 million or $2.56 per diluted share. Net income for 2009 was $115.1 million or $2.39 per diluted share. Net income increased due to higher sales volume and operating margins, partially offset by higher income tax expense.

Freight Group sales increased by $196.1 million or 33.3% due to higher sales of $81.8 million from acquisitions, $63.2
million for specialty products, $20.4 million for brake products and $13.6 million for other freight products. For the Freight Group, net sales improved by $14.1 million due to the favorable effects of foreign exchange.

Transit Group’s sales decreased by $90.7 million or 11.2% due to lower brake product sales of $38.9 million, lower transit related
product sales of $26.3 million, and other lower sales of $19.0 million from remanufacturing, overhaul and build of locomotives, partially offset by sales from acquisitions of $4.3 million. Transit Group sales are lower due in part to the completion
of major contracts, as well as project delays and budget constraints at municipal transit authorities. For the Transit Group, net sales were reduced by $9.9 million due to unfavorable effects of foreign exchange.

Gross profit

Gross profit increased to $449.1 million in 2010 compared to $393.3 million in 2009. Gross profit is dependent
on a number of factors including pricing, sales volume and product mix. In 2010, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 29.8% compared to 28.1% in 2009, because of higher sales volume and mix of products. The provision for warranty expense is
generally established for specific losses, along with historical estimates of customer claims as a percentage of sales, which can cause variability in warranty expense between quarters. Warranty expense was $2.4 million higher in 2010 compared to
2009 due to increased Freight Group sales. The warranty reserve recorded on the balance sheet is $6.3 million higher at December 31, 2010, compared to December 31, 2009. This is a result of higher warranty expense driven by higher sales
and lower claims actually satisfied. In particular, certain Transit Group warranty reserves reflect provisions established for original equipment deliveries in 2010.



Operating expenses

The following table shows our operating expenses:

Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $34.9 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due to
expenses from acquisitions, and incentive and non-cash compensation. Engineering expense decreased by $2.2 million in 2010 compared to 2009 as the company focused engineering resources on completing original equipment contracts. Costs related to
engineering for specific customer contracts are included in cost of sales. Total operating expenses were 16.3% and 15.2% of sales for 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Income from operations

Income from operations totaled $202.8 million or 13.5% of sales in 2010 compared to $180.0 million or 12.8% of sales in 2009. Income from operations increased due to
higher sales volume and operating margins.

Interest expense, net

Overall interest expense, net, decreased.
Interest expense is higher due to increased borrowings, offset by interest income on higher invested cash balances.

Other expense, net

The Company recorded foreign exchange expense of $1.0 million due to the effect of currency exchange
rate changes on intercompany transactions that are non U.S. dollar denominated amounts and charged or credited to earnings. This was offset by $0.9 million of other miscellaneous income.

Income taxes

The effective income tax rate was 34.1% and 29.6% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in the
effective tax rate is primarily due to a benefit recorded in 2009 related to the settlement of examinations in various taxing jurisdictions.

Net income

Net income for 2010 increased $8.0 million, compared to 2009. The increase in net income is due to higher sales volume and operating margins, partially offset by higher income tax
expense.

2009 COMPARED TO 2008

The following table summarizes the results of operations for the period:

Net sales decreased by
$173.2 million to $1,401.6 million in 2009 from $1,574.8 million in 2008. The decrease is due to the recession experienced during the previous 12 months, which contributed to lower rail traffic and lower Freight Group sales. Sales related to
acquisitions of $114.9 million, partially offset the decrease. The Company realized a net sales reduction of $35.1 million due to unfavorable effects of foreign exchange, but



net earnings were generally not impacted by foreign exchange. Net income for 2009 was $115.1 million or $2.39 per diluted share. Net income for 2008 was $130.6 million or $2.66 per diluted share.
Net income decreased due to lower Freight Group sales, severance and other costs related to downsizing and consolidation actions, partially offset by cost-saving initiatives and lower income taxes. Net income was also decreased by the $3.9 million
royalty charge, included in selling, general and administrative expenses, related to the Final Award in the arbitration proceeding between Faiveley Transport Malmo AB and Wabtec.

Freight Group sales decreased by $185.2 million or 23.9% due to lower sales of $145.7 million for specialty products, $107.3 million for
brake products and $21.5 million for remanufacturing, overhaul and manufacturing of locomotives. Offsetting those reductions was an increase in sales of $103.1 million from acquisitions.

Transit Group sales increased by $12.0 million or 1.5% due to increased sales of $17.1 million for brake products, $25.0 million for
other transit related products and $11.8 million from acquisitions. Offsetting those increases was a decrease in sales of $10.0 million for remanufacturing, overhaul and build of locomotives. For the Transit Group, net sales were reduced by $30.9
million due to unfavorable effects of foreign exchange on sales mentioned above.

Gross profit

Gross profit
decreased to $393.3 million in 2009 compared to $427.2 million in 2008. Gross profit is dependent on a number of factors including pricing, sales volume and product mix. In 2009, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 28.1% compared to 27.1% in
2008. The gross profit percentage increased due to realized cost savings from downsizing and consolidation actions and increased gross profit in the transit segment due to efficiencies realized on certain long-term contracts. The provision for
warranty expense is generally established for specific losses, along with historical estimates of customer claims as a percentage of sales, which can cause variability in warranty between periods. The provision for warranty expense was $3.4 million
more in 2009 compared to 2008 due primarily to specific reserves on certain transit products. The warranty reserve recorded on the balance sheet is $1.5 million lower at December 31, 2009, compared to December 31, 2008. This is a result of
lower warranty expense compared to claims actually satisfied. The balance sheet warranty reserve decreased at December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008 due higher than normal settlement of claims.

Operating expenses

The following table shows our operating expenses:

Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $9.6 million in 2009 compared to 2008 due to
cost-savings initiatives along with lower costs related to incentive compensation plans, partially offset by increased expenses from acquisitions. Engineering expenses increased by $3.4 million in 2009 compared to 2008 due mostly to acquisitions.
Costs related to engineering for specific customer contracts are included in cost of sales. Amortization expense increased $4.8 million due to acquisitions. During 2009, the Company sold a facility for net cash proceeds of $3.6 million to an
unrelated third party. While certain portions of the building are being leased back, this transaction resulted in a gain of $2.1 million and deferred gain of $0.6 million. The deferred gain will be recognized over five years. Total operating
expenses were 15.2% and 13.6% of sales for 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Income from operations

Income from
operations totaled $180.0 million or 12.8% of sales in 2009 compared to $212.5 million or 13.5% of sales in 2008. Income from operations decreased due to lower Freight Group sales, severance and other costs related to downsizing and consolidation
actions and the royalty payment to Faiveley Transport Malmo AB, partially offset by cost-saving initiatives.



Interest expense, net

Interest expense, net increased $8.1 million in 2009
compared to 2008 due to acquisition financing.

Other expense, net

The Company recorded foreign exchange expense
of $1.3 million due to the effect of currency exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions that are non U.S. dollar denominated amounts and charged or credited to earnings. This was offset by $1.0 million of other miscellaneous income.

Income taxes

The effective income tax rate was 29.6% and 36.1% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in
the effective tax rate is primarily due to the settlement of examinations in various taxing jurisdictions during 2009.

Net income

Net income for 2009 decreased $15.5 million, compared to 2008. The decrease in net income is due primarily to
lower sales.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity is provided by operating cash flow and borrowings under the Company’s unsecured credit facility with a consortium of commercial banks. The following is a summary of selected cash flow
information and other relevant data:

Operating
activities.

In 2010, 2009 and 2008, cash provided by operations was $176.1 million, $162.3 million and $155.8 million, respectively. In comparison to 2009, cash provided by operations in 2010 resulted from higher net income and higher
non-cash items, partially offset by a net increase in working capital. In 2010, accounts receivable increased by $34.3 million, primarily due to higher sales and inventory increased by $1.7 million from the prior year. These increases were partially
offset by an increase in accounts payable of $44.3 million. All other operating assets and liabilities, net, used cash of $20.2 million due primarily to the payment timing of certain accrued liabilities.

In comparison to 2008, cash provided by operations in 2009 resulted from a decrease in working capital, lower net income and lower
non-cash items. In 2009, accounts receivable decreased by $80.5 million, primarily due to lower sales and inventory decreased $33.4 from the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of $48.2 million. All
other operating assets and liabilities, net, used cash of $60.1 million due primarily to the payment timing of certain accrued liabilities.

In comparison to 2007, cash provided by operations in 2008 resulted from higher net income, partially offset by a net increase in working capital. In 2008, accounts receivable increased by $20.8 million,
primarily due to higher sales and inventory increased by $42.7 million from the prior year. These increases were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of $14.3 million. All other operating assets and liabilities, net, provided cash of
$28.7 million due primarily to the payment timing of certain accrued liabilities.



Investing activities.

In 2010, 2009 and 2008, cash used in investing
activities was $156.3 million, $115.2 million and $417.4 million, respectively. Net cash paid for acquisitions was $138.2 million, $96.3 million and $398.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Refer to Note 3
of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information on acquisitions. In 2009, the Company sold a facility for net cash proceeds of $3.6 million to an unrelated third party. Capital expenditures were $20.8
million, $18.3 million, and $19.7 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Financing activities

.

In
2010, cash provided by financing activities was $25.8 million, which included $248.4 million in proceeds from debt and $185.4 million of repayments of debt on the revolving credit facility, $32.7 million of debt repayments on the term loan and other
debt, $1.9 million of dividend payments and $8.4 million of Wabtec stock repurchases. In 2009, cash used for financing activities was $13.0 million, which included $197.5 million in proceeds from debt and $162.5 million of repayments of debt on the
revolving credit facility, $30.8 million of debt repayments on the term loan and other debt, $1.9 million of dividend payments and $19.7 million of Wabtec stock repurchases. In 2008, cash provided by financing activities was $189.7 million, which
included $236.0 million of borrowings under the new credit facility, offset by $45.8 million of Wabtec stock repurchases.

The
following table shows outstanding indebtedness at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Cash balance at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $236.9 million and $188.7 million, respectively.

2008 Refinancing Credit Agreement

On November 4, 2008, the Company refinanced its existing unsecured revolving credit agreement with a consortium of commercial banks. This “2008 Refinancing Credit Agreement” provides the
company with a $300 million five-year revolving credit facility and a $200 million five-year term loan facility. The Company incurred $2.9 million of deferred financing cost related to the 2008 Refinancing Credit Agreement. Both facilities expire in
January 2013. The 2008 Refinancing Credit Agreement borrowings bear variable interest rates indexed to the indices described below. At December 31, 2010 the weighted average interest rate on the Company’s variable rate debt was 1.58%. At
December 31, 2010, the Company had available bank borrowing capacity, net of $28.9 million of letters of credit, of approximately $137.1 million, subject to certain financial covenant restrictions.

Under the 2008 Refinancing Credit Agreement, the Company may elect a Base Rate of interest or an interest rate based on the London
Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) of interest (“the Alternate Rate”). The Base Rate adjusts on a daily basis and is the greater of the PNC, N.A. prime rate, 30-day LIBOR plus 150 basis points or the Federal Funds Effective Rate
plus 0.5% per annum, plus a margin that ranges from 25 to 50 basis points. The Alternate rate is based on quoted LIBOR rates plus a margin that ranges from 125 to 200 basis points. Both the Base Rate and Alternate Rate margins are dependent on
the Company’s consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios. The initial Base Rate is 25 basis points and the Alternate Rate margin is 125 basis points. To reduce the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of this variable-rate
debt, the Company entered into an interest rate swap which effectively converted a portion of the debt from variable to fixed-rate borrowing during the term



of the swap contract. On December 31, 2010, the notional value of the interest rate swap outstanding was $137.0 million and effectively changed the Company’s interest rate on bank debt
at December 31, 2010 from a variable rate to a fixed rate of 2.27%. The interest rate swap agreement matures at various times through December 2012. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty.
However, since only the cash interest payments are exchanged, exposure is significantly less than the notional amount. The counterparty is a large financial institution with an excellent credit rating and history of performance. The Company
currently believes the risk of nonperformance is negligible.

The 2008 Refinancing Credit Agreement limits the Company’s
ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the Company from declaring or making other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. The 2008 Refinancing Credit Agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the
following limitations: incurrence of additional indebtedness; mergers, consolidations, sales of assets and acquisitions; additional liens; sale and leasebacks; permissible investments, loans and advances; certain debt payments; and imposes a minimum
interest expense coverage ratio of 3.0 and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio of 3.25. The Company is in compliance with these measurements and covenants and expects that these measurements will not be any type of limiting factor in executing our
operating activities. See Note 8 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.

6.875% Senior Notes Due August 2013.

In August 2003, the Company issued $150 million of Senior Notes due in 2013 (“the Notes”). The Notes were issued at par. Interest on the Notes accrues
at a rate of 6.875% per annum and is payable semi-annually on January 31 and July 31 of each year. The proceeds were used to repay debt outstanding under the Company’s existing credit agreement, and for general corporate
purposes. The principal balance is due in full at maturity.

The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and
rank pari passu with all existing and future senior debt and senior to all our existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the Company. The indenture under which the Notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other
things, the following: the incurrence of indebtedness, payment of dividends and certain distributions, sale of assets, change in control, mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens. The Company is in compliance with these measurements
and covenants and expects that these measurements will not be any type of limiting factor in executing our operating activities.

Management believes that based on current levels of operations and forecasted earnings, cash flow and liquidity will be sufficient to fund working capital and capital equipment needs as well as meeting
debt service requirements. If sources of funds were to fail to satisfy the Company’s cash requirements, the Company may need to refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing. There is no assurance that such new financing
alternatives would be available, and, in any case, such new financing, if available, would be expected to be more costly and burdensome than the debt agreements currently in place.



Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company is obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and have certain
contingent commitments such as debt guarantees. The Company has grouped these contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements into operating activities, financing activities, and investing activities in the same manner as they are
classified in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows to provide a better understanding of the nature of the obligations and arrangements and to provide a basis for comparison to historical information. The table below provides a summary of
contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2010:

(1)

Purchase obligations for the purposes of this disclosure have been defined as a contractual obligation that is in excess of $100,000 annually, and $200,000 in total.

(2)

Future minimum payments for operating leases are disclosed by year in Note 14 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV,
Item 15 of this report.

(3)

Annual payments to participants are expected to continue into the foreseeable future at the amounts or ranges noted. Pension benefit payments are based on actuarial
estimates using current assumptions for discount rates, expected return on long-term assets and rate of compensation increases. The Company expects to contribute about $7.2 million to pension plan investments in 2011. See further disclosure in Note
9 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.

(4)

Annual payments to participants are expected to continue into the foreseeable future at the amounts or ranges noted. Postretirement payments are based on actuarial
estimates using current assumptions for discount rates and health care costs. See further disclosure in Note 9 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.

(5)

Interest payments are payable January and July of each year at 6.875% of $150 million Senior Notes due in 2013. Interest payments for the Term Loan Facility, Revolving
Credit Facility and Capital Leases are based on contractual terms and the Company’s current interest rates.

(6)

Scheduled principal repayments of outstanding loan balances are disclosed in Note 8 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV,
Item 15 of this report.

(7)

Shareholder dividends are subject to approval by the Company’s Board of Directors, currently at an annual rate of approximately $1.9 million.

(8)

The annual capital expenditure budget is subject to approval by the Board of Directors. The 2011 budget amount was approved at the December 2010 Board of Directors
meeting.

(9)

The Company has $28.9 million in outstanding letters of credit for performance and bid bond purposes, which expire in various dates through 2013. Amounts include
interest payments based on contractual terms and the Company’s current interest rate.



The above table does not reflect uncertain tax positions of $10.0 million, the timing of
which are uncertain except for $1.3 million that may become payable during 2011. Refer to Note 10 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information on uncertain tax positions.

Obligations for operating activities.

The Company has entered into $58.4 million of material long-term non-cancelable materials
and supply purchase obligations. Operating leases represent multi-year obligations for rental of facilities and equipment. Estimated pension funding and post retirement benefit payments are based on actuarial estimates using current assumptions for
discount rates, expected return on long-term assets, rate of compensation increases and health care cost trend rates. Benefits paid for pension obligations were $13.6 million and $16.0 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Benefits paid for post
retirement plans were $1.9 million and $1.9 million in 2010 and in 2009, respectively.

Obligations for financing
activities.

Cash requirements for financing activities consist primarily of long-term debt repayments, interest payments and dividend payments to shareholders. The Company has historically paid quarterly dividends to shareholders, subject to
quarterly approval by our Board of Directors, currently at a rate of approximately $1.9 million annually.

The Company
arranges for performance bonds to be issued by third party insurance companies to support certain long term customer contracts. At December 31, 2010 initial value of performance bonds issued on the Company’s behalf is about $226.7 million.

Obligations for investing activities.

The Company typically spends approximately $25 million to $35 million a year for
capital expenditures, primarily related to facility expansion efficiency and modernization, health and safety, and environmental control. The Company expects annual capital expenditures in the future will be within this range.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires Management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Areas of uncertainty that require judgments, estimates and assumptions include the accounting for
derivatives, environmental matters, warranty reserves, the testing of goodwill and other intangibles for impairment, pensions and other postretirement benefits, and tax matters. Management uses historical experience and all available information to
make these judgments and estimates, and actual results will inevitably differ from those estimates and assumptions that are used to prepare the Company’s financial statements at any given time. Despite these inherent limitations, Management
believes that Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) and the financial statements and related footnotes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the Company. A discussion of the
judgments and uncertainties associated with accounting for derivatives and environmental matters can be found in Notes 2 and 18, respectively, in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this
report.

A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 in the “Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the Company to provide the users of the financial statements with
useful and reliable information about the Company’s operating results and financial condition.







Item 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk

In the ordinary course of business, Wabtec is exposed
to risks that increases in interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with its variable-rate debt. The Company’s variable rate debt represents 32% and 38% of total long-term debt at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
respectively. On an annual basis a 1% change in the interest rate for variable rate debt at December 31, 2010 would increase or decrease interest expense by $1.3 million.

To reduce the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of this variable-rate debt, the Company entered into an interest rate swap which effectively converted a portion of the debt from variable to
fixed-rate borrowing during the term of the swap contract. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty. However, since only the cash interest payments are exchanged, exposure is significantly less than
the notional amount. The counterparty is a large financial institution with an excellent credit rating and history of performance. The Company currently believes the risk of nonperformance is negligible. The Company concluded that the interest rate
swap agreement qualifies for special cash flow hedge accounting which permits the recording of the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, on the balance sheet. As
of December 31, 2010, the Company had interest rate swap agreements with a notional value of $137.0 million and which effectively changed the Company’s interest rate on bank debt at December 31, 2010 from a variable rate to a fixed
rate of 2.27%. The interest rate swap agreements mature at various times through December 2012. As of December 31, 2010, the Company recorded a current liability of $2.5 million and a corresponding offset in accumulated other comprehensive loss
of $1.5 million, net of tax.



Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

The Company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Forward
contracts are agreements with counterparty to exchange two distinct currencies at a set exchange rate for delivery on a set date at some point in the future. There is no exchange of funds until the delivery date. At the delivery date the Company can
either take delivery of the currency or settle on a net basis.

We occasionally enter into several types of financial
instruments for the purpose of managing our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in countries in which we have significant operations. As of December 31, 2010, we had several such instruments outstanding to hedge currency
rate fluctuation in 2010.

At December 31, 2010, the Company had forward contracts for the sale of South African Rand
(ZAR) and the purchase of U.S. Dollars (USD). The Company concluded that these foreign currency forward contracts qualify for cash flow hedge accounting which permits the recording of the fair value of the forward contract and corresponding
adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, on the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had forward contracts with a notional value of 24.7 million ZAR (or $3.4 million U.S.) with an average exchange rate of 7.19
ZAR per $1 USD, resulting in the recording of a current liability of $192,000 and a corresponding offset in accumulated other comprehensive income of $122,000, net of tax.

At December 31, 2009, the Company had forward contracts for the sale of South African Rand (ZAR) and the purchase of U.S. Dollars (USD). The Company concluded that these foreign currency forward
contracts qualify for cash flow hedge accounting which permits the recording of the fair value of the forward contract and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, on the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2009,
the Company had forward contracts with a notional value of 10.1 million ZAR (or $1.2 million U.S.) with an average exchange rate of 8.21 ZAR per $1 USD, resulting in the recording of a current liability of $110,000 and a corresponding offset in
accumulated other comprehensive income of $70,000, net of tax.

We are also subject to certain risks associated with changes
in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent our operations are conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For the year ended December 31, 2010, approximately 54% of Wabtec’s net sales were to the United States, 11% to Canada,
3% to Mexico, 5% to Australia, 2% to Germany, 9% to the United Kingdom, and 16% in other international locations. (See Note 19 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report).

Our market risk exposure is not substantially different from our exposure at December 31, 2009.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORTS TO WABTEC SHAREHOLDERS

Management’s Report on Financial Statements and Practices

The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) were prepared by Management, which is responsible for their
integrity and objectivity. The statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and include amounts that are based on Management’s best judgments and estimates. The other financial information included in the
10-K is consistent with that in the financial statements.

Management also recognizes its responsibility for conducting the
Company’s affairs according to the highest standards of personal and corporate conduct. This responsibility is characterized and reflected in key policy statements issued from time to time regarding, among other things, conduct of its business
activities within the laws of host countries in which the Company operates and potentially conflicting outside business interests of its employees. The Company maintains a systematic program to assess compliance with these policies.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Management has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management has excluded Xorail LLC (“Xorail”), G&B Specialties, Inc. (“G&B”), Bach-Simpson Corporation
(“Bach-Simpson”) and Swiger Coil Systems (“Swiger”) from its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 because the Company acquired Xorail effective March 12, 2010, G&B
effective July 28, 2010, Bach-Simpson effective August 20, 2010 and Swiger effective November 5, 2010. Xorail, G&B, Bach-Simpson and Swiger are wholly owned subsidiaries whose total assets represents 5.3%, 3.6%, 1.4% and 4.8%,
respectively and net income represents 3.8%, 0.4%, -0.3% and -0.1%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010.

Based on its assessment, Management has concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2010, based on criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, has been audited by
Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010. Our audits also included the financial statement
schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s Management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by Management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

We also
have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on
criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation:

We have audited Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation’s management
is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Xorail LLC (“Xorail”), G&B Specialties, Inc.
(“G&B”), Bach-Simpson Corporation (“Bach-Simpson”) and Swiger Coil Systems (“Swiger”), which are included in the 2010 consolidated financial statements of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation and
constitute 5.3%, 3.6%, 1.4% and 4.8%, respectively, of total assets as of December 31, 2010, and 3.8%, 0.4%, -0.3% and -0.1%, respectively, of net income for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of
Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Xorail, G&B, Bach-Simpson, or Swiger.

In our opinion, Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the COSO criteria.

We have also audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation and our report dated February 25, 2011 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority owned subsidiaries. Such statements have been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. Sales between subsidiaries are billed at prices consistent with sales to third parties and are eliminated in consolidation.

Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects our best estimate of probable
losses inherent in our receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available evidence. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $7.5 million and $7.3
million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of
cost or market. Cost is determined under the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Inventory costs include material, labor and overhead.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment additions are stated at cost. Expenditures for renewals and improvements are capitalized. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance
and repairs are expensed as incurred. The Company provides for book depreciation principally on the straight-line method. Accelerated depreciation methods are utilized for income tax purposes.

Leasing Arrangements

The Company conducts a portion of its operations from leased facilities and finances certain equipment
purchases through lease agreements. In those cases in which the lease term approximates the useful life of the leased asset or the lease meets certain other prerequisites, the leasing arrangement is classified as a capital lease. The remaining
arrangements are treated as operating leases.

Intangible Assets

Goodwill and other intangible assets with
indefinite lives are not amortized. Other intangibles (with definite lives) are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives. Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment are
present. The Company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually. The Company performs its annual impairment test during the fourth quarter after the annual forecasting process is completed, and is reviewed
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Periodically, Management of the Company assesses whether or not an indicator of impairment is present that would necessitate a
goodwill impairment analysis be performed.

The goodwill impairment analysis is performed by comparing the carrying amount of
the reporting unit to its estimated fair value and to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair



value, the reporting unit’s carrying value of goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of goodwill. To the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of
goodwill, impairment exists and must be recognized.

The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level.
The Company prepares its goodwill impairment analysis by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit, using an income approach (a discounted cash flow model) as well as a market approach, with its carrying value. The income approach
and the market approach are equally weighted in arriving at fair value, which the Company has applied consistently.

The
discounted cash flow model requires several assumptions including future sales growth, EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margins and capital expenditures for the reporting units. The discounted cash flow model also requires the use of a
discount rate and a terminal revenue growth rate (the revenue growth rate for the period beyond the three years forecasted by the reporting units), as well as projections of future operating margins. During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company
used a discount rate for each of its reporting units ranging from 11% to 13% and a terminal revenue growth rate of 1% to 3%. The difference in the discount rates is based on the underlying markets and risks associated with each of the Company’s
reporting units.

The market approach requires several assumptions including EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization) multiples for comparable companies that operate in the same markets as the Company’s reporting units. During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company used EBITDA multiples for its reporting units ranging from 6.0
to 12.0. The difference in the EBITDA multiples is due to the underlying markets associated with each of the Company’s reporting units.

The fair value of each reporting units exceeded the carrying value of each reporting unit by more than 10% as of the date of the Company’s impairment test.

Warranty Costs

Warranty costs are accrued based on Management’s estimates of repair or upgrade costs per unit and
historical experience. Warranty expense was $22.8 million, $20.4 million and $17.1 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Accrued warranty was $35.5 million and $29.2 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined
based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws. The provision for income taxes includes federal, state and foreign income taxes.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company recognizes compensation expense for stock-based compensation based on the grant date
fair value. This expense must be recognized ratably over the requisite service period following the date of grant.

Financial Derivatives and Hedging Activities

The Company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the
impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Forward contracts are agreements with a counterparty to exchange two distinct currencies at a set exchange rate for delivery on a set date at some point in the future. There is no exchange of funds until
the delivery date. At the delivery date the Company can either take delivery of the currency or settle on a net basis.

At
December 31, 2010, the Company had forward contracts for the sale of South African Rand (ZAR) and the purchase of U.S. Dollars (USD). The Company concluded that these foreign currency forward contracts qualify for cash flow hedge accounting
which permits the recording of the fair value of the forward contract and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, on the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had forward contracts with a
notional value of 24.7 million ZAR (or



$3.4 million U.S.) with an average exchange rate of 7.19 ZAR per $1 USD, resulting in the recording of a current liability of $192,000 and a corresponding offset in accumulated other
comprehensive income of $122,000, net of tax.

At December 31, 2009, the Company had forward contracts for the sale of
South African Rand (ZAR) and the purchase of U.S. Dollars (USD). The Company concluded that these foreign currency forward contracts qualify for cash flow hedge accounting which permits the recording of the fair value of the forward contract and
corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, on the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had forward contracts with a notional value of 10.1 million ZAR (or $1.2 million U.S.) with an average
exchange rate of 8.21 ZAR per $1 USD, resulting in the recording of a current liability of $110,000 and a corresponding offset in accumulated other comprehensive income of $70,000, net of tax.

To reduce the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of this variable-rate debt, the Company entered into an interest rate swap
which effectively converted a portion of the debt from variable to fixed-rate borrowing during the term of the swap contract. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty. However, since only the cash
interest payments are exchanged, exposure is significantly less than the notional amount. The counterparty is a large financial institution with an excellent credit rating and history of performance. The Company currently believes the risk of
nonperformance is negligible. The Company concluded that the interest rate swap agreement qualifies for special cash flow hedge accounting which permits the recording of the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement and corresponding adjustment
to other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, on the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had interest rate swap agreements with a notional value of $137.0 million and which effectively changed the Company’s interest
rate on bank debt at December 31, 2010 from a variable rate to a fixed rate of 2.27%. The interest rate swap agreements mature at various times through December 2012. As of December 31, 2010, the Company recorded a current liability of
$2.5 million and a corresponding offset in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $1.5 million, net of tax.

Foreign
Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, except for the Company’s Mexican operations whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, are translated at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet
date while income and expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Foreign currency gains and losses resulting from transactions, and the translation of financial statements are recorded in the Company’s
consolidated financial statements based upon the provisions of ASC 830, “Foreign Currency Matters.” The effects of currency exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions and balances of a long-term investment nature are accumulated
and carried as a component of shareholders’ equity. The effects of currency exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions that are denominated in a currency other than an entity’s functional currency are charged or credited to
earnings. Foreign exchange transaction losses recognized in other (expense) income, net were $1.0 million, $1.3 million and $0.4 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Noncontrolling Interests

On January 1, 2009, the Company adopted the amendment under ASC 810 “Consolidation” related to noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial
statements. This amendment establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. The amendment clarifies that a noncontrolling interest should be reported as
equity in the consolidated financial statements and requires net income attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest to be disclosed separately on the face of the consolidated statement of income. The presentation and disclosure
requirements of the amendment require retrospective application to all prior periods presented. In accordance with ASC 810, the Company classified noncontrolling interests as equity on our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of
December 31, 2010 and 2009. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was not material.

Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as net income and all other non-owner changes in shareholders’ equity. The Company’s accumulated other
comprehensive income consists



of foreign currency translation adjustments, foreign currency hedges, foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps, and pension and post retirement related adjustments.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized in accordance with ASC 605 “Revenue Recognition.” Revenue is recognized
when products have been shipped to the respective customers, title has passed and the price for the product has been determined.

The Company recognizes revenues on long-term contracts based on the percentage of completion method of accounting. The units-of-delivery method or other input-based or output-based measures, as
appropriate, are used to measure the progress toward completion of individual contracts. Contract revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised quarterly at a minimum and adjustments are reflected in the accounting period as such amounts are
determined. Provisions are made currently for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts.

Certain pre-production costs
relating to long-term production and supply contracts have been deferred and will be recognized over the life of the contracts. Deferred pre-production costs were $11.9 million and $12.1 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Significant Customers and Concentrations of Credit Risk

The Company’s trade receivables are from rail and
transit industry original equipment manufacturers, Class I railroads, railroad carriers and commercial companies that utilize rail cars in their operations, such as utility and chemical companies. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of the
Company’s consolidated net sales in 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs

All fees
billed to the customer for shipping and handling are classified as a component of net revenues. All costs associated with shipping and handling is classified as a component of cost of sales.

Research and Development

Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. For the years ended
December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company incurred costs of approximately $40.2 million, $42.4 million and $39.0 million, respectively.

Employees

As of December 31, 2010, approximately 28% of the Company’s workforce was covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements are generally effective from 2011
through 2013. Agreements expiring in 2011 cover approximately 11% of the Company’s workforce.

Earnings Per
Share

Basic and diluted earnings per common share is computed in accordance with ASC 260 “Earnings Per Share.” Unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether
paid or unpaid) are participating securities and included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method included in ASC 260-10-55. (See Note 11 “Earnings Per Share” included herein)

Reclassifications

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified, where necessary, to conform to the current year
presentation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual amounts could differ from the estimates. On an ongoing basis, Management reviews its estimates based on currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates.

7.

INTANGIBLES

Goodwill and
other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized. Other intangibles (with definite lives) are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed
annually during the fourth quarter for impairment by applying a fair-value-based test and more frequently when indicators of impairment are present. The fair value was determined using a combination of discounted cash flow analysis and market
multiples based upon historical and projected financial information. Goodwill and indefinite live intangible assets were not impaired at December 31, 2010 and 2009.



Goodwill was $545.8 million and $483.0 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
respectively. The adjustment to preliminary purchase price allocation of $0.5 million to Goodwill is due to Ricon and Unifin. The change in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment for the year ended December 31, 2010 is as follows:

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company’s trademarks had a net carrying amount of $103.5
million and $96.0 million, respectively, and the Company believes these intangibles have an indefinite life. Intangible assets of the Company, other than goodwill and trademarks, consist of the following:

The weighted average useful lives of patents, customer relationships and intellectual property were six
years, 16 years and 17 years respectively. Amortization expense for intangible assets was $10.2 million, $9.8 million, and $5.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

LONG-TERM DEBT

Long-term
debt consisted of the following:



2008 Refinancing Credit Agreement

On November 4, 2008, the Company refinanced its existing unsecured revolving credit agreement with a consortium of commercial banks.
This “2008 Refinancing Credit Agreement” provides the company with a $300 million five-year revolving credit facility and a $200 million five-year term loan facility. The Company incurred $2.9 million of deferred financing cost related to
the 2008 Refinancing Credit Agreement. Both facilities expire in January 2013. The 2008 Refinancing Credit Agreement borrowings bear variable interest rates indexed to the indices described below. At December 31, 2010, the Company had available
bank borrowing capacity, net of $28.9 million of letters of credit, of approximately $137.1 million, subject to certain financial covenant restrictions.

Under the 2008 Refinancing Credit Agreement, the Company may elect a Base Rate of interest or an interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) of interest (“the
Alternate Rate”). The Base Rate adjusts on a daily basis and is the greater of the PNC, N.A. prime rate, 30-day LIBOR plus 150 basis points or the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5% per annum, plus a margin that ranges from 25 to 50
basis points. The Alternate rate is based on quoted LIBOR rates plus a margin that ranges from 125 to 200 basis points. Both the Base Rate and Alternate Rate margins are dependent on the Company’s consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow
ratios. The initial Base Rate margin is 25 basis points and the Alternate Rate margin is 125 basis points. At December 31, 2010 the weighted average interest rate on the Company’s variable rate debt was 1.58%. To reduce the impact of
interest rate changes on a portion of this variable-rate debt, the Company entered into an interest rate swap which effectively converted a portion of the debt from variable to fixed-rate borrowing during the term of the swap contract. On
December 31, 2010, the notional value of the interest rate swaps outstanding was $137.0 million and effectively changed the Company’s interest rate on bank debt at December 31, 2010 from a variable rate to a fixed rate of 2.27%. The
interest rate swap agreements mature at various times through December 2012. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty. However, since only the cash interest payments are exchanged, exposure is
significantly less than the notional amount. The counterparty is a large financial institution with an excellent credit rating and history of performance. The Company currently believes the risk of nonperformance is negligible.

The 2008 Refinancing Credit Agreement limits the Company’s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the Company from
declaring or making other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. The 2008 Refinancing Credit Agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations: incurrence of additional indebtedness; mergers,
consolidations, sales of assets and acquisitions; additional liens; sale and leasebacks; permissible investments, loans and advances; certain debt payments; and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio of 3.0 and a maximum debt to cash flow
ratio of 3.25. The Company is in compliance with these measurements and covenants and expects that these measurements will not be any type of limiting factor in executing our operating activities.

6.875% Senior Notes Due August 2013

In August 2003, the Company issued $150 million of Senior Notes due in 2013 (“the Notes”). The Notes were issued at par. Interest on the Notes accrues at a rate of 6.875% per annum and is
payable semi-annually on January 31 and July 31 of each year. The proceeds were used to repay debt outstanding under the Company’s existing credit agreement, and for general corporate purposes. The principal balance is due in full at
maturity.

The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and rank pari passu with all existing and future senior
debt and senior to all our existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the Company. The indenture under which the Notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things, the following: the incurrence of
indebtedness, payment of dividends and certain distributions, sale of assets, change in control, mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens.



Debt and Capital Leases

Scheduled principal repayments of debt and capital lease balances as of December 31, 2010 are as follows:

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Defined
Benefit Pension Plans

The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans that cover certain U.S., Canadian, German, and
United Kingdom employees and which provide benefits of stated amounts for each year of service of the employee. The Company uses a December 31 measurement date for the U.S., Canadian, German and U.K. plans.



The following tables provide information regarding the Company’s defined benefit
pension plans summarized by U.S. and international components.

Obligations and Funded Status



The aggregate accumulated benefit obligation for the U.S. pension plans was $47.2 million
and $46.5 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The aggregate accumulated benefit obligation for the international pension plans was $131.2 million and $119.0 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Components of Net Periodic Benefit
Costs

Other Changes in Plan Assets and Benefit Obligations Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income during 2010 are as follows:



The weighted average assumptions in the following table represent the rates used to develop
the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation for the year listed and also the net periodic benefit cost for the following year.

The discount rate is based
on settling the pension obligation with high grade, high yield corporate bonds, and the rate of compensation increase is based on actual experience. The expected return on plan assets is based on historical performance as well as expected future
rates of return on plan assets considering the current investment portfolio mix and the long-term investment strategy.

As of
December 31, 2010 the following table represents the amounts included in other comprehensive loss that are expected to be recognized as components of periodic benefit costs in 2011.

Pension Plan Assets

The Company has established formal investment policies for the assets associated with our pension plans. Objectives include maximizing long-term return at acceptable risk levels and diversifying among
asset classes. Asset allocation targets are based on periodic asset liability study results which help determine the appropriate investment strategies. The investment policies permit variances from the targets within certain parameters. The
composition plan assets consist primarily of equity security funds, debt security funds, and temporary cash and cash equivalent investments. The assets held in these funds are generally passively managed and are valued at the net asset value per
share multiplied by the number of shares held as of the measurement date. The balanced fund provides long-term growth and income by investing in a diversified portfolio of approximately 60% equities and 40% bonds. All plan assets are considered
Level 1 based on the fair value valuation hierarchy (See Note 17 “Fair Value Measurement” included herein). Plan assets by asset category at December 31, 2010 and 2009 are as follows:

The U.S. and International pension plans have target asset allocations of 60% equity securities and 40% debt
securities. Investment policies are determined by the respective Plan’s Pension Committee and set forth in its Investment Policy. Rebalancing of the asset allocation occurs on a quarterly basis.



Cash Flows

The Company’s funding methods are based on governmental requirements and differ from those methods used to recognize pension expense. The Company expects to contribute $1.3 million to the U.S. plans
and $5.9 million to the international plans during 2011.

Benefit payments expected to be paid to plan participants are as
follows:

Post Retirement Benefit Plans

In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company has provided certain unfunded postretirement health care and life
insurance benefits for a portion of North American employees. The Company is not obligated to pay health care and life insurance benefits to individuals who had retired prior to 1990.

The Company uses a December 31 measurement date for all post retirement plans. The following tables provide information regarding
the Company’s post retirement benefit plans summarized by U.S. and international components.

The assumed health care cost trend rate for the U.S. plans grades from an initial rate of 7.6% to an
ultimate rate of 4.5% by 2027 and for international plans from 8.4% to 4.5% by 2030. A 1% increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate will increase the service and interest cost components of the expense recognized for the U.S. and
international postretirement plans by approximately $204,000 and $44,000, respectively, for 2011, and increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $3.9 million and $335,000, respectively. A 1% decrease in the assumed
health care cost trend rate will decrease the service and interest cost



components of the expense recognized for the U.S. and international postretirement plans by approximately $173,000 and $37,000, respectively, for 2011, and decrease the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation by approximately $3.3 million and $285,000, respectively.

Cash Flows

Benefit payments expected to be paid to plan participants are as follows:

Defined Contribution Plans

The Company also participates in certain defined contribution plans and multiemployer pension plans. Costs recognized under
these plans are summarized as follows:

The 401(k) savings plan is a participant directed defined contribution plan that holds shares of the
Company’s stock as one of the investment options. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the plan held on behalf of its participants about 433,300 shares with a market value of $22.9 million, and 428,000 shares with a market value of $17.5
million, respectively.

Additionally, the Company has stock option based benefit and other plans further described in Note 12.

INCOME TAXES

The Company
is responsible for filing consolidated U.S., foreign and combined, unitary or separate state income tax returns. The Company is responsible for paying the taxes relating to such returns, including any subsequent adjustments resulting from the
redetermination of such tax liabilities by the applicable taxing authorities. The components of the income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes for the Company’s domestic and foreign operations for the years ended
December 31 are provided below:

No provision has been made for U.S., state, or additional foreign taxes related to undistributed earnings of
$182.9 million of foreign subsidiaries which have been or are intended to be permanently re-invested.



The consolidated provision for income taxes included in the Statement of Income consisted of
the following:

The consolidated income tax provision is included in the Statement of Income as follows:

A reconciliation of the United States federal statutory income tax rate to the effective income tax rate on
continuing operations for the years ended December 31 is provided below:

The effective income tax rate for 2009 included a net tax benefit of approximately $9.7 million which is due
primarily to the settlement of examinations in various tax jurisdictions.

Deferred income taxes result from temporary
differences in the recognition of income and expense for financial and income tax reporting purposes. These deferred income taxes will be recognized as future tax benefits or costs when the temporary differences reverse.



Components of deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:

A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
tax assets will not be realized. State net operating loss carryforwards exist in the amount of $58.3 million and are set to expire in various periods from 2012 to 2031.

Federal and foreign tax credits of approximately $1.8 million related to Research and Development credits have been fully utilized in 2010. State tax credits of approximately $866,000 are available and
consist of various Machinery & Equipment, Research and Development, and Jobs related credits.

As of
December 31, 2010, the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions was $10.0 million, of which $3.1 million, if recognized, would favorably affect the Company’s effective income tax rate. As of December 31,
2009, the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions was $10.0 million, of which $2.6 million, if recognized, would favorably affect the Company’s effective tax rate. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount
of the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions follows:



The Company includes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax
expense. The total interest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 are approximately $3.1 million and $1.7 million, respectively.

The Internal Revenue Service is currently auditing the 2008 and 2009 tax years. With limited exception, the Company is no longer subject to examination by various U.S. and foreign taxing authorities for
years before 2007.

At this time, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits of
approximately $3.4 million may change within the next 12 months due to the expiration of statutory review periods and current examinations.

11.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

The
computation of earnings per share from continuing operations is as follows:

Options to purchase
approximately 15,000, 79,200, and 32,400 shares of Common Stock were outstanding in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options’ exercise price exceeded the
average market price of the common shares.



12.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

As of December 31, 2010, the Company maintains employee stock-based compensation plans for stock options, non-vested restricted stock, and incentive stock awards as governed by the 2000 Stock
Incentive Plan, as amended (the 2000 Plan). As of December 31, 2010, shares available for future grants under the 2000 Plan is 669,795 shares. No awards may be made under the 2000 Plan subsequent to January 31, 2016. The Company also
maintains a Non-Employee Directors’ Fee and Stock Option Plan (Directors Plan).

Stock-based compensation expense was
$11.8 million, $3.6 million and $10.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company recognized associated tax benefits related to the stock-based compensation plans of $3.0 million, $1.6 million and
$3.3 million for the respective periods. Included in the stock-based compensation expense for 2010 above is $2.2 million of expense related to stock options, $3.7 million related to non-vested restricted stock, $5.0 million related to incentive
stock awards and $900,000 related to awards issued for Directors’ fees. At December 31, 2010, unamortized compensation expense related to those stock options, non-vested restricted shares and incentive stock awards expected to vest totaled
$13.6 million and will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.3 years.

Stock Options

Under the 2000 Plan,
stock options are granted to eligible employees at the fair market value, which is the average of the high and low Wabtec stock price on the date of grant. Generally, the options become exercisable over a three or four year vesting period and expire
ten years from the date of grant.

The Directors Plan, as amended, authorizes a total of 500,000 shares of Common Stock to be
issued. Generally, options issued under the plan become exercisable over a three-year vesting period and expire ten years from the date of grant and restricted stock issued under the plan vests one year from the date of grant. In addition, as
compensation for directors’ fees, a total of 13,500 shares have been awarded to non-employee directors for each of the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. No awards may be made under the plan subsequent to October 31, 2016. As
compensation for directors’ fees for the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company issued a total of 18,302 shares of restricted stock to non-employee directors. The total number of shares issued under the plan as of December 31, 2010
was 380,302 shares.

The following table summarizes the Company’s stock option activity and related information for both
the 2000 Plan and Directors Plan for the years ended December 31:



Options outstanding at December 31, 2010 were as follows:

The fair value of
each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

The dividend yield is
based on the Company’s dividend rate and the current market price of the underlying common stock at the date of grant. Expected life in years is determined from historical stock option exercise data. Expected volatility is based on the
historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury bond rates for the expected life of the option.

Non-Vested Restricted Stock and Incentive Stock Awards

Under the 2000 Plan, eligible employees are granted non-vested restricted stock that generally vest over three or four years from the date of
grant. In addition, the Company has issued incentive stock awards to eligible employees that vest upon attainment of certain cumulative three year performance goals. The incentive stock awards included in the table below represent the maximum number
of shares that may ultimately vest. As of December 31, 2010, based on the Company’s performance, we estimate that the majority of these stock awards will vest and have recorded compensation expense accordingly. If our estimate of the
number of these stock awards expected to vest changes in a future accounting period, compensation expense could be reduced and will be recognized over the remaining vesting period.



The following table summarizes the non-vested restricted stock and incentive stock awards
activity and related information for both the 2000 Plan and Directors Plan for the years ended December 31:

Compensation expense for the non-vested restricted stock and incentive stock awards is based on the closing
price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant and recognized over the applicable vesting period.

PREFERRED STOCK

The
Company’s authorized capital stock includes 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The Board of Directors has the authority to issue the preferred stock and to fix the designations, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such class
or series, including dividend rates, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption and liquidation preferences, without any further vote or action by the Company’s shareholders. The rights and preferences of the preferred stock would be
superior to those of the common stock. At December 31, 2010 and 2009 there was no preferred stock issued or outstanding.

17.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

ASC 820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and
explains the related disclosure requirements. ASC 820 indicates, among other things, that a fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in
the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability and defines fair value based upon an exit price model.

Valuation Hierarchy.

ASC 820 establishes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to valuation used to measure fair value. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as
follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on the Company’s assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities
at fair value. A financial asset or liability’s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.



The following table provides the liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring
basis as of December 31, 2010, which are included in other current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance sheet:

The following table
provides the asset carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2009, which is included in other current assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance sheet:

As a result of our
global operating activities the Company is exposed to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial position. When deemed appropriate, the Company minimizes these risks
through entering into foreign currency forward contracts. The foreign currency forward contracts are valued using broker quotations, or market transactions in either the listed or over-the counter markets. As such, these derivative instruments are
classified within level 2.

The Company’s defined benefit pension plan assets consist primarily of equity security funds,
debt security funds and temporary cash and cash equivalent investments. All plan assets are considered Level 1 based on the fair value valuation hierarchy (See Note 9 “Employee Benefit Plans” included herein).

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company is subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the
remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances. The Company believes its operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business;
however, there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements.

Under terms of the purchase agreement and related documents for the 1990 Acquisition, American Standard, Inc., now known as Trane (“Trane”), has indemnified the Company for certain items
including, among other things, certain environmental claims the Company asserted prior to 2000. If Trane was unable to honor or meet these indemnifications, the Company would be responsible for such items. In the opinion of Management, Trane
currently has the ability to meet its indemnification obligations.

Claims have been filed against the Company and certain of
its affiliates in various jurisdictions across the United States by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing products. Most of these claims have been made against our wholly owned subsidiary, Railroad Friction
Products Corporation (RFPC), and are based on a product sold by RFPC prior to the time that the Company acquired any interest in RFPC.



Most of these claims, including all of the RFPC claims, are submitted to insurance carriers
for defense and indemnity or to non-affiliated companies that retain the liabilities for the asbestos-containing products at issue. We cannot, however, assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors or
insurers will remain financially viable. Our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims, as is the case with other pending litigation, cannot be estimated.

It is Management’s belief that the potential range of loss for asbestos-related bodily injury cases is not reasonably determinable
at present due to a variety of factors, including: (1) the asbestos case settlement history of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, RFPC; (2) the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation in general; and (3) the
uncertainty of asbestos litigation in particular. Despite this uncertainty, and although the results of the Company’s operations and cash flows for any given period could be adversely affected by asbestos-related lawsuits, Management believes
that the final resolution of the Company’s asbestos-related cases will not be material to the Company’s overall financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In general, this belief is based upon: (1) Wabtec’s and
RFPC’s history of settlements and dismissals of asbestos-related cases to date; (2) the inability of many plaintiffs to establish any exposure or causal relationship to RFPC’s product; and (3) the inability of many plaintiffs to
demonstrate any identifiable injury or compensable loss.

More specifically, as to RFPC, Management’s belief that any
losses due to asbestos-related cases would not be material is also based on the fact that RFPC owns insurance which provides coverage for asbestos-related bodily injury claims. To date, RFPC’s insurers have provided RFPC with defense and
indemnity in these actions. The overall number of new claims being filed against RFPC has dropped significantly in recent years; however, these new claims, and all previously filed claims, may take a significant period of time to resolve. As to
Wabtec and its divisions, Management’s belief that asbestos-related cases will not have a material impact is also based on its position that it has no legal liability for asbestos-related bodily injury claims, and that the former owners of
Wabtec’s assets retained asbestos liabilities for the products at issue. To date, Wabtec has been able to successfully defend itself on this basis, including two arbitration decisions and a judicial opinion, all of which confirmed Wabtec’s
position that it did not assume any asbestos liabilities from the former owners of certain Wabtec assets. Although Wabtec has incurred defense and administrative costs in connection with asbestos bodily injury actions, these costs have not been
material, and the Company has no information that would suggest these costs would become material in the foreseeable future.

The Company is subject to a RCRA Part B Closure Permit (“the Permit”) issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and
the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, Division of Environmental Quality relating to the monitoring and treatment of groundwater contamination on, and adjacent to, the MotivePower Inc. (Boise, Idaho) facility. In compliance with the Permit, the
Company has completed an accelerated plan for the treatment of contaminated groundwater, and continues onsite and offsite monitoring for hazardous constituents. Reflected in the commitments and contingencies line of the consolidated balance sheet,
the Company has accruals of approximately $571,000 at December 31, 2010, the estimated remaining costs for remediation and monitoring. The Company was in compliance with the Permit at December 31, 2010.

Foster Wheeler Energy Corporation (FWEC), the seller of the Mountaintop, Pennsylvania property to the predecessor of one of the
Company’s subsidiaries in 1989, agreed to indemnify the Company’s predecessor and its successors and assigns against certain identified environmental liabilities for which FWEC executed a Consent Order Agreement with the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) and EPA. Management believes that this indemnification arrangement is enforceable for the benefit of the Company and that FWEC has the financial resources to honor its obligations under this
indemnification arrangement.

Prior to the Company’s acquisition of Young Radiator, Young agreed to clean up alleged
contamination on a prior production site in Mattoon, Illinois. The Company has completed the remediation of the site under the state’s voluntary cleanup program and has obtained closure certification for the site from the State of Illinois.

Young ceased manufacturing operations at its Racine, Wisconsin facility in the early 1990s. Investigations prior to the
acquisition of Young revealed some levels of contamination on the Racine property. The Company



has completed a comprehensive site evaluation and implemented a groundwater remediation program under Wisconsin’s voluntary remediation program. Site monitoring is being conducted to
demonstrate attainment of Wisconsin’s cleanup requirements. The Company believes the regulating authority is generally in agreement with the selected remediation approach and findings presented to-date.

Reflected in the commitments and contingencies line of the consolidated balance sheet, the Company has reserves of $369,000 at
December 31, 2010, relating to certain sales leaseback transactions, for locomotives that were assumed in connection with the MotivePower merger in 1999.

On October 18, 2007, Faiveley Transport Malmo AB (“Faiveley Malmo”) filed a request for arbitration with the International Chamber of Commerce alleging breach of contract and trade secret
violations relating to the Company’s manufacture and sale of certain components. The components at issue are limited in number and used in the transit industry. On that same day, Faiveley Malmo also filed a related proceeding against the
Company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (“Federal Court”), requesting a preliminary injunction in aid of the arbitration. In both forums, Faiveley sought to prevent the Company from manufacturing
and selling the subject components until the arbitration panel decides Faiveley’s claim. In the arbitration, Faiveley also sought monetary damages.

In the Federal Court action, Faiveley Malmo’s request for a preliminary injunction was initially granted, in part, on August 22, 2008. That injunction was vacated by the appellate court on
March 9, 2009, and the case was remanded to the District Court for further proceedings. On remand, Faiveley Malmo renewed its request for injunctive relief. The District Court denied that request on August 31, 2009, and Faiveley Malmo
appealed that denial to the appellate court. Faiveley Malmo later voluntarily dismissed that appeal.

In the international
arbitration proceeding, Faiveley Malmo originally alleged $128 million in damages, but later reduced its claim to $91 million in damages. The Company has stated that Faiveley Malmo’s claims were grossly overstated, not supported by the facts or
circumstances surrounding the case, and frivolous in most respects. An ICC International Court of Arbitration Arbitral Tribunal heard the case during the first half of 2009 and issued an award dated December 21, 2009. Pursuant to the Award, the
Company was required to make a $3.9 million royalty payment to Faiveley Malmo, with respect to Faiveley Malmo’s claims against the Company alleging breach of contract and trade secret violations. Faiveley Malmo’s parent company, Faiveley
Transport, stated that other Faiveley entities were considering filing claims against the Company arising from the same allegations.

On May 14, 2010, Faiveley Transport USA, Inc., Faiveley Transport Nordic AB, Faiveley Transport Amiens S.A.S, and Ellcon National, Inc. filed a complaint against Wabtec Corporation in the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York. That complaint was amended on June 8, 2010. The claims in the amended complaint include misappropriation of trade secrets, unfair competition, tortious interference with prospective business
relations, tortious interference with prospective economic advantage, and unjust enrichment. On June 25, 2010, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the Faiveley entities’ amended complaint in its entirety. That motion to dismiss was
denied. In November 2010, the plaintiffs asserted a claim for $17.2 million in compensatory and other unspecified damages. The Company is vigorously contesting all claims and does not believe that they would result in any material legal liability.
On December 10, 2010 the Company filed a motion for summary judgment and the plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment. Briefing on those motions was completed on December 29, 2010 and oral argument was heard on
January 7, 2011. Trial is scheduled to begin on June 13, 2011

From time to time the Company is involved in
litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations in the ordinary course of business. As of the date hereof, the Company is involved in no litigation that the Company believes will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition,
results of operations or liquidity.
