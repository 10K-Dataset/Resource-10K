PART I

Item 1.

BUSINESS

General

Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation, doing business as Wabtec Corporation, is a Delaware corporation with headquarters at 1001
Air Brake Avenue in Wilmerding, Pennsylvania. Our telephone number is 412-825-1000, and our website is located at

www.wabtec.com

. All references to “we”, “our”, “us”, the “Company” and
“Wabtec” refer to Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries. Westinghouse Air Brake Company (“WABCO”) was formed in 1990 when it acquired certain assets and operations from American Standard, Inc., now
known as Trane (“Trane”). In 1999, WABCO merged with MotivePower Industries, Inc. (“MotivePower”) and adopted the name Wabtec.

Today, Wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of value-added, technology-based equipment and services for the global rail industry. We believe we hold approximately a 50% market share in
North America for our primary braking-related equipment and a leading position in North America for most of our other product lines. Our highly engineered products, which are intended to enhance safety, improve productivity and reduce maintenance
costs for customers, can be found on virtually all U.S. locomotives, freight cars, subway cars and buses. In 2012, the Company had sales of approximately $2.4 billion and net income of about $251.7 million. In 2012 sales of aftermarket parts and
services represented about 54% of total sales, while sales to customers outside of the U.S. accounted for about 50% of total sales.

Industry Overview

The
Company primarily serves the worldwide freight rail and passenger transit industries. As such, our operating results are largely dependent on the level of activity, financial condition and capital spending plans of the global railroad and transit
industries. Many factors influence these industries, including general economic conditions; rail traffic, as measured by freight tonnage and passenger ridership; government spending on public transportation; and investment in new technologies by
freight rail and passenger transit systems.

According to a recent study by UNIFE, the Association of the European Rail
Industry, the accessible global market for railway products and services is more than $100.0 billion, and it is expected to grow at 2%-2.5% annually through 2016. The three largest markets, which represent about 75% of the total market, are Europe,
Asia-Pacific and North America.

In North America, railroads carry about 40% of intercity freight, as measured by ton-miles,
which is more than any other mode of transportation. They are an integral part of the continent’s economy and transportation system, serving nearly every industrial, wholesale and retail sector. Through direct ownership and operating
partnerships, U.S. railroads are part of an integrated network that includes railroads in Canada and Mexico, forming what is regarded as the world’s most-efficient and lowest-cost freight rail service. There are more than 500 railroads
operating in North America, with the largest railroads, referred to as “Class I,” accounting for more than 90% of the industry’s revenues. Although the railroads carry a wide variety of commodities and goods, coal is the
single-largest item, representing about 40% of carloadings in 2012. Intermodal traffic—the movement of trailers or containers by rail in combination with another mode of transportation—has been the railroads’ fastest-growing market
segment in the past 10 years. Railroads operate in a competitive environment, especially with the trucking industry, and are always seeking ways to improve safety, cost and reliability. New technologies offered by Wabtec and others in the industry
can provide some of these benefits.

Demand for our freight related products and services in North America is driven by a
number of factors, including:

•

Rail traffic.

The Association of American Railroads (“AAR”) compiles statistics that gauge the level of activity in the freight rail
industry. Two important statistics are revenue ton-miles and carloadings,



which are generally referred to as “rail traffic”. In 2012, U.S. revenue ton-miles decreased 2.4%, carloadings decreased 3.1%, and intermodal carloadings increased 3.2%, generally
reflecting a sluggish economy and reduced coal traffic.

•

Demand for new locomotives.

Currently, the active locomotive fleet for Class I railroads in North America is about 24,000. The average
number of new locomotives delivered in recent years has been about 1,100 annually. In 2012, about 1,300 new, heavy-haul locomotives were delivered, compared to about 1,075 in 2011.

•

Demand for new freight cars

. Currently, the active freight car fleet in North America is about 1.3 million. The average number of new
freight cars delivered over the past 10 years was about 49,000 annually. In 2012, about 59,000 new freight cars were delivered, compared to about 48,000 cars in 2011.

In the U.S., the passenger transit industry is dependent largely on funding from federal, state and local governments, and from fare box
revenues. With about 40% of the nation’s passenger transit vehicles, the New York City region is the largest passenger transit market in the U.S., but most major cities also offer either rail or bus transit services.

Demand for North American passenger transit products is driven by a number of factors, including:

•

Government funding.

The U.S. federal government provides money to local transit authorities, primarily to fund the purchase of new equipment and
infrastructure for their transit systems. In 2012, the U.S. Congress passed a new, two-year funding bill, which maintained spending at the same level, about $10.7 billion, as in prior years. The number of new transit cars delivered in 2012 was about
1,000, compared to about 850 in 2011. The number of new buses delivered in 2012 was about 4,500 compared to about 4,700 in 2011. In the past 10 years, the average number of new transit cars delivered annually is about 900, and the average
number of new buses delivered annually is about 4,700.

•

Ridership

. Ridership provides fare box revenues to transit authorities, which use these funds, along with state and local money, primarily for
equipment and system maintenance. Based on preliminary figures from the American Public Transportation Association, ridership on U.S. transit vehicles increased about 2.5% in 2012, after a 2% increase in 2011.

Outside of North America, many of the rail systems have historically been focused on passenger transit, rather than freight. In recent
years, however, railroads in countries such as Australia, Brazil, India and China have been investing capital to expand and improve both their freight and passenger rail systems. Throughout the world, some government-owned railroads are being sold
to private owners, who often look to improve the efficiency of the rail system by investing in new equipment and new technologies. According to UNIFE, emerging markets are expected to grow at above-average rates as global trade creates increases in
freight volumes and urbanization leads to increased demand for efficient mass-transportation systems. As this growth occurs, Wabtec expects to have additional opportunities to provide products and services in these markets.

In Europe, the majority of the rail system serves the passenger transit market, which is expected to continue growing as high fuel costs
and environmental factors encourage investment in public mass transit. France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Italy are the largest transit markets, representing about two-thirds of passenger traffic in the European Union. In its most recent
financial report, Deutsche Bahn (German national railway) reported an increase in passenger traffic of 4.0% for the first six months of 2012. About 75% of freight traffic in Europe is hauled by truck, while rail accounts for about 20%. The largest
freight markets in Europe are Germany, Poland and the United Kingdom. In the first half of 2012, Deutsche Bahn reported a 2.6% decrease in freight-related revenues compared to the same period in 2011. According to UNIFE, the European rail market
consists of about 33,000 locomotives, about 700,000 freight cars and about 150,000 passenger transit cars. In recent years, the European market purchased on average about 1,300 new locomotives, about 1,000 new freight cars and about 8,500 new
passenger transit cars annually.



The Asia/Pacific market is now the second-largest geographic segment, according to a recent
UNIFE study. This market consists primarily of China, India and Australia. Growth has been driven by the continued urbanization of China and India, and by investment in freight rail infrastructure to serve the mining and natural resources markets in
those countries, as well as in Australia. According to UNIFE, this market consists of about 34,000 locomotives and about 1.0 million freight cars. China is expected to increase spending on rail infrastructure and equipment in 2013. The Indian
government reported that in the first nine months of its fiscal 2012 freight rail traffic increased about 4% and passenger rail traffic increased about 3%. India is expected to increase spending significantly in 2013 as it seeks to modernize its
rail system.

Business Segments and Products

We provide our products and services through two principal business segments, the Freight Segment and the Transit Segment, both of which have different market characteristics and business drivers.

The Freight Segment primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing locomotive and freight cars ,
supplies railway electronics, positive train control equipment, signal design and engineering services, builds switcher locomotives, rebuilds freight locomotives and provides heat exchangers and cooling systems for rail and other industrial markets.
Customers include large, publicly traded railroads, leasing companies, manufacturers of original equipment such as locomotives and freight cars, and utilities. As discussed previously, demand in the freight market is primarily driven by rail
traffic, and deliveries of new locomotives and freight cars. In 2012, the Freight Segment accounted for 63% of our total sales, with about 70% of its sales in North America and the remainder to international customers. In 2012, slightly less than
half of the Freight Segment’s sales were in aftermarket.

The Transit Segment primarily manufactures and services
components for new and existing passenger transit vehicles, typically subway cars and buses, builds new commuter locomotives and refurbishes subway cars. Customers include public transit authorities and municipalities, leasing companies, and
manufacturers of subway cars and buses around the world. As discussed previously, demand in the transit market is primarily driven by government funding at all levels and passenger ridership. In 2012, the Transit Segment accounted for 37% of our
total sales, with about 54% of its sales in North America and the remainder to international customers. About two-thirds of the Transit Segment’s sales are in the aftermarket with the remainder in the original equipment market.

Following is a summary of our leading product lines in both aftermarket and original equipment across both of our business segments:

We have become a leader in the rail industry by capitalizing on the strength of our existing products, technological capabilities and new product innovation, and by our ability to harden products to
protect them from severe conditions, including extreme temperatures and high-vibration environments. Supported by our technical staff of over 1,120 engineers and specialists, we have extensive experience in a broad range of product lines, which
enables us to provide comprehensive, systems-based solutions for our customers.

Over the past several
years, we introduced a number of significant new products, including electronic braking equipment and train control equipment that encompasses onboard digital data and global positioning communication protocols. In 2007, for example, the Federal
Railroad Administration (FRA) approved the use of our Electronic Train Management System

®

, which offers safety
benefits to the rail industry. In 2008, the U.S. federal government enacted a rail safety bill that mandates the use of Positive Train Control (“PTC”) technology, which includes on-board locomotive computer and related software, on a
majority of the locomotives and track in the U.S. With our Electronic Train Management System

®

, we are the
leading supplier of this on-board train control equipment, and we are working with the U.S. Class I railroads, commuter rail authorities and other industry suppliers to implement this technology by the December 31, 2015 deadline set in the rail
safety bill. As part of its new surface transportation funding bill, a House committee has proposed extending this deadline.

In 2012, Wabtec recorded about $215 million of revenue from implementation of PTC projects both foreign and domestic. These multi-year
projects include: A $165 million contract to design and install a train control system for MRS Logistica, the fourth-largest railroad in Brazil; a $63 million contract to provide train control equipment and services for Denver Transit Partners for
three new commuter rail lines; and a $27 million contract to provide train control equipment for Metrolink, a commuter rail agency in Los Angeles.

For additional information on our business segments, see Note 19 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.

Competitive Strengths

Our key strengths include:

•

Leading market positions in core products

. Dating back to 1869 and George Westinghouse’s invention of the air brake, we are an established
leader in the development and manufacture of pneumatic braking equipment for freight and passenger transit vehicles. We have leveraged our leading position by focusing on research and engineering to expand beyond pneumatic braking components to
supplying integrated parts and assemblies for the locomotive through the end of the train. We are a recognized



leader in the development and production of electronic recording, measuring and communications systems, positive train control equipment, highly engineered compressors and heat exchangers for
locomotives, and a leading manufacturer of freight car components, including electronic braking equipment, draft gears, trucks, brake shoes and electronic end-of-train devices. We are also the leading manufacturer of commuter locomotives and a
leading provider of braking equipment, door assemblies, lifts and ramps, and couplers for passenger transit vehicles.

•

Breadth of product offering with a stable mix of original equipment market (OEM) and aftermarket business

. Our product portfolio is one of the
broadest in the rail industry, as we offer a wide selection of quality parts, components and assemblies across the entire train. We provide our products in both the original equipment market and the aftermarket. Our substantial installed base of
products with end-users such as the railroads and the passenger transit authorities is a significant competitive advantage for providing products and services to the aftermarket because these customers often look to purchase safety- and
performance-related replacement parts from the original equipment components supplier. In addition, as OEMs and Class I railroad operators attempt to modernize fleets with new products designed to improve and maintain safety and efficiency, these
products must be designed to be interoperable with existing equipment. Over the last several years, more than 50% of our total net sales have come from our aftermarket products and services business.

•

Leading design and engineering capabilities

. We believe a hallmark of our relationship with our customers has been our leading design and
engineering practice, which has, in our opinion, assisted in the improvement and modernization of global railway equipment. We believe both our customers and the government authorities value our technological capabilities and commitment to
innovation, as we seek not only to enhance the efficiency and profitability of our customers, but also to improve the overall safety of the railways through continuous improvement of product performance. The Company has an established record of
product improvements and new product development. We have assembled a wide range of patented products, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage. Wabtec currently owns over 1,475 active patents worldwide and over 520 U.S. patents.
During the last three years, we have filed for more than 175 patents worldwide in support of our new and evolving product lines.

•

Experience with industry regulatory requirements.

The U.S. rail industry is governed by the AAR and by the FRA. These groups mandate rigorous
manufacturer certification, new product testing and approval processes that we believe are difficult for new entrants to meet cost-effectively and efficiently without the scale and extensive experience we possess.

•

Experienced management team and the Wabtec Performance System

. The Company has implemented numerous initiatives that enable us to manage
successfully through cycles in the rail supply market. For example, the Wabtec Performance System (WPS), an ongoing program that focuses on lean manufacturing principles and continuous improvement across all aspects of our business, has been a part
of the Company’s culture for more than 20 years. As a result, our management team has improved our cost structure, operating leverage and financial flexibility, and placed the Company in an excellent position to benefit from growth
opportunities.

Business strategy

Using WPS, we strive to generate sufficient cash to invest in our growth strategies and to build on what we consider to be a leading position as a low-cost producer in the industry while maintaining
world-class product quality, technology and customer responsiveness. Through WPS and employee-directed initiatives such as Kaizen, a Japanese-developed team concept, we continuously strive to improve quality, delivery and productivity, and to reduce
costs. These efforts enable us to streamline processes, improve product reliability and customer satisfaction, reduce product cycle times and respond more rapidly to market developments. Over time,



these lean initiatives have enabled us to increase operating margins, improve cash flow and strengthen our ability to invest in the following growth strategies:

•

Expand globally and into new product markets

. We believe that international markets represent a significant opportunity for future growth. In
2012, sales to non-U.S. customers were $1.1 billion, including export sales from the Company’s U.S. operations of $579.6 million. We intend to increase our existing international sales through strategic acquisitions, direct sales of products
through our existing subsidiaries and licensees, and joint ventures with railway suppliers which have a strong presence in their local markets. We are specifically targeting markets that operate significant fleets of U.S.-style locomotives and
freight cars, including Australia, Brazil, China, India, Russia, South Africa, and other select areas within Europe and South America. In addition, we have opportunities to sell certain products that we currently manufacture for the rail industry
into other industrial markets, such as mining, off-highway and energy. These products include heat exchangers and friction materials.

•

Expand aftermarket sales

. Historically, aftermarket sales are less cyclical than OEM sales because a certain level of aftermarket maintenance
and service work must be performed, even during an industry slowdown. In 2012, Wabtec’s aftermarket sales and services represented approximately 54% of the Company’s total sales across both our business segments. Wabtec provides
aftermarket parts and services for its components, and the Company is seeking to expand this business with new customers such as short-line and regional railroads, or with customers who currently perform the work in-house. In this way, we expect to
take advantage of the rail industry trend toward outsourcing, as railroads and transit authorities focus on their core function of transporting goods and people

.

•

Accelerate new product development

. We continue to emphasize research and development funding to create new and improved products. We are
focusing on technological advances, especially in the areas of electronics, braking products and other on-board equipment, as a means of new product growth. We seek to provide customers with incremental technological advances that offer immediate
benefits with cost-effective investments. In 2008, the U.S. federal government enacted a rail safety bill that mandates the use of PTC technology on a majority of the locomotives and track in the U.S. As the leading supplier of on-board train
control equipment, Wabtec is working with the U.S. Class I railroads, commuter rail authorities and other industry suppliers to implement this technology.

•

Seek acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances

. We are exploring acquisition, joint venture and alliance opportunities using a disciplined,
selective approach and rigorous financial criteria. Such acquisitions will not only be expected to meet these financial criteria but also achieve our growth strategies of global expansion, new products and expanding aftermarket sales. All of these
expansion strategies will help Wabtec to grow profitably, expand geographically, and dampen the impact from potential cycles in the North American rail industry.

Recent Acquisitions and Joint Ventures

Wabtec has completed certain
significant acquisitions in support of its growth strategies mentioned above:

•

On January 31, 2013, Wabtec acquired Napier Turbochargers Ltd., a UK-based provider of turbochargers and related parts for the worldwide power
generation and marine markets, for a net purchase price of approximately $112.5 million, net of cash.

•

October 2012, Wabtec acquired LH Group, a UK-based provider of maintenance and overhaul services for the passenger transit market, for a net purchase
price of approximately $47.8 million.

•

July 2012, Wabtec acquired Winco Equipamentos Ltda., a Brazil-based marketing and sales company and provider of freight car components with
capabilities including value-added engineering and assembly, service, and technical support and logistics, for an initial net purchase price of approximately $3.7 million.

•

July 2012, the Company acquired Tec Tran Corp. and its affiliates, the only U.S. owned manufacturer of hydraulic braking systems for transit cars, for
a net purchase price of approximately $8.3 million.



•

June 2012, we acquired Mors Smitt Holding, a leading manufacturer of electronic components for rail and industrial markets with operations in the
Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the U.S., France, China, and Hong Kong, for a net purchase price of $90.0 million.

•

November 2011, Wabtec acquired Fulmer Company, a leading manufacturer of motor components for rail, power generation and other industrial markets, for
a net purchase price of approximately $13.6 million.

•

November 2011, Wabtec acquired Bearward Engineering, a UK-based manufacturer of cooling systems and related equipment for power generation and other
industrial markets, for a net purchase price of approximately $43.6 million.

•

June 2011, we acquired an aftermarket transit parts business from GE Transportation, a parts supply business for propulsion and control systems for the
passenger transit car aftermarket in North America, for a net purchase price of $21.1 million.

•

February 2011, the Company acquired Brush Traction Group, a UK-based provider of locomotive overhauls, services and aftermarket components, for a net
purchase price of approximately $30.7 million.

Backlog

The Company’s backlog was about $1.66 billion at December 31, 2012. For 2012, about 54% of total sales came from aftermarket
orders, which typically carry lead times of less than 30 days, and are not recorded in backlog for a significant period of time.

The Company’s contracts are subject to standard industry cancellation provisions, including cancellations on short notice or upon completion of designated stages. Substantial scope-of-work
adjustments are common. For these and other reasons, completion of the Company’s backlog may be delayed or cancelled. The railroad industry, in general, has historically been subject to fluctuations due to overall economic conditions and the
level of use of alternative modes of transportation.

The backlog of firm customer orders as of December 31, 2012 and
December 31, 2011, and the expected year of completion are as follows:

Engineering and Development

To execute our strategy to develop new products, we invest in a variety of engineering and development activities. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, we invested about
$41.3 million, $37.2 million and $40.2 million, respectively, on product development and improvement activities. The engineering resources of the Company are allocated between research and development activities and the execution of original
equipment customer contracts.

Our engineering and development program is largely focused upon train control and new braking
technologies, with an emphasis on applying electronics to traditional pneumatic equipment. Electronic braking has been used in the transit industry for years, and freight railroads are conducting pilot programs to test its



reliability and benefits. Freight railroads have generally been slower to accept the technology due to issues over interoperability, connectivity and durability. We are proceeding with efforts to
enhance the major components for existing hard-wired braking equipment and development of new electronic technologies for the freight railroads. Sometimes we conduct specific research projects in conjunction with universities, customers and other
railroad product suppliers.

We use our Product Development System (PDS) to develop and monitor new product programs. The
system requires the product development team to follow consistent steps throughout the development process, from concept to launch, to ensure the product will meet customer expectations and internal profitability targets.

Intellectual Property

We have more than 1,475 active patents worldwide. We also rely on a combination of trade secrets and other intellectual property laws,
nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our intellectual property.

Certain trademarks, among them the name WABCO

®

, were acquired or
licensed from American Standard Inc., now known as Trane, in 1990 at the time of our acquisition of the North American operations of the Railway Products Group of Trane. Other trademarks have been developed through the normal course of business, or
acquired as a part of our ongoing merger and acquisition program.

We have entered into a variety of license agreements as
licensor and licensee. We do not believe that any single license agreement is of material importance to our business or either of our business segments as a whole.

We have issued licenses to the two sole suppliers of railway air brakes and related products in Japan, Nabtesco and Mitsubishi Electric Company. The licensees pay annual license fees to us and also assist
us by acting as liaisons with key Japanese passenger transit vehicle builders for projects in North America. We believe that our relationships with these licensees have been beneficial to our core transit business and customer relationships in North
America.

Customers

Our customers include railroads and passenger transit authorities throughout North America, as well as in the United Kingdom, Australia, Europe, Asia, South Africa and South America; manufacturers of
transportation equipment, such as locomotives, freight cars, subway vehicles and buses; and lessors of such equipment.

In
2012, about 50% of sales were to customers outside the U.S. and to more than 100 countries throughout the world. About 54% of sales were in the aftermarket, with a majority of our remaining sales to OEMs of locomotives, freight cars, subway vehicles
and buses.

Top customers can change from year to year. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, our top five
customers accounted for 16% of net sales: General Electric Transportation, MRS Logistica S.A., National Steel Car Limited, Trinity Industries, and The Greenbrier Companies. No one customer represents 10% or more of consolidated sales. We believe
that we have strong relationships with all of our key customers.

Competition

We believe that we hold approximately a 50% market share in North America for our primary braking-related equipment and a leading market
position in North America for most of our other product lines. On a global basis, our market shares are smaller. We operate in a highly competitive marketplace. Price competition is strong because we have a relatively small number of customers and
they are very cost-conscious.

In addition to price, competition is based on product performance and technological leadership,
quality, reliability of delivery, and customer service and support.



Our principal competitors vary across product lines. Within North America, New York Air
Brake Company, a subsidiary of the German air brake producer Knorr-Bremse AG (“Knorr”) and Amsted Rail Company, Inc., a subsidiary of Amsted Industries Corporation, are our principal overall OEM competitors. Our competition for locomotive,
freight and passenger transit service and repair is mostly from the railroads’ and passenger transit authorities’ in-house operations, Electro-Motive Diesel, GE Transportation Systems, and New York Air Brake/Knorr. We believe our key
strengths, which include leading market positions in core products, breadth of product offering with a stable mix of OEM and aftermarket business, leading design and engineering capabilities, significant barriers to entry and an experienced
management team, enable us to compete effectively in this marketplace. Outside of North America, no individual company is our principal competitor in all our operating locations. Largest competitors for Brake and Transit products are Faiveley
Transport and Knorr.

Employees

At December 31, 2012, we had 9,253 full-time employees, approximately 27% of whom were unionized. A majority of the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements are within North America and
these agreements are generally effective from 2013 through 2015. Agreements expiring at various times during 2013 cover approximately 16% of the Company’s workforce. We consider our relations with employees and union representatives to be good,
but cannot assure that future contract negotiations will be favorable to us.

Regulation

In the course of our operations, we are subject to various regulations of agencies and other entities. In the United States, these include
principally the FRA and the AAR. The FRA administers and enforces federal laws and regulations relating to railroad safety. These regulations govern equipment and safety standards for freight cars and other rail equipment used in interstate
commerce. The AAR oversees a wide variety of rules and regulations governing safety and design of equipment, relationships among railroads with respect to railcars in interchange and other matters. The AAR also certifies railcar builders and
component manufacturers that provide equipment for use on railroads in the United States. New products generally must undergo AAR testing and approval processes. As a result of these regulations and those stipulated in other countries in which we
derive our revenues, we must maintain certain certifications as a component manufacturer and for products we sell.

Item 1A.

RISK FACTORS

Prolonged unfavorable
economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business.

Unfavorable general economic and market conditions
in the United States and internationally could have a negative impact on our sales and operations. To the extent that these factors result in continued instability of capital markets, shortages of raw materials or component parts, longer sales
cycles, deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

We are dependent upon key customers.

We rely on several key
customers who represent a significant portion of our business. Our top customers can change from year to year. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, our top five customers accounted for 16% of our net sales. While we believe our
relationships with our customers are generally good, our top customers could choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with us. In addition, many of our customers place orders for products on an as-needed basis and operate in cyclical
industries. As a result, their order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future. Such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers, and may be subject to delays and cancellations.
As a result of our dependence on our key customers, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition if we lost any one or more of our key customers or if there is a reduction in their
demand for our products.

Our business operates in a highly competitive industry.

We operate in a competitive marketplace and face substantial competition from a limited number of established competitors in the United
States and abroad, some of which may have greater financial resources than we do. Price competition is strong and, coupled with the existence of a number of cost conscious customers, has historically limited our ability to increase prices. In
addition to price, competition is based on product performance and technological leadership, quality, reliability of delivery and customer service and support. There can be no assurance that competition in one or more of our markets will not
adversely affect us and our results of operations.

We intend to pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances that involve a number
of inherent risks, any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits.

One aspect of our business strategy
is to selectively pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances that we believe will improve our market position, and provide opportunities to realize operating synergies. These transactions involve inherent risks and uncertainties, any one of
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition including:

•

difficulties in achieving identified financial and operating synergies, including the integration of operations, services and products;

•

diversion of Management’s attention from other business concerns;

•

the assumption of unknown liabilities; and

•

unanticipated changes in the market conditions, business and economic factors affecting such an acquisition.

We cannot assure that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions, joint ventures or other business combinations. If we are
unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to consummate strategic acquisitions, we may be unable to fully implement our business strategy, and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result. In addition, our
ability to engage in strategic acquisitions will be dependent on our ability to raise substantial capital, and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement our acquisition strategy on terms satisfactory to us, if at all.



As we introduce new products and services, a failure to predict and react to consumer demand could
adversely affect our business.

We have dedicated significant resources to the development, manufacturing and marketing
of new products. Decisions to develop and market new transportation products are typically made without firm indications of customer acceptance. Moreover, by their nature, new products may require alteration of existing business methods or threaten
to displace existing equipment in which our customers may have a substantial capital investment. There can be no assurance that any new products that we develop will gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace or that such products will be able to
compete successfully with other new products or services that may be introduced by competitors. In addition, we may incur additional warranty or other costs as new products are tested and used by customers.

A portion of our sales are related to delivering products and services to help our U.S. railroad and transit customers meet the Positive Train
Control (PTC) mandate from the U.S. federal government, which requires the use of on-board locomotive computers and software by December 31, 2015.

For the year ended December 31, 2012, we had sales of about $215 million related to PTC. As part of its new surface transportation funding bill, a House committee has proposed extending the PTC
deadline, which could affect the rate of industry spending on this technology. Should the federal government change its mandate by amending the timing, scope or requirements of the safety bill, there could be an adverse impact on our revenues in
future periods, and would cause us to reassess the staffing, resources and assets deployed in delivering Positive Train Control services.

Our revenues are subject to cyclical variations in the railway and passenger transit markets and changes in government spending.

The railway industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations due to overall economic conditions, the
use of alternate methods of transportation and the levels of federal, state and local government spending on railroad transit projects. In economic downturns, railroads have deferred, and may defer, certain expenditures in order to conserve cash in
the short term. Reductions in freight traffic may reduce demand for our replacement products.

The passenger transit railroad
industry is also cyclical. New passenger transit car orders vary from year to year and are influenced greatly by major replacement programs and by the construction or expansion of transit systems by transit authorities. A substantial portion of our
net sales have been, and we expect that a material portion of our future net sales will be, derived from contracts with metropolitan transit and commuter rail authorities and Amtrak. To the extent that future funding for proposed public projects is
curtailed or withdrawn altogether as a result of changes in political, economic, fiscal or other conditions beyond our control, such projects may be delayed or cancelled, resulting in a potential loss of business for us, including transit
aftermarket and new transit car orders. There can be no assurance that economic conditions will be favorable or that there will not be significant fluctuations adversely affecting the industry as a whole and, as a result, us.

A growing portion of our sales may be derived from our international operations, which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an
international level.

In fiscal year 2012, approximately 50% of our consolidated net sales were to customers outside of
the U.S. and we intend to continue to expand our international operations in the future. We currently conduct our international operations through a variety of wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures in Australia, Austria, Brazil,
Canada, China, Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Italy, Macedonia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, South Africa, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. As a result, we are subject to various risks, any one of which could have a material
adverse effect on those operations and on our business as a whole, including:

•

lack of complete operating control;



•

lack of local business experience;

•

currency exchange fluctuations and devaluations;

•

foreign trade restrictions and exchange controls;

•

difficulty enforcing agreements and intellectual property rights;

•

the potential for nationalization of enterprises; and

•

economic, political and social instability and possible terrorist attacks against American interests.

In addition, certain jurisdictions have laws that limit the ability of non-U.S. subsidiaries and their affiliates to pay dividends and
repatriate cash flows.

We may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.

In the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding
costs associated with variable-rate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements. There can be no assurance that any of these
measures will be effective. Any material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to us.

We may have
liability arising from asbestos litigation.

Claims have been filed against the Company and certain of its affiliates
in various jurisdictions across the United States by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing products. Most of these claims have been made against our wholly owned subsidiary, Railroad Friction Products
Corporation (RFPC), and are based on a product sold by RFPC prior to the time that the Company acquired any interest in RFPC.

Most of these claims, including all of the RFPC claims, are submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity or to
non-affiliated companies that retain the liabilities for the asbestos-containing products at issue. We cannot, however, assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors or insurers will remain financially
viable. Our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims, as is the case with most other pending litigation, cannot be estimated.

We are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations.

We are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water, the handling, storage and
disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances. We believe our operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and
regulations applicable to our business; however, there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements.

Future climate change regulation could result in increased operating costs, affect the demand for our products or affect the ability of our
critical suppliers to meet our needs.

The Company has followed the current debate over climate change and the related
policy discussion and prospective legislation. The potential challenges for the Company that climate change policy and legislation may pose have been reviewed by the Company. Any such challenges are heavily dependent on the nature and degree of
climate change legislation and the extent to which it applies to our industry. At this time, the Company cannot predict the ultimate impact of climate change and climate change legislation on the Company’s operations. Further, when or if these
impacts may occur cannot be assessed until scientific analysis and legislative policy are



more developed and specific legislative proposals begin to take shape. Any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gas could require us to incur
increased operating costs, and could have an adverse effect on demand for our products. In addition, the price and availability of certain of the raw materials that we use could vary in the future as a result of environmental laws and regulations
affecting our suppliers. An increase in the price of our raw materials or a decline in their availability could adversely affect our operating margins or result in reduced demand for our products.

Our manufacturer’s warranties or product liability may expose us to potentially significant claims.

We warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products. Accordingly, we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty
claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death, or does not conform to our customers’ specifications. In addition, in recent years, we have introduced a number of new products for which we do not
have a history of warranty experience. Although we have not had any material product liability or warranty claims made against us and we currently maintain liability insurance coverage, we cannot assure that product liability claims, if made, would
not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. The possibility exists for these types of warranty claims to result in costly product recalls, significant repair
costs and damage to our reputation.

Labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.

We collectively bargain with labor unions that represent approximately 27% of our employees. Our current collective
bargaining agreements are generally effective from 2013 through 2015. Agreements expiring at various times during 2013 cover approximately 16% of the Company’s workforce. Failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes or other labor
protests which could disrupt our operations. If we were to experience a strike or work stoppage, it would be difficult for us to find a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills to replace these employees. We cannot assure that we
will reach any such agreement or that we will not encounter strikes or other types of conflicts with the labor unions of our personnel. Such labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations,
could cause us to lose revenues and customers and might have permanent effects on our business.

From time to time we are engaged in
contractual disputes with our customers.

From time to time, we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers
regarding routine delivery and performance issues as well as adjustments for design changes and related extra work. These disputes are generally resolved in the ordinary course of business without having a material adverse impact on us.

Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health.

At December 31, 2012, we had total debt of $317.9 million. If it becomes necessary to access our available borrowing capacity under the 2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement, the $167.0 million currently
borrowed under this facility and the $150.0 million 6.875% senior notes, being indebted could have important consequences to us. For example, it could:

•

increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our
cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;

•

place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt; and

•

limit our ability to borrow additional funds.



The indenture for our $150 million 6.875% senior notes due in 2013 and our 2011 Refinancing Credit
Agreement contain various covenants that limit our Management’s discretion in the operation of our businesses.

The indenture governing the notes and our credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our Management’s discretion.

The 2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement limits the Company’s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the
Company from declaring or making other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. The 2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations: incurrence of additional indebtedness;
mergers, consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions; additional liens; sale and leasebacks; permissible investments, loans and advances; certain debt payments; capital expenditures; and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and
a maximum debt to cash flow ratio.

The indenture under which the senior notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions
which limit among other things, the following: the incurrence of indebtedness, payment of dividends and certain distributions, sale of assets, change in control, mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens.

The integration of our recently completed acquisitions may not result in anticipated improvements in market position or the realization of
anticipated operating synergies or may take longer to realize than expected.

In 2011 and 2012, we completed multiple
acquisitions with a combined investment of $258.8 million. Although we believe that the acquisitions will improve our market position and realize positive operating results, including operating synergies, operating expense reductions and overhead
cost savings, we cannot be assured that these improvements will be obtained or the timing of such improvements. The management and acquisition of businesses involves substantial risks, any of which may result in a material adverse effect on our
business and results of operations, including:

•

the uncertainty that an acquired business will achieve anticipated operating results;

•

significant expenses to integrate;

•

diversion of Management’s attention;

•

departure of key personnel from the acquired business;

•

effectively managing entrepreneurial spirit and decision-making;

•

integration of different information systems;

•

unanticipated costs and exposure to unforeseen liabilities; and

•

impairment of assets.

Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

Wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of
value-added, technology-based products and services for the global rail industry. Our products are found on virtually all U.S. locomotives, freight cars and passenger transit vehicles, as well as in more than 100 countries throughout the world. Our
products enhance safety, improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers, and many of our core products and services are essential in the safe and efficient operation of freight rail and passenger transit vehicles. Wabtec is a global
company with operations in 19 countries. In 2012, about 50% of the Company’s revenues came from customers outside the U.S.

Management
Review and Future Outlook

Wabtec’s long-term financial goals are to generate cash flow in excess of net income,
maintain a strong credit profile while minimizing our overall cost of capital, increase margins through strict attention to cost controls and implementation of the Wabtec Performance System, and increase revenues through a focused growth strategy,
including global and market expansion, new products and technologies, aftermarket products and services, and acquisitions. In addition, Management evaluates the Company’s current operational performance through measures such as quality and
on-time delivery.

The Company monitors a variety of factors and statistics to gauge market activity. The North America
freight rail industry is largely driven by general economic conditions, which can cause fluctuations in rail traffic. Based on those fluctuations, railroads can increase or decrease purchases of new locomotives and freight cars. The AAR compiles
statistics that gauge the level of activity in the freight rail industry, including revenue ton-miles and carloadings, which are generally referred to as “rail traffic”. In 2012, U.S. revenue ton-miles decreased 2.4%, carloadings decreased
3.1% and intermodal carloadings increased 3.2%, generally reflecting a sluggish economy and reduced coal traffic. In anticipation of increased future demand, railroads increased their purchases of new locomotives and freight cars, which had a
favorable effect on the Company’s Freight Segment. In 2013, we expect demand for new locomotives to remain about the same as in 2012, while we expect demand for new freight cars to be slightly lower. Future demand depends largely on the
strength in the overall economy and in rail traffic volumes.

In 2008, the U.S. federal government
enacted a rail safety bill that mandates the use of PTC technology, which includes on-board locomotive computer and related software, on a majority of the locomotives and track in the U.S. With our Electronic Train Management System

®

, we are the leading supplier of this on-board train control equipment, and we are working with the U.S. Class I
railroads, commuter rail authorities and other industry suppliers to implement this technology by the December 31, 2015 deadline set in the rail safety bill. As part of its new surface transportation funding bill, a House committee has proposed
extending this deadline. An extension of the deadline could affect the rate of industry spending on this technology. PTC revenue was about $215 million in 2012.

The North American transit rail industry is driven by government spending and ridership. In 2012, the U.S. Congress passed a new, two-year funding bill, which maintained spending at about the same level,
about $10.7 billion, as in prior years. Ridership provides fare box revenues to transit authorities, which use these funds, along with state and local money, primarily for equipment and system maintenance. Based on preliminary figures from the
American Public Transportation Association, ridership on U.S. transit vehicles increased about 2.5% in 2012, after a 2% increase in 2011. Spending in 2013 is expected to remain at about current levels.

In 2012, market conditions were mixed in the North America freight rail market. Demand for new freight cars and locomotives were higher,
but revenue ton-miles and carloadings were lower. In 2012, U.S. revenue ton-miles decreased 2.4%, carloadings decreased 3.1%, and intermodal carloadings increased 3.2%, generally reflecting a sluggish economy and reduced coal traffic. In the
passenger transit market during 2012, the Company believes that existing levels of federal funding and ridership resulted in consistent demand for new equipment and aftermarket parts when compared to previous years; however, most government entities
at all levels are facing budget issues, which could have a negative effect on demand for the Company’s products and services.



Wabtec continues to expand its presence in freight rail and passenger transit markets
outside the U.S., particularly in Europe, Asia-Pacific and South America. In Europe, the majority of the rail system serves the passenger transit market, which is larger than the transit market in the U.S. Our presence in the U.K., Germany and Italy
has positioned the Company to take advantage of this market. Asia-Pacific is a growth market and our various joint ventures and direct exports to China have positioned the Company to take advantage of this growth. Economic growth in Australia has
been an area of expansion for the Company as commodity suppliers use our products to meet the demands of their regional customers. The Company is delivering on a PTC contract, expanding locations and has completed two acquisitions in Brazil,
allowing us to increase our sales in that market.

In 2013 and beyond, general economic and market conditions in the United
States and internationally could have an impact on our sales and operations. To the extent that these factors cause instability of capital markets, shortages of raw materials or component parts, longer sales cycles, deferral or delay of customer
orders or an inability to market our products effectively, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, we face risks associated with our four-point growth strategy including the level of investment
that customers are willing to make in new technologies developed by the industry and the Company, and risks inherent in global expansion. When necessary, we will modify our financial and operating strategies to reflect changes in market conditions
and risks.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following table shows our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years indicated.

2012 COMPARED TO 2011

The following table summarizes the results of operations for the period:



The following table shows the major components of the change in sales in 2012 from 2011:

Net sales increased by $423.5 million to $2,391.1 million in 2012 from $1,967.6 million in 2011. The
increase is due to higher sales of $153.9 million for Specialty Products and Electronics from increased demand for freight original equipment rail products, and positive train control electronics and aftermarket products; $138.3 million from
acquisitions; $97.7 million for Remanufacturing, Overhaul and Build sales from increased demand for freight original equipment locomotives and aftermarket services for locomotives; $40.8 million for Brake Products sales due to higher demand for
original equipment brakes; and $8.6 million for other products. Company net sales decreased $19.9 million and income from operations decreased $2.4 million due to unfavorable effects of foreign exchange. Net income for 2012 was $251.7 million or
$5.19 per diluted share. Net income increased due to higher sales volume.

Freight Segment sales increased by $291.9 million,
or 24.1%, due to higher sales of $132.9 million for Specialty Products and Electronics, primarily resulting from increased demand for original equipment rail products, and positive train control electronics and aftermarket rail products; $65.7
million from acquisitions; $46.1 million from increased demand for freight original equipment locomotives and aftermarket services for locomotives; $41.4 million for Brake Products; and $7.7 million for other products. For the Freight Segment,
net sales decreased by $2.0 million due to unfavorable effects of foreign exchange.

Transit Segment sales increased by $131.6
million, or 17.4%, due to $72.6 million from acquisitions; higher sales of $51.6 million for Remanufacturing, Overhaul and Build from increased demand for overhaul and aftermarket services; $20.9 million of higher Specialty Products and Electronics
sales from increased demand for transit positive train control electronics; and $4.2 million for Other Transit Products. For the Transit Segment, net sales decreased by $17.9 million due to unfavorable effects of foreign exchange.

Cost of Sales and Gross profit

Cost of Sales increased by $299.3 million to $1,696.5 million in 2012 from $1,397.2 million
in 2011. Cost of sales, as a percentage of sales was 71.0% in 2012 and 2011.

During 2012, raw material costs decreased as a
percentage of sales to approximately 43% in 2012 from 44% in 2011. Labor costs increased as a percentage of sales to approximately 12% in 2012 from 11% in 2011. Overhead costs as a percentage of sales were approximately 16% in 2012 and 2011. Freight
Segment raw material costs decreased as a percentage of sales to approximately 43% in 2012 from 44% in 2011. Freight Segment labor costs increased as a percentage of sales to approximately 11% in 2012 from 10% in 2011, and overhead costs as a
percentage of sales were approximately 15% in 2012 and 2011. Transit Segment raw material costs as a percentage of sales were approximately 43% in 2012 and 2011. Transit Segment labor costs increased as a percentage of sales to approximately 13% in
2012 from 12% in 2011, and overhead costs as a percentage of sales were 19% in 2012 and 2011. In general, raw material costs as a percentage of sales decreased and labor costs as a percentage of sales increased reflecting the higher mix of revenue
generated from positive train control electronics and aftermarket services, which has a lower raw material component and higher labor component as cost of sales.



Included in costs of sales is warranty expense. The provision for warranty expense is
generally established for specific losses, along with historical estimates of customer claims as a percentage of sales, which can cause variability in warranty expense between quarters. Warranty expense was $3.1 million higher in 2012 compared to
2011 due to increased sales and increased provisions for certain transit contracts. As a percentage of sales, warranty expense was 1.0% in 2012 and 2011.

Gross profit increased to $694.6 million in 2012 compared to $570.4 million in 2011, due to higher sales volume and the reasons discussed above. For 2012 and 2011, gross profit, as a percentage of sales,
was 29.0%.

Operating expenses

The following table shows our operating expenses:

Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $1.8 million in 2012 compared to 2011 because the
prior year included an $18.1 million charge for a court ruling which was recorded in the second quarter of 2011and a decrease of $3.0 million in other Corporate expenses. This was offset by $18.0 million of expenses from acquisitions, and $1.7
million increase in incentive and non-cash compensation. Engineering expense increased by $4.1 million in 2012 compared to 2011 as the company focused engineering resources on product development. Costs related to engineering for specific customer
contracts are included in cost of sales. Amortization expense increased in 2012 compared to 2011 due to amortization of intangibles in 2012 associated with acquisitions. Total operating expenses were 12.6% and 15.2% of sales for 2012 and 2011,
respectively.

The following table shows our segment operating expenses:

Segment operating expenses consist of specific segment costs such as, sales and marketing, information
technology, insurance, and audit and tax fees, allocated corporate costs, and other segment specific discrete charges. Corporate costs are allocated to the freight and transit segments based on segment revenues. Certain corporate departmental
expenses are not allocated.

Freight Segment operating expenses increased $10.3 million in 2012 compared to 2011 because of
$6.4 million of expenses from acquisitions, an increase of $0.7 million in expenses allocated to the operating segments and an increase of $3.2 million in selling, general and administrative expense supporting higher sales volume. Freight Segment
operating expenses were 10.5% and 12.1% of sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Transit Segment operating expenses
increased $13.4 million in 2012 compared to 2011 because of $13.1 million of expenses from acquisitions, a benefit of $2.4 million for a settlement related to a prior acquisition which was recorded in the second quarter of 2011, and an increase of
$0.6 million in expense allocated to the



operating segments, partially offset by a decrease of $2.7 million in selling, general and administrative expense from cost saving initiatives. Transit Segment operating expenses were 14.4% and
15.1% of sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Corporate non-allocated operating expenses decreased $21.1 million in 2012
compared to 2011 because of the charge for a court ruling discussed above and decreases in other non-allocated departmental expenses.

Income from operations

Income from operations totaled $392.3 million or 16.4% of sales in 2012 compared to $270.7 million or 13.8% of sales in 2011. Income from operations increased due to
higher sales volume, partially offset by increased operating expenses discussed above.

Interest expense, net

Overall interest expense, net, decreased due to lower interest rates and lower debt balances.

Other expense,
net

The Company recorded foreign exchange gains of $0.1 million in 2012 and foreign exchange losses of $2.0 million in 2011 due to the effect of currency exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions that are non U.S. dollar denominated
and charged or credited to earnings.

Income taxes

The effective income tax rate was 33.3% and 33.4% in 2012 and
2011, respectively.

Net income

Net income for 2012 increased $81.6 million, compared to 2011. The increase in
net income is due to higher sales volume, partially offset by increased operating expenses.

2011 COMPARED TO 2010

The following table summarizes the results of operations for the period:

The following table shows the major components of the change in sales in 2011 from 2010:



Net sales increased by $460.6 million to $1,967.6 million in 2011 from $1,507.0 million in
2010. The increase is due to higher sales of $306.6 million for Specialty Products and Electronics from increased demand for freight original equipment rail products, and positive train control electronics and aftermarket products; $128.3 million
from acquisitions; $39.3 million for Brake Products sales due to higher demand for original equipment brakes; and $9.1 million for other products. Partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of $26.3 million for Other Transit Products and
$26.1 million for Remanufacturing, Overhaul and Build, from the completion of certain transit locomotive build contracts and lower sales from certain transit original equipment contracts. The Company realized a net sales increase of $29.6 million
and an income from operations increase of $4.1 million due to favorable effects of foreign exchange. Net income for 2011 was $170.1 million or $3.51 per diluted share. Net income increased due to higher sales volume and operating margins.

Freight Segment sales increased by $425.6 million, or 54.2%, due to higher sales of $281.5 million for Specialty Products and
Electronics, primarily resulting from increased demand for original equipment rail products, original equipment heat exchange products and aftermarket rail products; $47.7 million for Brake Products resulting from higher car build and increased rail
traffic; $47.6 million from acquisitions; $26.6 million for Remanufacturing, Overhaul and Build from increased demand for freight overhaul and remanufacturing services and $8.8 million for other products. For the Freight Segment, net sales improved
by $13.3 million due to favorable effects of foreign exchange.

Transit Segment sales increased by $35.1 million, or 4.9%, due
to increased sales of $80.7 million from acquisitions and $25.1 million for Specialty Products and Electronics resulting from increased demand for transit positive train control electronics; partially offset by decreased sales of $52.7 million for
Remanufacturing, Overhaul and Build, $26.3 million for Other Transit Products and $8.4 million for Brake Products, from the completion of certain transit locomotive build contracts and lower sales from certain transit original equipment contracts.
For the Transit Segment, net sales improved by $16.3 million due to favorable effects of foreign exchange.

Cost of
Sales and Gross profit

Cost of Sales increased by $339.3 million to $1,397.2 million in 2011 from $1,057.9 million in 2010. In 2011, cost of sales, as a percentage of sales was 71.0% compared to 70.2% in the same period of 2010. This
increase is the result of increased costs in the transit segment related to certain long-term contracts, partially offset by higher margin product sales (freight and aftermarket) increased as a percentage of total sales compared to other products.

During 2011, raw material costs increased as a percentage of sales to approximately 44% in 2011 from 41% in 2010. Labor costs
as a percentage of sales were approximately 11% in 2011 and 2010. Overhead costs decreased as a percentage of sales to approximately 16% in 2011 from 18% in 2010. Freight Segment raw material costs increased as a percentage of sales to approximately
44% in 2011 from 40% in 2010. Freight Segment labor costs decreased as a percentage of sales to approximately 10% in 2011 from 11% in 2010, and overhead costs decreased as a percentage of sales to approximately 15% in 2011 from 18% in 2010. Transit
Segment raw material costs as a percentage of sales were approximately 43% in 2011 and 2010. Transit Segment labor costs increased as a percentage of sales to approximately 12% in 2011 from 11% in 2010, and overhead costs increased as a percentage
of sales to 19% in 2011 from 18% in 2010. In general, raw material costs as a percentage of sales increased reflecting the higher mix of revenue generated from freight original equipment sales and aftermarket services, which has a higher raw
material component as cost of sales. Overhead costs vary as a percentage of sales depending on product mix and changes in sales volume.

Included in costs of sales is warranty expense. The provision for warranty expense is generally established for specific losses, along with historical estimates of customer claims as a percentage of
sales, which can cause variability in warranty expense between quarters. Warranty expense was $3.0 million lower in 2011 compared to 2010 because of the completion of certain transit contracts, which had required creating initial warranty reserves.

Gross profit increased to $570.4 million in 2011 compared to $449.1 million in 2010, for the reasons discussed above. For
2011, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 29.0% compared to 29.8%, for 2010.



Operating expenses

The following table shows our operating expenses:

Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $51.6 million in 2011 compared to 2010 because of
$19.0 million of expenses from acquisitions and other growth initiatives, an $18.1 million charge for a court ruling, $11.9 million increase in incentive and non-cash compensation and $4.0 million of other certain one-time charges, partially offset
by a benefit of $2.4 million from a settlement related to a prior acquisition. Engineering expense decreased by $3.0 million in 2011 compared 2010 as the Company focused engineering resources on completing original equipment contracts which caused
the related engineering costs to be charged to cost of sales. Amortization expense increased in 2011 compared to 2010 due to amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions. Total operating expenses were 15.2% and 16.3% of sales for 2011
and 2010, respectively.

The following table shows our segment operating expenses:

Segment operating expenses consist of specific segment costs such as; sales and marketing, information
technology, insurance, and audit and tax fees; allocated corporate costs, and other segment specific discrete charges. Corporate costs are allocated to the freight and transit segments based on segment revenues. Certain corporate departmental
expenses are not allocated.

Freight Segment operating expenses increased $23.2 million in 2011 compared to 2010 because of
$11.3 million of expenses from acquisitions, an increase of $10.7 million in expenses allocated to the operating segments and an increase of $1.2 million in selling, general and administrative expense supporting higher sales volume. Freight Segment
operating expenses were 12.1% and 15.4% of sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Transit Segment operating expenses
increased $6.8 million in 2011 compared to 2010 because of $7.7 million of expenses from acquisitions and an increase of $1.8 million in expense allocated to the operating segments, partially offset by a decrease of $2.7 million in selling, general
and administrative expense from cost saving initiatives. Transit Segment operating expenses were 15.1% and 14.8% of sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Corporate non-allocated operating expenses increased $23.5 million because of the charge for a court ruling discussed above and increases in other non-allocated departmental expenses.

Income from operations

Income from operations totaled $270.7 million or 13.8% of sales in 2011 compared to $202.8 million
or 13.5% of sales in 2010. Income from operations increased due to higher sales volume, partially offset by increased operating expenses discussed above.



Interest expense, net

Overall interest expense, net, decreased due to higher
interest income realized on higher invested cash balances.

Other expense, net

The Company recorded foreign
exchange losses of $2.0 million in 2011 and foreign exchange losses of $1.0 million in 2010 due to the effect of currency exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions that are non U.S. dollar denominated and charged or credited to earnings.

Income taxes

The effective income tax rate was 33.4% and 34.1% in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in
the effective tax rate is primarily due to a tax benefit of approximately $1.9 million which is due primarily to the settlement of examinations in various tax jurisdictions.

Net income

Net income for 2011 increased $47.0 million, compared to 2010. The increase in net income is due to higher sales volume, partially offset by increased operating expenses.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity is provided by operating cash flow and borrowings under the Company’s unsecured credit facility with a consortium of commercial banks. The following is a summary of selected cash flow
information and other relevant data:

Operating activities.

In 2012, 2011 and 2010, cash provided by operations was $237.7
million, $248.6 million and $176.1 million, respectively. In comparison to 2011, the decrease in cash provided by operations in 2012 resulted from higher working capital, offset by higher net income and higher non-cash items. In 2012 the
following working capital items used cash: accounts receivable increased by $23.0 million, primarily due to higher sales; inventory increased by $32.5 million to support the higher sales and due to certain long term contracts; accounts payable and
accrued income taxes decreased $34.6 million due to the timing of payments. All other operating assets and liabilities, net, provided cash of $13.4 million due to the payment timing of certain accrued liabilities.

In comparison to 2010, cash provided by operations in 2011 increased from higher net income and higher non-cash items, partially offset
by an increase in working capital. In 2011, accounts receivable increased by $68.7 million, primarily due to higher sales; and inventory increased by $79.5 million from the prior year, to support the higher sales level and certain locomotive build
contracts. These increases were offset by: an increase in accounts payable of $60.0 million, related to the increased inventory purchases and the timing of payments; an increase in customer deposits of $41.4 million for certain transit and freight
contracts; an increase in accrued income taxes of $31.5 million due to payment timing; and an increase in all other operating assets and liabilities, net, provided cash of $50.1 million due to the accrual for a court ruling and the payment timing of
certain accrued liabilities.



Investing activities.

In 2012, 2011 and 2010, cash used in investing
activities was $184.9 million, $146.2 million and $156.3 million, respectively. Net cash paid for acquisitions was $149.9 million, $109.0 million and $138.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Refer
to Note 3 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information on acquisitions. Capital expenditures were $36.0 million, $38.0 million, and $20.8 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Financing activities

.

In 2012, cash used in financing activities was $124.7 million, which included
$233.4 million in proceeds from debt and $311.4 million of repayments of debt on the revolving credit facility, $0.1 million of debt repayments on other debt, $7.7 million of dividend payments and $46.6 million of Wabtec stock repurchases.
In 2011, cash used in financing activities was $46.8 million, which included $257.0 million in proceeds from debt and $243.5 million of repayments of debt on the revolving credit facility, $39.7 million of debt repayments on the term loan and other
debt, $3.8 million of dividend payments and $26.0 million of Wabtec stock repurchases. In 2010, cash provided by financing activities was $25.8 million, which included $248.4 million in proceeds from debt and $185.4 million of repayments of
debt on the revolving credit facility, $32.7 million of debt repayments on the term loan and other debt, $1.9 million of dividend payments and $8.4 million of Wabtec stock repurchases.

The following table shows outstanding indebtedness at December 31, 2012 and 2011.

Cash balances at December 31, 2012 and 2011 were $215.8 million and $285.6 million, respectively.

2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement

On November 7, 2011, the Company refinanced its existing revolving credit and term loan facility with a consortium of commercial banks. This “2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement” provides the
Company with a $600 million, five-year revolving credit facility. The Company incurred approximately $1.9 million of deferred financing cost related to the 2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement. The facility expires on November 7, 2016.
The 2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement borrowings bear variable interest rates indexed to the indices described below. At December 31, 2012, the Company had available bank borrowing capacity, net of $32.5 million of letters of credit, of
approximately $400.5 million, subject to certain financial covenant restrictions.

Under the 2011 Refinancing Credit
Agreement, the Company may elect a Base Rate of interest or an interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) of interest (“the Alternate Rate”). The Base Rate adjusts on a daily basis and is the greater of
the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5% per annum, the PNC, N.A. prime rate or the Daily LIBOR Rate plus 100 basis points, plus a margin that ranges from 0 to 75 basis points. The Alternate Rate is based on quoted LIBOR rates plus a margin
that ranges from 75 to 175 basis points. Both the Base Rate and Alternate Rate margins are dependent on the Company’s consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios. The initial Base Rate margin is 25 basis points and the Alternate Rate
margin is 125 basis points.

At December 31, 2012 the weighted average interest rate on the Company’s variable rate
debt was 1.21%. On January 12, 2012, the Company entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional



value of $150 million. The effective date of the interest rate swap agreement is July 31, 2013, and the termination date is November 7, 2016. The impact of the interest rate swap
agreement will be to convert a portion of the Company’s then outstanding debt from a variable rate to a fixed-rate borrowing. During the term of the interest rate swap agreement the interest rate on the notional value will be fixed at 1.415%
plus the Alternate Rate margin. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty. However, since only the cash interest payments are exchanged, exposure is significantly less than the notional amount. The
counterparty is a large financial institution with an excellent credit rating and history of performance. The Company currently believes the risk of nonperformance is negligible.

The 2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement limits the Company’s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the Company from
declaring or making other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. The 2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations: incurrence of additional indebtedness; mergers,
consolidations, sales of assets and acquisitions; additional liens; sale and leasebacks; permissible investments, loans and advances; certain debt payments; and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio of 3.0 and a maximum debt to cash flow
ratio of 3.25. The Company does not expect that these measurements will limit the Company in executing our operating activities. See Note 8 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.

2008 Refinancing Credit Agreement

On November 4, 2008, the Company refinanced its then existing unsecured revolving credit agreement with a consortium of commercial banks. This “2008 Refinancing Credit Agreement” provided
the company with a $300 million five-year revolving credit facility and a $200 million five-year term loan facility. The Company incurred $2.9 million of deferred financing cost related to the 2008 Refinancing Credit Agreement. Both facilities were
set to expire in January 2013.

Under the 2008 Refinancing Credit Agreement, the Company may have elected a Base Rate of
interest or an interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) of interest (“the Alternate Rate”). The Base Rate adjusted on a daily basis and is the greater of the PNC, N.A. prime rate, 30-day LIBOR plus 150
basis points or the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5% per annum, plus a margin that ranges from 25 to 50 basis points. The Alternate rate was based on quoted LIBOR rates plus a margin that ranges from 125 to 200 basis points. Both the Base
Rate and Alternate Rate margins are dependent on the Company’s consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios.

6.875% Senior Notes Due August 2013.

In August 2003, the Company issued $150.0 million of Senior Notes due in 2013 (“the
Notes”). The Notes were issued at par. Interest on the Notes accrues at a rate of 6.875% per annum and is payable semi-annually on January 31 and July 31 of each year. The proceeds were used to repay debt outstanding under the
Company’s existing credit agreement and for general corporate purposes. The principal balance is due in full at maturity. The Company has both the intent and ability to refinance the Notes, maturing August 2013, on a long term basis utilizing
capacity under the 2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement. The 2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement will provide available bank borrowing capacity sufficient to refinance the Notes on a long-term basis. The Notes are included in the long-term portion of
debt as of December 31, 2012. The Company is in compliance with the restrictions and covenants in the indenture under which the Notes were issued and expects that these restrictions and covenants will not be any type of limiting factor in
executing our operating activities. For additional information regarding the Notes see Note 6 of the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.

Management believes that based on current levels of operations and forecasted earnings, cash flow and liquidity will be sufficient to
fund working capital and capital equipment needs as well as meeting debt service requirements. If sources of funds were to fail to satisfy the Company’s cash requirements, the Company may need to refinance our existing debt or obtain additional
financing. There is no assurance that such new financing alternatives would be available, and, in any case, such new financing, if available, may be more costly and burdensome than the debt agreements currently in place.



Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company is obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and have certain
contingent commitments such as debt guarantees. The Company has grouped these contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements into operating activities, financing activities, and investing activities in the same manner as they are
classified in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows to provide a better understanding of the nature of the obligations and arrangements and to provide a basis for comparison to historical information. The table below provides a summary of
contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2012:

(1)

Purchase obligations represent non-cancelable contractual obligations at December 31, 2012. In addition, the Company had $265.4 million of open purchase orders for

interest payments based on contractual terms and the Company’s current interest rate.

The above table does
not reflect uncertain tax positions of $11.3 million, the timing of which are uncertain except for $3.1 million that may become payable during 2013. Refer to Note 10 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional
information on uncertain tax positions.

Obligations for operating activities.

The Company has entered into $46.0
million of material long-term non-cancelable materials and supply purchase obligations. Operating leases represent multi-year obligations for rental of facilities and equipment. Estimated pension funding and post retirement benefit payments are
based on actuarial estimates using current assumptions for discount rates, expected return on long-term assets, rate of compensation increases and health care cost trend rates. Benefits paid for pension obligations were $12.9 million and $12.5
million in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Benefits paid for post retirement plans were $1.5 million and $1.9 million in 2012 and in 2011, respectively.

Obligations for financing activities.

Cash requirements for financing activities consist primarily of long-term debt repayments, interest payments and dividend payments to shareholders. The Company
has historically paid quarterly dividends to shareholders, subject to quarterly approval by our Board of Directors, currently at a rate of approximately $9.6 million annually.

The Company arranges for performance bonds to be issued by third party insurance companies to support certain long term customer contracts. At December 31, 2012 initial value of performance bonds
issued on the Company’s behalf is about $282.7 million.

Obligations for investing activities.

The Company
typically spends approximately $40 million to $50 million a year for capital expenditures, primarily related to facility expansion efficiency and modernization, health and safety, and environmental control. The Company expects annual capital
expenditures in the future will be within this range.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires Management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Areas of uncertainty that require judgments, estimates and assumptions include the accounting for
allowance for doubtful accounts, inventories, the testing of goodwill and other intangibles for impairment, warranty reserves, pensions and other postretirement benefits, stock based compensation and tax matters. Management uses historical
experience and all available information to make these judgments and estimates, and actual results will inevitably differ from those estimates and assumptions that are used to prepare the Company’s financial statements at any given time.
Despite these inherent limitations, Management believes that Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) and the financial statements and related footnotes provide a meaningful and fair
perspective of the Company. A discussion of the judgments and uncertainties associated with accounting for derivatives and environmental matters can be found in Notes 2 and 18, respectively, in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.

A summary of the Company’s significant accounting
policies is included in Note 2 in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report and is incorporated by reference herein. Management believes that the application of these policies on a
consistent basis enables the Company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the Company’s operating results and financial condition.











Item 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk

In the ordinary course of business, Wabtec is exposed
to risks that increases in interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with its variable-rate debt. The Company’s variable rate debt represents 53% and 35% of total long-term debt at December 31, 2012 and 2011,
respectively. On an annual basis a 1% change in the interest rate for variable rate debt at December 31, 2012 would increase or decrease interest expense by about $1.7 million.

To reduce the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of this variable-rate debt, the Company entered into interest rate swap
agreements which effectively converted a portion of the debt from a variable to a fixed-rate borrowing during the term of the swap contracts. Refer to “Financial Derivatives and Hedging Activities” in Note 2 of “Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report for additional information regarding interest rate risk.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

The Company is subject to certain risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent our operations are conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For the year ended
December 31, 2012, approximately 50% of Wabtec’s net sales were to the United States, 11% to the United Kingdom, 8% to Canada, 8% to Australia, 6% to Mexico, 2% to Germany, and 15% in other international locations. (See Note 19 of
“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report). To reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, the Company has periodically entered into foreign currency



forward contracts. Refer to “Financial Derivatives and Hedging Activities” in Note 2 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this
report for more information regarding foreign currency exchange risk.

Our market risk exposure is not substantially different
from our exposure at December 31, 2011.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORTS TO WABTEC SHAREHOLDERS

Management’s Report on Financial Statements and Practices

The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) were prepared by Management, which is responsible for their
integrity and objectivity. The statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and include amounts that are based on Management’s best judgments and estimates. The other financial information included in the
10-K is consistent with that in the financial statements.

Management also recognizes its responsibility for conducting the
Company’s affairs according to the highest standards of personal and corporate conduct. This responsibility is characterized and reflected in key policy statements issued from time to time regarding, among other things, conduct of its business
activities within the laws of host countries in which the Company operates and potentially conflicting outside business interests of its employees. The Company maintains a systematic program to assess compliance with these policies.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Management has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management has excluded Mors Smitt Holding (“Mors Smitt”), Winco Equipamentos Ferroviarios Ltda. (“Winco”) and
LH Group (“LH”) from its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 because the Company acquired Mors Smitt effective June 14, 2012, Winco effective July 31, 2012 and LH effective
October 1, 2012. Mors Smitt, Winco and LH are wholly owned subsidiaries whose total assets represents 5.2%, 0.5% and 2.6%, respectively and whose total net assets represents 7.5%, 0.4% and 3.7%, respectively, and net income represents 0.5%,
0.2% and 0.0%, respectively and whose customer revenues represents 1.3%, 0.2% and 0.7%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012.

Based on its assessment, Management has concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2012, based on criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, has been audited by
Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation as of December 31,
2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s Management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based
on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by Management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2012, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements
taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria
established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 22, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON
INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation:

We have audited Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies
Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of
and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Mors Smitt Holding (“Mors Smitt”), Winco Equipamentos Ferroviarios Ltda. (“Winco”) and LH Group
(“LH”), which are included in the 2012 consolidated financial statements of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation and constituted 5.2%, 0.5% and 2.6%, respectively, of total assets and 7.5%, 0.4% and 3.7%, respectively, of total
net assets as of December 31, 2012, and 0.5%, 0.2% and 0.0%, respectively, of net income and 1.3%, 0.2% and 0.7%, respectively, of customer revenue for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Westinghouse
Air Brake Technologies Corporation also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Mors Smitt, Winco and LH.

In our opinion, Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the COSO
criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States), the consolidated balance sheets of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 and our report dated February 22, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

2.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its majority owned subsidiaries. Such statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Sales between subsidiaries are billed at prices consistent with sales to third parties and are eliminated in
consolidation.

Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments purchased with an original
maturity of three months or less.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts
receivable reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available evidence. The allowance for
doubtful accounts was $6.7 million and $8.4 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined under the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Inventory costs include material, labor and overhead.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment additions are stated at cost. Expenditures for renewals and
improvements are capitalized. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The Company provides for book depreciation principally on the straight-line method. Accelerated depreciation methods are utilized for income
tax purposes.

Leasing Arrangements

The Company conducts a portion of its operations from leased facilities and
finances certain equipment purchases through lease agreements. In those cases in which the lease term approximates the useful life of the leased asset or the lease meets certain other prerequisites, the leasing arrangement is classified as a capital
lease. The remaining arrangements are treated as operating leases.

Intangible Assets

Goodwill and other
intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized. Other intangibles (with definite lives) are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives. Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when indicators
of impairment are present. The Company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually. The Company performs its annual impairment test during the fourth quarter after the annual forecasting process is
completed, and also tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Periodically, Management of the Company assesses whether or not an indicator of impairment is present that
would necessitate an impairment analysis be performed.

In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU No. 2012-02,
“Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic) 350) – Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment” (ASU 2012-02). The provisions of ASU 2012-02 provide an entity with the option to assess qualitative factors to determine
whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair



value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value. If, based on the review of the qualitative factors, an entity determines it is not more-likely-than-not that
the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, no further action is required. If an entity determines otherwise, then it is required to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset
and perform the quantitative impairment test required by prior accounting guidance. Similar to under ASU 2011-08, the entity has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the fair value calculation and the entity
may resume performing the qualitative analysis in any subsequent period. ASU 2012-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012, with early adoption permitted if the financial statements for the most recent annual or
interim period have not yet been issued. We chose to early adopt these new accounting provisions effective with our intangible impairment review during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. We determined, based upon our qualitative
assessment, that the fair value calculation was not required as there were no indications that the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets was less than their carrying value.

In September 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Updated (“ASU”) 2011-08 which amends the rules for testing goodwill for
impairment. Under the new rules, an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting
unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the
two-step impairment test is unnecessary. We adopted ASU 2011-08 for our 2011 annual goodwill impairment test.

In assessing
the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we assess relevant events and circumstances that may impact the fair value and the carrying amount of
the reporting unit. The identification of relevant events and circumstances and how these may impact a reporting unit’s fair value or carrying amount involve significant judgments and assumptions. The judgment and assumptions include the
identification of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, Wabtec specific events and share price trends and making the assessment on whether each relevant factor will impact the
impairment test positively or negatively and the magnitude of any such impact.

If our qualitative assessment concludes that
it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company then performs a two-step impairment test. In the first step of the quantitative assessment, our assets and liabilities, including
existing goodwill and other intangible assets, are assigned to the identified reporting units to determine the carrying value of the reporting units. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company prepares its
goodwill impairment analysis by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit, using an income approach (a discounted cash flow model) as well as a market approach, with its carrying value. The income approach and the market approach are
equally weighted in arriving at fair value, which the Company has applied consistently. The discounted cash flow model requires several assumptions including future sales growth, EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margins and capital
expenditures for the reporting units. The discounted cash flow model also requires the use of a discount rate and a terminal revenue growth rate (the revenue growth rate for the period beyond the three years forecasted by the reporting units), as
well as projections of future operating margins. The market approach requires several assumptions including EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) multiples for comparable companies that operate in the same markets
as the Company’s reporting units.

Warranty Costs

Warranty costs are accrued based on Management’s
estimates of repair or upgrade costs per unit and historical experience. Warranty expense was $23.0 million, $19.9 million and $22.8 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Accrued warranty was $58.2 million and $50.6 million at
December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.



Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws. The provision for income taxes includes federal, state
and foreign income taxes.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company recognizes compensation expense for stock-based
compensation based on the grant date fair value amortized ratably over the requisite service period following the date of grant.

Financial Derivatives and Hedging Activities

The Company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Forward contracts are
agreements with a counterparty to exchange two distinct currencies at a set exchange rate for delivery on a set date at some point in the future. There is no exchange of funds until the delivery date. At the delivery date the Company can either take
delivery of the currency or settle on a net basis. At December 31, 2012, the Company had no forward contracts.

To reduce
the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of this variable-rate debt, the Company entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of $150.0 million. Effective July 31, 2013, with a termination date of
November 7, 2016, this interest rate swap agreement will convert a portion of the Company’s then outstanding debt from a variable rate to a fixed-rate borrowing. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the
counterparty. However, since only the cash interest payments are exchanged, exposure is significantly less than the notional amount. The counterparty is a large financial institution with an excellent credit rating and history of performance. The
Company currently believes the risk of nonperformance is negligible. The Company concluded that the interest rate swap agreements qualify for special cash flow hedge accounting which permits the recording of the fair value of the interest rate swap
agreement and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, on the balance sheet. During the term of the interest rate swap agreement the interest rate on the notional value will be fixed at 1.415% plus the Alternate
Rate margin. As of December 31, 2012, the Company has recorded a current liability of $4.1 million and a corresponding offset in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $2.5 million, net of tax, related to this agreement.

Foreign Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, except for the Company’s Mexican
operations whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, are translated at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date while income and expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Foreign
currency gains and losses resulting from transactions, and the translation of financial statements are recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements based upon the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
830, “Foreign Currency Matters.” The effects of currency exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions and balances of a long-term investment nature are accumulated and carried as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.
The effects of currency exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions that are denominated in a currency other than an entity’s functional currency are charged or credited to earnings. Foreign exchange transaction losses recognized in
other (expense) income, net were $0.1 million, $2.0 million and $1.0 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Noncontrolling Interests

In accordance with ASC 810, the Company has classified noncontrolling interests as equity on our
condensed consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2012 and 2011. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was not material.

Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as net income and all other non-owner changes in
shareholders’ equity. The Company’s accumulated other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments, foreign currency hedges, foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps, and pension and post retirement
related adjustments.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized in accordance with ASC 605 “Revenue
Recognition.” Revenue is recognized when products have been shipped to the respective customers, title has passed and the price for the product has been determined.



In general, the Company recognizes revenues on long-term contracts based on the percentage
of completion method of accounting. The units-of-delivery method or other input-based or output-based measures, as appropriate, are used to measure the progress toward completion of individual contracts. Contract revenues and cost estimates are
reviewed and revised quarterly at a minimum and adjustments are reflected in the accounting period as such amounts are determined. Provisions are made currently for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts. Unbilled accounts receivables were $97.1
million and $58.9, customer deposits were $82.8 million and $72.8, and provisions for loss contracts were $14.2 million and $9.3 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Certain pre-production costs relating to long-term production and supply contracts have been deferred and will be recognized over the
life of the contracts. Deferred pre-production costs were $20.5 million and $15.4 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Significant Customers and Concentrations of Credit Risk

The Company’s trade receivables are from rail and transit industry original equipment manufacturers, Class I railroads, railroad
carriers and commercial companies that utilize rail cars in their operations, such as utility and chemical companies. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated net sales in 2012, 2011 and 2010.

Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs

All fees billed to the customer for shipping and handling are classified as a
component of net revenues. All costs associated with shipping and handling is classified as a component of cost of sales.

Research and Development

Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. For the years ended
December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company incurred costs of approximately $41.3 million, $37.2 million and $40.2 million, respectively.

Employees

As of December 31, 2012, approximately 27% of the Company’s workforce was covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements are generally effective from 2013
through 2015. Agreements expiring in 2013 cover approximately 16% of the Company’s workforce.

Earnings Per
Share

Basic and diluted earnings per common share is computed in accordance with ASC 260 “Earnings Per Share.” Unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents
(whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method included in ASC 260-10-55. (See Note 11 “Earnings Per Share” included herein)

Reclassifications

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified, where necessary, to conform to the current year
presentation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual amounts could differ from the estimates. On an ongoing basis, Management reviews its estimates based on currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates.

are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed annually during the fourth quarter for impairment (See Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies” included herein). Goodwill and indefinite live intangible assets were not impaired at December 31, 2012 and 2011.

Goodwill was $666.0 million and $587.5 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The change in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment for the year ended December 31, 2012 is as
follows:

LONG-TERM DEBT

Long-term debt consisted of the following:

2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement

On November 7, 2011, the Company refinanced its existing revolving credit and term loan facility with a consortium of commercial banks. This “2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement” provides the
company with a $600 million, five-year revolving credit facility. The Company incurred approximately $1.9 million of deferred financing cost related to the 2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement. The facility expires on November 7, 2016. The
2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement borrowings bear variable interest rates indexed to the indices described below. At December 31, 2012, the Company had available bank borrowing capacity, net of $32.5 million of letters of credit, of
approximately $400.5 million, subject to certain financial covenant restrictions.

Under the 2011 Refinancing Credit
Agreement, the Company may elect a Base Rate of interest or an interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) of interest (“the Alternate Rate”). The Base Rate adjusts on a daily basis and is the greater of
the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5% per annum, the PNC, N.A. prime rate or the Daily LIBOR Rate plus 100 basis points plus a margin that ranges from 0 to 75 basis



points. The Alternate Rate is based on quoted LIBOR rates plus a margin that ranges from 75 to 175 basis points. Both the Base Rate and Alternate Rate margins are dependent on the Company’s
consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios. The initial Base Rate margin is 25 basis points and the Alternate Rate margin is 125 basis points.

At December 31, 2012 the weighted average interest rate on the Company’s variable rate debt was 1.21%. On January 12, 2012, the Company entered into a forward starting interest rate swap
agreement with a notional value of $150 million. The effective date of the interest rate swap agreement is July 31, 2013, and the termination date is November 7, 2016. The impact of the interest rate swap agreement will be to convert a
portion of the Company’s then outstanding debt from a variable rate to a fixed-rate borrowing. During the term of the interest rate swap agreement the interest rate on the notional value will be fixed at 1.415% plus the Alternate Rate margin.
The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty. However, since only the cash interest payments are exchanged, exposure is significantly less than the notional amount. The counterparty is a large financial
institution with an excellent credit rating and history of performance. The Company currently believes the risk of nonperformance is negligible.

The 2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement limits the Company’s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the Company from declaring or making other distributions, subject to certain
exceptions. The 2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations: incurrence of additional indebtedness; mergers, consolidations, sales of assets and acquisitions; additional
liens; sale and leasebacks; permissible investments, loans and advances; certain debt payments; and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio of 3.0 and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio of 3.25. The Company does not expect that these
measurements will limit the Company in executing our operating activities.

2008 Refinancing Credit Agreement

On November 4, 2008, the Company had refinanced its existing unsecured revolving credit agreement with a consortium of commercial
banks. This “2008 Refinancing Credit Agreement” provided the company with a $300 million five-year revolving credit facility and a $200 million five-year term loan facility. The Company incurred $2.9 million of deferred financing cost
related to the 2008 Refinancing Credit Agreement. Both facilities were set to expire in January 2013.

Under the 2008
Refinancing Credit Agreement, the Company may have elected a Base Rate of interest or an interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) of interest (“the Alternate Rate”). The Base Rate adjusted on a daily
basis and is the greater of the PNC, N.A. prime rate, 30-day LIBOR plus 150 basis points or the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5% per annum, plus a margin that ranges from 25 to 50 basis points. The Alternate rate was based on quoted LIBOR
rates plus a margin that ranges from 125 to 200 basis points. Both the Base Rate and Alternate Rate margins are dependent on the Company’s consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios.

6.875% Senior Notes Due August 2013

In August 2003, the Company issued $150.0 million of Senior Notes due in 2013 (“the Notes”). The Notes were issued at par. Interest on the Notes accrues at a rate of 6.875% per annum and is
payable semi-annually on January 31 and July 31 of each year. The proceeds were used to repay debt outstanding under the Company’s existing credit agreement, and for general corporate purposes. The principal balance is due in full at
maturity. The Company has both the intent and ability to refinance the Notes, maturing August 2013, on a long term basis utilizing capacity under the 2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement. The 2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement will provide available
bank borrowing capacity sufficient to refinance the Notes on a long-term basis. The Notes are included in the long-term portion of debt as of December 31, 2012. The Company is in compliance with the restrictions and covenants in the indenture
under which the Notes were issued and expects that these restrictions and covenants will not be any type of limiting factor in executing our operating activities.



The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and rank pari passu with all
existing and future senior debt and senior to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the Company. The indenture under which the Notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things, the following: the
incurrence of indebtedness, payment of dividends and certain distributions, sale of assets, change in control, mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens.

Debt and Capital Leases

Scheduled principal repayments of debt and capital
lease balances as of December 31, 2012 are as follows:

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans that cover certain U.S., Canadian, German, and United Kingdom employees and which provide benefits of stated amounts for each year of service of the
employee. The Company uses a December 31 measurement date for the plans.



The following tables provide information regarding the Company’s defined benefit
pension plans summarized by U.S. and international components.

Obligations and Funded Status



The aggregate accumulated benefit obligation for the U.S. pension plans was $51.4 million
and $51.7 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The aggregate accumulated benefit obligation for the international pension plans was $154.2 million and $133.9 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Components of Net Periodic Benefit Costs

Other Changes in Plan Assets and Benefit Obligations Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income during 2012 are as
follows:



The weighted average assumptions in the following table represent the rates used to develop
the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation for the year listed and also the net periodic benefit cost for the following year.

The discount rate is based on settling the pension obligation with high grade, high yield corporate
bonds, and the rate of compensation increase is based on actual experience. The expected return on plan assets is based on historical performance as well as expected future rates of return on plan assets considering the current investment portfolio
mix and the long-term investment strategy.

As of December 31, 2012 the following table represents the amounts included
in other comprehensive loss that are expected to be recognized as components of periodic benefit costs in 2013.

Pension Plan Assets

The Company has established formal investment policies for the assets associated with our pension plans. Objectives include maximizing long-term return at acceptable risk levels and diversifying among
asset classes. Asset allocation targets are based on periodic asset liability study results which help determine the appropriate investment strategies. The investment policies permit variances from the targets within certain parameters. The plan
assets consist primarily of equity security funds, debt security funds, and temporary cash and cash equivalent investments. The assets held in these funds are generally passively managed and are valued at the net asset value per share multiplied by
the number of shares held as of the measurement date. Generally, all plan assets are considered Level 2 based on the fair value valuation hierarchy (See Note 17 “Fair Value Measurement” included herein). Plan assets by asset category at
December 31, 2012 and 2011 are as follows:

The U.S. pension plan has a target asset allocation of 50% equity securities and 50% debt securities. The
international pension plans have target asset allocations of 50% equity securities and 50% debt securities. Investment policies are determined by the respective Plan’s Pension Committee and set forth in its Investment Policy. Rebalancing of the
asset allocation occurs on a quarterly basis.



Cash Flows

The Company’s funding methods are based on governmental requirements and differ from those methods used to recognize pension expense. The Company expects to contribute $4.9 million to the
international plans and does not expect to make a contribution to the U.S. plans during 2013.

Benefit payments expected to be
paid to plan participants are as follows:

Post Retirement Benefit Plans

In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company has provided certain unfunded postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for a portion of North American employees. The Company is not
obligated to pay health care and life insurance benefits to individuals who had retired prior to 1990.

The Company uses a
December 31 measurement date for all post retirement plans. The following tables provide information regarding the Company’s post retirement benefit plans summarized by U.S. and international components.

The assumed health care cost trend rate for the U.S. plans grades from an initial rate of 7.2% to an
ultimate rate of 4.5% by 2027 and for international plans from 8.0% to 4.5% by 2030. A 1% increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate will increase the service and interest cost components of the expense recognized for the U.S. and
international postretirement plans by approximately $180,000 and $22,000, respectively, for 2013, and increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $4.4 million and $324,000, respectively. A 1% decrease in the assumed
health care cost trend rate will decrease the service and interest cost components of the expense recognized for the U.S. and international postretirement plans by approximately $153,000 and $18,000, respectively, for 2013, and decrease the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $3.7 million and $279,000, respectively.

Cash Flows

Benefit payments expected to be paid to plan participants are as follows:

Defined Contribution Plans

The Company also participates in certain defined contribution plans and multiemployer pension plans. Costs recognized under these plans are summarized as follows:

The 401(k) savings plan is a participant directed defined contribution plan that holds shares of the
Company’s stock as one of the investment options. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the plan held on behalf of its participants about 371,100 shares with a market value of $32.5 million, and 403,400 shares with a market value of $28.2
million, respectively.

Additionally, the Company has stock option based benefit and other plans further described in Note 12.

The Company contributes to several multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under collective bargaining agreements that
cover certain of its union-represented employees. The risks of participating in such



plans are different from the risks of single-employer plans. Assets contributed to a multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating
employers. If a participating employer ceases to contribute to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. If the Company ceases to have an obligation to contribute to the multiemployer plan
in which it had been a contributing employer, it may be required to pay to the plan an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan and on the history of the Company’s participation in the plan prior to the cessation of its obligation to
contribute. The amount that an employer that has ceased to have an obligation to contribute to a multiemployer plan is required to pay to the plan is referred to as a withdrawal liability.

The Company’s participation in multiemployer plans for the year ended December 31, 2012 is outlined in the table below. For
plans that are not individually significant to the Company, the total amount of contributions is presented in the aggregate.

(1)

The Company’s contribution represents more than 5% of the total contributions to the plan.

(2)

The Pension Fund’s board adopted a Rehabilitation Plan on September 30, 2012, increasing the weekly pension fund contribution rates by $75 with corresponding
decreases to the weekly welfare fund contribution rates.

(3)

Critical status triggered a 5% surcharge on employer contributions effective June 2012. Effective January 1, 2013, this surcharge increases to 10% and remains in
effect until the Company’s union adopts the Rehabilitation Plan.

(a)

The “EIN / PN” column provides the Employer Identification Number and the three-digit plan number assigned to a plan by the Internal Revenue Service.

(b)

The most recent Pension Protection Act Zone Status available for 2011 and 2010 is for plan years that ended in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The zone status is based on
information provided to the Company and other participating employers by each plan and is certified by the plan’s actuary. A plan in the “red” zone has been determined to be in “critical status”, based on criteria
established under the Internal Revenue Code (“Code”), and is generally less than 65% funded. A plan in the “yellow” zone has been determined to be in “endangered status”, based on criteria established under the Code,
and is generally less than 80% funded. A plan in the “green” zone has been determined to be neither in “critical status” nor in “endangered status”, and is generally at least 80% funded.

(c)

The “FIP/RP Status Pending/Implemented” column indicates whether a Funding Improvement Plan, as required under the Code to be adopted by plans in the
“yellow” zone, or a Rehabilitation Plan, as required under the Code to be adopted by plans in the “red” zone, is pending or has been implemented as of the end of the plan year that ended in 2012.

(d)

The “Surcharge Imposed” column indicates whether the Company’s contribution rate for 2012 included an amount in addition the contribution rate specified
in the applicable collective bargaining agreement, as imposed by a plan in “critical status”, in accordance with the requirements of the Code.



10.

INCOME TAXES

The Company is responsible for filing consolidated U.S., foreign and combined, unitary or separate state income tax
returns. The Company is responsible for paying the taxes relating to such returns, including any subsequent adjustments resulting from the redetermination of such tax liabilities by the applicable taxing authorities. The components of the income
from operations before provision for income taxes for the Company’s domestic and foreign operations for the years ended December 31 are provided below:

Undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately $404.1
million at December 31, 2012. Those earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested; accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal and state income taxes has been provided thereon. Upon repatriation of those earnings, in the form of
dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to both U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred
U.S. income tax liability is not practicable due to the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation. Withholding taxes of approximately $5.2 million would be payable upon remittance of all previously unremitted earnings at
December 31, 2012.

The consolidated provision for income taxes included in the Statement of Income consisted of the
following:



A reconciliation of the United States federal statutory income tax rate to the effective
income tax rate on operations for the years ended December 31 is provided below:

The “American Taxpayer Relief Act” retroactively extended the Research and Development tax
credit and certain foreign tax provisions that expired for 2012. The benefit of these extenders, approximately $2.0 million, will not be recorded until the first quarter of 2013 when the bill is enacted.

Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences in the recognition of income and expense for financial and income tax reporting
purposes. These deferred income taxes will be recognized as future tax benefits or costs when the temporary differences reverse.

Components of deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:

A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. In 2012, a $2.1 million valuation allowance for foreign carryforwards was recorded.

State and foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately $2.8 million expire in various periods from December 31, 2014 to
December 31, 2029. State net operating loss carryforwards in the amount of $50.0 million expire in various periods from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2033.



As of December 31, 2012, the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax
positions was $11.3 million, of which $3.7 million, if recognized, would favorably affect the Company’s effective income tax rate. As of December 31, 2011, the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions was
$8.2 million, of which $2.1 million, if recognized, would favorably affect the Company’s effective tax rate. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions follows:

The Company includes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As
of December 31, 2011, the total interest and penalties accrued was approximately $2.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, the total interest and penalties accrued was approximately $2.8 million and $1.5
million, respectively.

The Internal Revenue Service is currently auditing the 2009 and 2010 tax years. With limited
exception, the Company is no longer subject to examination by various U.S. and foreign taxing authorities for years before 2009.

At this time, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $3.1 million may change within the next 12 months due to the expiration of statutory
review periods and current examinations.



11.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

The computation of earnings per share from operations is as follows:

Options to purchase approximately 19,000, 25,000, and 15,000 shares of Common Stock were outstanding in
2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options’ exercise price exceeded the average market price of the common shares.

12.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

As of December 31, 2012, the Company maintains employee stock-based compensation plans for stock options,
restricted stock, and incentive stock awards as governed by the 2011 Stock Incentive Compensation Plan (the “2011 Plan”) and the 2000 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the “2000 Plan”). The 2011 Plan has a 10 year term through
March 27, 2021 and provides a maximum of 1,900,000 shares for grants or awards; no shares have been granted or awarded under this 2011 Plan as of December 31, 2012. The 2011 Plan was approved by stockholders of Wabtec on May 11, 2011.
As of December 31, 2012, the number of shares available for future grants under the 2000 Plan was 89,640 shares. The Company also maintains a 1995 Non-Employee Directors’ Fee and Stock Option Plan (“the Directors Plan”). The
Directors Plan, as amended, authorizes a total of 500,000 shares of Common Stock to be issued. Under the Directors Plan options issued become exercisable over a three-year vesting period and expire ten years from the date of grant and restricted
stock issued under the plan vests one year from the date of grant. As compensation for directors’ fees for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company issued a total of 11,005, 11,636 and 18,302 shares of restricted stock
to non-employee directors. The total number of shares issued under the plan as of December 31, 2012 was 402,943 shares. No awards may be made under the 2000 Plan or the Directors Plan subsequent to October 31, 2016.



Stock-based compensation expense was $19.8 million, $18.6 million and $11.8 million for the
years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company recognized associated tax benefits related to the stock-based compensation plans of $5.9 million, $5.1 million and $3.0 million for the respective periods. Included in the
stock-based compensation expense for 2012 above is $2.4 million of expense related to stock options, $4.8 million related to non-vested restricted stock, $606,000 related to restricted stock units, $11.2 million related to incentive stock awards and
$800,000 related to awards issued for Directors’ fees. At December 31, 2012, unamortized compensation expense related to those stock options, non-vested restricted shares and incentive stock awards expected to vest totaled $20.2 million
and will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.0 years.

Stock Options

Stock options are granted to
eligible employees and directors at the fair market value, which is the average of the high and low Wabtec stock price on the date of grant. Under the 2011 Plan and the 2000 Plan, options become exercisable over a four year vesting period and expire
10 years from the date of grant.

The following table summarizes the Company’s stock option activity and related
information for the 2011 Plan, the 2000 Plan and Directors Plan for the years ended December 31:

Options outstanding at December 31, 2012 were as follows:



The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

The dividend yield is based on the Company’s dividend rate and the current market price of the
underlying common stock at the date of grant. Expected life in years is determined from historical stock option exercise data. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The risk-free interest rate is
based on the 7 year U.S. Treasury bond rates for the expected life of the option.

Restricted Stock and Incentive Stock

Beginning in 2006 the Company adopted a restricted stock program. As provided for under the 2011 and 2000 Plans, eligible employees are granted restricted stock that generally vests over four years from the date of grant. Under the Directors
Plan, restricted stock awards vest one year from the date of grant.

In addition, the Company has issued incentive stock
awards to eligible employees that vest upon attainment of certain cumulative three-year performance goals. Based on the Company’s performance for each three year period then ended, the incentive stock awards can vest and be awarded ranging from
0% to 200% of the initial incentive stock awards granted. The incentive stock awards included in the table below represent the number of shares that are expected to vest based on the Company’s estimate for meeting those established performance
targets. As of December 31, 2012, the Company estimates that it will achieve 200%, 200% and 126% for the incentive stock awards expected to vest based on performance for the three year periods ending December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014,
respectively, and has recorded incentive compensation expense accordingly. If our estimate of the number of these stock awards expected to vest changes in a future accounting period, cumulative compensation expense could increase or decrease and
will be recognized in the current period for the elapsed portion of the vesting period and would change future expense for the remaining vesting period.

Compensation expense for the non-vested restricted stock and incentive stock awards is based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant and recognized over the applicable
vesting period.



The following table summarizes the restricted stock activity for the 2011Plan, the 2000
Plan and the Directors Plan, and incentive stock awards activity for the 2011 Plan and the 2000 Plan with related information for the years ended December 31:

PREFERRED STOCK

The Company’s authorized capital stock includes 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The Board of Directors has
the authority to issue the preferred stock and to fix the designations, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such class or series, including dividend rates, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption and liquidation
preferences, without any further vote or action by the Company’s shareholders. The rights and preferences of the preferred stock would be superior to those of the common stock. At December 31, 2012 and 2011 there was no preferred stock
issued or outstanding.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

ASC 820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
fair value and explains the related disclosure requirements. ASC 820 indicates, among other things, that a fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or
liability or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability and defines fair value based upon an exit price model.

Valuation Hierarchy.

ASC 820 establishes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to valuation used to measure fair value. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as
follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on the Company’s assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities
at fair value. A financial asset or liability’s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.



The following table provides the liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring
basis as of December 31, 2012, which are included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance sheet:

The following table provides the liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of
December 31, 2011, which are included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance sheet:

As a result of our global operating activities the Company is exposed to market risks from changes in
foreign currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial position. When deemed appropriate, the Company minimizes these risks through entering into foreign currency forward contracts. The foreign currency
forward contracts are valued using broker quotations, or market transactions in either the listed or over-the counter markets. As such, these derivative instruments are classified within level 2.

The Company’s defined benefit pension plan assets consist primarily of equity security funds, debt security funds and temporary cash
and cash equivalent investments. Generally, all plan assets are considered Level 2 based on the fair value valuation hierarchy (See Note 9 “Employee Benefit Plans” included herein).

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company is subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water, the
handling, storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances. The Company believes its operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the
various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business; however, there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements.

Under terms of the purchase agreement and related documents for the 1990 Acquisition, American Standard, Inc., now known as
Trane (“Trane”), has indemnified the Company for certain items including, among other things, certain environmental claims the Company asserted prior to 2000. If Trane was unable to honor or meet these indemnifications, the Company would
be responsible for such items. In the opinion of Management, Trane currently has the ability to meet its indemnification obligations.

Claims have been filed against the Company and certain of its affiliates in various jurisdictions across the United States by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing
products. Most of these claims have been made against our wholly owned subsidiary, Railroad Friction Products Corporation (“RFPC”), and are based on a product sold by RFPC prior to the time that the Company acquired any interest in RFPC.



Most of these claims, including all of the RFPC claims, are submitted to insurance carriers
for defense and indemnity or to non-affiliated companies that retain the liabilities for the asbestos-containing products at issue. We cannot, however, assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors or
insurers will remain financially viable. Our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims, as is the case with other pending litigation, cannot be estimated.

It is Management’s belief that the potential range of loss for asbestos-related bodily injury cases is not reasonably determinable
at present due to a variety of factors, including: (1) the asbestos case settlement history of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, RFPC; (2) the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation in general; and (3) the
uncertainty of asbestos litigation in particular. Despite this uncertainty, and although the results of the Company’s operations and cash flows for any given period could be adversely affected by asbestos-related lawsuits, Management believes
that the final resolution of the Company’s asbestos-related cases will not be material to the Company’s overall financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In general, this belief is based upon: (1) Wabtec’s and
RFPC’s history of settlements and dismissals of asbestos-related cases to date; (2) the inability of many plaintiffs to establish any exposure or causal relationship to RFPC’s product; and (3) the inability of many plaintiffs to
demonstrate any identifiable injury or compensable loss.

More specifically, as to RFPC, Management’s belief that any
losses due to asbestos-related cases would not be material is also based on the fact that RFPC owns insurance which provides coverage for asbestos-related bodily injury claims. To date, RFPC’s insurers have provided RFPC with defense and
indemnity in these actions. The overall number of new claims being filed against RFPC has dropped significantly in recent years; however, these new claims, and all previously filed claims, may take a significant period of time to resolve. As to
Wabtec and its divisions, Management’s belief that asbestos-related cases will not have a material impact is also based on its position that it has no legal liability for asbestos-related bodily injury claims, and that the former owners of
Wabtec’s assets retained asbestos liabilities for the products at issue. To date, Wabtec has been able to successfully defend itself on this basis, including two arbitration decisions and a judicial opinion, all of which confirmed Wabtec’s
position that it did not assume any asbestos liabilities from the former owners of certain Wabtec assets. Although Wabtec has incurred defense and administrative costs in connection with asbestos bodily injury actions, these costs have not been
material, and the Company has no information that would suggest these costs would become material in the foreseeable future.

A competitor of the Company, Faiveley Transport USA, Inc. and certain of its affiliated entities, sued the Company in U.S. District Court
for the Southern District of New York in May, 2010 alleging misappropriation of trade secrets and related claims stemming from an expired License Agreement. In April 2011 the court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary
judgment on several of their claims. Following a jury trial on damages plaintiffs were awarded $18.1 million, plus interest, and a final verdict in this amount was entered in July 2011. The Company recorded a charge in the second quarter
of 2011 in the amount of $18.1 million. The Company appealed the verdict to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On February 6, 2013, the appellate court issued a summary order decreeing that the judgment awarding damages be
vacated and remanded to the district court for a new trial limited to the issue of damages unless the Faiveley plaintiffs agreed to reduce the amount of damages previously awarded to $15 million, plus interest. No further proceedings have
occurred since the date of the appellate court’s order.

From time to time the Company is involved in litigation relating
to claims arising out of its operations in the ordinary course of business. As of the date hereof, the Company is involved in no litigation that the Company believes will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of
operations or liquidity.

cars and buses, builds new commuter locomotives and refurbishes subway cars. Customers include public transit authorities and municipalities, leasing companies, and manufacturers of subway cars and buses around the world.

The Company evaluates its business segments’ operating results based on income from operations. Corporate activities include general
corporate expenses, elimination of intersegment transactions, interest income and expense and other unallocated charges. Since certain administrative and other operating expenses and other items have not been allocated to business segments, the
results in the following tables are not necessarily a measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and may not be comparable to other companies.
