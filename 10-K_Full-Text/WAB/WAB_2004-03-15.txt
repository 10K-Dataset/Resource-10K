BUSINESS

General

Westinghouse Air Brake
Technologies Corporation, doing business as Wabtec Corporation, is a Delaware corporation with headquarters at 1001 Air Brake Avenue in Wilmerding, Pa. Our telephone number is 412-825-1000, and our website is located at www.wabtec.com. All
references to “we”, “our”, “us”, the “Company” and “Wabtec” refer to Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries. Originally founded by George Westinghouse in 1869,
Westinghouse Air Brake Company (“WABCO”) was formed in 1990 when it acquired certain operations from American Standard, Inc. (ASI). The current business includes the combined assets from the November 1999 merger of WABCO and MotivePower
Industries, Inc. (“MotivePower”).

Wabtec is one of the world’s
largest providers of value-added, technology-based equipment and services for the global rail industry. We believe we hold a greater than 50% market share in North America for our primary braking-related equipment and a number 1 or number 2 position
in North America for most of our other product lines. Our highly engineered products, which are intended to enhance safety, improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers, can be found on virtually all U.S. locomotives, freight cars
and passenger transit vehicles. We are a “Tier 1” supplier with approximately 44% of our net sales in 2003 to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). In 2003, the Company had sales of $717.9 million and net income of $22.7 million.

Management and insiders of the Company own approximately 12% of Wabtec’s
outstanding shares, with the balance held by investment companies and individuals. Executive management incentive compensation focuses on earnings, cash flow and working capital targets to align management interests with those of outside
shareholders.

Industry Overview

The Company primarily serves the worldwide freight and passenger transit rail industries.
The worldwide market for rail equipment has been estimated at about $70 billion annually, and it is estimated to grow at about 4% annually for the next five years. Our operating results are largely dependent on the level of activity, financial
condition and capital spending plans of the global railroad industry. Many factors influence the industry, including general economic conditions; rail traffic, as measured by freight tonnage and passenger ridership; government investment in public
transportation; and investment in new technologies by freight and passenger rail systems. Customers in North America account for about 79% of Wabtec’s sales.

In North America, railroads carry about 42% of intercity freight, as measured by ton-miles, which is more than any other mode of
transportation. They are an integral part of the continent’s economy and transportation system, serving nearly every industrial, wholesale and retail sector. Through direct ownership and operating partnerships, U.S. railroads are part of an
integrated network that includes railroads in Canada and Mexico, forming what is regarded as the world’s most- efficient and lowest-cost freight rail service. There are more than 500 railroads operating in North America, with the largest
railroads, referred to as “Class I,” accounting for more than 90% of the industry’s revenues. Although the railroads carry a wide variety of commodities, coal accounts for the most tons and revenues (about 45% and about 20%,
respectively, in 2003). Intermodal traffic – the movement of trailers or containers by rail in combination with another mode of transportation – has been the railroads’ fastest-growing market segment in the past 10 years. Railroads
operate in a competitive environment, especially with the trucking industry, and are always seeking ways to improve safety, cost and reliability. New technologies offered by Wabtec and others in the industry can provide some of these benefits.

Outside of North America, most of the rail systems have historically been
focused on passenger transit, rather than freight. In recent years, however, railroads in countries such as Australia, India and China have been investing capital to expand and improve both their freight and passenger rail systems. Throughout the
world, government-owned railroads are being sold to private owners, who often look to improve the efficiency of the rail system by investing in new equipment and new technologies. These investment programs represent additional opportunities for
Wabtec to provide products and services.

In the U.S., public transportation is
a $32 billion industry, dependent largely on funding from federal, state and local governments, and from fare box revenues. With about 40% of the nation’s transit vehicles, New York City is the largest transit market in the U.S. Transit
ridership is near an all-time high, after increasing throughout the 1990’s due to steady growth in the U.S. economy. Ridership declined 1.3% in 2002, however, as the economy slowed. Based on preliminary figures for 2003, ridership is expected
to decline at about the same rate. In response to lower fare box revenues and government funding cutbacks, transit authorities have delayed capital expenditures for new equipment and deferred maintenance on existing equipment. New York City,
however, has continued to invest in new equipment, as demonstrated by its order for up to 1,700 new subway vehicles, including options, which are expected to be delivered beginning in 2006.

Demand for our products and services in North America are driven by a number of factors,
including:

•

Rail traffic.

The Association of American Railroads (AAR) compiles statistics that gauge the level of activity in the freight rail industry. Two important
statistics are revenue ton-miles and carloadings, which are generally referred to as “rail traffic”. According to preliminary AAR estimates for 2003, revenue ton-miles increased about 1.9% and carloadings increased about 0.4% compared to



2002. This is the first year since 1999 that both measures increased in the same year, which we believe should maintain an improving marketplace for Wabtec.
As rail traffic increases, we believe that our customers will increase their level of spending on equipment and equipment maintenance.

•

Demand for new locomotives.

Currently, the active locomotive fleet in the North American market is about 20,000 units. The average number of new locomotives delivered over
the past 10 years was about 1,000 annually. In 2003, about 750 new, heavy-haul locomotives were delivered, down from 969 in 2002. In 2004, we expect the industry to deliver about 1,050 new locomotives, as railroads opt to purchase new units before
stricter U.S. federal government emissions standards take effect in January 2005.

•

Demand for new freight cars

. Currently, the active freight car fleet in North America is about 1.3 million units. The average number of new freight cars delivered over the
past 10 years was about 50,000 annually. In 2003, new freight car deliveries were substantially below the 10-year average for the third consecutive year (about 31,400 compared to about 17,700 in 2002). We expect that about 37,500 new units will be
delivered in 2004 and that the rate of new deliveries will continue to increase by about 10% in the next several years to meet railroad demand.

Demand for North American transit products is driven by a number of factors, including:

•

Replacement, building and/or expansion programs of transit authorities.

These programs are funded in part by national and local government programs. Currently, the U.S.
federal government is considering a new spending proposal, known as SAFETEA, that would provide federal funding for transit projects for the fiscal years 2004-09. Although the amount of future funding is yet to be finalized, the current proposal
calls for a funding level of about $7.2 billion in fiscal year 2004 (about the same as in fiscal year 2003), with annual increases of about 2% per year through fiscal year 2009. The amount of funding in the legislation will have an impact on the
capital spending plans of transit authorities. In recent years, U.S. federal funding for transit projects has generally served as a countercyclical balance during the downturn in our freight rail markets. The average annual number of new transit car
deliveries over the past 10 years was about 600 units. In 2003, we estimate that about 670 transit vehicles were delivered compared to 1,320 in 2002. The decrease was due to the completion of a major multiple-year car replacement program for New
York City. In late 2002, New York City placed another major order for new subway cars, with deliveries expected to begin in 2006. Management expects the annual transit vehicle delivery rate to be in the range of 500-800 units for the next several
years as disclosed under item 7 of this report.

•

Ridership levels

. Ridership on U.S. transit vehicles increased steadily from 1995-2001. In 2002, ridership decreased for the first time since 1995 due to higher unemployment
levels in the U.S. The lower ridership level, as well as government funding cutbacks, negatively impacted aftermarket spending in 2002 and 2003. We anticipate that the current underspending will create a pent-up demand for maintenance and service
work when ridership and funding levels increase in future years.

Business Segments and Products

We provide our products and
services through two principal business segments, the Freight Group and the Transit Group. The Freight Group manufactures and services components for new and existing freight cars and locomotives, while the Transit Group does the same for passenger
transit vehicles, typically subways and buses. Both business segments serve OEMs and provide aftermarket services with the aftermarket accounting for about 56% of net sales. In 2003, the Freight Group accounted for 73% of our total net sales, and
the Transit Group accounted for the remaining 27%. In 2003, the Freight Group generated 39% of its net sales from OEMs and Class I railroads and 61% of its net sales from the aftermarket, while the Transit Group generated 59% of its net sales from
OEMs and 41% of its net sales from the aftermarket. A summary of our leading product lines across both of our business segments is outlined below.

•

Brakes and related components

•

Brake assemblies

•

Draft gears, couplers and slack adjusters

•

Air compressors and dryers

•

Railway electronics, including event recorders, control and monitoring equipment, and end of train devices

•

Friction products

•

We manufacture, sell and service high-quality electronics for railroads in the form of on-board systems and braking for locomotives and freight cars. We harden our
products to protect them from severe conditions, including extreme temperatures and high-vibration environments. Recently, we have concentrated our new product development on extending electronic technology to braking and control systems.

We have become a leader in the rail industry by capitalizing on the strength
of our existing products, technological capabilities and new product innovation. Our new product development effort has focused on electronic technology for brakes and controls. Over the past several years, we introduced a number of significant new
products including electronic brakes and Positive Train Control equipment that encompasses onboard digital data and global positioning communication protocols. The Transit Group also focuses on new product development



and has introduced a number of new products during the past several years. Supported by our technical staff of over 500 engineers and specialists, we have
extensive experience in a broad range of product lines, which enables us to provide comprehensive, systems-based solutions for our customers. We currently own over 2,000 active patents worldwide and 500 U.S. patents. During the last three years, we
have filed for more than 150 U.S. patents in support of our new and evolving product lines.

For additional information on our business segments, see Note 20 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.

Competitive Strengths

Our key strengths include:

•

Leading market positions in core products

. Dating back to 1869 and George Westinghouse’s invention of the air brake, we are an established leader in the development and
manufacture of pneumatic braking equipment for freight and passenger transit vehicles. We have leveraged our leading position by focusing on research and engineering to expand beyond pneumatic braking system components to supplying integrated parts
and assemblies for the whole locomotive through the end-of-train. We are a recognized leader in the development and production of electronic recording, measuring and communications systems, highly engineered compressors and heat exchange systems for
locomotives and a leading manufacturer of freight car components, including electronic braking equipment, draft gears, brake shoes and electronic end-of-train devices. Additionally, we are a leading provider of complete door systems and couplers for
passenger and transit vehicles.

•

Breadth of product offering with a stable mix of OEM and aftermarket business

. We believe that our substantial installed base of products to the OEMs is a significant
competitive advantage for providing products and services to the aftermarket because end-users often look to purchase safety and performance-related replacement parts from the original supplier. In addition, we believe our product portfolio is one
of the broadest in the rail industry, as we offer a wide selection of quality parts, components and assemblies across the entire train. Over the last several years, approximately 50% of our total net sales have come from our aftermarket products and
services business.

•

Leading design and engineering capabilities

. We believe a hallmark of our relationship with our customers has been our leading design and engineering practice, which has, in
our opinion, assisted in the improvement and modernization of global railway equipment. We believe both our customers and the federal transit authorities value our technological capabilities and commitment to innovation, as we seek not only to
enhance the efficiency and profitability of our customers, but also to improve the overall safety of the railways through continuous product improvement.

•

Significant barriers to entry

. We believe that there are a number of company- and industry-specific factors that represent meaningful barriers to entry:

•

Proprietary product offering

. We have an established record of product improvements and new product development. We have assembled a wide range of patented products, which we
believe provides us with a competitive advantage.

•

Substantial installed base.

We believe our installed base presents a meaningful barrier to entry in both the new product market and the aftermarket. As OEMs and Class I
railroad operators attempt to modernize fleets with new products designed to improve and maintain safety and efficiency, new products must be designed to be interoperable with existing equipment. We believe our dedicated research and development
staff and comprehensive product offering enables us to leverage our installed base to maintain our leadership position with OEMs and the Class I railroads. Similarly, we believe our substantial installed base makes us a preferred supplier in the
aftermarket, as end-users typically prefer to source performance and safety-related replacement parts and service from the original product supplier.

•

Regulatory nature of the rail industry.

Oversight of the U.S. rail industry is governed by a number of federal regulatory agencies, including the National Transportation
Safety Board (NTSB), the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and the AAR. These groups mandate rigorous manufacturer certification and new product testing and approval processes that we believe are difficult for new entrants to meet
cost-effectively and efficiently without the scale and extensive experience we possess.

•

Experienced management team

. Our management team has over 150 years of combined experience with the Company, and implemented numerous initiatives that
enabled us to manage the sharp cyclical downturn in the rail supply market in 2001 and 2002. Our management team has implemented the Wabtec Quality and Performance System (QPS), an ongoing program that focuses on “lean manufacturing”
principles and continuous improvement across all aspects of our business. In addition, in 2001, we completed a plan to eliminate excess manufacturing capacity by closing several facilities, realigning operations, reducing head count and divesting
certain non-core assets. Since 2000, we have also reduced our debt by approximately $350 million, lowering our percentage of debt to book capitalization from 73% at December 31, 2000 to 43% at December 31, 2003. As a result of these initiatives, our
management team has improved our cost structure, operating leverage and financial flexibility and placed us



in an excellent position to benefit from growth opportunities in an improving market environment.

Business strategy

We are focused on executing the following four-point growth strategy:

•

Expand systems offerings as “Tier 1” supplier

. We are currently a “Tier 1” supplier to OEMs in certain markets, but desire to expand our business with
these customers to become an even more integral part of their operations. We plan to focus on integrating our electronic, pneumatic and mechanical technologies within and across business units and combining them as a complete package. Increasingly,
customers will be able to purchase complete assemblies from us, rather than purchasing individual components from multiple suppliers. This will likely improve reliability and reduce product integration issues. We expect this capability to strengthen
our position against competitors that do not have the breadth and depth of our product line. In addition, we will have the opportunity to service these assemblies in the aftermarket when they require replacement, upgrade or repair. In this way, we
expect to increase the installed base of our products over time.

•

Accelerate new product and service development

. During the recent industry downturn, we maintained research and development spending at historical levels and continued to
fund major development projects, and we will continue to emphasize research and development to create new and improved products. We are focusing on technological advances, especially in the areas of electronics, braking products and other on-board
equipment, as a means of new product growth. We seek to provide customers with incremental technological advances that offer immediate benefits with cost effective investments. In addition, we are focused on expanding the level and type of
aftermarket services that we currently provide to customers. In this way, we expect to take advantage of the industry trend toward outsourcing, as railroads and transit authorities’ focus on their core function of transporting goods and people,
rather than maintaining and servicing their equipment.

•

Expand globally

. Our net sales outside of North America totaled 21% in 2003, up from 16% in 2002, and we believe that international markets represent a significant
opportunity for future growth. We intend to increase our existing international sales through strategic acquisitions, direct sales of products through our existing subsidiaries and licensees and joint ventures with railway suppliers having a strong
presence in their local markets. We are specifically targeting markets that operate significant fleets of U.S.-style locomotives and freight cars, including Australia, China, India, Russia, South Africa, South America and select areas within Europe.

•

Continuous improvement through lean principles

. We intend to build on what we consider to be a leading position as a low-cost producer in the industry while maintaining
world-class product quality, technology and customer responsiveness. Through QPS and employee-directed initiatives such as Kaizen, a Japanese-developed team concept, we continuously strive to improve quality, delivery and productivity, and to reduce
costs. These efforts enable us to streamline processes, improve product quality and customer satisfaction, reduce product cycle times and respond more rapidly to market developments. Over time, we expect these lean initiatives to enable us to
increase profit margins, which would improve cash flow and strengthen our ability to invest in new product and service programs.



Backlog

In 2003, 56% of our sales came from aftermarket orders. Aftermarket orders typically carry lead times of less than 30 days, so they are not recorded in backlog for a
significant period of time. As such, the Company’s backlog is primarily an indicator of future original equipment sales, not expected aftermarket activity.

The Company’s contracts are subject to standard industry cancellation provisions, including cancellations on short notice or upon completion of designated stages.
Substantial scope-of-work adjustments are common. For these and other reasons, completion of the Company’s backlog may be delayed or cancelled, so backlog should not be relied upon as an indicator of the Company’s future performance. The
railroad industry, in general, has historically been subject to fluctuations due to overall economic conditions and the level of use of alternative modes of transportation.

The backlog of customer orders as of December 31, 2003, and December 31, 2002, and the expected year of completion are as follows.



Engineering and Development

To execute our strategy to develop new products, we invest in a variety of engineering and development activities. For the fiscal years
ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, we invested about $32.9 million, $33.6 million and $33.2 million, respectively, on product development and improvement activities. Approximately 40% of these costs comprise activities solely devoted to new
product development in any given year. These engineering and development expenditures, in total, represent about 4.6%, 4.8% and 4.2% of net sales for the same periods, respectively. Sometimes we conduct specific research projects in conjunction with
universities, customers and other railroad product suppliers.

Our engineering
and development program is largely focused upon train control and new braking technologies, with an emphasis on applying electronics to traditional pneumatic equipment. Electronic braking has been used in the transit industry for a long time, but
freight railroads have been slower to accept the technology due to issues over interchangeability, connectivity and durability. We are proceeding with efforts to enhance the major components for existing hard-wired braking equipment and development
of new electronic technologies for the freight railroads.

We use our Product
Development System (PDS) to develop and monitor all new product programs. The system requires the product development team to follow consistent steps throughout the development process, from concept to launch, to ensure the product will meet
customer expectations and internal profitability targets.

Intellectual
Property

We have more than 2,000 active patents worldwide. We also rely
on a combination of trade secrets and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our intellectual property.

Certain trademarks, among them the name WABCO

®

, were acquired or licensed from American Standard Inc. in 1990 at the time of our acquisition of the North American operations of the
Railway Products Group of American Standard.

We are a party, as licensor and
licensee, to a variety of license agreements. We do not believe that any single license agreement is of material importance to our business or either of our business segments as a whole.

We entered into a license agreement with SAB WABCO Holdings B.V. (SAB) on December 31, 1993, pursuant to which SAB granted us a license to
the intellectual property and know-how related to the manufacturing and marketing of certain disc brakes, tread brakes and low noise and resilient wheel products. SAB is a former affiliate of Wabtec, since both were owned by the same parent company
in the early 1990s. In 2002, SAB was purchased by Vestar Capital Partners IV, L.P., an affiliate of Vestar Equity Partners, L.P. and Vestar Capital Partners, Inc., both of which were then significant shareholders of Wabtec.

In November 2003, Vestar Equity Partners and Vestar Capital Partners sold their entire stake
in Wabtec, consisting of 2,440,000 Wabtec common shares, in a registered secondary offering. The SAB license expired December 31, 2003, but has been renewed for an additional one-year term as provided in the license agreement. The license may be
renewed for additional one-year terms.

We have issued licenses to the two sole
suppliers of railway air brakes and related products in Japan, NABCO Ltd. and Mitsubishi Electric Company. The licensees pay annual license fees to us and also assist us by acting as liaisons with key Japanese passenger transit vehicle builders for
projects in North America. We believe that our relationships with these licensees have been beneficial to our core transit business and customer relationships in North America.

Customers

Our customers include railroads throughout North America, as well as in Australia, South Africa, India, Italy and the United Kingdom; manufacturers of transportation
equipment, such as locomotives, freight cars, subway vehicles and buses; lessors of such equipment; and passenger transit authorities, primarily those in North America.

In 2003, about 79% of our sales were to customers in North America, but we also shipped products to more than 62 countries throughout the
world. About 56% of our sales were in the aftermarket, with the rest of our sales to OEMs of locomotives, freight cars, subway vehicles and buses.

Our top five customers, Northeast Illinois Railroad Corporation (Metra), General Electric Transportation Systems, Bombardier, Burlington Northern Santa Fe and Alstom
accounted for 26% of our net sales in 2003. Our top customer, Metra, represented 7% of consolidated sales. We believe that we have strong relationships with all of our key customers.

Competition

We believe that we hold a greater than 50% market share in North America for our primary braking-related equipment and a No. 1 or No. 2 market position in North America
for most of our other product lines. Nonetheless, we operate in a highly competitive marketplace. Price competition is strong because we have a relatively small number of customers and they are very cost-conscious.

In addition to price, competition is based on product performance and technological
leadership, quality, reliability of delivery, and customer service and support. Our principal competitors vary to some extent across product lines, but most competitors are smaller, privately held companies. Within North America, New York Air Brake
Company, a subsidiary of the German air brake producer Knorr-Bremse AG, is our principal overall OEM competitor. Our competition for locomotive, freight and passenger transit service and repair is



primarily from the railroads’ and passenger transit authorities’ in-house operations, the Electro-Motive Division of General Motors, General
Electric Transportation Systems, and New York Air Brake/Knorr. We believe our key strengths, which include leading market positions in core products, breadth of product offering with a stable mix of OEM and aftermarket business, leading design and
engineering capabilities, significant barriers to entry and an experienced management team enable us to compete effectively in this marketplace.

Employees

At December 31, 2003, we had 4,482 full-time employees, approximately 36% of whom were unionized. A majority of the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements are within North America and these agreements
generally extend through late 2004, 2005 and 2006.

We consider our relations
with our employees and union representatives to be good, but cannot assure that future contract negotiations will be favorable to us.

Regulation

In the course of our operations, we are subject to various regulations of agencies and other entities. In the United States, these include principally the FRA and the AAR.

The FRA administers and enforces federal laws and regulations relating to railroad safety.
These regulations govern equipment and safety standards for freight cars and other rail equipment used in interstate commerce.

The AAR oversees a wide variety of rules and regulations governing safety and design of equipment, relationships among railroads with respect to railcars in interchange
and other matters. The AAR also certifies railcar builders and component manufacturers that provide equipment for use on railroads in the United States. New products generally must undergo AAR testing and approval processes.

As a result of these regulations and regulations in other countries in which we derive our
revenues, we must maintain certain certifications as a component manufacturer and for products we sell.

Effects of Seasonality

Our business is
not typically seasonal, although the third quarter results may be impacted by vacation and plant shutdowns at several of its major customers during this period.

Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

Wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of value-added, technology-based products and services for the global rail industry. Our products are found on
virtually all locomotives, freight cars and passenger transit vehicles in the U.S., as well as in certain markets throughout the world. Our products enhance safety, improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers, and many of our
core products and services are essential in the safe and efficient operation of freight rail and passenger transit vehicles.

Wabtec is a global company with operations in nine countries. In 2003, about 79 percent of the Company’s revenues came from its North American operations, but Wabtec
also sold products or services in 62 countries around the world.

Management
Review of 2003 and Future Outlook

Wabtec’s long-term financial goals
are to generate free cash flow in excess of net income, maintain a strong credit profile while minimizing our overall cost of capital, increase margins through strict attention to cost controls, and increase revenues through a focused growth
strategy. In addition, management monitors the Company’s short-term operational performance through measures such as quality and on-time delivery.

In 2003, we achieved the following:

•

Generated cash of $56 million, more than double net income of $23 million;

•

Debt net of cash, was $120 million at Dec. 31, 2003, compared to $176 million at the end of 2002;

•

Gross margin increased to 26.4% compared to 25.8% for 2002, as a favorable product mix and cost reductions more than offset the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates;

•

Revenues increased 3%, as higher sales of freight car original equipment in North America and higher international sales combined to offset lower sales of aftermarket components and
transit original equipment;

•

Product quality, as measured by first-time pass rate, improved by 40%;

•

On-time delivery increased 8%.

We achieved these results despite continued weakness in demand for aftermarket products and services, and a 23% drop in sales in the Transit Group, which completed
several major contracts in 2002. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on the Company’s Canadian operations.

We expect increased demand for our products as the U.S. economy recovers, government transit spending increases and Class I railroads, utilities and leasing companies
begin to reinvest in their fleets after deferring capital spending during the difficult U.S. economic environment since 2001. We anticipate that this increased capital spending will positively impact rail industry fundamentals, which have shown
gradual improvement over the past few quarters, as evidenced by better-than-expected freight car orders and backlog. For example, freight car deliveries increased to 9,170 in the fourth quarter of 2003, an increase of 11% over the prior quarter and
up 91% over the prior year. The table below demonstrates the improving trends in the freight car segment of the rail industry:

Source: Railway Supply Institute

Freight car, locomotive and transit car deliveries for the industry are
expected to trend upwards providing an expanding market for the Company:

Based on company estimates

In 2004, we expect demand to improve in two of our key markets (components
for new freight cars and new locomotives), but we do not expect growth in the aftermarket, which represents about 56% of sales.



Looking beyond 2004, we expect to generate increases in sales and earnings from executing our four-point growth strategy
(see page 5 for more details):

•

Expand sales of systems offerings as “Tier 1” supplier;

•

Accelerate new product and service development;

•

Expand globally;

•

Continuous improvement through lean principles.

In 2004 and beyond, we will continue to face many challenges, including increased costs for raw materials, especially steel; higher costs for medical and insurance
premiums; and foreign currency fluctuations. In addition, we face general economic risks, as well as the risk that our customers could curtail spending on new and existing equipment. Risks associated with our four-point growth strategy include the
level of investment that customers are willing to make in new technologies developed by the industry and the Company, and risks inherent in global expansion. When necessary, we will modify our financial and operating strategies to reflect changes in
market conditions and risks.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following table shows our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years indicated.



2003 COMPARED TO 2002

The following table summarizes the results of operations for the period:

In 2002, we completed fair value
assessments of goodwill and wrote down the carrying value of goodwill by $90 million ($83.2 million for the Freight Group and $6.8 million for the Transit Group) in accordance with the adoption of SFAS No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets.” The total impact of the writedown, net of taxes, was $61.7 million.

The following table shows the Company’s net sales by business segment:

Net sales.

Net sales for 2003
increased $21.7 million, or 3.1%, as compared to 2002. The increased sales in the Freight Group more than offset lower sales in the Transit Group. The Freight Group’s increased sales reflected higher sales of components for new freight cars and
locomotives, and commuter locomotives, as well as higher international sales. Industry deliveries of new freight cars for 2003 increased to about 31,400 units as compared to about 17,700 in 2002. The Transit Group’s decreased sales were due to
the completion of a contract to supply components for New York City subway cars in 2002 and lower aftermarket sales.

Gross profit.

Gross profit increased to $189.5 million in 2003 compared to $179.5 million in 2002. Gross profit is dependent on a number of factors including
pricing, sales volume and product mix. Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 26.4% compared to 25.8% in 2002. The increase in gross profit percentage is primarily due to higher sales and favorable product mix, which more than offset the
negative impact of the weakening U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar.

The
following table shows our operating expenses:

Operating expenses.

Operating
expenses increased $5.8 million in 2003 as compared to 2002 due to the write-off of non-operating assets of $1.6 million, and higher medical and insurance premiums, partially offset by reduced amortization expense. Amortization expense decreased due
to certain intangible assets having been fully amortized.

Income from
operations

. Income from operations totaled $51.7 million (or 7.2% of sales) in 2003 compared with $47.5 million (or 6.8% of sales) in 2002. Higher operating income resulted from increased sales and gross margins, but was partially offset by
increased operating expenses in 2003.

Interest expense.

Interest
expense decreased 42.6% in 2003 as compared to 2002 primarily due to a substantial decrease in debt.

Other expense.

The Company recorded foreign exchange losses from the translation of balance sheet accounts of $2.8 million and $1.2 million, respectively, in 2003 and 2002.

Income taxes.

The effective income tax rate was 36.5% for 2003 and 32% for 2002. The
change in the effective tax rate was due to a higher effective state tax rate and increased statutory rates in foreign jurisdictions. Also, increased income has reduced the significance of the favorable impact the Company’s utilization of
foreign tax credits has on the effective tax rate.

Net income

. Net
income for 2003 increased $68.2 million, compared with 2002, which included a $61.7 million, net of tax, write off of goodwill. Income before the cumulative effect of an accounting change increased $6.5 million, compared with 2002. The increase was
due to increased sales, improved margins, and lower interest expense.



2002 COMPARED TO 2001

The following table summarizes the results of operations for the period:

A number of events occurred over the
comparative period that impacted our results of operations and financial condition including:

•

In 2002, we completed fair value assessments of goodwill and wrote down the carrying value of goodwill by $90 million ($83.2 million for the Freight Group and $6.8 million for the
Transit Group) in accordance with the adoption of SFAS No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” The total impact of the writedown, net of tax was $61.7 million.

•

In July 2002, we redeemed at par (face) $175 million of the 9.375% senior notes due in 2005 through the use of cash on hand and additional borrowings under the credit agreement.
This redemption resulted in a non-cash loss of $1.9 million, relating to a write-off of deferred debt issuance costs, which was recorded as interest expense.

•

In November 2001, we sold certain assets to GE Transportation Systems for $238 million in cash. The assets sold primarily included locomotive aftermarket products and services for
which we were not the OEM. The sale resulted in an after-tax gain of $48.7 million, which is reflected on the income statement as a gain, net of tax, on the sale of discontinued operations.

•

In the fourth quarter of 2001, we decided to exit certain businesses. The net amount of these businesses was written down to their estimated realizable value. This resulted in a
pre-tax charge of $9.3 million and an after-tax charge of $7.2 million.

Merger and Restructuring Plan.

In 2001, the Company completed a merger and restructuring plan with costs totaling $71 million pre-tax, with approximately $2 million of the charge expensed in 2001, $20 million in 2000 and $49 million
in 1999. The plan involved the elimination of duplicate facilities and excess capacity, operational realignment and related workforce reductions, and the evaluation of certain assets as to their perceived ongoing benefit to the Company.

The following table shows the Company’s net sales by business segment:

Net sales

. Net sales for 2002
decreased $87.5 million or 11.2% to $696.2 million as compared to the prior period. Both the Freight Group and Transit Group had lower sales. The Freight Group’s decreased sales reflected lower sales of components for new freight cars and
locomotives. In 2002, industry deliveries of new freight cars decreased to 17,717 units as compared to 34,247 in the same period in 2001. In 2002, industry deliveries of new locomotives decreased to 969 as compared to 1,085 in the same period in
2001. The Transit Group’s decreased sales were primarily due to the completion of a supply contract for New York City subway cars in the third quarter of 2002.

Gross profit.

Gross profit decreased to $179.5 million (or 25.8% of sales) in 2002 compared to $209.9 million (or 26.8% of sales) in
the same period of 2001. The decrease in gross profit and margin is largely attributed to the effect of a decrease in sales volumes, which had a negative impact of about $35 million.

The following table shows our operating expenses for the period:

Operating expenses.

Operating
expenses improved by $23.9 million in 2002 as compared to 2001. Included in operating expenses for 2001 were goodwill amortization of $7 million, $9.3 million for asset writedowns, $3.7 million for merger and restructuring charges and $1.7 million
for severance costs in 2001. The remaining decrease in operating expenses was due to a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses.



Income from operations.

Income from operations totaled $47.5 million in 2002 compared with $54.1 million in 2001.
Operating income would have been $75.8 million in 2001 excluding the adjustments discussed in the prior paragraph. Lower operating income resulted from decreased sales volumes in 2002 (see Note 20 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report).

Interest
expense.

Interest expense decreased 46.1% in 2002 as compared to 2001, primarily due to a decrease in debt and interest rates.

Other expense.

The Company recorded foreign exchange losses of $1.2 million and $1.7 million, respectively, in 2002 and 2001 due to exchange rate fluctuations.
Also in 2002, the Company wrote down a facility held for sale, resulting in a $2 million charge.

Income taxes.

The effective income tax rate for 2002 was 32% as compared to 24.2% in 2001. The rate includes the effect of research and development and foreign tax credits of $772,000 and $2 million
respectively, for 2002 and 2001. Excluding these tax credits, the rate would have been 35% in both 2002 and 2001.

Net income

. Net income decreased $107.3 million, or 173.6%, compared with the same period the prior year. However, adjusting for the 2001 gain on sale of certain
businesses of $41.5 million, and the 2002 goodwill writedown of $61.7 million (net of tax), net income declined $4.1 million, principally the result of overall lower sales activity in 2002 compared to 2001.

Income taxes

In the next three years cash outlays for income taxes will be less then income tax expense due to the amortization of goodwill and
intangible assets which will continue to be amortized for tax purposes. The Company’s current level of pre-tax income is sufficient to utilize the deferred tax assets. As of 2003 the Company has utilized all previous federal net operating
losses, and a portion of the reported federal credits in the amount of $3.2 million will be realized through a carry back regardless of current income generated. The Company engages in diverse foreign activity whereby certain funds could be
repatriated to the U.S. This would afford the Company the opportunity to utilize certain assets more quickly. Management believes tax planning opportunities exist in various foreign countries that will allow the Company to utilize foreign net
operating loss carryforwards. Any tax assets that are uncertain regarding realization have a valuation allowance in the full amount of the asset. Management believes the remaining assets will be realized in the normal course of business.

Significant differences between pre-tax earnings for financial reporting purposes and
taxable income for income tax purposes consist of the following:



Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity is provided primarily by operating cash flow and borrowings under our credit facilities with a consortium of commercial banks
(“credit agreement”). The following is a summary of selected cash flow information and other relevant data:

The following is a reconciliation of
EBITDA to net income (loss):

EBITDA is defined as earnings before
deducting interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. Although EBITDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, management believes that it is useful to an investor
in evaluating Wabtec because it is widely used as a measure to evaluate a Company’s operating performance and ability to service debt. Financial covenants in our credit facility include ratios based on EBITDA. EBITDA does not purport to
represent cash generated by operating activities and should not be considered in isolation or as substitute for measures of performance in accordance with



generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, because EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies, the presentation here may not be
comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Management’s discretionary use of funds depicted by EBITDA may be limited by working capital, debt service and capital expenditure requirements, and by restrictions related to
legal requirements, commitments and uncertainties.

Operating activities.

Operating cash flow in 2003 was $55.9 million as compared to $15.7 million in 2002. Working capital remained relatively unchanged, as receivables and inventory increased $13.2 million, and accounts payable increased $14.1 million.

Operating cash flow in 2002 was $15.7 million as compared to $119.1 million in the same
period a year ago. Working capital decreased $6 million in 2002, as inventory decreased by $16 million while payables and accruals decreased by $10 million. Cash from operating activities in 2001 was positively impacted by the sale of certain
businesses and its corresponding reduction in working capital.

During 2002 and
2001, cash outlays for merger and restructuring activities were approximately $2.5 million and $6.8 million, respectively, and are reported as a reduction to cash provided by operating activities. Also, in 2002, $30 million was paid in taxes related
to the gain on the sale of locomotive aftermarket assets in 2001. The operating cash flow in 2002 excluding the $30 million tax payment from 2001 was approximately $46 million.

Investing activities.

In 2003 and 2002, cash used in investing activities was $12.5 and $10.8 million, respectively, consisting
almost entirely of capital expenditures, net of disposals. In 2001 cash provided by investing activities was $227.4 million. Adjusting 2001 for the gross proceeds from the sale of certain businesses for $238 million, cash used by investing
activities would have been approximately $10.6 million. In 2002 and 2001 we used $1.7 million and $3.7 million for certain business acquisitions. See Note 5 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of
this report, for further information.

Capital expenditures for continuing
operations were $17.5 million, $14.1 million and $20.7 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The majority of capital expenditures for these periods relates to upgrades to and replacement of existing equipment.

Financing activities.

In 2003, cash provided by financing activities was $9.2 million
compared to cash used by financing activities of $44.1 million in 2002.

In
2003, we issued $150 million of Senior Notes due in August 2013 (“the Notes”). The Notes were issued at par and interest accrues at 6.875% and is payable semi-annually on January 31 and July 31 of each year, commencing on January 31, 2004.
The proceeds were used to repay debt outstanding under the Company’s then existing bank credit agreement, and for general corporate purposes.

The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and rank pari passu with all existing and future senior debt and senior to all our existing and future
subordinated indebtedness of the Company. The indenture under which the Notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things, the following: the incurrence of indebtedness, payment of dividends and certain
distributions, sale of assets, change in control, mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens.

In November 2003, we issued common stock in connection with the registration and sale of stock by certain selling shareholders. We issued 726,900 shares of common stock realizing total proceeds of about $10 million.
See “Prospectus Summary — Recent development.”

Cash used for
financing activities was $44.1 million in 2002 versus $297.2 million in 2001. During 2002, we reduced long-term debt by $45.9 million. During 2001, we reduced long-term debt by $298.3 million. We repaid $175 million of senior notes in the third
quarter of 2002 to take advantage of lower interest rates on our revolving credit agreement. Historically, we have financed the purchase of significant businesses utilizing cash flow generated from operations and amounts available under its credit
facilities.

The following table shows our outstanding indebtedness at December
31, 2003 and 2002. The revolving credit note and other term loan interest rates are variable and dependent on market conditions.

Cash balance at December 31, 2003 and
2002 was $70.3 million and $19.2 million, respectively. The financial statements have been prepared based on the terms of the Refinanced Credit Agreement.

Credit agreements.

In November 1999, we refinanced the then existing unsecured MotivePower credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a consortium of
commercial banks. This unsecured Credit Agreement provided a $275 million five-year revolving credit facility expiring in November 2004 and a 364-day $275 million convertible revolving credit facility maturing in November 2004. In November 2001, we



and the banks negotiated a reduction in the 364-day facility to $100 million, as a result of the $208 million, net of tax, cash proceeds from the sale of
locomotive businesses to GE. In November 2002, we negotiated a further reduction in the 364-day facility from $100 million to $95 million. In July 2003, we and the banks negotiated a reduction in both facilities to a total of $225 million as a
result of the issuance of the Senior Notes. The $225 million facility provided a reduced five-year facility of $167.2 million and a reduced 364-day facility of $57.8 million. In November 2003 we allowed the $57.8 million 364-day facility to expire.
At December 31, 2003, we had available bank borrowing capacity, net of $19.6 million of letters of credit, of approximately $107.7 million.

Under the Credit Agreement, we may elect a base rate, an interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rates of Interest (“LIBOR”), a cost of funds rate
and a bid rate. The base rate is the greater of LaSalle Bank National Association’s prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% per annum. The LIBOR rate is based on LIBOR plus a margin that ranges from 87.5 to 200 basis points
depending on our consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios. The current margin is 137.5 basis points. The cost of funds rate is a fluctuating interest rate based on LaSalle Bank National Association’s then cost of funds. Under the bid
rate option, any participating bank may propose the interest rate at which it will lend funds, which rate may either be a fixed rate or a floating rate based on LIBOR.

The Credit Agreement limits our ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits us from declaring or making other distributions,
subject to certain exceptions. The credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations: incurrence of additional indebtedness; mergers, consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions;
additional liens; sale and leasebacks; permissible investments, loans and advances; certain debt payments; capital expenditures; and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio.

The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including payment defaults,
failure of representations or warranties to be true in any material respect, covenant defaults, defaults with respect to other indebtedness of the Company, bankruptcy, certain judgments against the Company, ERISA defaults and “change of
control” of the Company.

Credit Agreement borrowings bear variable
interest rates indexed to the indices described above. The maximum credit agreement borrowings, average credit agreement borrowings and weighted-average contractual interest rate on credit agreement borrowings were $209 million, $129.3 million and
2.68%, respectively for 2003. To reduce the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of this variable-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swaps which effectively convert a portion of the debt from variable to fixed-rate borrowings during
the term of the swap contracts. On December 31, 2003, the notional value of interest rate swaps outstanding totaled $40 million and effectively changed our interest rate from a variable rate to a fixed rate of 3.98%. The interest rate swap
agreements mature in February 2006. We are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties. However, since only the cash interest payments are exchanged, exposure is significantly less than the notional amount. The
counterparties are large financial institutions and we do not anticipate nonperformance.

In January 2004, we refinanced the Credit Agreement with a consortium of commercial banks. This “Refinancing Credit Agreement” currently provides a $175 million five-year revolving credit facility expiring
in January 2009. Under the Refinancing Credit Agreement, we may elect a base rate or an interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rates of Interest (“LIBOR”). The base rate is the greater of LaSalle Bank National
Association’s prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% per annum. The LIBOR rate is based on LIBOR plus a margin that ranges from 100 to 200 basis points depending on our consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios. The
current margin is 175 basis points.

The Refinancing Credit Agreement limits
our ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits us from declaring or making other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. The Refinancing Credit Agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following
limitations: incurrence of additional indebtedness; mergers, consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions; additional liens; sale and leasebacks; permissible investments, loans and advances; certain debt payments; capital expenditures; and
imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio.

The Refinancing Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including payment defaults, failure of representations or warranties to be true in any material respect, covenant defaults, defaults with respect
to other indebtedness of the Company, bankruptcy, certain judgments against the Company, ERISA defaults and “change of control” of the Company. Financial covenants include Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio, Maximum Total Debt to EBITDA
Ratio, Minimum Net Worth Measurement, and Capital Expenditures Limitations. The Company is in compliance with these measurements and covenants and expects that these measurements will not be any type of limiting factor in executing our operating
activities. See Note 9 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.

We believe, based on current levels of operations and forecasted earnings, cash flow and liquidity will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital equipment
needs as well as meeting the debt service requirements. If our sources of funds were to fail to satisfy our cash requirements, we may need to refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing. There is no assurance that such new financing
alternatives would be



available, and, in any case, such new financing, if available, would be expected to be more costly and burdensome than the debt agreements currently in
place.

Extinguishment of other debt.

In June 1995, the Company issued
$100 million of 9.375% Senior Notes due in 2005 (the “1995 Notes”). In January 1999, the Company issued an additional $75 million of 9.375% Senior Notes due in 2005 (the “1999 Notes”). The 1995 Notes and the 1999 Notes were
redeemed at par (face) on July 8, 2002 through the use of cash on hand and additional borrowings under the credit agreement. This redemption resulted in a non-cash loss of $1.9 million relating to a write-off of deferred debt issuance costs.

In July 1998, a subsidiary of the Company entered into a 10 year $7.5 million
debt obligation for the purchase of a building used in the Company’s operations. The debt was repaid in September 2003.

Effects of Inflation

General price inflation has not had a material impact on the Company’s results of operations. Some of our labor contracts contain negotiated salary and benefit increases and others contain cost of living
adjustment clauses, which would cause our labor cost to automatically increase if inflation were to become significant.



Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We are obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements,
lease agreements and have certain contingent commitments such as debt guarantees. We have grouped these contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements into operating activities, financing activities, and investing activities in the same
manner as they are classified in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows to provide a better understanding of the nature of the obligations and arrangements and to provide a basis for comparison to historical information. The table below provides a
summary of contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2003:

(1)

Unconditional purchase obligations for the purposes of this disclosure have been defined as a
contractual obligation to purchase utilities, electricity, natural gas that is in excess of $100,000 annually, and $200,000 in total. Long-term purchase obligations for the purposes of this disclosure have been defined as a contractual obligation to
purchase raw materials or supplies that are non-cancelable, and are in excess of $100,000 annually, and $200,000 in total.

(2)

Future minimum payments for operating leases are disclosed by year in Note 15 of the
“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.

(3)

Annual payments and funding are expected to continue into the foreseeable future at the
amounts or ranges noted. Pension funding payments are based on actuarial estimates using current assumptions for discount rates, expected return on long-term assets and rate of compensation increases. See further disclosure in Note 10 of the
“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.

(4)

Annual payments and funding are expected to continue into the foreseeable future at the
amounts or ranges noted. To estimate the funding requirements, historical benefit payments were utilized assuming 22 percent rate of inflation. See further disclosure in Note 10 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included
in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.

(5)

Scheduled principal repayments of outstanding loan balances (as refinanced subsequent to
December 31, 2003) are disclosed by year in Note 9 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.

(6)

Shareholder dividends are subject to approval by the Company’s Board of Directors,
currently at an annual rate of $1.8 million.

(7)

The annual capital expenditure budget is subject to approval by the Board of Directors. The
2004 budget amount of $20 million was approved at the February 2004 Board of Directors meeting.

(8)

The Company has $19.6 million in outstanding letters of credit for performance and bid bond
purposes, all of which expire in 2004.

(9)

Guarantee for debt of former operating unit sold in 2001.

Obligations for operating activities.

We have not entered into any material long-term
non-cancelable materials and supply purchase obligations. Operating leases represent multi-year obligations for rental of facilities and equipment. Estimated pension funding and post retirement benefit payments are based on actuarial estimates using
current assumptions for discount rates, expected return on long-term assets, rate of compensation increases and health care cost trend rates. Benefits paid for pension obligations were $5.7 million and $5.6 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Benefits paid for post retirement plans were $2.1 million and $1.9 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. We expect these minimum levels of funding to continue in future periods.

Obligations for financing activities.

Cash requirements for financing activities consist primarily of long-term debt repayments and
dividend payments to shareholders. We have historically paid quarterly dividends to shareholders, subject to quarterly approval by our Board of Directors, currently at a rate of $1.8 million annually.

In 2001, we sold a subsidiary to that unit’s management team. As part of the sale, we
guaranteed approximately $3 million of bank debt of the buyer, which was used for the purchase financing. In the event that the purchaser cannot repay or refinance the debt without a guarantee by us, the subsidiary would be returned to us. This debt
is due in 2004. We have no reason to believe that this debt will not be repaid or refinanced.

Obligations for investing activities.

Historically, we typically spend approximately $15-20 million a year for capital expenditures, primarily related to facility expansion efficiency and modernization, health
and safety, and environmental control.



We expect annual capital expenditures in the future will be within this range. In 2004, we have two properties currently
under contract for sale and expect to generate approximately $5 million in sale proceeds once these transactions close.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions
regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Areas of uncertainty that require judgments, estimates and
assumptions include the accounting for derivatives, environmental matters, warranty reserves, the testing of goodwill and other intangibles for impairment, proceeds on assets to be sold, pensions and other postretirement benefits, and tax matters.
Management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments and estimates, and actual results will inevitably differ from those estimates and assumptions that are used to prepare the Company’s financial
statements at any given time. Despite these inherent limitations, management believes that Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) and the financial statements and related footnotes
provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the Company. A discussion of the judgments and uncertainties associated with accounting for derivatives and environmental matters can be found in Note 2 in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.

A summary of the
Company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report. Management believes that the application of these policies on a
consistent basis enables the Company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the Company’s operating results and financial condition.



In 2002, we adopted the new standard of accounting for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. The
cumulative effect adjustment recognized on January 1, 2002, upon adoption of the new standard, was a charge of $61.7 million (after tax). Also in 2002, amortization ceased for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Total amortization
expense for intangible assets recognized was $3.4 million in 2003 and $4 million in 2002. Additionally, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are required to be tested for impairment at least annually. The evaluation of impairment involves
comparing the current fair value of the business to the recorded value (including goodwill). We use a combination of a guideline public company market approach and a discounted cash flow model (“DCF model”) to determine the current fair
value of the business. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the DCF model to forecasted operating cash flows, including markets and market share, sales volume and pricing, costs to produce and working
capital changes. Management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values of its business are estimated. However, actual fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those
used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill.

The allowance for doubtful
accounts receivable reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available evidence.

Other areas of significant judgments and estimates include the liabilities and
expenses for pensions and other postretirement benefits. These amounts are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions, including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability, the long-term rate of
return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce (salary increases, medical costs, retirement age and mortality). The rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined considering the rates available at
year-end on debt instruments that could be used to settle the obligations of the plan. The long-term rate of return is estimated by considering historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally
applied to a five-year average market value of assets.

As a global company,
Wabtec records an estimated liability or benefit for income and other taxes based on what it determines will likely be paid in various tax jurisdictions in which it operates. Management uses its best judgment in the determination of these amounts.
However, the liabilities ultimately realized and paid are dependent on various matters including the resolution of the tax audits in the various affected tax jurisdictions and may differ from the amounts recorded. An adjustment to the estimated
liability would be recorded through income in the period in which it becomes probable that the amount of the actual liability differs from the recorded amount. Management does not believe that such a charge would be material.

Item 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk

In the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to risks that increases in interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with its variable-rate debt. After considering the effects of interest rate
swaps, further described below, our variable rate debt represents 0% of total long-term debt at December 31, 2003 and 66% in 2002. Management has entered into pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swap contracts that mitigates the impact of
variable-rate debt interest rate increases. At December 31, 2003, an instantaneous 100 basis point increase in interest rates would not reduce our annual earnings. We have adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No.
133, and as amended by SFAS 138, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” effective January 1, 2001. In the application, we have concluded that our swap contracts qualify for “special cash flow hedge
accounting” which permit recording the fair value of the swap and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income on the balance sheet (see Note 21 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of
this report). This fluctuation is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

We occasionally enter into several types of financial instruments for the purpose of managing our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in countries in
which we have significant operations. As of December 31, 2003, we had several such instruments outstanding to hedge currency rate fluctuation in 2004.

We entered into foreign currency options and forward contracts to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. A currency option gives us the right but not
the obligation to exchange currency at a pre-determined exchange rate either on a specific date or within a specific period of time. Forward contracts are agreements with a counterparty to exchange two distinct currencies at a set exchange rate for
delivery on a set date at some point in the future. There is no exchange of funds until the delivery date. At the delivery date we can either take delivery of the currency or settle on a net basis. All outstanding forward contracts and option
agreements are for the sale of U.S. Dollars (USD) and the purchase of Canadian Dollars (CAD). As of December 31, 2003, we had outstanding option agreements with a notional value of $10.5 million CAD resulting in the recording of a current asset of
$270,000 and an increase in comprehensive income of $171,000, net of tax and has forward contracts with a notional value of $13.5 million CAD, resulting in the



recording of a current asset of $100,000 and an increase in comprehensive income of $64,000, net of tax.

Subsequent to December 31, 2003, The Company entered into additional forward contracts to
hedge its exposure to Canadian currency risk. Including the forwards outstanding at the end of 2003, the forward contracts currently have a total notional value of $83 million CAD (or $62 million USD), with an average exchange rate of $0.747 USD per
$1 CAD.

We are also subject to certain risks associated with changes in
foreign currency exchange rates to the extent our operations are conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For the year ended December 31, 2003, approximately 69% of Wabtec’s net sales are in the United States, 9% in Canada, 1% in
Mexico, and 21% in other international locations, primarily Europe. (See Note 20 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report).

Our market risk exposure is not substantially different from our exposure at December 31, 2002.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

As reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K dated May 30, 2002, we dismissed Arthur Andersen LLP as our independent public accountants on
May 30, 2002 and, after a review of several possible candidates, appointed Ernst & Young LLP to serve as our independent public accountants for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 in accordance with the recommendation of our Board
of Directors and its Audit Committee. We dismissed Arthur Andersen LLP as our auditor because we believed that the firm could no longer provide the necessary services on a global basis. There were no disagreements with Arthur Andersen reported.

Item 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Wabtec’s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of Wabtec’s “disclosure controls and
procedures,” (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of December 31, 2003. Based upon their evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that Wabtec’s disclosure controls and procedures are
effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by Wabtec in the reports filed or submitted by it under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC’s rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by Wabtec in such reports is accumulated and communicated to Wabtec’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal
finance officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

There was no change in Wabtec’s “internal control over financial reporting” (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2003, that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Wabtec’s internal control over financial reporting

EXHIBITS, FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES, AND REPORTS ON FORM 8-K

The financial statements, financial statement schedules and exhibits listed below are filed as part of this annual report:









REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To the Board of
Directors and Shareholders of

Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for the years then ended. Our audit also included the financial statement schedule for the year ended December 31, 2003
listed in the index in Item 15(a) of this Registration Statement. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. The
financial statements of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001, and for the year then ended were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations. Those auditors expressed an unqualified opinion
on those financial statements in their report dated February 18, 2002.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Also in our opinion,
the financial statement schedule referred to above, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

As more fully discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January
1, 2002, Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

(SFAS No. 142).

As discussed above, the consolidated financial statements of Westinghouse Air Brake
Technologies Corporation as of December 31, 2001, and for the year then ended were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations. As described in Note 8, these financial statements have been revised to include the transitional disclosures
required by SFAS No. 142, which was adopted by the Company as of January 1, 2002. Our audit procedures with respect to the disclosures in Note 8 with respect to 2001 included (a) agreeing the previously reported net income to the previously issued
financial statements and the adjustments to reported net income representing amortization expense (including any related tax effects) recognized in those periods related to goodwill as a result of initially applying Statement No. 142 to the
Company’s underlying records obtained from management, and (b) testing the mathematical accuracy of the reconciliation of adjusted net income to reported net income, and the related earnings per share amounts. In our opinion, the disclosures
for 2001 in Note 8 are appropriate. However, we were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the 2001 financial statements of the Company other than with respect to such disclosures and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or
any other form of assurance on the 2001 financial statements taken as a whole.

BUSINESS

Wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of value-added, technology-based products and services for the global rail industry. Our products are found on virtually all U.S. locomotives, freight cars and
passenger transit vehicles, as well as in certain markets throughout the world. Our products enhance safety, improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers, and many of our core products and services are essential in the safe and
efficient operation of freight rail and passenger transit vehicles.

Wabtec is
a global company with operations in nine countries. In 2003, about 79 percent of the Company’s revenues came from its North American operations, but Wabtec also sold products or services in 62 countries around the world.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority owned subsidiaries. Such statements
have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Sales between subsidiaries are billed at prices consistent with sales to third parties and are eliminated in consolidation.

Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments purchased with
an original maturity of three months or less.

Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and
other currently available evidence. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $4.5 million and $4.6 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined under the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Inventory costs include
material, labor and overhead.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment additions are stated at cost. Expenditures for renewals and improvements are capitalized. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The Company provides for book depreciation
principally on the straight-line method. Accelerated depreciation methods are utilized for income tax purposes.

Leasing Arrangements

The Company conducts a portion of its operations from leased facilities and finances certain equipment purchases through lease
agreements. In those cases in which the lease term approximates the useful life of the leased asset or the lease meets certain other prerequisites, the leasing arrangement is classified as a capital lease. The remaining arrangements are treated as
operating leases.

Intangible Assets

The Company adopted SFAS No.
142 effective January 1, 2002, and, as a result, goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized. Other intangibles (with definite lives) are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives.
Goodwill effective January 1, 2002 is reviewed annually for impairment while amortizable intangibles are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment are present.

Warranty Costs

Warranty costs are accrued based on management’s estimates of repair or upgrade costs per unit and
historical experience. In recent years, the Company has introduced a number of new products. The Company does not have the same level of historical warranty experience for these new products as it does for its continuing products. Therefore,
warranty reserves have been established for these new products based upon management’s estimates. Actual future results may vary from such estimates. Warranty expense was $10.5 million, $17.6 million and $14.1 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Warranty reserves were $13.3 million and $17.4 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Deferred Compensation Agreements

In May 1998, a consensus on Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 97-14, “Accounting for Deferred Compensation
Arrangements Where Amounts Earned Are Held in a Rabbi Trust and Invested” (“EITF 97-14”), was issued. The adoption of EITF 97-14 required the Company to record as treasury stock the historical value of the Company’s stock
maintained in its deferred compensation plans.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax
rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The provision for income taxes includes federal, state and foreign income taxes.



Stock-Based Compensation

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure.” SFAS No. 148 amends SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” to provide alternate methods of transition to SFAS No. 123’s fair value method of accounting
for stock-based compensation. The statement amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures about the method of accounting for compensation cost associated with employee stock option plans, as well as the effect
of the method used on reported results. The Company adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148 and has not changed its method for measuring the compensation cost of stock options.

The Company continues to use the intrinsic value based method and does not recognize
compensation expense for the issuance of options with an exercise price equal to or greater than the market price of the stock at the time of grant. As a result, the adoption of SFAS No. 148 had no impact on our results of operations or financial
position.

Had compensation expense for these plans been determined based on
the fair value at the grant dates for awards, the Company’s net income and earnings per share would be as set forth in the following table. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value is amortized to expense over the
options’ vesting period.

For purposes of presenting pro forma
results, the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

The Black-Scholes option valuation
model was developed for use in estimating fair value of traded options, which are significantly different than employee stock options. Although this valuation model is an acceptable method for use in presenting pro forma information, because of the
differences in traded options and employee stock options, the Black-Scholes model does not necessarily provide a single measure of the fair value of employee stock options.

Financial Derivatives and Hedging Activities

The Company periodically enters into interest rate swap agreements to reduce the
impact of interest rate changes on its variable rate borrowings. Interest rate swaps are agreements with a counterparty to exchange periodic interest payments (such as pay fixed, receive variable) calculated on a notional principal amount. The
interest rate differential to be paid or received is recognized as interest expense.

The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133, and as amended by SFAS 138, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” effective January 1, 2001, resulting in the
recording of current assets of $266,000, long term assets of $399,000, current liabilities of $760,000, long term liabilities of $1.1 million, and a decrease in other comprehensive loss of $1.2 million. In the application, the Company has concluded
its interest rate swap contracts qualify for “special cash flow hedge accounting” which permit recording the fair value of the swap and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss) on the balance sheet. At December 31,
2003, and as a result of entering into these interest rate swaps, the Company is expected to incur $600,000 in additional interest expense in 2004.

The Company also entered into foreign currency options and forward contracts to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. A currency option gives the
Company the right but not the obligation to exchange currency at a pre-determined exchange rate either on a specific date or within a specific period of time. Forward contracts are agreements with a counterparty to exchange two distinct currencies
at a set exchange rate for delivery on a set date at some point in the future. There is no exchange of funds until the delivery date. At the delivery date the Company can either take delivery of the currency or settle on



a net basis. All outstanding forward contracts and option agreements are for the sale of U.S. Dollars and the purchase of Canadian Dollars (CAD). As of
December 31, 2003, the Company has outstanding option agreements with a notional value of $10.5 million CAD resulting in the recording of a current asset of $270,000, and an increase in comprehensive income of $171,000, net of tax and has forward
contracts with a notional value of $13.5 million CAD, resulting in the recording of a current asset of $100,000, and an increase in comprehensive income of $64,000, net of tax. At December 31, 2003, and as a result of entering into these foreign
currency forward and option contracts, the Company is not expected to incur any additional currency exchange loss or gain in 2004.

Subsequent to December 31, 2003, The Company entered into additional forward contracts to hedge its exposure to Canadian currency risk. Including the forwards outstanding
at the end of 2003, the forward contracts currently have a total notional value of $83 million CAD (or $62 million U.S.), with an average exchange rate of $0.747 USD per $1 CAD.

Foreign Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, except for the Company’s Mexican operations
whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, are translated at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date while income and expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Foreign currency gains and
losses resulting from transactions, and the translation of financial statements are recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements based upon the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 52,
“Foreign Currency Translation.” The effects of currency exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions and balances of a long-term investment nature are accumulated and carried as a component of shareholders’ equity. The effects
of currency exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions that are non U.S. dollar denominated amounts are charged or credited to earnings. Foreign exchange loss was $2.8 million, $1.2 million and $1.7 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive
income (loss) is defined as net income and all other non-owner changes in shareholders’ equity. The Company’s accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consists of foreign currency translation adjustments, unrealized gains and losses
on derivatives designated and qualified as cash flow hedges, foreign currency hedges and pension related adjustments

.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 101, “Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.”
Wabtec recognizes revenue upon the passage of title, ownership and risk of loss to the customer.

The Company recognizes revenues on long-term contracts based on the percentage of completion method of accounting. Contract revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised quarterly, at a minimum, and adjustments
are reflected in the accounting period as known. Provisions are made for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts as known, if necessary. Certain pre-production costs relating to long term production and supply contracts have been deferred and will
be amortized over the life of the contract. Deferred pre-production costs were $3.4 million and $700,000 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Significant Customers and Concentrations of Credit Risk

The Company’s trade receivables are primarily from rail and transit industry original equipment
manufacturers, Class I railroads, railroad carriers and commercial companies that utilize rail cars in their operations, such as utility and chemical companies. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated net sales
in 2003. One customer, in the transit group, accounted for 11% of the Company’s consolidated net sales in 2002 and 2001.

Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs

All fees billed to the customer for shipping and handling are classified as a component of net revenues. All costs
associated with shipping and handling is classified as a component of cost of sales.

Research and Development

Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company incurred costs of approximately $32.9
million, $33.6 million and $33.2 million, respectively.

Employees

As of December 31, 2003, approximately 36% of the Company’s workforce was covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements are generally effective through 2004, 2005 and 2006.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per common share are computed by dividing net
income applicable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share are computed by dividing net income applicable to common shareholders by the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding adjusted for the assumed conversion of all dilutive securities (such as employee stock options).

Reclassifications

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified, where necessary, to conform to the current year presentation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts could differ from the estimates. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates based on currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised
estimates.



Recent Accounting Pronouncements.

In April 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
149, “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” SFAS No. 149 amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for
hedging activities under SFAS No. 133. The provisions of this statement are effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003 and should be applied prospectively. SFAS
No. 149 has no impact on the Company’s financial statements or results of operations.

In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity.” SFAS No. 150 requires that certain
financial instruments embodying an obligation to transfer assets or to issue equity securities be classified as liabilities. It is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective July 1,
2003. SFAS No. 150 has no impact on the Company’s financial statements or results of operations.

Effective December 31, 2003, Wabtec adopted SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003), “Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other Post-retirement Benefits – an Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88 and
106” for its U.S. pension plans. This standard requires additional disclosures about an employer’s pension plans and postretirement benefits such as: the type of plan assets, investment strategy, measurement date, plan obligations, cash
flows, and components of net periodic benefit costs recognized during interim periods. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the required additional disclosures.

During 2003, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. (“FIN”) 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
for Guarantees.” FIN 45 requires increased disclosure of guarantees, including those for which likelihood payment is remote, and product warranty information (see Note 16). FIN 45 also requires that guarantors recognize a liability for certain
types of guarantees equal to the fair value of the guarantee upon its issuance. The adoption of FIN 45 has no impact on the Company’s financial statements or results of operations.

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities.” A variable interest entity (“VIE”) is one where the contractual or ownership interests in an entity change with changes in the entity’s net asset value. This interpretation requires the consolidation of a VIE by the
primary beneficiary, and also requires disclosure about VIEs where an enterprise has a significant variable interest but is not the primary beneficiary. The Company does not believe that this statement will have a material impact on the
Company’s financial statements or results of operations.

On December 8,
2003, President Bush signed into law the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act). The Act expanded Medicare to include, for the first time, coverage for prescription drugs. In January 2004, the FASB issued
Staff Position 106-1, “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003,” (FSP FAS 106-1). This position permits a sponsor of a postretirement health care plan that
provides a prescription drug benefit to make a one-time election to defer accounting for the effects of the Act. As permitted by FSP FAS 106-1, the Company has elected to defer financial recognition of this legislation until the FASB issues final
accounting guidance. In accordance with FSP FAS 106-1, appropriate disclosures related to the deferral election have been made in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

On November 1, 2001, the Company completed the sale of certain assets to GE Transportation Systems (GETS) for $238 million in cash. The assets sold primarily included
locomotive aftermarket products and services for which Wabtec was not the original equipment manufacturer. Under the terms of the sales agreement, the Company has agreed to indemnify GETS for, among other things, certain potential third party, off
site environmental cleanup or remediation costs. The Company has purchased an insurance policy to mitigate its exposure for the environmental indemnities. The Company reported a $48.7 million after tax gain on the sale in 2001.

In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company decided to exit other businesses and put these
businesses up for sale. The net assets of those businesses were written down to their estimated realizable value based on a multiple of earnings and was classified as Assets Held for Sale on the balance sheet. The Company reported a $7.2 million
after tax loss on the write-down of these entities.

As of December 31, 2003,
one of the businesses has not sold. The Company actively solicited but did not receive any reasonable offers to purchase the asset and, in response, had reduced the price. The asset is no longer being actively marketed and as a result, the Company
reclassed the business to continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2003. Such reclassification had no material impact on the financial statements.



In accordance with SFAS 144, the operating results of these businesses have been classified as discontinued operations
for all years presented and are summarized as of December 31, as follows:

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS

The Company did not make any acquisitions in 2003. During 2002 and 2001 the Company completed the following acquisitions:

i)

In February 2002, the Company purchased the minority interest of a business in India that the Company did not already own for $1.7 million.

ii)

In October 2001, the Company purchased certain assets of Milufab, a supplier of door panels for subway trains for $3.7 million.

These acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method. Accordingly, the results of
operations of the applicable acquisition are included in the Company’s financial statements prospectively from the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets was approximately $2.9 million
and was allocated to goodwill. Effective January 1, 2002, goodwill was no longer amortized upon adoption of SFAS No. 142.

6.

INVENTORY

The components of inventory, net of reserves, were:

PROPERTY, PLANT & EQUIPMENT

The major classes of depreciable assets are as follows:

The estimated useful lives of
property, plant and equipment are as follows:

Depreciation expense was $21 million,
$20.2 million and $20 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

8.

INTANGIBLES

The Company has adopted SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” effective January 1, 2002. Under its provisions, all goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer
amortized under a straight-line basis over the assets estimated useful life. Instead, they will be subject to periodic assessments for impairment by applying a fair-value-based test. In 2002, the Company completed the Phase I and Phase II
assessments and wrote down the carrying value of goodwill by $90 million ($83.2 million for the Freight Group and $6.8 million for the Transit Group), resulting in a non-cash after-tax charge of $61.7 million. The fair value of these reporting units
was determined using a combination of



discounted cash flow analysis and market multiples based upon historical and projected financial information. The Company also performed the required
impairment test in 2003 which resulted in no additional impairment charge. Goodwill still remaining on the balance sheet is $109.5 million at December 31, 2003.

As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company’s trademarks had a net carrying amount of $19.5 million and the Company believes these intangibles have an
indefinite life. Intangible assets of the Company, other than goodwill and trademarks, consist of the following:

In connection with the adoption of
SFAS No. 142, the Company reassessed the useful lives and the classification of its identifiable assets and determined that they continue to be appropriate. The weighted average useful life of patents was 13 years and of covenants not to compete was
five years.

Amortization expense for intangible assets was $3.4 million, $4
million and $11.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. Amortization expense for the five succeeding years is as follows (in thousands):


$

2,162


$

2,137


$

1,973


$

1,863


$

1,790

The changes in the carrying amount of
goodwill by segment for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, are as follows:

Actual results of continuing
operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, and pro forma results of continuing operations for 2001 had we applied the non-amortization provisions of SFAS No. 142 in these periods are as follows:

LONG-TERM DEBT

Long-term debt consisted of the following:



Credit Agreement

In November 1999, Wabtec refinanced the then existing unsecured MotivePower credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a consortium of commercial banks.
This unsecured Credit Agreement provided a $275 million five-year revolving credit facility expiring in November 2004 and a 364-day $275 million convertible revolving credit facility maturing in November 2004. In November 2001, the Company and the
banks negotiated a reduction in the 364-day facility to $100 million, as a result of the $208 million, net of tax, cash proceeds from the sale of certain businesses. In November 2002, the Company negotiated a further reduction in the 364-day
facility from $100 million to $95 million. In July 2003, the Company and the banks negotiated a reduction in both facilities to $225 million as a result of the issuance of the Senior Notes. The $225 million facility provided a reduced five-year
facility of $167.2 million and a reduced 364-day facility of $57.8 million. In November 2003, the Company allowed the $57.8 million 364-day facility to expire. At December 31, 2003, the Company’s available bank borrowing capacity, net of $19.6
million of letters of credit, was approximately $107.7 million.

Credit
Agreement borrowings bear variable interest rates indexed to the indices described below. The maximum credit agreement borrowings, average credit agreement borrowings and weighted-average contractual interest rate on credit agreement borrowings were
$209 million, $129.3 million and 2.68%, respectively for 2003. To reduce the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of this variable-rate debt, the Company entered into interest rate swaps which effectively convert a portion of the debt from
variable to fixed-rate borrowings during the term of the swap contracts. On December 31, 2003, the notional value of interest rate swaps outstanding totaled $40 million and effectively changed the Company’s interest rate on bank debt at
December 31, 2003 from a variable rate to a fixed rate of 3.98%. The interest rate swap agreements mature in February 2006. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties. However, since only the cash
interest payments are exchanged, exposure is significantly less than the notional amount. The counterparties are large financial institutions and the Company does not anticipate nonperformance.

As required by SFAS 145, the Company has reclassified a $1.2 million net of tax charge
related to the early extinguishment of debt in the third quarter of 2002, which had been previously recorded as an extraordinary item, to interest expense and income tax expense.

Refinancing Credit Agreement

In January 2004, the Company entered into a new credit agreement, refinancing its existing unsecured revolving Credit Agreement with a consortium of commercial banks.
This “Refinancing Credit Agreement” provides a $175 million five-year revolving credit facility expiring in January 2009. The financial statements have been prepared based on the terms of the Refinanced Credit Agreement.

Under the Refinancing Credit Agreement, the Company may elect a base rate or an interest rate
based on the London Interbank Offered Rates of Interest (“LIBOR”). The base rate is the greater of LaSalle Bank National Association’s prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% per annum. The LIBOR rate is based on
LIBOR plus a margin that ranges from 100 to 200 basis points depending on the Company’s consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios. The current margin is 175 basis points.

The Refinancing Credit Agreement limits the Company’s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the Company from declaring
or making other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. The Refinancing Credit Agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations: incurrence of additional indebtedness; mergers, consolidations and
sales of assets and acquisitions; additional liens; sale and leasebacks; permissible investments, loans and advances; certain debt payments; capital expenditures; and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash flow
ratio.

The Refinancing Credit Agreement contains customary events of default,
including payment defaults, failure of representations or warranties to be true in any material respect, covenant defaults, defaults with respect to other indebtedness of the Company, bankruptcy, certain judgments against the Company, ERISA defaults
and “change of control” of the Company.

6.875% Senior Notes Due
August 2013

In August 2003, the Company issued $150 million of Senior
Notes due in 2013 (“the Notes”). The Notes were issued at par. Interest on the Notes will accrue at a rate of 6.875% per annum and will be payable semi-annually on January 31 and July 31 of each year, commencing on January 31, 2004. The
proceeds were used to repay debt outstanding under the Company’s existing credit agreement, and for general corporate purposes.

The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and rank pari passu with all existing and future senior debt and senior to all our existing and future
subordinated indebtedness of the Company. The indenture under which the Notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things, the following: the incurrence of indebtedness, payment of dividends and certain
distributions, sale of assets, change in control, mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens,



Scheduled principal repayments of outstanding loan balances required as of December 31, 2003 are as follows:

Extinguishment of Other Borrowings

In June 1995, the Company issued $100 million of 9.375% Senior Notes due
in 2005 (the “1995 Notes”). In January 1999, the Company issued an additional $75 million of 9.375% Senior Notes due in 2005 (the “1999 Notes”). The 1995 Notes and the 1999 Notes were redeemed at par (face) on July 8, 2002
through the use of cash on hand and additional borrowings under the credit agreement. This redemption resulted in a non-cash loss of $1.9 million relating to a write-off of deferred financing costs.

In July 1998, a subsidiary of the Company entered into a 10- year $7.5 million debt
obligation for the purchase of a building used in the Company’s operations. The debt was repaid in September 2003.



10.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans that cover certain U.S., Canadian and United Kingdom employees and provide benefits of stated amounts for each year of
service of the employee.

Included in the above table, the
aggregate benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the pension plans with plan assets in excess of benefit obligations were $3 million and $3.4 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2003; and $2 million and $2.1 million,
respectively, as of December 31, 2002 (the total of which was pension plan benefit obligation in excess of plan assets).



The components of prepaid (accrued) benefit costs by country are as follows:

Pension Plan Assets

The composition of U.S. plan assets consists primarily of equities, corporate bonds,
governmental notes and temporary investments. This Plan’s asset allocations at December 31, 2003 by asset category are as follows:

Investment policies are determined by
the Plan’s Pension Committee and set forth in the Plan’s Investment Policy. Pursuant to the Plan’s Investment Policy, the investment strategy is to use passive index funds managed by the Bank of New York. The target asset allocation
and composite benchmarks include the following:

The Company’s funding methods,
which are primarily based on the ERISA requirements, differ from those used to recognize pension expense, which is primarily based on the projected unit credit method applied in the accompanying financial statements.

The Company expects to contribute $6.4 million to the pension plan during 2004 and that this
level of funding to continue in future periods. Rebalancing of the asset allocation occurs on a quarterly basis.

In 2002, as a result of an early retirement package offered to certain union employees, the Company incurred charges of approximately $1.2 million reflected above as a
special termination benefit.

In addition to providing pension benefits, the
Company has provided certain unfunded postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all U.S. employees. In January 1995 the postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for salaried employees was modified to
discontinue benefits for employees who had not attained the age of 50 by March 31, 1995. The Company is not obligated to pay health care and life insurance benefits to individuals who had retired prior to 1990.

The assumed health care cost trend rate grades from an initial rate of 8% to an ultimate rate
of 4.75% in four years. A 1% increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate will increase the amount of expense recognized for the postretirement plans by approximately $358,000 for 2004, and increase the service and interest cost components of
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $4.1 million. A 1% decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate will decrease the service and interest cost components of the expense recognized for the postretirement plans
by approximately $286,000 for 2004, and decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $3.4 million.

On December 8, 2003, President Bush signed into law the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act). The Act expanded Medicare to
include, for the first time, coverage for prescription drugs. The Company sponsors retiree medical programs for certain of its locations and expects that this legislation will reduce the Company’s costs for some of these programs in the future.

In January 2004, FASB Staff Position 106-1, “Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003” (FSP FAS 106-1) was issued which permits a sponsor of a postretirement health care plan that provides a prescription drug benefit to make a
one-time election to defer accounting for the effects of the Act. The Company is awaiting guidance from various governmental and regulatory agencies concerning the requirements that must be met to obtain these cost reductions as well as the manner
in which such savings should be measured. Based on this preliminary analysis, it appears that some of the Company’s retiree medical plans may need to be revised in order to qualify for beneficial treatment under the Act, while other plans can
continue unchanged

Defined Contribution Plans

The Company also participates in a variety of defined contribution, 401(k) and multiemployer
pension, health and welfare plans. Additionally, the Company has stock option -based benefit and other plans further described in Note 14.



Costs recognized under multi-employer and other defined contribution plans are summarized as follows:

The 401(k) savings plan is a
participant directed defined contribution plan that holds shares of the Company’s stock. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the plan held on behalf of its participants about 776,000 shares with a market value of $13.2 million, and 861,000 shares
with a market value of $12 million, respectively.

11.

INCOME TAXES

In general, the Company is responsible for filing consolidated U.S., foreign and combined, unitary or separate state income tax returns. The Company is responsible for paying the taxes relating to such returns,
including any subsequent adjustments resulting from the redetermination of such tax liabilities by the applicable taxing authorities.

The components of the income (loss) from continuing operations before provision for income taxes for the Company’s domestic and foreign operations for the years
ended December 31 are provided below:

No provision has been made for U.S.,
state or additional foreign taxes related to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which have been or are intended to be permanently re-invested. It is not practical to estimate the income tax expense or benefit that might be incurred if
these earnings were to be remitted to the U.S.

The consolidated provision
(credit) for income taxes included in the Statement of Income consisted of the following:

Consolidated income tax provision
(credit) is included in the Statement of Income as follows:

A reconciliation of the United States
federal statutory income tax rate to the effective income tax rate on continuing operations for the years ended December 31 is provided below:

Deferred income taxes result from
temporary differences in the recognition of income and expense for financial and income tax reporting purposes. These deferred income taxes will be recognized as future tax benefits or costs when the temporary differences reverse.



Components of deferred tax assets and (liabilities) were as follows:

A valuation allowance is provided when
it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $18.5 million for certain net operating loss carryforwards and deferred tax assets anticipated to
produce no tax benefit. The valuation allowance has increased in the current year by $3.9 million to be applied against certain state and foreign deferred tax assets.

State and foreign net operating loss carryforwards exist in the amount of $139 million and $20.5 million, respectively, and are set to
expire in various periods from 2006 to 2023. A valuation allowance has been established for certain of these net operating loss carryforwards.

Federal tax credits exist of approximately $5.6 million which are comprised of Research and Experimentation credits available through 2023 and Alternative Minimum Tax
credits available indefinitely.

12.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

The computation of earnings per share from continuing operations is as follows:

Options to purchase approximately
646,000, 2.1 million and 2.8 million shares of Common Stock were outstanding in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options’ exercise price exceeded the average
market price of the common shares.



13.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

Stock Options

Under the 2000 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2000 Plan), the Company may grant options to employees for an initial amount of 1.1 million shares of Common
Stock. This amount is subject to annual modification based on a formula. Under the formula, 1.5% of total common shares outstanding at the end of the preceding fiscal year are added to shares available for grant under the 2000 Plan. Based on the
adjustment, the Company had approximately 1.4 million shares available for 2003 grants and has available approximately 1.4 million shares through the end of fiscal 2004. The shares available for grants on any given date may not exceed 15% of
Wabtec’s total common shares outstanding. Generally, the options become exercisable over a three-year vesting period and expire ten years from the date of grant.

As part of a long-term incentive program, in 1998, the Company granted options to purchase up to 500,020 shares, to certain executives under
a plan that preceded the 2000 Plan. The option price is $20 per share. The options vest 100% after eight years and are subject to accelerated vesting after three years if the Company achieves certain earnings targets as established by the
compensation committee of the board of directors. No further grants may be made under this plan.

The Company also has a non-employee directors’ stock option plan under which 500,000 shares of Common Stock are reserved for issuance. Through year-end 2003, the Company granted nonqualified stock options to
non-employee directors to purchase a total of 93,000 shares.

Employee Stock
Purchase Plan

In 1998, the Company adopted an employee discounted stock purchase plan (DSPP). The DSPP had 500,000 shares available for issuance. Participants can purchase the Company’s common stock at 85% of the lesser of fair market value
on the first or last day of each offering period. Stock outstanding under this plan at December 31, 2003 was 202,632 shares.



A summary of the Company’s stock option activity and related information for the years indicated follows:

The following table summarizes
information about stock options outstanding at December 31, 2003:



Restricted Stock Award

In February of 2001, the Company awarded to two officers 4,920 shares of restricted Common Stock in lieu of a cash bonus for 2000.

OPERATING LEASES

The Company leases office and manufacturing facilities under operating leases with terms ranging from one to 15 years, excluding renewal options.

The Company has sold remanufactured locomotives to various financial institutions and leased them back under operating leases with terms
from five to 20 years.

Total net rental expense charged to operations in 2003,
2002, and 2001 was $6.9 million, $6.2 million and $5.7 million, respectively. Certain of the Company’s equipment rental obligations under operating leases pertain to locomotives, which are subleased to customers under both short-term and
long-term agreements. The amounts above are shown net of sublease rentals of $2.8 million, $2.8 million and $2.8 million for the years 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Future minimum rental payments under operating leases with remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year are as follows:

In 2001, the Company sold a small non-core operating unit to its management team. As part of the sale, Wabtec guaranteed approximately $3 million of bank debt of the buyer, which was used for the purchase financing.
In the event that the purchaser cannot repay or refinance the debt without a guarantee by Wabtec, the business would be returned to Wabtec. This debt is due in 2004. The Company has no reason to believe that this debt will not be repaid or
refinanced.

The following table reconciles the changes in the Company’s
product warranty reserve as follows:

STOCKHOLDERS’ AGREEMENTS

As of December 31, 2003 the approximate ownership interests in the Company’s Common Stock are: management (12%), American Industrial Partners Capital Fund II, L.P.
(2%), and all others including public shareholders (86%).

A Stockholders
Agreement exists between the Company and American Industrial Partners that provides for, among other things, the composition of the Board of Directors as long as certain minimum stock ownership percentages are maintained, and rights to request the
registration of the shares.

18.

PREFERRED STOCK

The Company’s authorized capital stock includes 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The Board of Directors has the authority to issue the preferred stock and to fix the designations, powers, preferences and
rights of the shares of each such class or series, including dividend rates, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption and liquidation preferences, without any further vote or action by the Company’s shareholders. The rights and
preferences of the preferred stock would be superior to those of the common stock. At December 31, 2003 and 2002 there was no preferred stock issued or outstanding.

19.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company is subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous or solid
waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances. The Company believes its operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations
applicable to our business; however, there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements.

Under terms of the purchase agreement and related documents for the 1990 Acquisition,
American Standard, Inc. (“ASI”) has indemnified the Company for certain items including, among other things, certain environmental claims the Company asserted prior to 2000. If ASI was unable to honor or meet these indemnifications, the
Company would be responsible for such items. In the opinion of management, ASI currently has the ability to meet its indemnification obligations.

Actions have been filed against us and certain of our affiliates in various jurisdictions across the United States by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of
exposure to asbestos-containing products. Since 2000, the number of such claims has increased. Most of these claims have been made against our wholly-owned subsidiary, Railroad Friction Products Corporation (RFPC), and are based on a product sold by
RFPC before we acquired American Standard, Inc.’s (ASI) 50% interest in RFPC in 1990. We acquired the remaining interest in RFPC in 1992. These claims include a suit against RFPC by ASI seeking contribution and indemnity for asbestos claims
brought against ASI that ASI alleges claim exposure to RFPC’s product.

Most of these claims, including all of the RFPC claims, are submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity or to non-affiliated companies that retain the liabilities for the asbestos-containing products at issue. Neither we nor
our affiliates have to date incurred material costs relating to these asbestos claims. We cannot, however, assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors will remain financially viable. Our ultimate legal and
financial liability with respect to these claims, as is the case with other pending litigation, cannot be estimated with certainty.

BOISE, IDAHO

The Company is subject to a RCRA Part B Closure Permit (“the Permit”) issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, Division of Environmental Quality
relating to the monitoring and treatment of groundwater contamination on, and adjacent to, the MotivePower Industries (Boise, Idaho) facility. In compliance with the Permit, the Company has completed the first phase of an accelerated plan for the
treatment of contaminated groundwater, and continues onsite and offsite monitoring for hazardous constituents. The Company has accrued $585,000 at December 31, 2003, the estimated remaining costs for remediation. The Company was in compliance with
the Permit at December 31, 2003.

MOUNTAINTOP, PENNSYLVANIA

Foster Wheeler Energy Corporation (“FWEC”) the seller of the Mountaintop
property to the predecessor of one of the Company’s subsidiaries in 1989, agreed to indemnify the Company’s predecessor and its successors and assigns against certain identified environmental liabilities for which FWEC executed a Consent
Order Agreement with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) and EPA. On October 14, 2003, the Company executed a Consent Order and Agreement with PADEP pursuant to the PA Land Recycling and Environmental Remediation
Standards Act (Act 2), entitling the Company to the liability protections afforded under Act 2 for the environmental contamination identified in the Agreement. Management believes that the Act 2 protection and the FWEC indemnification arrangement
are enforceable for the benefit of the Company. Management believes that this indemnification arrangement is enforceable for the benefit of the Company and that FWEC has the financial resources to honor its obligations under this indemnification
arrangement.



MATTOON, ILLINOIS

Prior to the Company’s acquisition of Young Radiator, Young agreed to clean up alleged contamination on a prior production site in Mattoon, Ill. The Company is in
the process of remediating the site with the state of Illinois and now estimates the costs to remediate the site to be approximately $251,000 which has been accrued at December 31, 2003.

RACINE, WISCONSIN

Young ceased manufacturing operations at its Racine facility in the early 1990s. Investigations prior to the acquisition of Young revealed some levels of contamination on
the Racine property and the Company has begun remediation efforts. The Company has initiated a comprehensive site evaluation with the state of Wisconsin and believes this governing body is generally in agreement with the findings. The Company has
accrued approximately $259,000 at December 31, 2003 as its estimate of the remaining remediation costs.

GETS-GS

On November 3, 2000, the
Company settled a suit brought against it in 1999 by GE-Harris Railway Electronics, L.L.C. and GE-Harris Railway Electronics Services, L.L.C. (collectively “GE-Harris”). On September 20, 2002, a motion in that lawsuit was filed by the
successor to GE Harris, GE Transportation Services Global Signaling, L.L.C. (“GETS-GS”). The motion by GETS-GS contends that the Company is acting beyond authority granted in the parties’ November 2000 settlement and license agreement
and in contempt of the consent order that concluded the suit at that time. In support of its motion, GETS-GS points principally to sales and offers to sell certain railway brake equipment, including distributed power equipment, to Australian
customers. GETS-GS is seeking substantial money damages and has claimed a significant business loss. A two day hearing was held on GETS-GS’ motion in May 2003. The parties completed and filed all post-hearing papers on August 28, 2003. Barring
a settlement agreement in the interim, the parties are awaiting the court’s decision and opinion on the motion.

The Company has other contingent obligations relating to certain sales leaseback transactions, for locomotives that were assumed in connection with the MotivePower merger
in 1999, for which reserves of $5.8 million have been established.

From time
to time the Company is involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations in the ordinary course of business. As of the date hereof, the Company is involved in no litigation that the Company believes will have a material adverse
effect on its financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

SEGMENT INFORMATION

Wabtec has two reportable segments – the Freight Group and the Transit Group. The key factors used to identify these reportable segments are the organization and alignment of the Company’s internal
operations, the nature of the products and services and customer type. The business segments are:

Freight Group

manufactures products and provides services geared to the production and operation of freight cars and locomotives, including braking control equipment, engines, on-board electronic components and
train coupler equipment. Revenues are derived from OEM sales and locomotive overhauls, aftermarket sales and from freight car repairs and services. All of the assets sold to GETS were part of the Freight Group.

Transit Group

consists of products for passenger transit vehicles (typically subways,
rail and buses) that include braking, coupling and monitoring systems, climate control and door equipment that are engineered to meet individual customer specifications. Revenues are derived from OEM and aftermarket sales as well as from repairs and
services.

The Company evaluates its business segments’ operating results
based on income from operations. Corporate activities include general corporate expenses, elimination of intersegment transactions, interest income and expense and other unallocated charges. Since certain administrative and other operating expenses
and other items have not been allocated to business segments, the results in the below tables are not necessarily a measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and may not be comparable to other companies.



Segment financial information for 2003 is as follows:

In 2001, $530,000 of the merger and
restructuring costs related to the Freight Group, and $2 million related to the Transit Group.



The following geographic area data as of and for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, includes
net sales based on product shipment destination and long-lived assets, which consist of plant, property and equipment, net of depreciation, resident in their respective countries:

Export sales from the Company’s
United States operations were $59.2 million, $61.9 million and $90.3 million for the years ending December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The following data reflects income (loss) from operations, including merger and restructuring related
charges by major geographic area, attributed to the Company’s operations within each of the following countries or regions for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively:



21.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The estimated fair values of the Company’s financial instruments approximate their related carrying values, except for the following:

The fair value of the Company’s
interest rate swaps (see Note 9), foreign exchange hedges and option contracts and senior notes were based on dealer quotes and represent the estimated amount the Company would pay to the counterparty to terminate the agreements.



22.

SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA (UNAUDITED)

Earnings per share for 2002 are
different than the sum of the quarterly earnings per share due to rounding.

The Company recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change for goodwill, net of tax, of $61.7 million, or $1.41 in the first quarter of 2002. In the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a $772,000, or $0.02, per diluted share tax
benefit due to research and development credits and the utilization of foreign tax credits. Also in the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company’s vacation policy was changed so that employees that leave the Company are entitled to a pro rata
portion of their vacation for that year instead of their entire vacation for the year. This change resulted in income of $789,000, net of tax, or $0.02 per diluted share.



23.

RESTRUCTURING CHARGE

In 2001, the Company completed a merger and restructuring plan with charges totaling $71 million pre-tax, with approximately $2 million of the costs expensed in 2001, $20 million in 2000 and $49 million in 1999. The
plan involved the elimination of duplicate facilities and excess capacity, operational realignment and related workforce reductions, and the evaluation of certain assets as to their perceived ongoing benefit to the Company.

As of December 31, 2003, $86,000 of the merger and restructuring charge was still remaining
as accrued on the balance sheet as part of other accrued liabilities. The table below identifies the significant components of the charge and reflects the accrual balance at that date.

The lease impairment charges are
associated with the Company’s closing of a plant and the consolidation of the corporate headquarters.
