BUSINESS

General

Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation, doing business as Wabtec Corporation, is a Delaware corporation with headquarters at 1001 Air Brake Avenue in Wilmerding, Pennsylvania. Our telephone number is 412-825-1000, and our website is located at

www.wabtec.com

. All references to “we”, “our”, “us”, the “Company” and “Wabtec” refer to Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries. Westinghouse Air Brake Company (“WABCO”) was formed in 1990 when it acquired certain assets and operations from American Standard, Inc., now known as Trane (“Trane”). In 1999, WABCO merged with MotivePower Industries, Inc. (“MotivePower”) and adopted the name Wabtec.

Today, Wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of value-added, technology-based equipment and services for the global rail industry. We believe we hold approximately a 50% market share in North America for our primary braking-related equipment and a leading position in North America for most of our other product lines. Our highly engineered products, which are intended to enhance safety, improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers, can be found on virtually all U.S. locomotives, freight cars, subway cars and buses, and on many of these vehicles around the world. In


, the Company had sales of approximately

$3.3 billion

and net income of about

$398.6 million

. In


, sales of aftermarket parts and services represented about

62%

of total sales, while sales to customers outside of the U.S. accounted for about

47%

of total sales.

Industry Overview

The Company primarily serves the worldwide freight rail and passenger transit industries. As such, our operating results are largely dependent on the level of activity, financial condition and capital spending plans of the global railroad and transit industries. Many factors influence these industries, including general economic conditions; traffic volumes, as measured by freight tonnage and passenger ridership; government spending on public transportation; and investment in new technologies by freight rail and passenger transit systems.

According to a recent study by UNIFE, the Association of the European Rail Industry, the accessible global market for railway products and services is more than $100 billion, and it is expected to grow at about 2.7% annually through 2019. The three largest markets, which represent about 75% of the total market, are Europe, Asia-Pacific and North America. UNIFE projects the overall market to remain stable through 2020 as emerging markets show above-average growth due to overall economic growth and trends such as urbanization and increasing mobility, deregulation, investments in new technologies, energy and environmental issues, and increasing government support; while developed markets grow at a slower pace. UNIFE projects growth in all major product segments, with rail control and services expected to grow the fastest, at about 3% each.

By using various industry publications and market studies, we estimate that the global installed base of locomotives is about 110,000 units, with about 35% in Asia-Pacific, about 25% in Russia-CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) and about 20% in North America.  We estimate the global installed base of freight cars is about 5.2 million units, with about 30% each in Russia-CIS and North America, and about 20% in Asia-Pacific.  We estimate the global installed base of transit cars is about 330,000 units, with about 55% in Asia-Pacific, about 20% in Europe and about 10% in Russia.

In North America, railroads carry about 40% of intercity freight, as measured by ton-miles, which is more than any other mode of transportation. They are an integral part of the continent’s economy and transportation system, serving nearly every industrial, wholesale and retail sector. Through direct ownership and operating partnerships, U.S. railroads are part of an integrated network that includes railroads in Canada and Mexico, forming what is regarded as the world’s most-efficient and lowest-cost freight rail service. There are more than 500 railroads operating in North America, with the largest railroads, referred to as “Class I,” accounting for more than 90% of the industry’s revenues. The railroads carry a wide variety of commodities and goods, including coal, metals, minerals, chemicals, grain, and petroleum.  These commodities represent about 55% of total rail carloadings, with intermodal carloads accounting for the rest. Intermodal traffic—the movement of trailers or containers by rail in combination with another mode of transportation—has been the railroads’ fastest-growing market segment in the past 10 years. Railroads operate in a competitive environment, especially with the trucking industry, and are always seeking ways to improve safety, cost and reliability. New technologies offered by Wabtec and others in the industry can provide some of these benefits. Demand for our freight related products and services in North America is driven by a number of factors, including rail traffic, and production of new locomotives and new freight cars.  In 2015, the Association of American Railroads (“AAR”) reported total carloads decreased 2.2%, as a 2.1% increase in intermodal traffic was more than offset by a 5.8% decrease in commodities carloads.  Generally, a decrease in carloads reflects a slowing economy.  Deliveries of new locomotives were about 1,200 units in 2015, compared to about 1,500 in 2014, and the average of about 1,200 in the past 10 years.  Deliveries of new freight cars were about 82,000 units in 2015, compared to about 67,000 in 2014 and the average of about 50,000 in the past 10 years.


In the U.S., the passenger transit industry is dependent largely on funding from federal, state and local governments, and from fare box revenues. The New York City region is the largest passenger transit market in the U.S., but most major cities also offer either rail or bus transit services. Demand for North American passenger transit products is driven by a number of factors, including government funding, deliveries of new subway cars and buses, and ridership. The U.S. federal government provides money to local transit authorities, primarily to fund the purchase of new equipment and infrastructure for their transit systems. In 2015, the U.S. Congress passed a five-year transportation funding bill that includes transit spending of about $11.8 billion in fiscal 2016, an increase of about 10% compared to the prior year.  The number of new transit cars delivered in 2015 was about 850, compared to about the same in 2014. The number of new buses delivered in 2015 was about 4,600 compared to about the same in 2014. In the past 10 years, the average number of new transit cars delivered annually is about 800, and the average number of new buses delivered annually is about 4,700.

Public transit ridership provides fare box revenues to transit authorities, which use these funds, along with state and local money, primarily for equipment and system maintenance. Based on preliminary figures from the American Public Transportation Association, ridership on U.S. transit vehicles decreased about 1.0% in 2015.

Outside of North America, countries such as Australia, Brazil, China, India, Russia, and South Africa have been investing capital to expand and improve both their freight and passenger rail systems. Throughout the world, some government-owned railroads are being sold to private owners, who often look to improve the efficiency of the rail system by investing in new equipment and new technologies. According to UNIFE, emerging markets are expected to grow at above-average rates as global trade creates increases in freight volumes and urbanization leads to increased demand for efficient mass-transportation systems. As this growth occurs, Wabtec expects to have additional opportunities to provide products and services in these markets.

In Europe, the majority of the rail system serves the passenger transit market, which is expected to continue growing as energy and environmental factors encourage investment in public mass transit. France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Italy are the largest transit markets, representing about two-thirds of passenger traffic in the European Union. UNIFE projected the Western European rail market to grow at about 2.0% annually in the next few years, with the United Kingdom and France expected to invest in new rolling stock.  According to the UK’s Office of Rail Regulation, passenger rail usage has steadily increased in the past decade, with the Office reporting a 1.4% increase in second quarter ridership in its most recent quarterly report.  For the same time period, the Office also reported a decrease of 16.5% in freight volume, driven by a reduction in coal shipments.  Germany has the largest rail network in Europe.  About 75% of freight traffic in Europe is hauled by truck, while rail accounts for about 20%. The largest freight markets in Europe are Germany, Poland and the United Kingdom. In the first nine months of 2015, The Federal Statistical Office of Germany reported a 2.1% decrease in freight volumes compared to the same period in 2014. For the first six months of 2015, SNCF (French national railway) reported an increase of 4.0% in revenue for local and regional ridership, and flat freight-related revenue.  We estimate that the European rail market consists of about 11,000 locomotives, about 750,000 freight cars and about 72,000 passenger transit cars.

The Asia/Pacific market is now the second-largest geographic segment, according to UNIFE. This market consists primarily of China, India and Australia. Growth has been driven by the continued urbanization of China and India, and by investments in freight rail infrastructure to serve the mining and natural resources markets in those countries.  We estimate that this market consists of 35,000 locomotives and about 1.0 million freight cars.  China is expected to increase spending on rail infrastructure and equipment, as it resumes investment in high-speed rail programs.  In its most recent report, the Indian government reported that in the first six months of its fiscal 2015, freight rail volume increased about 26% and earnings from passenger rail traffic increased about 8.5%. India is expected to increase spending significantly in future years as it seeks to modernize its rail system; for example, it recently awarded a 1,000-unit locomotive order to a U.S. manufacturer.

Other key geographic markets include Russia-CIS, South Africa, and Brazil.  With about 1.5 million freight cars and about 28,000 locomotives, Russia-CIS is among the largest freight rail markets in the world, and it’s expected to invest significantly in new rolling stock and infrastructure.  Russian Railways, a state-owned company, provides both freight and passenger transportation.  In 2015, Russian Railways announced a decrease of 1.2% in freight loadings and a decrease of 4.4% in passenger ridership.  South Africa, in 2012, announced a major program to invest in its freight rail and passenger transit infrastructure during the next 20 years.  As part of this program, PRASA, the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa, plans to purchase about 3,600 new transit cars and about 1,000 new locomotives.  Brazil has also been investing in its passenger transport systems in advance of hosting the 2016 Olympics.

Business Segments and Products

We provide our products and services through two principal business segments, the Freight Segment and the Transit Segment, both of which have different market characteristics and business drivers.

The Freight Segment primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing locomotive and freight cars, supplies railway electronics, positive train control equipment, signal design and engineering services, builds switcher


locomotives, rebuilds freight locomotives and provides heat exchangers and cooling systems for rail and other industrial markets. Customers include large, publicly traded railroads, leasing companies, manufacturers of original equipment such as locomotives and freight cars, and utilities. As discussed previously, demand in the freight market is primarily driven by rail traffic, and deliveries of new locomotives and freight cars. In


, the Freight Segment accounted for

62%

of our total sales, with about

81%

of its sales in North America and the remainder to international customers. In


, slightly more than half of the Freight Segment’s sales were in aftermarket.

The Transit Segment primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing passenger transit vehicles, typically subway cars and buses, builds new commuter locomotives and refurbishes subway cars. Customers include public transit authorities and municipalities, leasing companies, and manufacturers of subway cars and buses around the world. As discussed previously, demand in the transit market is primarily driven by government funding at all levels and passenger ridership. In


, the Transit Segment accounted for

38%

of our total sales, with about

39%

of its sales in North America and the remainder to international customers. About two-thirds of the Transit Segment’s sales are in the aftermarket with the remainder in the original equipment market.

Following is a summary of our leading product lines in both aftermarket and original equipment across both of our business segments:

We have become a leader in the rail industry by capitalizing on the strength of our existing products, technological capabilities and new product innovation, and by our ability to harden products to protect them from severe conditions, including extreme temperatures and high-vibration environments. Supported by our technical staff of over

1,500

engineers and specialists, we have extensive experience in a broad range of product lines, which enables us to provide comprehensive, systems-based solutions for our customers.

Over the past several years, we introduced a number of significant new products, including electronic braking equipment and train control equipment that encompasses onboard digital data and global positioning communication protocols. In 2007, for example, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) approved the use of our Electronic Train Management System

®

, which offers safety benefits to the rail industry. In 2008, the U.S. federal government enacted a rail safety bill that mandates the use of Positive Train Control (“PTC”) technology, which includes on-board locomotive computer and related software, on a majority of the locomotives and track in the U.S. With our Electronic Train Management System

®

, we are the leading supplier of this on-board train control equipment, and we are working with the U.S. Class I railroads, commuter rail authorities and other industry suppliers to implement this technology.  The rail safety bill included a deadline of December 31, 2015 for PTC


implementation, but the deadline has been extended until the end of 2018.  The deadline extension is expected to affect the rate of industry spending on this technology.  In


, Wabtec recorded about

$400 million

of revenue from freight and transit PTC projects.

For additional information on our business segments, see Note 20 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.

Competitive Strengths

Our key strengths include:

•

Leading market positions in core products

. Dating back to 1869 and George Westinghouse’s invention of the air brake, we are an established leader in the development and manufacture of pneumatic braking equipment for freight and passenger transit vehicles. We have leveraged our leading position by focusing on research and engineering to expand beyond pneumatic braking components to supplying integrated parts and assemblies for the locomotive through the end of the train. We are a recognized leader in the development and production of electronic recording, measuring and communications systems, positive train control equipment, highly engineered compressors and heat exchangers for locomotives, and a leading manufacturer of freight car components, including electronic braking equipment, draft gears, trucks, brake shoes and electronic end-of-train devices. We are also a leading provider of braking equipment, door assemblies, lifts and ramps, couplers and current collection equipment for passenger transit vehicles.

•

Breadth of product offering with a stable mix of original equipment market (OEM) and aftermarket business

. Our product portfolio is one of the broadest in the rail industry, as we offer a wide selection of quality parts, components and assemblies across the entire train. We provide our products in both the original equipment market and the aftermarket. Our substantial installed base of products with end-users such as the railroads and the passenger transit authorities is a significant competitive advantage for providing products and services to the aftermarket because these customers often look to purchase safety- and performance-related replacement parts from the original equipment components supplier. In addition, as OEMs and railroad operators attempt to modernize fleets with new products designed to improve and maintain safety and efficiency, these products must be designed to be interoperable with existing equipment. On average, over the last several years, more than

60%

of our total net sales have come from our aftermarket products and services business.

•

Leading design and engineering capabilities

. We believe a hallmark of our relationship with our customers has been our leading design and engineering practice, which has, in our opinion, assisted in the improvement and modernization of global railway equipment. We believe both our customers and the government authorities value our technological capabilities and commitment to innovation, as we seek not only to enhance the efficiency and profitability of our customers, but also to improve the overall safety of the railways through continuous improvement of product performance. The Company has an established record of product improvements and new product development. We have assembled a wide range of patented products, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage. Wabtec currently owns

2,312

active patents worldwide and


U.S. patents. During the last three years, we have filed for more than


patents worldwide in support of our new and evolving product lines.

•

Experience with industry regulatory requirements.

The freight rail and passenger transit industries are governed by various government agencies and regulators in each country and region. These groups mandate rigorous manufacturer certification, new product testing and approval processes that we believe are difficult for new entrants to meet cost-effectively and efficiently without the scale and extensive experience we possess.

•

Experienced management team and the Wabtec Performance System

. The Company has implemented numerous initiatives that enable us to manage successfully through cycles in the rail supply market. For example, the Wabtec Performance System (WPS), an ongoing program that focuses on lean manufacturing principles and continuous improvement across all aspects of our business, has been a part of the Company’s culture for more than 20 years. As a result, our management team has improved our cost structure, operating leverage and financial flexibility, and placed the Company in an excellent position to benefit from growth opportunities.

Business strategy

Using WPS, we strive to generate sufficient cash to invest in our growth strategies and to build on what we consider to be a leading position as a low-cost producer in the industry while maintaining world-class product quality, technology and customer responsiveness. Through WPS and employee-directed initiatives such as Kaizen, a Japanese-developed team concept, we continuously strive to improve quality, delivery and productivity, and to reduce costs. These efforts enable us to streamline processes, improve product reliability and customer satisfaction, reduce product cycle times and respond more rapidly to market developments. Over time, these lean initiatives have enabled us to increase operating margins, improve cash flow and strengthen our ability to invest in the following growth strategies:


•

Expand globally and into new product markets

. We believe that international markets represent a significant opportunity for future growth. In


, sales to non-U.S. customers were

$1.6 billion

, including export sales from the Company’s U.S. operations of

$508.4 million

. We intend to increase our existing international sales through strategic acquisitions, direct sales of products through our existing subsidiaries and licensees, and joint ventures with railway suppliers which have a strong presence in their local markets. We are specifically targeting markets that operate significant fleets of U.S.-style locomotives and freight cars, including Australia, Brazil, China, India, Russia, South Africa, and other select areas within Europe and South America. In addition, we have opportunities to increase the sale of certain products that we currently manufacture for the rail industry into other industrial markets, such as mining, off-highway and energy. These products include heat exchangers and friction materials.

•

Expand aftermarket sales

. Historically, aftermarket sales are less cyclical than OEM sales because a certain level of aftermarket maintenance and service work must be performed, even during an industry slowdown. In


, Wabtec’s aftermarket sales and services represented approximately

62%

of the Company’s total sales across both of our business segments. Wabtec provides aftermarket parts and services for its components, and the Company is seeking to expand this business with customers who currently perform the work in-house. In this way, we expect to take advantage of the rail industry trend toward outsourcing, as railroads and transit authorities focus on their core function of transporting goods and people

.

•

Accelerate new product development

. We continue to emphasize research and development funding to create new and improved products. We are focusing on technological advances, especially in the areas of electronics, braking products and other on-board equipment, as a means of new product growth. We seek to provide customers with incremental technological advances that offer immediate benefits with cost-effective investments.

•

Seek acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances

. We invest in acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances using a disciplined, selective approach and rigorous financial criteria. These transactions are expected to meet the financial criteria and contribute to our growth strategies of global expansion, new products and expanding aftermarket sales. All of these expansion strategies will help Wabtec to grow profitably, expand geographically, and dampen the impact from potential cycles in the North American rail industry.

Recent Acquisitions and Joint Ventures

Wabtec has completed certain significant acquisitions in support of its growth strategies mentioned above:

•

$199.4 million

, net of cash acquired.

Backlog

The Company’s backlog was about

$2.1 billion

at

December 31, 2015

. For


, about

62%

of total sales came from aftermarket orders, which typically carry lead times of less than 30 days, and are not recorded in backlog for a significant period of time.

The Company’s contracts are subject to standard industry cancellation provisions, including cancellations on short notice or upon completion of designated stages. Substantial scope-of-work adjustments are common. For these and other


reasons, completion of the Company’s backlog may be delayed or cancelled. The railroad industry, in general, has historically been subject to fluctuations due to overall economic conditions and the level of use of alternative modes of transportation.

The backlog of firm customer orders as of

December 31, 2015

and

December 31, 2014

, and the expected year of completion are as follows:

Engineering and Development

To execute our strategy to develop new products, we invest in a variety of engineering and development activities. For the fiscal years ended December 31,


,


, and


, we invested about

$71.2 million

,

$61.9 million

and

$46.3 million

, respectively, on product development and improvement activities. The engineering resources of the Company are allocated between research and development activities and the execution of original equipment customer contracts.

Our engineering and development program includes investment in train control and new braking technologies, with an emphasis on applying electronics to traditional pneumatic equipment. Electronic braking has been used in the transit industry for years, and freight railroads are conducting pilot programs to test its reliability and benefits. Freight railroads have generally been slower to accept the technology due to issues over interoperability, connectivity and durability. We are proceeding with efforts to enhance the major components for existing hard-wired braking equipment and development of new electronic technologies for the freight railroads. We are also investing in technology, such as advanced cooling systems that enable lower emissions from diesel engines used in rail and other industrial markets.  Sometimes we conduct specific research projects in conjunction with universities, customers and other industry suppliers.

We use our Product Development System (PDS) to develop and monitor new product programs. The system requires the product development team to follow consistent steps throughout the development process, from concept to launch, to ensure the product will meet customer expectations and internal profitability targets.

Intellectual Property

We have

2,312

active patents worldwide. We also rely on a combination of trade secrets and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our intellectual property.

Certain trademarks, among them the name WABCO

®

, were acquired or licensed from American Standard Inc., now known as Trane, in 1990 at the time of our acquisition of the North American operations of the Railway Products Group of Trane. Other trademarks have been developed through the normal course of business, or acquired as a part of our ongoing merger and acquisition program.

We have entered into a variety of license agreements as licensor and licensee. We do not believe that any single license agreement is of material importance to our business or either of our business segments as a whole.

We have issued licenses to the two sole suppliers of railway air brakes and related products in Japan, Nabtesco and Mitsubishi Electric Company. The licensees pay annual license fees to us and also assist us by acting as liaisons with key Japanese passenger transit vehicle builders for projects in North America. We believe that our relationships with these licensees have been beneficial to our core transit business and customer relationships in North America.

Customers

Our customers include railroads and passenger transit authorities throughout North America, as well as in the United Kingdom, Australia, Europe, Asia, South Africa and South America; manufacturers of transportation equipment, such as locomotives, freight cars, subway vehicles and buses; and lessors of such equipment.

Top customers can change from year to year. For the fiscal year ended

December 31, 2015

, our top five customers accounted for

22%

of net sales: The BNSF Railway, CSX Corporation, General Electric Transportation, Trinity Industries, and Union Pacific Corporation. No one customer represents 10% or more of consolidated sales. We believe that we have strong relationships with all of our key customers.


Competition

We believe that we hold approximately a 50% market share in North America for our primary braking-related equipment and a leading market position in North America for most of our other product lines. On a global basis, our market shares are smaller. We operate in a highly competitive marketplace. Price competition is strong because we have a relatively small number of customers and they are very cost-conscious. In addition to price, competition is based on product performance and technological leadership, quality, reliability of delivery, and customer service and support.

Our principal competitors vary across product lines. Within North America, New York Air Brake Company, a subsidiary of the German air brake producer Knorr-Bremse AG (“Knorr”) and Amsted Rail Company, Inc., a subsidiary of Amsted Industries Corporation, are our principal overall OEM competitors. Our competition for locomotive, freight and passenger transit service and repair is mostly from the railroads’ and passenger transit authorities’ in-house operations, Electro-Motive Diesel, a division of Caterpillar, GE Transportation Systems, and New York Air Brake/Knorr. We believe our key strengths, which include leading market positions in core products, breadth of product offering with a stable mix of OEM and aftermarket business, leading design and engineering capabilities, significant barriers to entry and an experienced management team, enable us to compete effectively in this marketplace. Outside of North America, no individual company is our principal competitor in all of our operating locations. The largest competitors for Brake and Transit products are Faiveley Transport and Knorr. In addition, our competitors often include smaller, local suppliers in most international markets.

Employees

At

December 31, 2015

, we had approximately

13,000

full-time employees, approximately

30%

of whom were unionized. A majority of the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements are outside North America and these agreements are generally effective from 2016 through 2018. Agreements expiring at various times during 2016 cover approximately

26%

of the Company’s workforce. We consider our relations with employees and union representatives to be good, but cannot assure that future contract negotiations will be favorable to us.

Regulation

In the course of our operations, we are subject to various regulations of governments and other agencies in the U.S. and around the world. These entities typically govern equipment and safety standards for freight rail and passenger transit rolling stock, oversee a wide variety of rules and regulations governing safety and design of equipment, and evaluate certification and qualification requirements for suppliers.  New products generally must undergo testing and approval processes that are rigorous and lengthy. As a result of these regulations and requirements, we must usually obtain and maintain certifications in a variety of jurisdictions and countries.  The governing bodies include:  FRA and AAR in the U.S., the International Union of Railways (“UIC”) and the European Railway Agency in Europe, the Federal Agency of Railway Transport in Russia, the Agencia Nacional de Transportes Terrestres in Brazil, the National Railway Administration, formerly the Ministry of Railway in China, and the Ministry of Railways in India.

Effects of Seasonality

Our business is not typically seasonal, although the third quarter results may be affected by vacation and scheduled plant shutdowns at several of our major customers during this period.

Item 1A.

RISK FACTORS

Prolonged unfavorable economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business.

Unfavorable general economic and market conditions in the United States and internationally could have a negative impact on our sales and operations. To the extent that these factors result in continued instability of capital markets, shortages of raw materials or component parts, longer sales cycles, deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

We are dependent upon key customers.

We rely on several key customers who represent a significant portion of our business. Our top customers can change from year to year. For the fiscal year ended

December 31, 2015

, our top five customers accounted for

22%

of our net sales. While we believe our relationships with our customers are generally good, our top customers could choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with us. In addition, many of our customers place orders for products on an as-needed basis and operate in cyclical industries. As a result, their order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future. Such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers, and may be subject to delays and cancellations. As a result of our dependence on our key customers, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition if we lost any one or more of our key customers or if there is a reduction in their demand for our products.

Our business operates in a highly competitive industry.

We operate in a competitive marketplace and face substantial competition from a limited number of established competitors in the United States and abroad, some of which may have greater financial resources than we do. Price competition is strong and, coupled with the existence of a number of cost conscious customers, has historically limited our ability to increase prices. In addition to price, competition is based on product performance and technological leadership, quality, reliability of delivery and customer service and support. There can be no assurance that competition in one or more of our markets will not adversely affect us and our results of operations.

We intend to pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances that involve a number of inherent risks, any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits.

One aspect of our business strategy is to selectively pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances that we believe will improve our market position, and provide opportunities to realize operating synergies. These transactions involve inherent risks and uncertainties, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition including:

•

difficulties in achieving identified financial and operating synergies, including the integration of operations, services and products;

•

diversion of Management’s attention from other business concerns;

•

the assumption of unknown liabilities; and

•

unanticipated changes in the market conditions, business and economic factors affecting such an acquisition.

We cannot assure that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions, joint ventures or other business combinations. If we are unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to consummate strategic acquisitions, we may be unable to fully implement our business strategy, and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result. In addition, our ability to engage in strategic acquisitions will be dependent on our ability to raise substantial capital, and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement our acquisition strategy on terms satisfactory to us, if at all.

As we introduce new products and services, a failure to predict and react to consumer demand could adversely affect our business.

We have dedicated significant resources to the development, manufacturing and marketing of new products. Decisions to develop and market new transportation products are typically made without firm indications of customer acceptance. Moreover, by their nature, new products may require alteration of existing business methods or threaten to displace existing equipment in which our customers may have a substantial capital investment. There can be no assurance that any new products that we develop will gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace or that such products will be able to compete successfully with other new products or services that may be introduced by competitors. In addition, we may incur additional warranty or other costs as new products are tested and used by customers.


A portion of our sales are related to delivering products and services to help our U.S. railroad and transit customers meet the Positive Train Control (PTC) mandate from the U.S. federal government, which requires the use of on-board locomotive computers and software by the end of 2018.

For the year ended

December 31, 2015

, we had sales of about

$400 million

related to PTC. In 2015, the industry's PTC deadline was extended by three years, which could change the timing of our revenues and could cause us to reassess the staffing, resources and assets deployed in delivering Positive Train Control services.

Our revenues are subject to cyclical variations in the railway and passenger transit markets and changes in government spending.

The railway industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations due to overall economic conditions, the use of alternate methods of transportation and the levels of federal, state and local government spending on railroad transit projects. In economic downturns, railroads have deferred, and may defer, certain expenditures in order to conserve cash in the short term. Reductions in freight traffic may reduce demand for our replacement products.

The passenger transit railroad industry is also cyclical. New passenger transit car orders vary from year to year and are influenced greatly by major replacement programs and by the construction or expansion of transit systems by transit authorities. A substantial portion of our net sales have been, and we expect that a material portion of our future net sales will be, derived from contracts with metropolitan transit and commuter rail authorities and Amtrak. To the extent that future funding for proposed public projects is curtailed or withdrawn altogether as a result of changes in political, economic, fiscal or other conditions beyond our control, such projects may be delayed or cancelled, resulting in a potential loss of business for us, including transit aftermarket and new transit car orders. There can be no assurance that economic conditions will be favorable or that there will not be significant fluctuations adversely affecting the industry as a whole and, as a result, us.

Our backlog is not necessarily indicative of the level of our future revenues.

Our backlog represents future production and estimated potential revenue attributable to firm contracts with, or written orders from, our customers for delivery in various periods.  Instability in the global economy, negative conditions in the global credit markets, volatility in the industries that our products serve, changes in legislative policy, adverse changes in the financial condition of our customers, adverse changes in the availability of raw materials and supplies, or un-remedied contract breaches could possibly lead to contract termination or cancellations of orders in our backlog or request for deferred deliveries of our backlog orders, each of which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.

A growing portion of our sales may be derived from our international operations, which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level.

In fiscal year


, approximately

47%

of our consolidated net sales were to customers outside of the U.S. and we intend to continue to expand our international operations in the future. We currently conduct our international operations through a variety of wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Italy, Macedonia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Spain, South Africa, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. As a result, we are subject to various risks, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on those operations and on our business as a whole, including:

•

lack of complete operating control;

•

lack of local business experience;

•

currency exchange fluctuations and devaluations;

•

foreign trade restrictions and exchange controls;

•

difficulty enforcing agreements and intellectual property rights;

•

the potential for nationalization of enterprises; and

•

economic, political and social instability and possible terrorist attacks against American interests.

In addition, certain jurisdictions have laws that limit the ability of non-U.S. subsidiaries and their affiliates to pay dividends and repatriate cash flows.

We may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.

In the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding costs associated with variable-rate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements. There can be no assurance that any of these measures will be effective. Any material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to us.


We may have liability arising from asbestos litigation.

Claims have been filed against the Company and certain of its affiliates in various jurisdictions across the United States by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing products. Most of these claims have been made against our wholly owned subsidiary, Railroad Friction Products Corporation (RFPC), and are based on a product sold by RFPC prior to the time that the Company acquired any interest in RFPC.

Most of these claims, including all of the RFPC claims, are submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity or to non-affiliated companies that retain the liabilities for the asbestos-containing products at issue. We cannot, however, assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors or insurers will remain financially viable. Our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims, as is the case with most other pending litigation, cannot be estimated.

We are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations.

We are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances. We believe our operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business; however, there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements.

Future climate change regulation could result in increased operating costs, affect the demand for our products or affect the ability of our critical suppliers to meet our needs.

The Company has followed the current debate over climate change and the related policy discussion and prospective legislation. The potential challenges for the Company that climate change policy and legislation may pose have been reviewed by the Company. Any such challenges are heavily dependent on the nature and degree of climate change legislation and the extent to which it applies to our industry. At this time, the Company cannot predict the ultimate impact of climate change and climate change legislation on the Company’s operations. Further, when or if these impacts may occur cannot be assessed until scientific analysis and legislative policy are more developed and specific legislative proposals begin to take shape. Any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gas could require us to incur increased operating costs, and could have an adverse effect on demand for our products. In addition, the price and availability of certain of the raw materials that we use could vary in the future as a result of environmental laws and regulations affecting our suppliers. An increase in the price of our raw materials or a decline in their availability could adversely affect our operating margins or result in reduced demand for our products.

Our manufacturer’s warranties or product liability may expose us to potentially significant claims.

We warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products. Accordingly, we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death, or does not conform to our customers’ specifications. In addition, in recent years, we have introduced a number of new products for which we do not have a history of warranty experience. Although we have not had any material product liability or warranty claims made against us and we currently maintain liability insurance coverage, we cannot assure that product liability claims, if made, would not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. The possibility exists for these types of warranty claims to result in costly product recalls, significant repair costs and damage to our reputation.

Labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.

We collectively bargain with labor unions that represent approximately

30%

of our employees. Our current collective bargaining agreements are generally effective from 2016 through 2018. Agreements expiring at various times during 2016 cover approximately

26%

of the Company’s workforce. Failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes or other labor protests which could disrupt our operations. If we were to experience a strike or work stoppage, it would be difficult for us to find a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills to replace these employees. We cannot assure that we will reach any such agreement or that we will not encounter strikes or other types of conflicts with the labor unions of our personnel. Such labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, could cause us to lose revenues and customers and might have permanent effects on our business.

From time to time we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers.

From time to time, we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers regarding routine delivery and performance issues as well as adjustments for design changes and related extra work. These disputes are generally resolved in


the ordinary course of business without having a material adverse impact on us although we cannot guarantee that this will continue to occur.

Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health.

At

December 31, 2015

, we had total debt of

$695.7 million

. If it becomes necessary to access our available borrowing capacity under our 2013 Refinancing Credit Agreement, the

$445.0 million

currently borrowed under this facility and the

$250.0 million

4.375% senior notes, being indebted could have important consequences to us. For example, it could:

•

increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;

•

place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt; and

•

limit our ability to borrow additional funds.

The indenture for our

$250 million

4.375% senior notes due in 2023 and our 2013 Refinancing Credit Agreement contain various covenants that limit our Management’s discretion in the operation of our businesses.

The indenture governing the notes and our credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our Management’s discretion.

The 2013 Refinancing Credit Agreement limits the Company’s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the Company from declaring or making other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. The 2013 Refinancing Credit Agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations: incurrence of additional indebtedness; mergers, consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions; additional liens; sale and leasebacks; permissible investments, loans and advances; certain debt payments; capital expenditures; and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio.

The indenture under which the senior notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things, the following: the incurrence of indebtedness, payment of dividends and certain distributions, sale of assets, change in control, mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens.

The integration of our recently completed acquisitions may not result in anticipated improvements in market position or the realization of anticipated operating synergies or may take longer to realize than expected.

In 2014 and 2015, we completed multiple acquisitions with a combined investment of

$424.7 million

. Although we believe that the acquisitions will improve our market position and realize positive operating results, including operating synergies, operating expense reductions and overhead cost savings, we cannot be assured that these improvements will be obtained or the timing of such improvements. The management and acquisition of businesses involves substantial risks, any of which may result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, including:

•

the uncertainty that an acquired business will achieve anticipated operating results;

•

significant expenses to integrate;

•

diversion of Management’s attention;

•

departure of key personnel from the acquired business;

•

effectively managing entrepreneurial spirit and decision-making;

•

integration of different information systems;

•

unanticipated costs and exposure to unforeseen liabilities; and

•

impairment of assets.

Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

Wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of value-added, technology-based products and services for the global rail industry. Our products are found on virtually all U.S. locomotives, freight cars and passenger transit vehicles, as well as in more than 100 countries throughout the world. Our products enhance safety, improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers, and many of our core products and services are essential in the safe and efficient operation of freight rail and passenger transit vehicles. Wabtec is a global company with operations in


countries. In


, about

47%

of the Company’s revenues came from customers outside the U.S.

Management Review and Future Outlook

Wabtec’s long-term financial goals are to generate cash flow from operations in excess of net income, maintain a strong credit profile while minimizing our overall cost of capital, increase margins through strict attention to cost controls and implementation of the Wabtec Performance System, and increase revenues through a focused growth strategy, including global and market expansion, new products and technologies, aftermarket products and services, and acquisitions. In addition, Management evaluates the Company’s current operational performance through measures such as quality and on-time delivery.

The Company monitors a variety of factors and statistics to gauge market activity. Freight rail markets around the world are driven primarily by overall economic conditions and activity, while Transit markets are driven primarily by government funding and passenger ridership.  Changes in these market drivers can cause fluctuations in demand for Wabtec’s product and services.  In its 2014 - 2019 study, UNIFE projected annual growth of about 2.7% in the worldwide rail supply market over the next several years, with the highest expected growth rates in Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America.

In North America, the AAR compiles statistics that gauge the level of activity in the freight rail industry, including revenue ton-miles and carloadings, which are generally referred to as “rail traffic”.  Based on changes in rail traffic trends, railroads can increase or decrease purchases of new locomotives and freight cars.  In 2015, North American carloadings decreased 2.2%, including a 5.8% decrease in commodity carloadings and a 2.1% increase in intermodal carloadings. Deliveries of new locomotives decreased 20%, and deliveries of new freight cars increased 22%.  In 2016, we expect locomotive and freight car deliveries to be lower than in 2015.  UNIFE projected an annual growth rate of about 3.0% in North America, but the actual figure depends on the growth of the economy.

In North America, the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) compiles ridership statistics and trends.  Based on preliminary figures for 2015, ridership decreased about 1.0% in the U.S. and about 1.0% in Canada.  Ridership provides fare box revenues to transit authorities, which use these funds, along with state and local money, primarily, for equipment maintenance.  In 2015, the U.S. Congress passed a new, five-year transportation funding bill, which includes an increase in spending of about 10.0% in the first year, and smaller increases in future years.  A majority of the money that transit agencies spend to purchase new equipment or infrastructure comes from the federal government.

Wabtec continues to expand its presence in freight rail and passenger transit markets outside the U.S., particularly in Europe, Asia-Pacific and South America. To gauge activity in these markets, we monitor trends in rail traffic and the spending plans of our customers.  In Europe, the majority of the rail system serves the passenger transit market, which is larger than the transit market in the U.S., our presence in the U.K., Germany and Italy has positioned the Company to take advantage of this market. UNIFE projected the Western European rail market to grow annually by about 2.0% in the next few years, with the United Kingdom and France expected to invest in new rolling stock.  UNIFE projected the market in Asia-Pacific, the world’s second largest according to the study, to grow annually by about 4.0%, primarily reflecting strong spending in China in recent years.  Other growth markets around the world, according to UNIFE, include Latin America, projected to grow at about 5.0%; and the Commonwealth of Independent States, projected to grow at about 1.0%.  Actual growth rates will be affected by the general global economic conditions and specific economic conditions in each market.  Through wholly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures, Wabtec has a presence in every key freight rail and passenger transit market around the world.

In 2016 and beyond, general economic and market conditions in the United States and internationally will have an impact on our sales and operations. To the extent that these factors cause instability of capital markets, shortages of raw materials or component parts, longer sales cycles, deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, we face risks associated with our four-point growth strategy including the level of investment that customers are willing to make in new technologies


developed by the industry and the Company, and risks inherent in global expansion. When necessary, we will modify our financial and operating strategies to reflect changes in market conditions and risks.

PROPOSED TRANSACTION WITH FAIVELEY TRANSPORT S.A.

On July 27, 2015, the Company announced plans to acquire Faiveley Transport S.A. ("Faiveley Transport"), a leading global provider of value-added, integrated systems and services for the railway industry with annual sales of about $1.2 billion and more than 5,700 employees in 24 countries.  Faiveley Transport supplies railway manufacturers, operators and maintenance providers with a range of valued-added, technology-based systems and services in Energy & Comfort (air conditioning, power collectors and converters, and passenger information), Access & Mobility (passenger access systems and platform doors), and Brakes & Safety (braking systems and couplers).

The transaction has been structured in three steps:

•

Wabtec made an irrevocable offer to the owners of approximately 51% of Faiveley Transport’s shares for a purchase price of €100 per share, payable 25% in cash and 75% in Wabtec preferred stock.  The preferred stock will have a 1% annual dividend or, if greater, the annual dividend assuming full conversion into common shares, and must be converted after three years into Wabtec common shares at an implied ratio of one Faiveley Transport common share for 1.125 Wabtec common shares. Shareholders owning 51% of Faiveley Transport have entered into exclusive discussions with Wabtec.

•

Upon completion of required labor group consultations, on October 6, 2015, the 51% shareholders entered into a definitive share purchase agreement and Faiveley Transport entered into an acquisition agreement with Wabtec.

•

Upon completing the share purchase, Wabtec will commence a tender offer for the remaining publicly traded Faiveley Transport shares. The public shareholders will have the option to elect to receive €100 per share in cash or Wabtec preferred stock. The preferred stock portion of the consideration is subject to a cap of 75% of Faiveley Transport’s common shares.  Wabtec intends to delist Faiveley Transport from Euronext after the tender offer if minority interests represent less than 5%.

The total purchase price offered is about $1.8 billion, including assumed debt.  Wabtec plans to fund the cash portion of the transaction with cash on hand, existing credit facilities and potentially other credit and debt financing.  Prior to

December 31, 2015

, Wabtec set aside €186.9 million as an escrow deposit for the Faiveley Transport purchase. The combination of Wabtec and Faiveley Transport would create one of the world’s largest public rail equipment companies, with revenues of about $4.5 billion and a presence in all key freight rail and passenger transit geographies worldwide.

Closing of the transaction is subject to various conditions, including completion of regulatory requirements.  These steps are currently on-going and the timing of completion is unknown.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following table shows our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years indicated.


COMPARED TO


The following table summarizes the results of operations for the period:

The following table shows the major components of the change in sales in


from


:

Net sales increased by

$263.5 million

to

$3,308.0 million

in


from

$3,044.5 million

in


. The increase is primarily due to a

$156.5 million

increase for Specialty Products and Electronics sales from higher demand for freight original equipment products and aftermarket electronic and PTC electronic products.  Acquisitions increased sales

$262.8 million

and unfavorable foreign exchange decreased sales

$151.8 million

.

Freight Segment sales increased by

$323.2 million

, or

18.7%

, primarily due to a

$145.7 million

increase for Specialty Products and Electronics sales from higher demand for freight original equipment rail products, PTC electronics, and aftermarket rail products and

$80.4 million

for Remanufacturing, Overhaul and Build products due to higher demand for aftermarket locomotive builds.  Acquisitions increased sales by

$145.5 million

and unfavorable foreign exchange decreased sales by

$49.6 million

.


Transit Segment sales decreased by

$59.7 million

, or

4.5%

, due to a decrease of

$102.3 million

related to unfavorable foreign exchange, a

$53.9 million

decrease in Remanufacturing, Overhaul and Build from lower demand for original transit locomotive because a multi-year project was substantially completed in 2014, and a

$23.1 million

decrease for Brake Products from lower demand for braking products in Europe and braking systems in North America.  These decreases were partially offset by

$117.3 million

in sales from acquisitions.

Cost of Sales and Gross Profit

The following table shows the major components of cost of sales for the periods indicated:

Cost of Sales increased by

$151.7 million

to

$2,260.2 million

in


compared to

$2,108.5 million

in the same period of


.  For the twelve months ended


, cost of sales as a percentage of sales was

68.3%

compared to

69.3%

in the same period of


.  The decrease of cost of sales as a percentage of sales is due to lower material costs primarily due to lower original equipment transit locomotive sales and higher specialty product and electronics sales.

Freight Segment cost of sales increased

0.5%

as a percentage of sales to

66.3%

in 2015 compared to

65.8%

for the same period of 2014.  The increase is primarily related to slightly lower margins related to recent acquisitions, and cost overruns on a project nearing completion, partially offset by higher Specialty Products and Electronics sales.

Transit Segment cost of sales decreased

2.2%

as a percentage of sales to

71.7%

in 2015 compared to

73.9%

for the same period in 2014.  The decrease in 2015 is primarily due to lower material costs associated with lower original equipment locomotive sales and lower original equipment and aftermarket brake product sales which carry higher raw material content, partially offset by additional costs incurred on the closeout of several projects.

Included in cost of sales is warranty expense. The provision for warranty expense is generally established for specific losses, along with historical estimates of customer claims as a percentage of sales, which can cause variability in warranty expense between quarters. Warranty expense for the twelve months ended December 31,


increased

$1.3 million

to

$35.4 million

from

$34.1 million

in


primarily due to increased sales.

Gross profit for the twelve months ended December 31,


increased

$111.8 million

to

$1,047.8 million

from

$936.0 million

for the twelve months ended December


and the gross profit margin increased 100 basis points to

31.7%

from

30.7%

at December 31,


.  These increases are due to higher sales volume, favorable sales mix, and the reasons discussed above.


Operating expenses

The following table shows our operating expenses:

Total operating expenses were

13.4%

for both the years ending December 31


, and


.  Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased

$22.8 million

, or

7.0%

, primarily due to $24.7 million of expenses from acquisitions partially offset by lower incentive and non-cash compensation expense and the effects of foreign exchange.  Engineering expense increased by

$9.3 million

, or

15.1%

, primarily due to $3.5 million of expenses from acquisitions.  The remainder of the increase can be attributed to the company concentrating resources on new product development, specifically in the electronics market.  Costs related to engineering for specific customer contracts are included in cost of sales.  Amortization expense decreased

$0.8 million

due to lower amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions.

The following table shows our segment operating expenses:

Freight Segment operating expenses increased

$19.8 million

, or

10.5%

, in


but decreased 70 basis points to

10.2%

Transit Segment operating expenses increased

$8.6 million

, or

4.4%

, in


and increased 140 basis points to

16.4%

of sales.  The increase is primarily related to $19.8 million of incremental operating expenses related to acquisitions.  This increase is partially offset by lower operating expenses due to foreign exchange.

Corporate non-allocated operating expenses increased

$2.9 million

in


primarily due to higher administrative and transaction costs associated with growing our business.

COMPARED TO


The following table summarizes the results of operations for the period:

The following table shows the major components of the change in sales in


from


:

Net sales increased by $478.1 million to $3,044.5 million in 2014 from $2,566.4 million in 2013. The increase is due to sales related to acquisitions of $229.4 million, $184.7 million for Specialty Products and Electronics sales from higher demand for freight original equipment products and aftermarket electronic products, and $84.2 million for Brake Products sales due to higher demand for original equipment products for freight customers and aftermarket brakes from certain transit authorities.  The increases were partially offset by lower sales for original equipment locomotives.  Favorable foreign exchange increased sales $11.2 million.

Freight Segment sales increased by $333.4 million, or 23.8%, primarily due to a $184.5 million for Specialty Products and Electronics sales from higher demand for freight original equipment rail products, positive train control electronics, and aftermarket rail products, acquisitions of $93.3 million, and $55.5 million for Brake Products due to higher demand for original equipment brakes.  Unfavorable foreign exchange decreased sales $12.2 million.

Transit Segment sales increased by $144.7 million, or 12.4%, due to acquisitions of $136.1 million and $28.7 million from increased demand for aftermarket brakes from certain transit authorities.  These increases were partially offset by $39.9 million in lower sales for original equipment transit locomotives.  Favorable foreign exchange increased net sales $23.4 million.


Cost of Sales and Gross Profit

The following table shows the major components of cost of sales for the periods indicated:

Cost of Sales increased by $306.1 million to $2,108.5 million in 2014 from $1,802.4 million in 2013.  Cost of sales, as a percentage of sales was 69.3% in 2014 and 70.2% in 2013.

Overhead costs as a percentage of sales decreased to approximately 14% in 2014 from 15% in 2013. Freight Segment raw material costs increased as a percentage of sales to approximately 42% in 2014 from 40% in 2013 due to the higher mix of revenue generated from freight and transit original equipment sales and aftermarket services, which have a higher raw material component as cost of sales. Freight Segment labor costs decreased from approximately 10% as a percentage of sales in 2014 from 11% in 2013, and overhead costs as a percentage of sales were approximately 13% in 2014 and 14% in 2013. Transit Segment raw material costs decreased as a percentage of sales to approximately 45% in 2014 from 46% in 2013, primarily due to lower original equipment locomotive sales, which have a higher raw material component. Transit Segment labor costs increased as a percentage of sales to approximately 13% in 2014 from 12% in 2013, and overhead costs remained unchanged at 15% for both 2014 and 2013. In general, overhead costs vary as a percentage of sales depending on product mix and changes in sales volume.

Included in cost of sales is warranty expense. The provision for warranty expense is generally established for specific losses, along with historical estimates of customer claims as a percentage of sales, which can cause variability in warranty expense between quarters. Warranty expense was $11.1 million higher in 2014 compared to 2013 due to increased sales.  As a percentage of sales, warranty expense was 0.6% in 2014 and 0.9% in 2013.

Gross profit increased to $936.0 million in 2014 compared to $764.0 million in 2013, due to higher sales volume and the reasons discussed above.  For 2014 and 2013, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 30.7% and 29.8%, respectively.

Operating expenses

The following table shows our operating expenses:

Total operating expenses were 13.4% and 12.7% of sales for the years ending December 31 2014, and 2013, respectively.  Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $61.8 million, or 23.5%, primarily due to $30.1 million of expenses from acquisitions and $9.2 million of expenses related to higher incentive and non-cash compensation expense.  In addition, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to support higher sales volumes.  Engineering expense


increased by $15.6 million, or 33.7%, primarily due to $7.5 million of expenses from acquisitions.  The remainder of the increase can be attributed to the company concentrating resources on new product development, specifically in the electronics market.  Costs related to engineering for specific customer contracts are included in cost of sales.  Amortization expense increased $4.7 million due to amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions.

The following table shows our segment operating expenses:

Freight Segment operating expenses increased $30.8 million, or 19.5%, in 2014 but decreased 40 basis points to 10.9% of sales.  The increase primarily relates to $8.4 million of incremental operating expenses from acquisitions, $8.2 million in higher corporate allocations mainly due to increased incentive compensation expense, and $8.2 million for engineering attributable to the Company concentrating resources on new product development.

Transit Segment operating expenses increased $43.6 million, or 28.5%, in 2014 and increased 190 basis points to 15.0% of sales.  The increase is primarily related to $33.9 million of incremental operating expenses related to acquisitions.  In addition, Transit Segment engineering expenses increased to support new product development.

Corporate non-allocated operating expenses increased $7.7 million in 2014 primarily due to higher administrative costs associated with growing our business.

Income from operations

Income from operations totaled $527.1 million or 17.3% of sales in 2014 compared to $437.3 million or 17.0% of sales in 2013. Income from operations increased due to higher sales volume, partially offset by increased operating expenses discussed above.

Income taxes

The effective income tax rate was 30.8% and 30.6% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. In 2014, the positive effect of an increase in foreign income taxed at lower statutory rates was offset by tax reserves required for uncertain tax positions in several jurisdictions.

Net income

Net income for 2014 increased $59.4 million to $351.7 million, compared to 2013. The increase in net income is due to higher sales volume and lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher operating expenses.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity is provided by operating cash flow and borrowings under the Company’s unsecured credit facility with a consortium of commercial banks. The following is a summary of selected cash flow information and other relevant data:

Operating activities

.

In


,


and


, cash provided by operations was

$448.3 million

,

$472.4 million

and

$235.7 million

, respectively. In comparison to


, cash provided by operations in


decreased due to unfavorable working capital requirements partially offset by higher operating results.  The unfavorable working capital requirements primarily related to an unfavorable change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $132.0 million and $86.9 million, respectively.  These cash outflows were partially offset by a favorable change in accounts receivable of $38.9 million driven by collections due to achieving certain project related milestones and a favorable change in inventory of $84.2 million due to successful efforts to control the amount of inventory on hand.

In comparison to 2013, cash provided by operations in 2014 increased due to reduced working capital compared to the prior year, coupled with higher operating results. The major components of the higher cash inflows were as follows: a positive change in accounts receivable of $132.3 million as the number of days to collect cash decreased, a positive change in other accrued liabilities and customer deposits of $117.6 million, and a positive change in accrued income taxes due to payment timing.  These cash inflows were partially offset by the following cash outflows: an unfavorable change in accounts payable of $5.6 million due to payment timing, and an unfavorable change or increase of $90.1 million in inventory as the Company held more inventory to support the higher backlog of orders in 2015.

Investing activities.

2013 Refinancing Credit Agreement

On

December 19, 2013

, the Company amended its existing revolving credit facility with a consortium of commercial banks. This “2013 Refinancing Credit Agreement” provides the company with a

$800.0 million

,

five

- year revolving credit facility. The Company incurred approximately

$1.0 million

of deferred financing cost related to the 2013 Refinancing Credit Agreement. The facility expires on

December 19, 2018

. The 2013 Refinancing Credit Agreement borrowings bear variable interest rates indexed as described below. At

December 31, 2015

, the Company had available bank borrowing capacity, net of

$21.9 million

of letters of credit, of approximately

$333.1 million

, subject to certain financial covenant restrictions.

Under the 2013 Refinancing Credit Agreement, the Company may elect a Base Rate of interest for U.S. Dollar denominated loans or, for certain currencies,  an interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) of interest, or other rates appropriate for such currencies  (in any case, “the Alternate Rate”). The Base Rate adjusts on a daily basis and is the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus

0.5%

per annum, the PNC, N.A. prime rate or the Daily LIBOR Rate plus

100 basis points

, plus a margin that ranges from

0 basis points

to

75 basis points

. The Alternate Rate is based on the quoted rates specific to the applicable currency, plus a margin that ranges from

75 basis points

to

175 basis points

. Both the Base Rate and Alternate Rate margins are dependent on the Company’s consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios. The initial Base Rate margin is

0 basis points

and the Alternate Rate margin is

75 basis points

.

At

December 31, 2015

, the weighted average interest rate on the Company’s variable rate debt was

1.10%

.  On

January 12, 2012

, the Company entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of

$150.0 million

. The effective date of the interest rate swap agreement is

July 31, 2013

, and the termination date is

November 7, 2016

. The impact of the interest rate swap agreement converts a portion of the Company’s outstanding debt from a variable rate to a fixed-rate borrowing. During the term of the interest rate swap agreement the interest rate on the notional value will be fixed at

1.415%

plus the Alternate Rate margin. On

June 5, 2014

, the Company entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of

$150.0 million

.  The effective date of the interest rate swap agreement is

November 7, 2016

, and the termination date is

December 19, 2018

.  The impact of the interest rate swap agreement converts a portion of the Company’s outstanding debt from a variable rate to a fixed-rate borrowing.  During the term of the interest rate swap agreement the interest rate on the notional value will be fixed at

2.56%

plus the Alternate Rate margin.  As for these agreements, the Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties.  However, since only the cash interest payments are exchanged, exposure is significantly less than the notional amount.  The counterparties are large financial institutions with an excellent credit rating and history of performance.  The Company currently believes the risk of nonperformance is negligible.

The 2013 Refinancing Credit Agreement limits the Company’s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the Company from declaring or making other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. The 2013 Refinancing Credit Agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations: incurrence of additional indebtedness; mergers, consolidations, sales of assets and acquisitions; additional liens; sale and leasebacks; permissible investments, loans and advances; certain debt payments; and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio of

3.0

and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio of

3.25

. The Company does not expect that these measurements will limit the Company in executing it's operating activities. See Note 9 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.

2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement

On

November 7, 2011

, the Company refinanced its existing revolving credit and term loan facility with a consortium of commercial banks. This “2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement” provided the Company with a

$600.0 million

,

five

-year revolving credit facility. The Company incurred approximately

$1.9 million

of deferred financing cost related to the 2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement. The facility was set to expire on

November 7, 2016

.

Under the 2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement, the Company may have elected a Base Rate of interest or an interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) of interest (“the Alternate Rate”). The Base Rate adjusted on a daily basis and was the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus

0.5%

per annum, the PNC, N.A. prime rate or the Daily LIBOR Rate plus

100 basis points

plus a margin that ranged from

0 basis points

to

0.75 basis points

. The Alternate Rate was based on quoted LIBOR rates plus a margin that ranged from

0.75 basis points

to

175 basis points

. Both the Base Rate and Alternate Rate margins were dependent on the Company’s consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios. The current Base Rate margin was

0 basis points

and the Alternate Rate margin was

100 basis points

.


4.375% Senior Notes Due August 2023

In

August 31, 2013

, the Company issued

$250.0 million

of Senior Notes due in


(“the 2013 Notes”).   Interest on the 2013 Notes accrues at a rate of

4.375%

per annum and is payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year.  The proceeds were used to repay debt outstanding under the Company’s existing credit agreement, and for general corporate purposes.  The principal balance is due in full at maturity.  The Company incurred

$2.6 million

of deferred financing costs related to the issuance of the 2013 Notes.

The 2013 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and rank pari passu with all existing and future senior debt and senior to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the Company. The indenture under which the 2013 Notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things, the following: the incurrence of indebtedness, payment of dividends and certain distributions, sale of assets, change in control, mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens.

The Company is in compliance with the restrictions and covenants in the indenture under which the 2013 Notes were issued and expects that these restrictions and covenants will not be any type of limiting factor in executing our operating activities.

6.875% Senior Notes Due August 2013

In

August 31, 2003

, the Company issued

$150.0 million

of Senior Notes due in 2013 (“the 2003 Notes”). The 2003 Notes were issued at par. Interest on the 2003 Notes accrued at a rate of

6.875%

per annum and was payable semi-annually on January 31 and July 31 of each year. The proceeds were used to repay debt outstanding under the Company’s existing credit agreement and for general corporate purposes. The Company paid off the 2003 Notes, which matured on

July 31, 2013

utilizing available capacity under it's 2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement.


Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Estimated pension funding and post-retirement benefit payments are based on actuarial estimates using current assumptions for discount rates, expected return on long-term assets, rate of compensation increases and health care cost trend rates. Benefits paid for pension obligations were

$11.7 million

and

$12.7 million

in


and


, respectively. Benefits paid for post-retirement plans were

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires Management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Areas of uncertainty that require judgments, estimates and assumptions include the accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts, inventories, the testing of goodwill and other intangibles for impairment, warranty reserves, pensions and other postretirement benefits, stock based compensation and tax matters. Management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments and estimates, and actual results will inevitably differ from those estimates and assumptions that are used to prepare the Company’s financial statements at any given time. Despite these inherent limitations, Management believes that Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) and the financial statements and related footnotes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the Company. A discussion of the judgments and uncertainties associated with accounting for derivatives and environmental matters can be found in Notes 3 and 19, respectively, in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.

A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 3 in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report and is incorporated by reference herein. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the Company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the Company’s operating results and financial condition.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts:

Description

The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts to cover anticipated losses on uncollectible accounts receivable.

Judgments and Uncertainties

The allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available evidence.

Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions

If our estimates regarding the collectability of troubled accounts, and/or our actual losses within our receivable portfolio exceed our historical experience, we may be exposed to the expense of increasing our allowance for doubtful accounts.


Inventories:

Description

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and are reviewed to ensure that an adequate provision is recognized for excess, slow moving and obsolete inventories.

Judgments and Uncertainties

Cost is determined under the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Inventory costs include material, labor and overhead. The Company compares inventory components to prior year sales history and current backlog and anticipated future requirements. To the extent that inventory parts exceed estimated usage and demand, a reserve is recognized to reduce the carrying value of inventory. Also, specific reserves are established for known inventory obsolescence.

Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions

If the market value of our products were to decrease due to changing market conditions, the Company could be at risk of incurring write-downs to adjust inventory value to a market value lower than stated cost. If our estimates regarding sales and backlog requirements are inaccurate, we may be exposed to the expense of increasing our reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventory.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangibles:

Description

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are required to be tested for impairment at least annually. The Company performs its annual impairment test during the fourth quarter and more frequently when indicators of impairment are present. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. The evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of the business to the recorded value (including goodwill).

Judgments and Uncertainties

A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the impairment test, including the identification of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, Wabtec specific events and share price trends and making the assessment on whether each relevant factor will impact the impairment test positively or negatively and the magnitude of any such amount.

Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions

Management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated. However, actual amounts realized may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations. For example, based on the last quantitative analysis performed as of October 1, 2013, a decline in the terminal growth rate greater than 50 basis points would decrease fair market value by $175.2 million, or an increase in the weighted-average cost of capital by 100 basis points would result in a decrease in fair market value by $482.9 million. Even with such changes the fair value of the reporting units would be greater than their net book values, necessitating no Step 2 calculations. See Note 3 in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report for additional discussion regarding impairment testing.

Warranty Reserves:

Description

The Company provides warranty reserves to cover expected costs from repairing or replacing products with durability, quality or workmanship issues occurring during established warranty periods.

Judgments and Uncertainties

In general, reserves are provided for as a percentage of sales, based on historical experience. In addition, specific reserves are established for known warranty issues and their estimable losses.

Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions

If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments used to calculate our warranty liability, the Company may be at risk of realizing material gains or losses.

Accounting for Pensions and Postretirement Benefits:

Description

The Company provides pension and postretirement benefits for its employees.  These amounts are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions, including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability, the long-term rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce (salary increases, medical costs, retirement age and mortality).

Judgments and Uncertainties

Significant judgments and estimates are used in determining the liabilities and expenses for pensions and other postretirement benefits. The rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined considering the rates available at year-end on debt instruments that could be used to settle the obligations of the plan. The long-term rate of


return is estimated by considering historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a five-year average market value of assets.  The differences between actual and expected asset returns are recognized in expense using the normal amortization of gains and losses per ASC 715.

Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions

If assumptions used in determining the pension and other postretirement benefits change significantly, these costs can fluctuate materially from period to period. The key assumptions in determining the pension and other postretirement expense and obligation include the discount rate, expected return on assets and health care cost trend rate. For example, a 1% decrease or increase in the discount rate used in determining the pension and postretirement expense would increase expense $2.0 million or decrease expense $2.3 million, respectively. A 1% decrease or increase in the discount rate used in determining the pension and postretirement obligation would increase the obligation $34.7 million or decrease the obligation $42.6 million, respectively. A 1% decrease or increase in the expected return on assets used in determining the pension expense would increase or decrease expense $2.1 million, respectively. If the actual asset values at December 31,


had been 1% lower, the amortization of losses in the following year would decrease $0.1 million. A 1% decrease or increase in the health care cost trend rate used in determining the postretirement expense would increase the expense $0.04 million or decrease expense $0.02 million. A 1% decrease or increase in the health care cost trend rate used in determining the postretirement obligation would increase or decrease the obligation $0.3 million, respectively.

Stock-based Compensation:

Description

The Company has issued incentive stock units to eligible employees that vest upon attainment of certain cumulative three-year performance goals. The program is structured as a rolling three-year plan; each year starts a new three-year performance cycle with the most recently commenced cycle being 2013-2015. No incentive stock units will vest for performance below the three-year cumulative threshold.  The Company utilizes an economic profit measure for this performance goal.  Economic profit is a measure of the extent to which the Company produces financial results in excess of its cost of capital.  Based on the Company’s achievement of the threshold and three-year cumulative performance, the stock units vested can range from 0% to 200% of the shares granted.

Judgments and Uncertainties

Significant judgments and estimates are used in determining the estimated three-year performance, which is then used to estimate the total shares expected to vest over the three year vesting cycle and corresponding expense based on the grant date fair value of the award.  When determining the estimated three-year performance, the Company utilizes a combination of historical actual results, budgeted results and forecasts.  In the initial grant year of a performance cycle, the Company estimates the three-year performance at 100%.  As actual performance results for a cycle begin to accumulate and the Company completes its budgeting and forecasting cycles the performance estimates are updated.  These judgments and estimates are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis.

Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions

If assumptions used in determining the estimated three-year performance change significantly, stock-based compensation expense related to the unvested incentive stock awards can fluctuate materially from period to period.  For example a 10% decrease or increase in the estimated vesting percentage for incentive stock awards would decrease or increase stock-based compensation expense by approximately

$1.4 million

and

$1.4 million

, respectively.

Income Taxes:

Description

Wabtec records an estimated liability or benefit for income and other taxes based on what it determines will likely be paid in various tax jurisdictions in which it operates in accordance with ASC 740-10 Accounting for Income Taxes and Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.

Judgments and Uncertainties

The estimate of our tax obligations are uncertain because Management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions, as well as realization of our deferred tax assets. ASC 740-10 establishes a recognition and measurement threshold to determine the amount of tax benefit that should be recognized related to uncertain tax positions.

Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions

Management uses its best judgment in the determination of these amounts. However, the liabilities ultimately realized and paid are dependent on various matters including the resolution of the tax audits in the various affected tax jurisdictions and may differ from the amounts recorded. An adjustment to the estimated liability would be recorded through income in the period in which it becomes probable that the amount of the actual liability differs from the recorded amount. A deferred tax valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.


Revenue Recognition:

Description

Revenue is recognized in accordance with ASC-605 “Revenue Recognition.” The Company recognizes revenues on long-term contracts based on the percentage of completion method of accounting. The units-of-delivery method or other input-based or output-based measures, as appropriate, are used to measure the progress toward completion of individual contracts. Contract revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised at a minimum quarterly and adjustments are reflected in the accounting period as such amounts are determined. Certain pre-production costs relating to long term production and supply contracts have been deferred and will be recognized over the life of the contracts.

Judgments and Uncertainties

Revenue is recognized when products have been shipped to the respective customers, title has passed and the price for the product has been determined. Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated profit margin percentages. For each contract with revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method, the amount reported as revenues is determined by calculating cost incurred to date as a percentage of the total expected contract costs to determine the percentage of total contract revenue to be recognized in the current period. Due to the size, duration and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). Total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. For long-term contracts, revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised quarterly at a minimum and adjustments are reflected in the accounting period as such amounts are determined. Pre-production costs are recognized over the expected life of the contract usually based on the Company’s progress toward the estimated number of units expected to be delivered under the production or supply contract.

Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions

Should market conditions and customer demands dictate changes to our standard shipping terms, the Company may be impacted by longer than typical revenue recognition cycles. The development of expected contract costs and contract profit margin percentages involves procedures and personnel in all areas that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process, it is likely that materially different revenue amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined profit margin for all contracts recognized on the percentage of completion method during


had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased revenue and gross profit for the year by approximately $12.2 million. A few of our contracts are expected to be completed in a loss position. Provisions are made currently for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts. A charge to expense for unrecognized portions of pre-production costs could be realized if the Company’s estimate of the number of units to be delivered changes or the underlying contract is cancelled.

Item 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk

In the ordinary course of business, Wabtec is exposed to risks that increases in interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with its variable-rate debt. The Company’s variable rate debt represents 42% and 23% of total long-term debt at December 31,


and


, respectively. On an annual basis a 1% change in the interest rate for variable rate debt at December 31,


would increase or decrease interest expense by about $3.0 million.

To reduce the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of this variable-rate debt, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements which effectively converted a portion of the debt from a variable to a fixed-rate borrowing during the term of the swap contracts. Refer to “Financial Derivatives and Hedging Activities” in Note 3 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report for additional information regarding interest rate risk.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

The Company is subject to certain risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent our operations are conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For the year ended December 31,


, approximately 53% of Wabtec’s net sales were in the United States, 11% in the United Kingdom, 6% in Canada, 6% in Mexico, 3% in Australia, 3% in Brazil, 3% in Germany, 3% in China, and 12% in other international locations. (See Note 20 of “Notes in Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report). To reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates,


the Company has periodically entered into foreign currency forward contracts. Refer to “Financial Derivatives and Hedging Activities” in Note 3 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report for more information regarding foreign currency exchange risk.

Our market risk exposure is not substantially different from our exposure at December 31,

MANAGEMENT’S REPORTS TO WABTEC SHAREHOLDERS

Management’s Report on Financial Statements and Practices

The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) were prepared by Management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. The statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and include amounts that are based on Management’s best judgments and estimates. The other financial information included in the 10-K is consistent with that in the financial statements.

Management also recognizes its responsibility for conducting the Company’s affairs according to the highest standards of personal and corporate conduct. This responsibility is characterized and reflected in key policy statements issued from time to time regarding, among other things, conduct of its business activities within the laws of host countries in which the Company operates and potentially conflicting outside business interests of its employees. The Company maintains a systematic program to assess compliance with these policies.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Management has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (COSO). The Company’s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management has excluded Relay Monitoring Systems PTY Ltd. ("RMS"), Track IQ, Metalocaucho ("MTC"), and Railroad Controls, L.P. ("RCL") from its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2015

because the Company acquired RMS effective October 30, 2015, Track IQ effective October 8, 2015, MTC effective June 17, 2015, and RCL effective February 4, 2015.  RMS, Track IQ, MTC, and RCL are wholly owned subsidiaries whose total assets represents 0.8%, 0.4%, 1.0%, and 2.8%, respectively, and whose total net assets represents 0.6%, 1.3%, 1.6%, and 5.2%, respectively, and whose customer revenues represents 0.0%, 0.1%, 0.4%, and 3.2%, respectively, and net income represents 0.0%, 0.2%, 0.0%, and 3.9%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended

December 31, 2015

.

Based on its assessment, Management has concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2015

, based on criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2015

, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation as of December 31,


and


, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,


. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s Management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation as of December 31,


and


, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,


, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,


, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) and our report dated

February 19, 2016

, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation:

We have audited Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2015

, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (the COSO criteria). Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Relay Monitoring Systems PTY Ltd. ("RMS"), Track IQ, Metalocaucho ("MTC"), and Railroad Controls, L.P. ("RCL") which are included in the


consolidated financial statements of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation and constituted 0.8%, 0.4%, 1.0%, and 2.8%, respectively, of total assets and 0.6%, 1.3%, 1.6%, and 5.2%, respectively, of total net assets as of

December 31, 2015

, and 0.0%, 0.1%, 0.4%, and 3.2%, respectively, of net sales and 0.0%, 0.2%, 0.0%, and 3.9%, respectively, of net income for the year then ended.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of RMS, Track IQ, Metalocaucho and RCL.

In our opinion, Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.   BUSINESS

Wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of value-added, technology-based products and services for the global rail industry. Our products are found on virtually all U.S. locomotives, freight cars and passenger transit vehicles, as well as in more than


countries throughout the world. Our products enhance safety, improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers, and many of our core products and services are essential in the safe and efficient operation of freight rail and passenger transit vehicles. Wabtec is a global company with operations in


countries. In


, about

47%

of the Company’s revenues came from customers outside the U.S.


.

PROPOSED TRANSACTION WITH FAIVELEY TRANSPORT S.A.

On July 27, 2015, the Company announced plans to acquire Faiveley Transport S.A. ("Faiveley Transport"), a leading

global provider of value-added, integrated systems and services for the railway industry with annual sales of about

$1.2 billion

and more than

5,700

employees in


countries. Faiveley Transport supplies railway manufacturers, operators and maintenance

providers with a range of valued-added, technology-based systems and services in Energy & Comfort (air conditioning, power

collectors and converters, and passenger information), Access & Mobility (passenger access systems and platform doors), and

Brakes & Safety (braking systems and couplers).

The transaction has been structured in three steps:

•

Wabtec made an irrevocable offer to the owners of approximately

51%

of Faiveley Transport’s shares for a purchase price of

€100

per share, payable

25%

in cash and

75%

in Wabtec preferred stock. The preferred stock will have a

1%

annual dividend or, if greater, the annual dividend assuming full conversion into common shares, and must be converted after

three

years into Wabtec common shares at an implied ratio of one Faiveley Transport common share for

1.125

Wabtec common shares. Shareholders owning

51%

of Faiveley Transport have entered into exclusive discussions with Wabtec.

•

Upon completion of required labor group consultations, on October 6, 2015, the

51%

shareholders entered into a definitive share purchase agreement and Faiveley Transport entered into an acquisition agreement with Wabtec.

•

Upon completing the share purchase, Wabtec will commence a tender offer for the remaining publicly traded Faiveley Transport shares. The public shareholders will have the option to elect to receive

€100

per share in cash or Wabtec preferred stock. The preferred stock portion of the consideration is subject to a cap of

75%

of Faiveley Transport’s common shares. Wabtec intends to delist Faiveley Transport from Euronext after the tender offer if minority interests represent less than

5%

.

The total purchase price offered is about

$1.8 billion

, including assumed debt. Wabtec plans to fund the cash portion of the transaction with cash on hand, existing credit facilities and potentially other credit and debt financing. Prior to

December 31, 2015

, Wabtec set aside

€186.9 million

as an escrow deposit for the Faiveley Transport purchase. The combination of Wabtec and Faiveley Transport would create one of the world’s largest public rail equipment companies, with revenues of about

$4.5 billion

and a presence in all key freight rail and passenger transit geographies worldwide.

Closing of the transaction is subject to various conditions, including completion of regulatory requirements. These steps are currently on-going and the timing of completion is unknown.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority owned subsidiaries. Such statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Sales between subsidiaries are billed at prices consistent with sales to third parties and are eliminated in consolidation.

Capital Structure

On May 14, 2013, our stockholders approved an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock to

200.0

million shares.  In addition, on May 14, 2013, our Board of Directors approved a

two

-for-one split of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock in the form of a

100%

stock dividend.  The increase in the authorized shares and the stock split became effective on May 14, 2013 and June 11, 2013, respectively.

The Company issued approximately

66.2

million shares of its common stock as a result of the

two

-for-one stock split. The par value of the Company’s common stock remained unchanged at

$0.01

per share.


Information regarding shares of common stock (except par value per share), retained earnings, and net income per common share attributable to Wabtec shareholders for all periods presented reflects the

two

-for-one split of the Company’s common stock. The number of shares of the Company’s common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options and vesting of other stock-based awards was proportionally increased, and the exercise price per share thereof was proportionally decreased, in accordance with the terms of the stock incentive plans.

Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available evidence. The allowance for doubtful accounts was

$5.6 million

and

$6.3 million

as of

December 31, 2015

and


, respectively.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined under the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Inventory costs include material, labor and overhead.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment additions are stated at cost. Expenditures for renewals and improvements are capitalized. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The Company provides for book depreciation principally on the straight-line method. Accelerated depreciation methods are utilized for income tax purposes.

Leasing Arrangements

The Company conducts a portion of its operations from leased facilities and finances certain equipment purchases through lease agreements. In those cases in which the lease term approximates the useful life of the leased asset or the lease meets certain other prerequisites, the leasing arrangement is classified as a capital lease. The remaining arrangements are treated as operating leases.

Intangible Assets

Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized. Other intangibles (with definite lives) are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives. Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment are present. The Company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually. The Company performs its annual impairment test during the fourth quarter after the annual forecasting process is completed, and also tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Periodically, Management of the Company assesses whether or not an indicator of impairment is present that would necessitate an impairment analysis be performed.

For 2015, the Company opted to perform a qualitative goodwill assessment and determined that step two was not necessary.  In assessing the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we assess relevant events and circumstances that may impact the fair value and the carrying amount of the reporting unit. The identification of relevant events and circumstances and how these may impact a reporting unit’s fair value or carrying amount involve significant judgments and assumptions. The judgment and assumptions include the identification of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, Wabtec specific events and share price trends and making the assessment on whether each relevant factor will impact the impairment test positively or negatively and the magnitude of any such impact.

If our qualitative assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company then performs a two-step impairment test. In the first step of the quantitative assessment, our assets and liabilities, including existing goodwill and other intangible assets, are assigned to the identified reporting units to determine the carrying value of the reporting units. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company prepares its goodwill impairment analysis by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit, using an income approach (a discounted cash flow model) as well as a market approach, with its carrying value. The income approach and the market approach are equally weighted in arriving at fair value, which the Company has applied consistently. The discounted cash flow model requires several assumptions including future sales growth, EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margins and capital expenditures for the reporting units. The discounted cash flow model also requires the use of a discount rate and a terminal revenue growth rate (the revenue growth rate for the period beyond the three years forecasted by the reporting units), as well as projections of future operating margins. The market approach requires several assumptions including EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) multiples for comparable companies that operate in the same markets as the Company’s reporting units.


Warranty Costs

Warranty costs are accrued based on Management’s estimates of repair or upgrade costs per unit and historical experience. Warranty expense was

$35.4 million

,

$34.1 million

and

$22.9 million

for


,


and


, respectively. Accrued warranty was

$92.1 million

and

$87.8 million

at

December 31, 2015

and


, respectively.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws. The provision for income taxes includes federal, state and foreign income taxes.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company recognizes compensation expense for stock-based compensation based on the grant date fair value amortized ratably over the requisite service period following the date of grant.

Financial Derivatives and Hedging Activities

The Company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Foreign currency forward contracts are agreements with a counterparty to exchange two distinct currencies at a set exchange rate for delivery on a set date at some point in the future. There is no exchange of funds until the delivery date. At the delivery date the Company can either take delivery of the currency or settle on a net basis. At

December 31, 2015

, the Company had

no

material foreign currency forward contracts.

To reduce the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of it's variable-rate debt, the Company has entered into

two

forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of

$150 million

.  As of

December 31, 2015

, the Company has recorded a current liability of

$4.5 million

and a corresponding offset in accumulated other comprehensive loss of

$2.7 million

, net of tax, related to these agreements. For further information regarding the forward starting interest rate swap agreements, see Footnote 9.

Foreign Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, except for the Company’s Mexican operations whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, are translated at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date while income and expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the period. Foreign currency gains and losses resulting from transactions, and the translation of financial statements are recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements based upon the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 830, “Foreign Currency Matters.” The effects of currency exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions and balances of a long-term investment nature are accumulated and carried as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The effects of currency exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions that are denominated in a currency other than an entity’s functional currency are charged or credited to earnings. Foreign exchange transaction losses recognized in other (expense) income, net were

$4.7 million

,

$2.4 million

and

$3.5 million

for


,


and


, respectively.

Noncontrolling Interests

In accordance with ASC 810, the Company has classified noncontrolling interests as equity on our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of

December 31, 2015

and


. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the years ended

December 31, 2015

,


and


was not material.

Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as net income and all other non-owner changes in shareholders’ equity. The Company’s accumulated other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments, foreign currency hedges, foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps, and pension and post retirement related adjustments.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized in accordance with ASC 605 “Revenue Recognition,”  The Company recognized revenue when the following criteria are met: 1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; 2) delivery has occurred; 3) an established sales price has been set with the customer; 4) collection of the sale revenue from the customer is reasonably assured; and 5) no contingencies exist.  Delivery is considered to have occurred when the customer assumes the risk and rewards of ownership.  The Company estimates and records provisions for quantity rebates and sales returns and allowances as an offset to revenue in the same period the related revenue is recognized, based upon its experience.  These items are included as a reduction in deriving net sales.

In general, the Company recognizes revenues on long-term contracts based on the percentage of completion method of accounting. The units-of-delivery method or other input-based or output-based measures, as appropriate, are used to measure the progress toward completion of individual contracts. Contract revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised quarterly at a minimum and adjustments are reflected in the accounting period as such amounts are determined. Provisions are made currently for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts. Unbilled accounts receivables were

$103.8 million

and

$187.8 million

, customer deposits were

$106.1 million

and

$111.8 million

, and provisions for loss contracts were

$11.8 million

and

$7.1 million

at

December 31, 2015

and


, respectively.


Certain pre-production costs relating to long-term production and supply contracts have been deferred and will be recognized over the life of the contracts. Deferred pre-production costs were

$30.3 million

and

$24.9 million

at

December 31, 2015

and


, respectively.

Significant Customers and Concentrations of Credit Risk

The Company’s trade receivables are from rail and transit industry original equipment manufacturers, Class I railroads, railroad carriers and commercial companies that utilize rail cars in their operations, such as utility and chemical companies.

No

one customer accounted for more than

10%

of the Company’s consolidated net sales in


,


or


.

Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs

All fees billed to the customer for shipping and handling are classified as a component of net revenues. All costs associated with shipping and handling is classified as a component of cost of sales.

Research and Development

Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. For the years ended

December 31, 2015

,


and


, the Company incurred costs of approximately

$71.2 million

,

$61.9 million

, and

$46.3 million

, respectively.

Employees

As of

December 31, 2015

, approximately

30%

of the Company’s workforce was covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements are generally effective from 2015 through 2017. Agreements expiring in 2015 cover approximately

26%

of the Company’s workforce.

Earnings Per Share

Basic and diluted earnings per common share is computed in accordance with ASC 260 “Earnings Per Share.” Unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method included in ASC 260-10-55. (See Note 12 “Earnings Per Share” included herein)

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts could differ from the estimates. On an ongoing basis, Management reviews its estimates based on currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-3, “Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs” (“ASU 2015-3”) which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements to present such costs as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. ASU 2015-3 will become effective for public companies during interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact to the financial statements. The Company will make the required changes in the first quarter of 2016.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU no. 2014-9, “Revenue from Contract with Customers.” The ASU will supersede most of the existing revenue recognition requirements in U.S. GAAP and will require entities to recognize revenue at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. The new standard also requires significantly expanded disclosures regarding the qualitative and quantitative information of an entity’s nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The Board voted to propose that the standard would take effect for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and that early adoption would be allowed as of the original effective date. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the pronouncement will have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, “Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes” as part of their simplification initiatives. The update requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of

financial position. The update is effective for financial periods beginning after December 15, 2017; however, early application is permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact to the financial statements.

LONG-TERM DEBT

Long-term debt consisted of the following:

2013 Refinancing Credit Agreement

On

December 19, 2013

, the Company amended its existing revolving credit facility with a consortium of commercial banks. This “2013 Refinancing Credit Agreement” provides the company with a

$800.0 million

,

five

- year revolving credit facility. The Company incurred approximately

$1.0 million

of deferred financing cost related to the 2013 Refinancing Credit Agreement. The facility expires on

December 19, 2018

. The 2013 Refinancing Credit Agreement borrowings bear variable interest rates indexed as described below. At

December 31, 2015

, the Company had available bank borrowing capacity, net of

$21.9 million

of letters of credit, of approximately

$333.1 million

, subject to certain financial covenant restrictions.

Under the 2013 Refinancing Credit Agreement, the Company may elect a Base Rate of interest for U.S. Dollar denominated loans or, for certain currencies,  an interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) of interest, or other rates appropriate for such currencies  (in any case, “the Alternate Rate”). The Base Rate adjusts on a daily basis and is the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus

0.5%

per annum, the PNC, N.A. prime rate or the Daily LIBOR Rate plus

100 basis points

, plus a margin that ranges from

0 basis points

to

75 basis points

. The Alternate Rate is based on the quoted rates specific to the applicable currency, plus a margin that ranges from

75 basis points

to

175 basis points

. Both the Base Rate and Alternate Rate margins are dependent on the Company’s consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios. The initial Base Rate margin is

0 basis points

and the Alternate Rate margin is

75 basis points

.

At

December 31, 2015

the weighted average interest rate on the Company’s variable rate debt was

1.10%

.  On

January 12, 2012

, the Company entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of

$150.0 million

. The effective date of the interest rate swap agreement is

July 31, 2013

, and the termination date is

November 7, 2016

. The impact of the interest rate swap agreement converts a portion of the Company’s outstanding debt from a variable rate to a fixed-rate borrowing. During the term of the interest rate swap agreement the interest rate on the notional value will be fixed at

1.415%

plus the Alternate Rate margin. On

June 5, 2014

, the Company entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of

$150.0 million

.  The effective date of the interest rate swap agreement is

November 7, 2016

, and the termination date is

December 19, 2018

.  The impact of the interest rate swap agreement converts a portion of the Company’s outstanding debt from a variable rate to a fixed-rate borrowing.  During the term of the interest rate swap agreement the interest rate on the notional value will be fixed at

2.56%

plus the Alternate Rate margin.  As for these agreements, the Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties.  However, since only the cash interest payments are exchanged, exposure is significantly less than the notional amount.  The counterparties are large financial institutions with an excellent credit rating and history of performance.  The Company currently believes the risk of nonperformance is negligible.

The 2013 Refinancing Credit Agreement limits the Company’s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the Company from declaring or making other distributions, subject to certain exceptions. The 2013 Refinancing Credit Agreement


contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations: incurrence of additional indebtedness; mergers, consolidations, sales of assets and acquisitions; additional liens; sale and leasebacks; permissible investments, loans and advances; certain debt payments; and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio of

3.0

and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio of

3.25

. The Company does not expect that these measurements will limit the Company in executing our operating activities.

2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement

On

November 7, 2011

, the Company refinanced its existing revolving credit and term loan facility with a consortium of commercial banks. This “2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement” provided the company with a

$600.0 million

,

five

-year revolving credit facility. The Company incurred approximately

$1.9 million

of deferred financing cost related to the 2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement. The facility was set to expire on

November 7, 2016

.

Under the 2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement, the Company may have elected a Base Rate of interest or an interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) of interest (“the Alternate Rate”). The Base Rate adjusted on a daily basis and was the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus

0.5%

per annum, the PNC, N.A. prime rate or the Daily LIBOR Rate plus

100 basis points

plus a margin that ranged from

0 basis points

to

75 basis points

. The Alternate Rate was based on quoted LIBOR rates plus a margin that ranged from

75 basis points

to

175 basis points

. Both the Base Rate and Alternate Rate margins were dependent on the Company’s consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios. The current Base Rate margin was

0 basis points

and the Alternate Rate margin was

100 basis points

.

4.375% Senior Notes Due August 2023

In

August 31, 2013

, the Company issued

$250.0 million

of Senior Notes due in


(“the 2013 Notes”).   Interest on the 2013 Notes accrues at a rate of

4.375%

per annum and is payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year.  The proceeds were used to repay debt outstanding under the Company’s existing credit agreement, and for general corporate purposes.  The principal balance is due in full at maturity.  The Company incurred

$2.6 million

of deferred financing costs related to the issuance.

The 2013 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and rank pari passu with all existing and future senior debt and senior to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the Company. The indenture under which the 2013 Notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things, the following: the incurrence of indebtedness, payment of dividends and certain distributions, sale of assets, change in control, mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens.

The Company is in compliance with the restrictions and covenants in the indenture under which the 2013 Notes were issued and expects that these restrictions and covenants will not be any type of limiting factor in executing our operating activities.

August 31, 2003

, the Company issued

$150.0 million

of Senior Notes due in 2013 (“the 2003 Notes”). The 2003 Notes were issued at par. Interest on the 2003 Notes accrued at a rate of

6.875%

per annum and was payable semi-annually on January 31 and July 31 of each year. The proceeds were used to repay debt outstanding under the Company’s existing credit agreement and for general corporate purposes. The Company paid off the 2003 Notes, which matured on

July 31, 2013

utilizing available capacity under the 2011 Refinancing Credit Agreement.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans that cover certain U.S., Canadian, German, and United Kingdom employees and which provide benefits of stated amounts for each year of service of the employee. The Company uses a December 31 measurement date for the plans.

The following tables provide information regarding the Company’s defined benefit pension plans summarized by U.S. and international components.

Obligations and Funded Status

The aggregate accumulated benefit obligation for the U.S. pension plans was

$45.2 million

and

$49.3 million

as of

December 31, 2015

and


, respectively. The aggregate accumulated benefit obligation for the international pension plans was

$190.2 million

and

$213.4 million

as of

December 31, 2015

and


, respectively.


Components of Net Periodic Benefit Costs

Other Changes in Plan Assets and Benefit Obligations Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income during 2015 are as follows:

The weighted average assumptions in the following table represent the rates used to develop the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation for the year listed.

The discount rate is based on settling the pension obligation with high grade, high yield corporate bonds, and the rate of compensation increase is based on actual experience. The expected return on plan assets is based on historical performance as well as expected future rates of return on plan assets considering the current investment portfolio mix and the long-term investment strategy.

As of

December 31, 2015

the following table represents the amounts included in other comprehensive loss that are expected to be recognized as components of periodic benefit costs in


.


Pension Plan Assets

The Company has established formal investment policies for the assets associated with our pension plans. Objectives include maximizing long-term return at acceptable risk levels and diversifying among asset classes. Asset allocation targets are based on periodic asset liability study results which help determine the appropriate investment strategies. The investment policies permit variances from the targets within certain parameters. The plan assets consist primarily of equity security funds, debt security funds, and temporary cash and cash equivalent investments. The assets held in these funds are generally actively managed and are valued at the net asset value per share multiplied by the number of shares held as of the measurement date. Generally, all plan assets are considered Level 2 based on the fair value valuation hierarchy (See Note 18 “Fair Value Measurement” included herein). Plan assets by asset category at

December 31, 2015

and


are as follows:

The U.S., Canadian and German pension plans have a target asset allocation of

50%

equity securities and

50%

debt securities. The United Kingdom plan has a target asset allocation of

62.5%

equity securities and

37.5%

debt securities. Investment policies are determined by the respective Plan’s Pension Committee and set forth in its Investment Policy. Rebalancing of the asset allocation occurs on a quarterly basis.

Cash Flows

The Company’s funding methods are based on governmental requirements and differ from those methods used to recognize pension expense. The Company expects to contribute

$6.2 million

to the international plans and does not expect to make a contribution to the U.S. plans during


.

Benefit payments expected to be paid to plan participants are as follows:

Post Retirement Benefit Plans

In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company has provided certain unfunded postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for a portion of North American employees. The Company is not obligated to pay health care and life insurance benefits to individuals who had retired prior to 1990.


The Company uses a December 31 measurement date for all post retirement plans. The following tables provide information regarding the Company’s post retirement benefit plans summarized by U.S. and international components.

Obligations and Funded Status

During 2015, the Company amended its medical plan that amongst other things, provided the participants with HRA funding contributions.  The change resulted in a

$16.1 million

decrease to the accumulated project benefit obligation.

Components of Net Periodic Benefit Cost


Other Changes in Plan Assets and Benefit Obligations Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income during 2015 are as follows:

The weighted average assumptions in the following table represent the rates used to develop the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation for the year listed and also the net periodic benefit cost for the following year. The discount rate is based on settling the pension obligation with high grade, high yield corporate bonds.

As of

December 31, 2015

the following table represents the amounts included in other comprehensive loss that are expected to be recognized as components of periodic benefit costs in


.

The assumed health care cost trend rate for the U.S. plans grades from an initial rate of

6.60%

to an ultimate rate of

4.50%

by


and for international plans from

6.62%

to

4.50%

by


. A

1.0%

increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate will increase the service and interest cost components of the expense recognized for the U.S. and international post-retirement plans by approximately

$189,000

and

$14,000

, respectively, for 2015, and increase the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation by approximately

$46,000

and

$228,000

, respectively. A

1.0%

decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate will decrease the service and interest cost components of the expense recognized for the U.S. and international post-retirement plans by approximately

$158,000

and

$13,000

, respectively, for 2015, and decrease the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation by approximately

$42,000

and

$206,000

, respectively.

Cash Flows

Benefit payments expected to be paid to plan participants are as follows:

Defined Contribution Plans

The Company also participates in certain defined contribution plans and multiemployer pension plans. Costs recognized under these plans are summarized as follows:


The 401(k) savings plan is a participant directed defined contribution plan that holds shares of the Company’s stock as one of the investment options. At

December 31, 2015

and


, the plan held on behalf of its participants about

632,523

shares with a market value of

$45.0 million

, and

670,322

shares with a market value of

$58.2 million

, respectively.

Additionally, the Company has stock option based benefit and other plans further described in Note 13.

The Company contributes to several multi-employer defined benefit pension plans under collective bargaining agreements that cover certain of its union-represented employees. The risks of participating in such plans are different from the risks of single-employer plans. Assets contributed to a multi-employer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers. If a participating employer ceases to contribute to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. If the Company ceases to have an obligation to contribute to the multi-employer plan in which it had been a contributing employer, it may be required to pay to the plan an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan and on the history of the Company’s participation in the plan prior to the cessation of its obligation to contribute. The amount that an employer that has ceased to have an obligation to contribute to a multi-employer plan is required to pay to the plan is referred to as a withdrawal liability.

The Company’s participation in multi-employer plans for the year ended

December 31, 2015

is outlined in the table below. For plans that are not individually significant to the Company, the total amount of contributions is presented in the aggregate.

(1)

The Company’s contribution represents more than

5%

of the total contributions to the plan.

(2)

The Pension Fund’s board adopted a Funding Improvement Plan on October 21, 2015, continuing the existing plan which increased the weekly pension fund contribution rates by

$75

with corresponding decreases to the weekly welfare fund contribution rates until December 31, 2017.

(3)

Critical status triggered a

5%

surcharge on employer contributions effective June 2012.  Effective January 1, 2013, this surcharge increases to

10%

.  The surcharge ended on October 21, 2015 when the rehabilitation plan commenced.

(a)

The “EIN / PN” column provides the Employer Identification Number and the three-digit plan number assigned to a plan by the Internal Revenue Service.

(b)

The most recent Pension Protection Act Zone Status available for 2013 and 2012 is for plan years that ended in 2013 and 2012, respectively. The zone status is based on information provided to the Company and other participating employers by each plan and is certified by the plan’s actuary. A plan in the “red” zone has been determined to be in “critical status”, based on criteria established under the Internal Revenue Code (“Code”), and is generally less than

65%

funded. A plan in the “yellow” zone has been determined to be in “endangered status”, based on criteria established under the Code, and is generally less than

80%

funded. A plan in the “green” zone has been determined to be neither in “critical status” nor in “endangered status”, and is generally at least

80%

funded.

(c)

The “FIP/RP Status Pending/Implemented” column indicates whether a Funding Improvement Plan, as required under the Code to be adopted by plans in the “yellow” zone, or a Rehabilitation Plan, as required under the Code to be adopted by plans in the “red” zone, is pending or has been implemented as of the end of the plan year that ended in


.

(d)

The “Surcharge Imposed” column indicates whether the Company’s contribution rate for


included an amount in addition the contribution rate specified in the applicable collective bargaining agreement, as imposed by a plan in “critical status”, in accordance with the requirements of the Code.

11.

INCOME TAXES

The Company is responsible for filing consolidated U.S., foreign and combined, unitary or separate state income tax returns. The Company is responsible for paying the taxes relating to such returns, including any subsequent adjustments resulting from the redetermination of such tax liabilities by the applicable taxing authorities.


The components of the income from operations before provision for income taxes for the Company’s domestic and foreign operations for the years ended December 31 are provided below:

Undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately

$1,004.0 million

at

December 31, 2015

. Those earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested; accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal and state income taxes has been provided thereon. Upon repatriation of those earnings, in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to both U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability is not practicable due to the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.

The consolidated provision for income taxes included in the Statement of Income consisted of the following:

A reconciliation of the United States federal statutory income tax rate to the effective income tax rate on operations for the years ended December 31 is provided below:

Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences in the recognition of income and expense for financial and income tax reporting purposes. These deferred income taxes will be recognized as future tax benefits or costs when the temporary differences reverse.


Components of deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:

A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  As of

December 31, 2015

, the valuation allowance for certain foreign carryforwards was

$12.6 million

primarily in Brazil and South Africa.

State tax credit carry-forwards of approximately

$1.0 million

expire in various periods from

December 31, 2016

to

December 31, 2030

.  Net operating loss carry-forwards in the amount of

$25.6 million

expire in various periods from

December 31, 2016

to

December 31, 2035

.

As of

December 31, 2015

, the liability for income taxes associated with unrecognized tax benefits was

$10.6 million

, of which

$4.3 million

, if recognized, would favorably affect the Company’s effective income tax rate. As of

December 31, 2014

, the liability for income taxes associated with unrecognized tax benefits was

$12.6 million

, of which

$5.5 million

, if recognized, would favorably affect the Company’s effective tax rate. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of the liability for income taxes associated with unrecognized tax benefits follows:

The Company includes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. As of

December 31, 2015

, the total interest and penalties accrued was approximately

$2.0 million

and

$0.2 million

, respectively. As of

December 31, 2014

, the total interest and penalties accrued was approximately

$1.9 million

and

$1.3 million

, respectively.

With limited exception, the Company is no longer subject to examination by various U.S. and foreign taxing authorities for years before 2012. At this time, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits of approximately

$2.1 million

may change within the next 12 months due to the expiration of statutory review periods and current examinations.


12.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

The computation of earnings per share from operations is as follows:

Options to purchase approximately

13,000

,

17,000

, and

12,000

shares of Common Stock were outstanding in


,


and


, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options’ exercise price exceeded the average market price of the common shares.

13.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

As of

December 31, 2015

, the Company maintains employee stock-based compensation plans for stock options, restricted stock, and incentive stock units as governed by the 2011 Stock Incentive Compensation Plan (the “2011 Plan”) and the 2000 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the “2000 Plan”).  The 2011 Plan has a


year term through March 27, 2021 and as of

December 31, 2015

the number of shares available for future grants under the 2011 Plan was

2,703,673

shares, which includes remaining shares to grant under the 2000 Plan.  The 2011 Plan was approved by stockholders of Wabtec on May 11, 2011. The Company also maintains a 1995 Non-Employee Directors’ Fee and Stock Option Plan (“ the Directors Plan”).  The Directors Plan, as amended, authorizes a total of

1,000,000

shares of Common Stock to be issued. Under the Directors Plan options issued become exercisable over a

three

-year vesting period and expire

ten years

from the date of grant and restricted stock issued under the plan vests

one year

from the date of grant. As compensation for directors’ fees for the years ended

December 31, 2015

,


and


, the Company issued a total of

11,256

,

12,704

and

17,875

shares of restricted stock to non-employee directors. The total number of shares issued under the plan as of

December 31, 2015

was

847,720

shares. No units may be made under the Directors Plan subsequent to

October 31, 2016

.

Stock-based compensation expense for all of the plans was

$26.0 million

,

$26.1 million

and

$24.1 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2015

,


and


, respectively. The Company recognized associated tax benefits related to the stock-based compensation plans of

$15.3 million

,

$7.6 million

and

$7.9 million

for the respective periods. Included in the stock-based compensation expense for 2015 above is

$2.2 million

of expense related to stock options,

$6.2 million

related to non-vested restricted stock,

$2.5 million

related to restricted stock units,

$13.5 million

related to incentive stock units and

$1.1 million

related to units issued for Directors’ fees. At

December 31, 2015

, unamortized compensation expense related to those stock options, non-vested restricted shares and incentive stock units expected to vest totaled

$23.8 million

and will be recognized over a weighted average period of

1.1 years

.


Stock Options

Stock options are granted to eligible employees and directors at the fair market value, which is the average of the high and low Wabtec stock price on the date of grant. Under the 2011 Plan and the 2000 Plan, options become exercisable over a

four years

vesting period and expire

10 years

from the date of grant.

The following table summarizes the Company’s stock option activity and related information for the 2011 Plan, the 2000 Plan and Directors Plan for the years ended December 31:

Options outstanding at

December 31, 2015

were as follows:

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

The dividend yield is based on the Company’s dividend rate and the current market price of the underlying common stock at the date of grant. Expected life in years is determined from historical stock option exercise data. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the

7 years

U.S. Treasury bond rates for the expected life of the option.

Restricted Stock and Incentive Stock

Beginning in 2006 the Company adopted a restricted stock program. As provided for under the 2011 and 2000 Plans, eligible employees are granted restricted stock that generally vests over

four years

from the date of grant. Under the Directors Plan, restricted stock units vest

one year

from the date of grant.


In addition, the Company has issued incentive stock units to eligible employees that vest upon attainment of certain cumulative

three

-year performance goals. Based on the Company’s performance for each

three

year period then ended, the incentive stock units can vest and be awarded ranging from

0%

to

200%

of the initial incentive stock units granted. The incentive stock units included in the table below represent the number of shares that are expected to vest based on the Company’s estimate for meeting those established performance targets. As of

December 31, 2015

, the Company estimates that it will achieve

123%

,

134%

and

101%

for the incentive stock units expected to vest based on performance for the three year periods ending

December 31, 2015

,


, and


, respectively, and has recorded incentive compensation expense accordingly. If our estimate of the number of these stock units expected to vest changes in a future accounting period, cumulative compensation expense could increase or decrease and will be recognized in the current period for the elapsed portion of the vesting period and would change future expense for the remaining vesting period.

Compensation expense for the non-vested restricted stock and incentive stock units is based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant and recognized over the applicable vesting period.

The following table summarizes the restricted stock activity and related information for the 2011 Plan, the 2000 Plan, and Directors Plan, and incentive stock units activity and related information for the 2011 Plan and the 2000 Plan with related information for the years ended December 31:

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT AND FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

ASC 820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and explains the related disclosure requirements. ASC 820 indicates, among other things, that a fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability and defines fair value based upon an exit price model.

Valuation Hierarchy.

ASC 820 establishes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to valuation used to measure fair value. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on the Company’s assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. A financial asset or liability’s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

The following table provides the liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of

December 31, 2015

, which are included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance sheet:

The following table provides the liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of

December 31, 2014

, which are included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance sheet:

To reduce the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of its variable-rate debt, the Company entered into interest rate swaps which effectively converted a portion of the debt from variable to fixed-rate borrowings during the term of the swap


contracts. For certain derivative contracts whose fair values are based upon trades in liquid markets, such as interest rate swaps, valuation model inputs can generally be verified and valuation techniques do not involve significant management judgment. The fair values of such financial instruments are generally classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

As a result of our global operating activities the Company is exposed to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial position. When deemed appropriate, the Company minimizes these risks through entering into foreign currency forward contracts. The foreign currency forward contracts are valued using broker quotations, or market transactions in either the listed or over-the counter markets. As such, these derivative instruments are classified within level 2.

The Company’s cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less and are considered Level 1 on the fair value valuation hierarchy. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximated the carrying value at

December 31, 2015

and

December 31, 2014

. The Company’s defined benefit pension plan assets consist primarily of equity security funds, debt security funds and temporary cash and cash equivalent investments. Generally, all plan assets are considered Level 2 based on the fair value valuation hierarchy. These investments are comprised of a number of investment funds that invest in a diverse portfolio of assets including equity securities, corporate and governmental bonds, and money markets.  Trusts are valued at the net asset value (“NAV”) as determined by their custodian.  NAV represent the accumulation of the unadjusted quoted close prices on the reporting date for the underlying investments divided by the total shares outstanding at the reporting dates.  The 2013 Notes are considered Level 2 based on the fair value valuation hierarchy.

The estimated fair values and related carrying values of the Company’s financial instruments are as follows:

The fair value of the Company’s interest rate swap agreements and the 2013 Notes were based on dealer quotes and represent the estimated amount the Company would pay to the counterparty to terminate the agreement.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company is subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances. The Company believes its operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business; however, there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements.

Under terms of the purchase agreement and related documents for the 1990 Acquisition, American Standard, Inc., now known as Trane (“Trane”), has indemnified the Company for certain items including, among other things, certain environmental claims the Company asserted prior to 2000. If Trane was unable to honor or meet these indemnifications, the Company would be responsible for such items. In the opinion of Management, Trane currently has the ability to meet its indemnification obligations.

Claims have been filed against the Company and certain of its affiliates in various jurisdictions across the United States by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing products. Most of these claims have been made against our wholly owned subsidiary, Railroad Friction Products Corporation (“RFPC”), and are based on a product sold by RFPC prior to the time that the Company acquired any interest in RFPC.

Most of these claims, including all of the RFPC claims, are submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity or to non-affiliated companies that retain the liabilities for the asbestos-containing products at issue. We cannot, however, assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors or insurers will remain financially viable. Our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims, as is the case with other pending litigation, cannot be estimated.

It is Management’s belief that the potential range of loss for asbestos-related bodily injury cases is not reasonably determinable at present due to a variety of factors, including: (1) the asbestos case settlement history of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, RFPC; (2) the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation in general; and (3) the uncertainty of


asbestos litigation in particular. Despite this uncertainty, and although the results of the Company’s operations and cash flows for any given period could be adversely affected by asbestos-related lawsuits, Management believes that the final resolution of the Company’s asbestos-related cases will not be material to the Company’s overall financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In general, this belief is based upon: (1) Wabtec’s and RFPC’s history of settlements and dismissals of asbestos-related cases to date; (2) the inability of many plaintiffs to establish any exposure or causal relationship to RFPC’s product; and (3) the inability of many plaintiffs to demonstrate any identifiable injury or compensable loss.

More specifically, as to RFPC, Management’s belief that any losses due to asbestos-related cases would not be material is also based on the fact that RFPC owns insurance which provides coverage for asbestos-related bodily injury claims. To date, RFPC’s insurers have provided RFPC with defense and indemnity in these actions. The overall number of new claims being filed against RFPC has dropped significantly in recent years; however, these new claims, and all previously filed claims, may take a significant period of time to resolve. As to Wabtec and its divisions, Management’s belief that asbestos-related cases will not have a material impact is also based on its position that it has

no

legal liability for asbestos-related bodily injury claims, and that the former owners of Wabtec’s assets retained asbestos liabilities for the products at issue. To date, Wabtec has been able to successfully defend itself on this basis, including

two

arbitration decisions and a judicial opinion, all of which confirmed Wabtec’s position that it did not assume any asbestos liabilities from the former owners of certain Wabtec assets. Although Wabtec has incurred defense and administrative costs in connection with asbestos bodily injury actions, these costs have not been material, and the Company has

no

information that would suggest these costs would become material in the foreseeable future.

From time to time the Company is involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations in the ordinary course of business. As of the date hereof, the Company is involved in

no

litigation that the Company believes will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

20.

SEGMENT INFORMATION

Wabtec has

two

reportable segments—the Freight Segment and the Transit Segment. The key factors used to identify these reportable segments are the organization and alignment of the Company’s internal operations, the nature of the products and services, and customer type. The business segments are:

Freight Segment

primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing freight cars and locomotives, builds new switcher locomotives, rebuilds freight locomotives, supplies railway electronics, positive train control equipment, signal design and engineering services, and provides related heat exchange and cooling systems. Customers include large, publicly traded railroads, leasing companies, manufacturers of original equipment such as locomotives and freight cars, and utilities.

Transit Segment

primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing passenger transit vehicles, typically subway cars and buses, builds new commuter locomotives and refurbishes subway cars. Customers include public transit authorities and municipalities, leasing companies, and manufacturers of subway cars and buses around the world.

The Company evaluates its business segments’ operating results based on income from operations. Corporate activities include general corporate expenses, elimination of intersegment transactions, interest income and expense and other unallocated charges. Since certain administrative and other operating expenses and other items have not been allocated to business segments, the results in the following tables are not necessarily a measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and may not be comparable to other companies.
